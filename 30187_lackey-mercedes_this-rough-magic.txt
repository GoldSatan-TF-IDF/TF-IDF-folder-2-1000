this rough magic mercedes lackey eric flint and dave freer rome eneko lopez was not the sort of man to let mere discomfort of the body come between him and his god or between him and the work he believed god intended him to do the basque ignored exhaustion and hunger he existed on inner fires anyway and the fires of his spirit burned hot and bright some of that showed in the eagle eyes looking intently at the chalice on the altar the lowburned candles and the fact that several of the other priests had fainted from exhaustion cold or hunger bore mute testimony to the fact that the ceremony had gone on for many hours without looking away from the chalice upon which their energies were focused eneko could pick up the voices of his companions still joined in prayer there was diegos baritone father pierres deeper bass franciss gravelly frankish the voices of a brotherhood united in faith against the darkness at last the wine in the chalice stirred the surface became misty and an image began to form craggyedged foamfringed a mountain the air in the chapel became scented with myrtle and lemonblossom then came a sound the wistful ethereal notes of panpipes there was something inhuman about that playing although eneko could not precisely put his finger on it it was a melancholy tune poignant old music of rocks and streams music that seemed as old as the mountains themselves there was a thump yet another priest in the invocation circle had fallen and the circle was broken again so was the vision eneko sighed and began to lead the others in the dismissal of the wards my knees are numb said father francis rubbing them the floors in roman chapels are somehow harder than the ones in aquitaine ever were or venetian floors said pierre shaking his head only your knees numb i think i am without blood or warmth from the chest down we came close eneko said glumly i still have no idea where the vision is pointing to though father pierre rubbed his cold hands you are certain this is where chernobog is turning his attentions next certain as can be under the circumstances chernobogor some other demonic creature great magical forces leave such traces but where is it asked diego rubbing his back wearily somewhere in the mediterranean an island that much is clear probably in the vicinity of greece or the balkans but which there are a multitude eneko shrugged i dont know but it is an old place full of crude and elemental powers a repository of great strength and and what and it does not love us eneko said with a kind of grim certainty it did not feel evil commented francis i would have thought an ally of chernobog must be corrupted and polluted by the blackness francis the enemy of my enemy is not always my friend even if we have common cause we should ally eneko said francis firmly or at least not waste our strength against each other after all we face a common enemy eneko shrugged again perhaps but it is not always that simple or that wise well let us talk to the grand metropolitan and tell him what little we know vilna count kazimierz mindaug chief adviser and counselor to grand duke jagiellon of lithuania scratched himself lice were one of the smaller hazards and discomforts of his position to be honest he scarcely noticed them the grand duke tended to make other problems pale into insignificance if a direct attack on venice is out of the question now given our recent defeat there he said calmly then why dont we just hamstring them we can paralyze their trade the mediterranean can still be ours we can still draw the enemy into a war on a second front the terrible scar on jagiellons forehead pulsed it looked like an ugly purple worm halfembedded in his skin a throbbing worm the holy roman emperor looks for our hand in everything now since the disaster in venice charles fredrik would ally openly with the accursed venetians their combined fleets would crush our own even in the black sea count mindaug nodded his head true but what if our hand was not shown what if those who at least appear to oppose us took action against venice and her interests the grand dukes inhuman eyes glowed for just a moment as the idea caught his interest then he shook his head the emperor will still see our hand in anything count mindaug smiled revealing filed teeth of course he will but he cannot act against his allies he cannot be seen to be partisan not in a matter that appears to be a mere squabble between venice and her commercial rivals especially when those rivals are parties with whom the empire has either a treaty or a very uneasy relationship jagiellon raised his heavy brows ah aquitaine he said i have hopes of the norse my plans move apace there but it will take a little while before their fleets ravage the north but aquitaine even with genoas assistance cannot bottle up the venetian fleet mindaug flashed those filed teeth again but they could blockade the pillars of hercules and if the aragonese join them and perhaps the barbary pirates too they will easily prevent the venetian atlantic fleet from returning and let us not forget that you now hold byzantiums emperor in thrall jagiellon shook his head it is not thralldom yet let us just say we know of certain vices which even the greeks will not tolerate we wield a certain amount of influence yes enough to send him to attempt to regain some of his lost territory asked mindaug shrewdly after a moment jagiellon nodded probably the golden horn or negroponte mindaug smiled sharklike neither my lord well not directly if byzantium reduces the ability of the venetian fleet to extract vengeance on constantinople and on their shipping then the golden horn negroponte and even zante are theirs for the taking even the jewel crete but while the venetians have the freedom of the mediterranean alexius dares not seize venetian property and one island is the key to the adriatic to bottling the venetians into a little corner corfu the byzantines attack and capture corfu in alliance with emeric of hungary corfu is the key to the adriatic with it captured venices traders die the scar on jagiellons head pulsed again corfu he mused speaking the syllables slowly but emeric is not a thrall of mine not yet he seeks to challenge me i will devour him in time jagiellons metal eyes looked pointedly at the count and anyone else who tries to become my rival rather than my ally cold sweat beaded under count mindaugs heavy robes of course he had ambitions to be part of this court you had to have them it was a dogeatdog environment but he knew just how well grand duke jagiellon defended his position he knewor at least he thought he knewjust what jagiellon had ventured into and what had happened to him kazimierz mindaug was no mean sorcerer himself you had to be to survive in the quest for power in lithuania he had experimented with dangerous ritesvery dangerousbut there were some things he had held back from jagiellon he guessed had not a demon now lurked behind those metallic allblack eyes the arrogant prince who had thought to summon and use chernobog was now the demons slave the prey had swallowed the predator the count cleared his throat trying to ease the nervousness our spies have reported that emeric has been on secret expeditions down in the southern balkans beginning in the spring it is a certainty that he must be looking at expansion there a judicious hint or two to the byzantines and he would not even smell our hand corfu would offer him a safe staging post for attacks on the hinterland the count smiled nastily after all the balkans can distract charles fredrik as well as that mess of principalities called italy he would be obliged to stop emeric of hungary and if the hungarians clash with the holy roman empire over corfu both of our enemies may be weakened while we remain strong jagiellon smiled it was not a pleasant sight there were several rotten stumps in among the huge lithuanians teeth and valdosta may be sent there the younger one if not the elder i do not allow a quest for vengeance to impede my plans only a fool concentrates on a personal vendetta when larger affairs are unresolved but this time i could perhaps combine both good i will send my new errandboy to constantinople he clapped his meaty hands a frightenedlooking slave appeared almost instantly have the new man sent to me see that horses are made ready captain tcherklas must also be called he is to accompany my servant to odessa the servant will need five hundred ducats and will require suitable clothes for the imperial court in constantinople the slave bowed and left at a run he could not answer he had no tongue any more jagiellon allowed his servants to retain only those portions of themselves as were useful corfu it was a powerful place of an old faith once said jagiellon speculatively the count said nothing that was wisdom his own plotting was subtle and the less he even thought about it the demon chernobog could pick up thoughts and if he was correct then what the black brain knew jagiellon knew also and vice versa of course there was a chance that events might favor his progress and his ambitions but if they did not he needed to keep his hands clean relatively still those days are long gone now jagiellon nodded to the count we will take these steps we will find old shrines the stones will have some power we will rededicate them to our ends the slave returned escorting a blond and once handsome man now caesare aldanto was gaunt his fine golden hair hung limp about his face matted with filth and vomit he had plainly by the smell soiled himself not just once but often and by those empty eyes this matter was of no concern to him jagiellon did not seem to notice the smell as he gave detailed precise instructions caesare was to take himself to constantinople letters of introduction and certain tokens of the emperors latest pastime were to be presented to the emperor alexius vi the tokens fetched by the tongueless servant were of such a nature as to make even mindaug blanch for a moment caesare did not even look discomfited when he was told to participate if the emperor so desired he didnt even blink and youd better have him cleaned up said count mindaug when jagiellon had finished hell be noticed else and i doubt hed get as far as the greek emperors flunkies in the condition hes in now much less the emperor himself he stinks the solid black eyes that now filled jagiellons sockets stared at the count he does jagiellon turned to caesare you will see to that also then caesare nodded like his walk his nod had a slightly jerky controlledpuppet air about it but just for a moment a madness showed in those blank eyes a desperate sad madness then that too was gone jagiellon waved dismissively go see that emperor alexius engages in talks on military action with emeric corfu must fall he turned to the tongueless slave has my new shaman arrived the slave shook his head fearfully he was very efficient welleducated once he had been a prince very well jagiellon rumbled only a little displeased bring him to me when he appears and see to this one make him fit for an emperors company count mindaug scratched again as the servant nodded and hurried out lice were a small price to pay for power rome ive gotten word from the grand metropolitan the emperor began abruptly the moment baron trolliger sat down in charles fredriks small audience chamber the chamber was even smaller than the one the holy roman emperor preferred in his palace in mainz here in rome which he was visiting incognito the emperor had rented a minor and secluded mansion for the duration of his stay the servant had ushered trolliger to a comfortable divan positioned at an angle to the emperors own chair a goblet of wine had been poured for the baron and was resting on a small table next to him the emperor had a goblet in hand already but trolliger saw that it was as yet untouched something is stirring in the greek isles or the balkans charles fredrik continued something dark and foul so at least hes being told by eneko lopez by itself the metropolitan might think that was simply lopezs wellknown zeal at workbut his own scryers seem to agree jagiellon the emperors heavy shoulders moved in a shrug impossible to tell jagiellon is a likelihood of course any time something dark and foul begins to move the grand duke of lithuania is probably involved but hell be licking his wounds still id think after the hammering he took in venice recentlyand theres always the king of hungary to consider baron trolliger took a sip of his wine then rubbed his lips with the back of his hand when the hand moved away a slight sneer remained young emeric hes a puppy a vile and vicious one to be sure but a puppy nonetheless the kind of arrogant toosmartforhisowngood king wholl always make overly complex plans that come apart at the seams and then his subordinates will be blamed for it which allows the twit to come up with a new grandiose scheme get blamedand pay the price agreed charles fredrik still i think youre dismissing emeric too lightly dont forget that hes got his aunt lurking in the shadows trolligers sneer shifted into a dark scowl aunt i think shes his greatgreataunt actually if shes that young there is something purely unnatural about that womans lifespanand her youthful beauty if all reports are to be believed thats my point elizabeth countess bartholdy traffics with very dark powers perhaps even the darkest do not underestimate her hans trolliger inclined his head true enough still your majesty i dont see what we can do at the moment not with such vague information to go on neither do i i simply wanted to alert you because his voice trailed off and trolliger winced venice again he muttered id hoped to return with you to mainz charles fredrik smiled sympathetically the italians arent that bad hans a bit hastilybefore the baron could respond with the inevitable yes they arethe emperor added the wines excellent and so is the climate as long as you stay out of the malarial areas and i think youd do better to set up in ferrara anyway that mollified trolliger a bit ferrara ah well yes enrico delleste is almost as levelheaded as a german so long as he leaves aside any insane italian vendettas the emperor shrugged how many vendettas could he still be nursing now that hes handed sforza the worst defeat in his career and has his two grandsons back true enough and i agree that ferrara would make a better place from which i could observe whatever developments take place venice that city is a conspirators madhouse at least the duke of ferrara will see to it that my identity remains a secret trolliger made a last attempt to evade the prospect of miserable months spent in italy still perhaps manfred but the emperor was already shaking his head smiling at the barons effort not a chance hans you know i need to send manfred and erik off to deal with this swedish mess besides what i need here in italy for the moment is an observer the baron grimaced he could hardly argue the point after all the notion that rambunctious young prince manfredeven restrained by his keeper erik hakkonsenwould ever simply act as an observer was ludicrous i hate italy he muttered id hate it even if it wasnt inhabited by italians kingdom of hungary near the carpathian mountains elizabeth countess bartholdy laughed musically she looked like a woman who would have a musical laugh in fact she looked like a woman who never did or had anything without grace charm and beauty yet somehow underneath all that beauty there was something else something old something hungry something that occasionally looked out of her eyes and when it did whoever was facing its regard generally was not seen again my dear crocell jagiellon or to give it its true name chernobog is an expansionist and compared to the power into whose territory i will inveigle him a young upstart she smiled wisely a little slyly corfu is one of the old magic places very old very wise veryother the man standing next to her took his eyes away from the thing in the glass jar a risky game youre playing elizabeth chernobog is mighty and the powers on corfu are as you say very old his middleaged face creased into a slight smile very old often means wearyeven for such as me those ancient powers may not be enough to snare him the demons power is nothing to sneer at and then what she dimpled exactly like a maiden who had just been given a lapdog puppy corfu is a terrible place for any foreigner to try to practice magic crocells gaze came back to the thing moving restlessly in the jar hence this yes i can see the logic it must have been quite a struggle to get two disparate elementals to breed indeed it was she grimaced at the memory as well as the thing in the jar nor is their offspring here any great pleasure to have around but when the time comes it will serve the purpose crocell gave a nod with just enough bow in it to satisfactorily acknowledge her skill you will use your nephew as the tool i assume emeric is made for the purpose my greatgreatnephew is such a smart boyand such a careless one crocell shook his head smiling again and began walking with a stifflegged gait toward the entry to the bathhouse i leave you to your machinations elizabeth if nothing else its always a pleasure for us to watch you at work countess bartholdy followed are any of you betting in my favor yet crocells laugh was low and harsh of course not though i will say the odds are improving still he paused at the entryway and looked back examining her no one has ever succeeded in cheating him out of a soul elizabeth not once in millennia though many have tried her dimples appeared again i will do it watch and see crocell shrugged no you will not but it hardly matters to me after all and now countess if i may be of service he stepped aside and allowed the countess to precede him into the bathhouse yes crocelland i do thank you again for offering your assistance im having a bit of trouble extracting all of the blood the veins and arteries empty well enough but i think her face tight with concentration elizabeth studied the corpse of the virgin suspended over the bath the bath was now halffull with red liquid a few drops of blood were still dripping off the chin oozing there from the great gash in the young girls throat i think theres still quite a bit more resting in the internal organs the liver especially hearing a sharp sound she swiveled her head do be a bit careful would you those tiles are expensive sorry murmured crocell staring down at the flooring hed cracked his flesh was denser and heavier than iron and he always walked clumsily wearing boots that might look on close inspection to be just a bit odd in shape they weremore so on the inside than the outside the feet in those boots were not human crocell was helpful as he always was dealing with such matters he was the greatest apothecary and alchemist among the servants and always enjoyed the intellectual challenge of practicing his craft he left then laughing when elizabeth offered to share the bath his expression did not match the laugh however nor the words that followed i have no need for it countess as you well know i am already immortal the last words were said a bit sadly long ago crocell had paid the price elizabeth bartholdy hoped to avoid after her bath the countess retired to her study with a bowl of the bloodwaste not want not she always said there was still another use for it after all a use that the bath would actually facilitate the blood was now as much elizabeths as the former owners thanks to the magical law of contagion she poured it into a flat shallow basin of black glass and carefully added the dark liquid from two vials she removed from a rank of others on the shelves then she held her hands palms down outstretched over the surface of the basin what she whispered would be familiar to any other magician so long as he or she was not from some tradition outside of the western empire all except for the last name which would have sent some screaming for her head rather insular of them she thought a mist spread over the surface of the dark liquid it rose from nothing but swiftly sank into the surface of the blood the liquid began to glow from within with a sullen red light and there after a moment came the image of her conspirator count mindaugs face was creased with worry this is dangerous elizabeth the countess laughed at him dont be silly jagiellon is practically a deafmute in such matters he acknowledges no power but his own except as something to devour he wont overhear us besides ill be brief i received a letter from my nephew yesterday hes clearly decided to launch his project mindaug shook his head the idiot well yes elizabeths laugh as always was silvery what else is family good for mindaug grunted he was hardly the one to argue the point since his own fortune had come largely from his two brothers and three sisters none of whom had lived more than two months after coming into their inheritance hes still an idiot id no more venture onto corfu than i would well politely he refrained from naming the place where the hungarian countess would most likely be making her permanent domicile sooner or later elizabeth appreciated the delicacy although she would dispute the conclusion however its good for us ill keep steering jagiellon as best i can splendid all we have to do for the moment then is allow others to stumble forward politely she refrained from commenting on the way mindaug was scratching himself the albanian coast it was a bitter morning the wind whipped small flurries of snow around the hooves of the magnificent black horse the rider seemed unaware of the chill his entire attention focused instead on the distant prospect from up here he could see the dark ionian gulf and the narrow strip of water that separated the green island from the bleak balkan mountains over here winter was arriving over there it would still be a good few more weeks before the first signs of it began to show the riders eyes narrowed as he studied the crescent of island taking in every detail from mount pantocrator to corfu bay the shepherdguide looked warily up at the rider the rider was paying a lot of money for the shepherds services the shepherd was still wondering if he was going to live to collect abruptly the tall rider turned on his guide when your tribes raid across there which way do they follow the shepherd held up his hands lord we are only poor shepherds peaceful people dont lie to me said the rider the shepherd looked uneasily across at the sleeping island memories unpleasant memories of certain reprisals came back to him of a woman hed once thought to possess it is true lord it is not wise to attack the corfiotes there are many witches and their men fight the venetians too come and burn our villages fight the tall rider snorted if things develop as i expect they will in venice theyll have to learn to fight or be crushed well i have seen what i have come to see and now you will take me to iskander beg the shepherd shied his swarthy face paling i do not know who you are talking about lord i have warned you once do not lie to me i warn you again i will not warn you a third time it was said with a grim certainty take me to iskander beg the shepherd looked down at the stony earth at the dry grass where he knew his body might rest in a few moments no king emeric you can only kill me iskander beg he left the sentence hanging i will not take you to the lord of the mountains he knows you are here if he wants to see you he will see you the king of hungary showed no surprise that the shepherd had known who he was secretly escorting after all the thinbrowed brokennosed face was well knownand feared yes he was a murderous killer that in itself was nothing unusual in these mountains but emeric was also rumored to be a manwitch that was why this guide had agreed to lead him emeric was sure not simply the money emeric would leave these mountains alive the king of hungary turned his horse he can choose he will see me soon enough anyway he can see me now or see me later on my terms the shepherd shrugged i can show you the way back now corfu across on the green island in a rugged glen the stream cascaded laughingly amid the mossy rocks in front of the grottos opening the piper played a melody on the simple shepherds pipe it was a tune as old as the mountain and only just a little younger than the sea poignant and bittersweet it echoed among the rocks and around the tiny glade between the trees the sweet young grass was bruised by the dancing of many feet and among the tufts were sharpcut little hoofmarks alongside the barefoot human prints far below a shepherd whistled for his dogs the piper did not pause in her playing to draw the hood of her cloak over the small horns set among the dark ringlets this was a holy place holy ancient and enchanted neither the shepherd nor his dogs would come up here here the old religion and old powers still held sway the power here was like the olive roots in the mountain groves just because they were gnarled and ancient did not mean they were weak or friendly part i autumn ad chapter benito valdosta latterly a gentleman of the case vecchie of venice walked along a narrow alleyway in the most dubious part of cannaregio quite a long time after midnight benito sauntered in the shadows just hoping someone would make his day women women as every man on earth knew were the source of all the damned trouble in the world and then some extra he thought bitterly no one obliged him even in the clothes of the case vecchie walking where no sane case vecchie gentleman would go the watchershe could feel them if not see themknew who he was these days he had a reputation totally out of keeping with his age or size well he would find a tavern not barduccis too many memories there and then in the shape of two sailors some relief came in sight they were in their clumsy fashion trying to box him in he let them the one with the cudgel tossed it from hand to hand a mistake benito knew it meant as caesare had taught him in what seemed a different world that for a few instants you were not actually holding the weapon the cudgelwielder obviously hadnt been taught this he was amazingly stupid part of benitos mind thought when he spoke to his companion with the knife he actually looked away from the victim well spiro venice takes away and she gives back to us with interest he laughed coarsely benito judged that the one with the knife was the more dangerous of the two if the smaller he showed signs of a recent beatingup sporting a black eye and torn cloak yeah i suppose so give us your money rich kid hand it over and you wont get hurt amateurs thought benito wryly came in on the last tide got drunk maybe got rolled maybe just ran out of money and got thrown out of some tavern still at least halfdrunk benito cringed stepping back to make sure neither could get behind him please sirs youre not going hurt me just give us your money repeated the knifeman and get out of here this is no part of town forwhat do they call noblemen around hereyeah a case vecchie i think i might just take that lucco too said the cudgel wielder he was big man an oarsman by the looks of his muscles if if i give you all my money and my lucco too will you let me go whined benito letting a quaver into his voice still cringing yeah said the knifeman relaxing dropping the point slightly cudgel smiled viciously well i think you need a few bruises to take home to mummy and maybe a cut on that pretty face as he said this cudgelman had stepped in closer still tossing the cudgel handtohand and now getting in the knifewielders way from behind the cudgelwielder benito heard the knifeman say brusco hes only a kid take his money and leave him alone brusco wasnt listening cringing means your limbs are bent youre into a fighters crouch with a moments change of attitude benito didnt bother to aim he just hit the arm of the hand that was about to catch the cudgel grabbing cloth as the cudgel went flying harmlessly benito pushed the sailor over his outstretched foot as the formercudgelwielder fell benito stepped forward planting a boot firmly in the thugs solar plexus his rapier was suddenly in his right hand and the main gauche in his left finest ferrara steel gleamed in the gray dawnlight fierce exultation leapt inside him as he moved in for the kill already the moves long practiced were in mind engage thrust he had the reach turn and kill the other one before he could get to his feet and then as he saw the look of terror on the sailors face the battlejoy went away her words came back to him i wont marry a wolf he settled for hitting the knife hard just at the base of the blade with the rapier it did precisely what cheap knives will do given that to save metal the tang into the hilt is usually much thinner than the blade it snapped the sailor looked briefly at the hilt in his hand and prepared himself to die i didnt plan to hurt you he said hoarsely his eyes now fixed on the two unwavering blades facing him benito flicked a glance at the other man who was up on one elbow feeling for his cudgel safety prudence and caesare said kill them both fast dead men are no threat desperate men are her words came back to him again are you the son of the wolf or the fox i know you werent said benito thats why youre still alive but if your friend moves a muscle thats going to change the sailor looked at his companion then youd better kill me milord he sighed that brusco has no brains at all he got us into this mess in the first place benito stepped over to where the brainless brusco was busy proving his lack of intelligence by trying to get to his feet a slash of the rapier severed the mans belt by the piggy squeal benitos judgement must have been a touch off stay down brusco said the other sailor urgently the casevecchiell kill you milord hes still halfdrunk we our ship left us winters coming and berths are few now we thought some eating money benito snorted in exasperation feeling as if he were fifty instead of seventeen come on both of you up on your feet you use both hands to keep those trousers up brusco now in front of me quick march youre no more than a pair of damned virgins in a brothel in this part of town youre not cut out for a life of crime either of you youre not local or youd never have been so stupid where are you from liapadhes kerkira corfu the former knifeman said he jerked a thumb at his companion who was staggering along holding up his trousers bruscos from bari down south benito prodded the former cudgelwielder with his rapier they must breed them big and dumb down there im bleeding said brusco sulkily theyd arrived at the canalside by this time benito flicked the complaining bruscos shoulder with his rapier so the man turned around so did his companion bleeding ha youre lucky brusco that i didnt cut your damnfool balls off before you sired any dumb kids now listen to me sailor from bari you get yourself out of venice and dont come back if you do youll be lucky if the canalers cut your throat before i find you swim or sell your shirt but get onto the mainland and dont come back go they both turned benito put out his rapier and halted the smaller man the one with the black eye who had once bought a cheap knife stay the man looked wary glancing at the canal benito shook his head dont be as much of a fool as the idiot from bari if id wanted to kill you id have done it back there anyway a couple of mouthfuls of that water is more likely to kill you than any swordstroke here benito reached into his pouch took out some silver pennies and handed them to the wouldbe thief get yourself some breakfast go that way along the fondamenta and youre in a better part of town and then get yourself along to the dorma shipyards tell alberto on the gate that benito sent you tell him youre looking for a berth and that i said youd do the corfiote seaman looked at the money in his palm then he shook his head unbelieving why are you doing this he asked quietly i thought youd hand us over to the nightwatch i was looking for a chance to run i needed a fight said benito shrugging and i needed to sort out some things in my head you obliged i owe you now ive got to find a gondola youve straightened out my mind a bit and theres a girl ive got say goodbye to i was going to go drinking if i couldnt find a fight the sailor shook his head again and then smiled if its all the same to you milord next time youre in need of a fight im not going to be around i thought i was going to be killed back there one minute you were a scared kid thenyou were somebody else when i looked in your eyes for a minute i thought i was dead benito took a deep breath you very nearly were he said quietly the sailor nodded a risk a thief takes its not something ive tried before or im in a hurry to try again and your girl should be very sorry youre leaving any chance id be shipping out with you milord to his surprise benito realized the man wanted him to be on the vessel that was admiration in his voice im not shipping out he waved at a dark sleek gondola out on the grand canal she is and as far as i can see shes not a bit sorry he added bitterly the gondolier had responded to his wave and the vessel was just about at the canalside benito vaulted down into it with athletic ease bacino san marco he said taking his seat morning valdosta or are you too important to greet us these days benito looked up oh hell sorry theobaldo my mind was somewhere else the gondolier shrugged its too late boy shes married and hes a fine man besides she is one of us and youre one of them it would never have worked benito was not in the least surprised that the canaler knew all about his private life hed lived next to these canals himself for far too long not to know that the real lifeblood of venice was not the water in her canals or the trade of her farflung colonies but gossip when you and your brother are real romantic heroes nobles hidden in slums who come into their own while saving the city in its hour of need when your patron is the new doge well suddenly everyone knows you to be fair on the canals most of them had known his brother marco anyway marco was pretty well regarded as the local saint for his work in healing the poor and sick of the canals he benito had a fairly welldeserved reputation for being a thief and trouble and a pack follower of the assassin caesare aldanto until almost the last hed redeemed himself in the fighting to be sure fighting was one of the few things he was good at thanks in part to the treacherous caesare and thanks in part to his fathers bloodneither of which most people regarded as good things benito sighed his skills fighting carousing and climbing buildings none of the three seemed to fit him for the aristocratic mold petro dorma wanted to cram him into his halfbrother marco on the other hand was a gentleman born fitting into the case vecchie mold was easy enough for him so long as he could go on with his beloved medical studies and seeing katerina montescue besides ever since benitos brother and the lion of venice had shared a body marco was different he was still the brother benito knew and loved but hed always been the thinker benito was a doer not a thinker marco was no longer unsure of himself and now it was benitos turn to be it was something benito had never been before i know theobaldo i messed up good huh but i grew up as a bridgebrat im still learning this case vecchie stuff and to tell the truth i dont like it much the gondolier sculled easily moving the boat along the limpid water of the canal under the rialto bridge a few bankers clerks were already setting up their masters stalls we always reckoned you were born to be hanged he said that brother of yours is too good for this world but you anyway youre not going to make trouble for maria and umberto are you because if you are im going to pitch you into the canal here you and that fancy sword of yours benito knew he was good with that fancy sword so long as he was on dry land he also knew what maria had taught him never mess with a boatman in his own boat the gondolier had spent forty years staying on his feet in this vessel benito was a landsman even if hed grown up canalside besides benito had no intention of causing trouble umberto was a fine man even if he was twentyfive years older than maria and never mind the gondolierimaria would pitch him into the water herself if he tried anything she was certainly strong enough and quite capable of doing it im just going to say goodbye he said quietly and good luck she deserves some he withdrew into a brown study thinking back to that time of poverty hed spent living with maria and caesare when both of them in their different waysmaria as caesares lover and he as caesares young protegehad thought caesare aldanto was some kind of demigod on earth until in one night and day aldantos evil nature had surfaced and benito and maria had wound up becoming lovers themselves a night which was still for all the horror of it benitos most precious memory benito realized now with crystal clarity looking back how hed been shaped by those times his blood if you were shaped by blood was terrifying enough his mother was an undutiful daughter of duke enrico delleste the old fox they called him lord of ferrara modena este regio nell emilia and since milan and veronas defeat a month back of several more po valley towns delleste was supposed to be the leading strategist of the age a man feared and respected a nobleman but benitos father was worse carlo sforza the wolf of the north a man feared the most powerful and deadly soldieroffortune of the day italys most notorious condottiere undefeated until the debacle at the palatine forts on the po during the battle for venice last month when the old fox had bloodied the wolf bloodied the wolf but not killed him benito still had his fathers broken sword in the cupboard at the casa dorma they all expected him to be like one or the other of these men and maybe in time he might be but he knew very little of either of them or of their very different worlds hed learned how to live and how to behave mostly from two women streetthieves until he and marco had tied up with caesare like it or not benito had to admit hed modeled himself on caesare aldanto the man had been something of a hero to both of them caesare and maria had been the center of their world for some very crucial years maria if there was ever going to be a reason why benito didnt turn out as much of a pizza da merde as caesare had turned out to be she would probably be it deep inside him it ached her values were hard clear loyal and true and shed turned him down to marry a caulker here he was protege of the man who was the new doge hurting because some canalwoman had spurned his offer of marriage deep down he was also worried that she was dead right to have done so hed nearly killed those two stupid sailors just because he was in a foul mood and looking for excitement to distract him caesare would have done the same but would not have stopped short so according to rumor would carlo sforza as for the old foxwell stories painted him as a good friend and a bad enemy but a cautious and wily man a cautious and wily man might well have done as benito had or perhaps not but the old fox mariaor a younger less arrogant benitowould never have gotten into that position in the first place he sighed maybe part of it was that he was so short one of the other things he owed to growing up a thief living under bridges and in secret in other peoples attics with no money but lots of enthusiasm more enthusiasm and conviction that things would come right than food sometimes food had been hard to come by for a few years he was growing broader now but hed never be as tall as his brother marco had done his basic growing before hard times hit the two of them besides the delleste were not tall the tall willowy shape was that of the valdosta family you going to sit there all day asked the gondolier interrupting his musing or are you going to get out startled benito stood up and reached for the mooringpole you can pay me valdosta said theodoro dryly flushing benito did generously after all money was the one thing he had plenty of now benito was not surprised to find katerina montescue on the quayside and if kat was going to be there his brother was almost inevitably going to be too marco and kat eyed him with considerable wariness as he came up you shouldnt be here hissed kat benito held up his hands pacifically im not going to cause any trouble you should have caused trouble said kat crossly before she did this its too late now benito nodded and swallowed to clear the lump in his throat i know now all i can do is not make trouble so im just going to say goodbye to an old friend the spittingtabby glow in kats eyes died she patted his arm awkwardly maybe it is for the best i mean she seems happy enough benito looked over to where maria garavellino not garavelli any more verrier nowwas talking to two older women she seemed if not happy at least to be her usual abrasive self dont be crazy she was saying the boats worth twice that put it up on blocks in tomasos yard if you wont use it benito missed half of the reply something about when you come back maria shook her head emphatically im not coming back benito winced at that certainty maria caught sight of him then immediately she turned and strode over to him her dark eyes flashing what are you doing here nito there was challenge in her voice challenge and deep down anger if there was anything else there he didnt want to know about it benito shrugged i heard an old friend was leaving venice she did a lot toward raising me i came to say goodbye good luck and a safe journey and i hopei mean i really hopeshes happy for a moment she said nothing then goodbye benito it was said very quietly with just a flicker of pain she turned her back on him and walked away benito had spent his life knowing exactly what to do next for once he didnt so he walked blindly off into the piazza leaving maria to embark with her new husband on the ship outbound for istria chapter the roll of the ship on its way to istria was comforting something familiar in an increasingly unfamiliar world maria needed that comfort now as she lay sleepless for the first time in her life she wasnt going to be living in a city that worried her more than she liked to admit but it worried her a lot less than the life stirring inside her did beside her umberto snored shed get used to that she supposed eventually at least the snoring made him different from caesare and benito for that matter benito had upset her the baby had kicked just when hed said goodbye shed swear it was hisit was so damned restless just like him but it would be a long time before she forgot the look on his face there on the quayside not for the first time maria wondered if shed made a mistake still shed made her decisions made her bed as the old ones said and now she must lie in it benito just reminded her too much of caesare caesare had hurt her worse than shed ever been hurt in her life and in ways she was probably never going to get over whatever else she wasnt going to have that happen to her again umberto wasnt an exciting man true and hadnt been even in his youth but maria had known him since she was a little girl umberto verrier was as decent as they came and as reliable as the seasons she sighed it was good fortune that umberto had gotten this post as chief forester for a district in istria the post usually went to one of the mastercarpenters from the arsenal which the caulkers technically were but normally it went to one of the more prestigious guilds not to the poorrelation caulkers she suspected the hand of petro dorma in that appointment his family had huge estates in istria and besides the doge had influence everywhere in venice but she was grateful even if all it meant was that the doge was trying to get benito valdosta of the casavecchie valdosta away from the canals and a certain boatgirl who might try to exercise a hold over him it would take her away from venice before her pregnancy began to show now all she had to do was bear with the interminable voyage an alien new life and try to love the husband she had bound herself to he was a good man umberto he deserved at least that she try try as hard as she ever had in all her life the voyage wound up not being as long or as uncomfortable as she had feared it would be but once the tarette had dropped them at the tiny harbor at rovini the enormity of the change in her life really struck her she had not been on the dock for more than a minute before she was aware deep in her gut that venetianheld istria was different all her life had been formed around the bustle of venice around an existence that centered on people and water she stood on the dock with a bundle of her personal belongings beside her as umberto looked for the forester who was to meet them and fought down a sudden surge of fear fortunately the forester was also looking for them and his arrival pushed the fear aside in favor of more immediate and practical concerns there was the usual confused comedy over boxes and chests eventually umberto and the other man got it sorted out while maria stood by trying not to feel impatient because she would have had it dealt with in two minutes the effort to control her oftenbrusque temperament steadied mariathe brusque temperament itself even more so whatever else maria had to worry about in the future her own practical competence was not one of them the foresters had arranged for a small caretta to transport the new chief forester and his bride up to his home in the forests and the hills bouncing up the muddy track beyond the olives and the bare fields they moved into the fringes of forested land for the first time in her life maria found herself out of sight or scent of the sea the forest smelled a damp rich mushroomy smell that probably under other circumstances would have been pleasant at least it wasnt the sewagestink of the canals in high summer but it wasnt familiar either it wasnt anything she was expecting and it was strong that or pregnancy or just the bouncing of the cart made her feel sick but when they got to the house maria was so astounded that she forgot her nausea it was made of wood like a rich mans home wood was saved for things that could float and bring you profit not used for houses and it was big set apart from the cluster of foresters huts it was a real house she could not imagine how they could afford it the house was new so it must have been built by the man umberto was replacing how did he afford such a place umberto looked sour the admirals at the arsenal discovered three weeks back that he and five of the foresters were in a very convenient arrangement with the lazzari the timber buyers from trieste that is why the post was vacantand probably why i got it they didnt want anyone who might still have a hand in the arrangement to come in and start it up all over again which meant delving deep into the guild to find a replacement as deep as the caulkers even he sighed the nice part is that the house comes with the post but i will have a mountain of paperwork to do and i doubt if the oxcart with our clothes and furnishings will be here until dusk im sorry maria ill have to get stuck in straight away even when the oxcart gets here the house will have to wait until i have time to arrange things we have bedding at least rossi assures me but the house is otherwise bare inside it was a crisp and for a miracle dry autumn day the hills with their leafbare stands of oak and larch called to her the thought of getting off of this carriage and onto her feet called even more shed walk up to the ridge where the dark pines stood like the raised hackles of some huge cat ill explore around she said not caring a pin whether or not there was a chair to sit on or plates to eat off hadnt she done without those things before well she could again i need to walk to get some air very well but please dont go out of sight of the house these wild places are dangerous rossi has been telling of bears and boar he trailed off looking miserably at the house personally maria thought rossis tales improbable even for the wilds of the fabled east the halfslovene was having fun seeing how many stories he could get his new boss to swallow most likely but she nodded since she wouldnt contradict him in front of rossi bad thing for a boss to be shown up in front of his underlings by a girlwife before hed even met most of those underlings umberto wasnt quite finished just remember youre um he flushed in a delicate condition maria nodded again poor umberto shed been brutally frank before accepting his proposal shed told him straight out that she was pregnant hed gone puce but hed also managed to say that it wouldnt matter to him that was quite something from anyone still umberto struggled to talk about the pregnancy it had begun to dawn on maria that it wasnt the mysterious father so much as the fact that so far as umberto was concerned this was an area men didnt refer to ever babies just happened and he would much prefer that things stayed that way thank you maria walked out past the house looking about her with wonder she had never in her life seen trees so tall or sountamed beneath her feet the springy turf felt very different from dockside boards and stone quays and the cool air was dry wondrously dry in venice the air was thick enough to wring out like a dishrag the loneliness out here was compelling and pulled her farther under the trees in short order shed very rapidly broken the injunction about going out of sight of the houses rossis stories and umbertos concern aside the hills seemed as unthreatening as a kitten and she was in a phase of pregnancy where she just seemed to have too much energy she was over most of the morning sickness now and although shed been told she would become heavy and uncomfortable soon she still felt strong not needing to be pampered and cosseted still there was maybe less room in her lungs than there used to be she sat herself down on a pile of leaves with a neat rock backrest just short of the ridge the rock was sunwarmed and shed walked a long way a canalers strength she realized after a moment really didnt lie in the legs shed just rest a while just a little in the sun the warm sun she woke with a startthough out of habit not moving not even to open her eyes voices strange voices near but not near enough to see her obviously she recognized the one rossi the forester who had brought the caretta to collect them see any problems the old man theyve sent up doesnt look like hell understand what is going on torfini rossi chuckled i reckon after the wolf bear and boar stories i told the man and that young woman of his the two of them will stay barricaded in the house for the next two years never mind the next two months even so im sure it was rudolpho and marco who somehow got word to the admirals at the arsenal i dont want those two to hook onto the fact that we still have timber to move out oak that well curved is much in demand so who is buying ship ribs now constantinople the other man snorted for heavens sake i dont care its all money good money and i want mine torfini there was a threat in that voice that made maria press herself into the rock youll get it all right just keep everyone away from the mello ridges for a couple of weeks ill find you if i dont get it youll get yours maria waited a good long while after theyd left the last thing she wanted was for either of those two pizza de merde to guess shed overheard them in fact her descent was more alarming than shed anticipated for darkness had come on much quicker than shed expected it was twilight when she got down to the cottages which were already twinkling with firelight umberto was standing outside their house with the door wide open beside himself where have you been i have been so worried ive got the men out looking for you there are saw pits she patted his cheek and tried to make him really look at her im fine i just walked farther than i meant to then i stopped for a rest and fell asleep but umberto never mind all that now i found out something very important he wasnt listening you must be more careful maria this isnt the canals of venice it is dangerous out here you hear me dangerous rossi told me that before the old chief forester left she tried mightily to keep from snapping at him she wasnt a child this wasnt about a new flower or a wild hare shed seen umberto rossi is a liar he was trying to keep us indoors and if the old chief foresters name was torfini then he hasnt gone far he was up on that ridge over there talking to rossi i heard them he wasnt even listening he led her indoors patting her youre in a a delicate condition maria you must rest ill get someone to look after you suddenly she was too tired to fight for him anymore maybe if a man told him what was going on he might actually listen to it very well ill rest if you go out and get two of your men in here rudolpho and marco you really must be more careful maria in this at least she would be firm rudolpho and marco umberto now and then ill rest and be good chapter grand duke jagiellon looked at his new shaman with a strange glow in his inhuman eyes count mindaug was sure he understood the thoughts moving in that nowdemonic brain this particular shamans skin would offer more eating than the last it was very wrinkled and the tattoos would give it an interesting color and flavor the face especially was heavily tattooed the shaman wore a coat of reindeer hide the shoulders of which were covered in feathers and the back with small brass bells he carried a quodba a magic drum so large that it seemed to dwarf the wrinkled old man the drumhead had also been tattooed there was no expression on the old face only the eyes narrow and slightly uptilted showed any signs of trepidation they darted about taking in details faintly shadowed with unnamed and secret thoughts count mindaug detected the battle of wills going on between the huge meaty grand duke and the scrawny old man not a word was said but the air itself shivered as if with heat eventually the old shoulders slumped the haltija is too strong he bowed to the grand duke master remember that jagiellon said coldly but you are stronger than my last shamans the shaman said nothing he waited jagiellon turned to count mindaug this one is not karelian why has he come pacifically mindaug held out his hands with their perfectly manicured and sharpened nails i sent emissaries into the north seeking out their most powerful your new shaman the one from karelen killed himself some days back this one is from kandalaksha the shaman nodded i am master of many words of power many sea words many water words some forest words i kill small karelian he challenged my power but i too strong for him his lithuanian was good if accented this was talk jagiellon understood you will give me that strength all of it and you will only kill at my express command the dark eyes flared there will be plenty of opportunity who do i go kill the big hands carved a shape in the air a vision appeared of a tall willowy boy this one marco valdosta is his name see him taste his magic he is weak in skill but deep in power the shamans drum seemed to shiver but other than the faint throbbing that came from it there was no sound or movement for some time eventually the shaman shook his head not one is two one human very strong but no skill and one big but not human you no kill this one this did not to mindaugs surprise anger his master not visibly anyway the purple scar on jagiellons forehead pulsed briefly the nonhuman one is limited to a place if the human comes out of that you can kill him the shaman nodded eat his haltija he strong but not skilled yet good a gesture and the vision was dispelled now this one again a shape formed in the air reddish hair an aquiline nose a single line of eyebrow and eyes that burned eneko lopez this ones name the drumskin shivered and then with a sound like tearing cloth split the shaman averted his face making a warningsign make it go master he said urgently he will see us too the vision disappeared the shaman shook himself like a dog ridding water too skilled master not so strong as the last two but very skilled and much haltija much strength to that soul more than the skill or power jagiellon nodded then we will work through intermediaries there are powers in the shadowworld that are mightyat least within their geographical area and we can misdirect he must be watched watched from a distance yes master the shaman bowed i have two watchers at my call birds can see a great distance they are not magical creatures asked jagiellon he will be aware of magical watchers the shaman flicked his fingers against the drum scowling and muttering the skin began to knit itself as soon as it was entire he began to drum a steady demanding beat count mindaug could see his lips moving but despite listening intently he could not make out the words two birds battered at the window jagiellon motioned to the count to open it the count pulled open the window and then had to duck as two enormous goshawks streaked past his head to land on the shamans now outstretched arms beneath his reindeerhide robe the shaman wore heavy leather vambraces of what could only be the thickest bullhide and well he did sothose powerful talons would have pierced anything less right through like most nobles mindaug had flown falcons there was something wrong with these birds those eyes were red insanity goshawks were always a little mad but these two it was said that a goshawk with a threatened nest would attack anything short of an elephant mindaug had the distinct impression that these two would not hesitate at the elephant with or without a nest under threat most birds of prey killed only enough to feed on goshawks and their kin sometimes went into killing frenzies if the opportunity presented itself mindaug sensed that this pair would create the opportunity if one didnt already exist feel them master feel them with your power jagiellon looked hard at the birds hmm it is there but very very light just a hold just their names master but i can see through their eyes jagiellon turned to the count you served me well with this one mindaug i am pleased the count bowed his fingernails digging into his palms the shaman was a very valuable tool to give up to his master but the count had one thing that the grand duke did not have he had the shamans own name of power mindaug wasnt too sure how hed use that yet but treachery was after all the core value of his world his researches into magical creatures had stretched a wide net away from the polishlithuanian power base that was his masters realm hed looked far far back what hed found was this old one the shaman was not entirely human any more himself but then in the ionian islands was something far far older quiescent but far from dead jagiellon knew it had been a powerful place once but actually he knew very little that was verifiable about the island once referred to as nausicaa an island which was settled before etruscans came to the venetian lagoon mindaug wondered if this was at long last the moment that the grand duke had overreached himself chapter it was bitterly cold down here in the water chapel below st raphaella marco felt it even through the thick coat and fur collar brother mascoli still wore his simple lightcolored habit the fringe of gray hair about his ears was if anything thinner than it had been when marco first met him old people were usually touched more by the cold than the young but the priests faith seemed to keep him warm warmer than marco anyway he shivered you are afraid marco said the hypatian sibling gently dont be gods will is gods will i know but i still question the rightness of what i am doing i do it for someone i love especially and dearly this is not just a deed done out of love for my fellow man or to serve a greater cause marco shook his head kat and her grandfather must have been praying for the return of her father for years and if it is gods will that he not return so be it all i want to do is find out where he is if at least they knew what had happened to him and where he isor wasit might give them not comfort exactly but he groped after the concept that he wanted but he might have known that a sibling would know very well whathe was getting at i understand brother mascoli said soothingly remember marco there is nothing unchristian about asking creatures that are not human for their help just as it is not unchristian to help them when they come to us for healing he smiled of course no evil creature would ever approach us for help their very natures would prevent them coming anywhere near here and since you helped to heal one undine all of the unhuman creatures are kindly inclined to you mascoli put a hand on marcos shoulder if a stranger had asked this of you you would have tried marco nodded mascoli smiled it is not right to deny the same help to those one loves dearly that too would be a sin he who judges these things knows the intents of the innermost heart and he is not fooled by the shallow and their pretences in the presence of men it may sometimes be wise not to show favor to an especially loved one in the presence of god well he knows already and since he is love incarnate he will always look kindly upon a deed done out of unselfish love it didnt seem quite so cold down here any more marco took a deep breath and began to ask the blessing of the four great archangels the warded corners glowed heaven would forfend any attempt to venture evil here remembering brother mascolis instructions he intoned in nomine patri et filii et spiritus sancti fiat pace standing now within the veil of light lying weightlessly on the chapel walls marco dipped the wine cup into the cold murky canal water discipline and concentration were called for here marco held the wine cup until the water was mirrorstill he began scrying building up an image in his mind calling by their true names the triton androcles and his mate althea the images and response came quickly wait we come an image of winter waves curling and foamlines danced across the wine cup and a brief moment of a circular suckerlike mouth full of long needlesharp teeth and a terrible roaring the wards flared to an incandescent brightness briefly and there was a sense that something had impacted against them hard the tall candles were now merely burning wicks in a dripping pool of wax marco nearly dropped the wine cup he turned to brother mascoli what happened he asked afraid and angry at the same time what was that the hypatian sibling was already kneeling ignoring the fact that the stones were wet join me he said hastily we need to strengthen the wards now one thing marco had learned when a magician said now in that tone of voice it was no time to ask questions what happened are androcles and althea all right marco asked as soon as brother mascoli had finished leading the invocation marcos heart was in his mouth describe exactly what you saw the sibling said his usual calm considerably thinner marco did brother mascoli nodded yes he let out a gusty sigh in my opinion your merfolk are probably all right in fact theyre probably completely unaware that anything happened they were not the target of what you encountered he blinked they werent brother mascoli shook his head and looked very grave indeed it is clear to me marco that we need to work on your focus and your defenses you are very vulnerable when you are scrying like that and i fear that this time only your bond with the lion saved you part of you was outside the wardsand your ability stretches the window of vision it is rare that one person can do that sort of scrying alone and unaided as a consequence you can see much more than say i can unfortunately it also means you are then visible to anything lurking waiting for the sign of your magic you are at your most vulnerable under such circumstances and something attacked me the information that he and not the merfolk had been the object of an attack made him feel a moment of relief at least he had not been the cause of two innocents getting in harms way brother mascoli made the sign of the cross something is definitely out there he said quietly something that dares not venture within the ancient boundaries of our current venice but knows what marco valdostas magework feels like something that is so evil that the wards were called on to guard your very soul marcos relief evaporated and he felt as if he had been doused in iced water and now that he came to think about it thered been something very recognizable about that image a feeling that hed met it when theyd fought chernobogs minions he could almost taste the magic foul beyond measure and polluted yet with an edge of seductive sweetnessseductive at least if you were not aware that it was the sweetness of corruption but i thought the lion had defeated the evil that attacked venice he whispered brother mascoli was the gentlest and kindest of all the men that marco knew right now he did not look gentle we have won a battle he said quietly sighing a battle not the war we need to go on being vigilant and we need to remember that in this war it is love and care that are our weapons as much as swords or magics our foe can match us sword for sword magic for magic but love and care are ours and ours alone our enemy cannot give those they would destroy him if he tried it was marcos turn to sigh he had given so much already and now that things were settling down for him he had hoped for a respite im just so sick of fighting i thought i thought we could give peace a try the sibling shook his head i am not a man of arms but it is no use simply calling for peace when our foe takes our desire for it to be an opportunity to conquer brutally without meeting any resistance we need swords aye and magic beside the love and care you and i and the hypatian order want to serve the latter but we need the former also we need to support them the still canal water greenish in the pale light was suddenly ringed the mermaid and the triton popped up the tritons voice boomed in the brickwalled waterchapel greetings mage marco we had a sudden squall there very strange you are unhurt marcos anxiety plainly struck the two of them as very funny storms are to us what a fresh breeze is to you humans said androcles that was no natural squall said brother mascoli quietly marco is right to be anxious about you that was caused by some magic weather magic is hard and expensive on the user said althea her mercurial expression going from mischievous to somber in an instant mascoli looked grim the squall was little more than an accidental slap of some great forces tail be careful beloved ones it was magic of the blackest and powerful the two looked doubtful and their tails beat the water behind them in slow measured waves of their fins well said the triton androcles it wasnt trying to stop us reaching you with the news you asked us for marco the truth is we have next to none if this friends father is dead he lies on land but we will widen our search and there are friends of fresh water like the undines that we can call upon the wide world over the mermaid whose aquamarine eyes sparkled with mischief again had wrapped her long wet blond hair several times around her upper torso creating an effective garment to cover her unclothed breasts her companion the triton blondbearded and longhaired looked exactly like the creatures that adorned the borders of tapestries and the basins of fountains all over venice like the mermaid he had a fishs tail unlike her he also had a fishs dorsal fin adorning his backbone faugh magus marco how you humans can live among such filthy waters i cannot imagine the triton somehow managed to grin and grimace at the same time because we arent very bright marco replied cautiously that seemed to be the correct answer for althea joined in the tritons chuckles well i cannot fault you overmuch for doing what we ourselves do androcles admitted you know i have a friend antonio a netman he drinks nothing but grappa and i asked him why he rotted his gut with the stuff and do you know what he said marco shook his head he said what am i to drink water after what you people and every fish in the sea do in it the triton roared with laughter which echoed in the brickwalled waterchapel and drowned out every other sound if he is there in the sea we will find him eventually said the mermaid smiling with confidence her teeth unlike those of undines were white pearly and exactly like human teeth althea was very pretty indeed marco wondered idly if at some point his artistfriend rafael de tomaso would be interested in having her pose for him we can follow the source of a single drop of blood in the water for leagues it will take time a year perhaps but we will find him and when we do find him what would you have us do marco thought about the horror of kat being presented with a body halfeaten by fish and crabs or a skeletonbut then thought of the value of having something to weep over something to bury even if it wasnt much please he said can you bring him home we will if he lies under the sea the triton promised then with a flick of tails they were gone after theyd left marco and brother mascoli found themselves standing and gazing into the water marco wasnt certain what to think perhaps at some level he had been so certain that kats father was dead and drowned that he had anticipated a quick answer to the question he had posed to the merfolk some weeks earlier at length mascoli shook himself come marco let us go upstairs and get a little warmer no news is good news i suppose marco shook his head slowly it may be but he could be dead on land or he could be a prisoner somewhere or ill or somehow lost his memory its the not knowing that is so terrible for kat well perhaps but where there is life there is also hope young man brother mascoli seemed to regain his calm he took marco by the elbow and led him upstairs and i must find someone who is more skilled in combative magic to instruct you in how to ward yourself it is a shame that eneko lopez is not still here in venice he is a harsh man but he is on his way to becoming one of the greatest of christian mages brother mascoli smiled wryly he has a belief in shared strength that the brethren of christ should unite giving the powers of light a strength as of an armywhile evil power stands as a tower alone relying only on itself yet many of the strega rituals are those of a bonding of power so perhaps father lopez is mistaken in his ideas marco pursed his lips sharing himself with the lion had broadened his outlook somewhat from the one which hed held once maybe the strega are not evil mascoli laughed softly i might believe you and truly that is the opinion of most hypatians but you should always keep in mind when dealing with him that eneko lopez is not always as flexible in his ideas chapter looking out from the palace on the summit of the terraced plateau of buda emeric could see all the way to the danube he preferred the nearer view however just outside the palace he had two new poleornaments the one on the left writhed slightly the chill air of late autumn had the interesting property of prolonging the futile struggle for lifein high summer heat and winters cold his ornaments had a tendency to expire much too quickly the king of hungary would not tolerate nationalism or too much in the way of religious fervor his kingdoms people were a mixture of slovenes croats slavs magyar slovaks walachs and a half a dozen other minorities not to mention several different religions that didnt matter they were first and foremost his impalement of those who sought to undermine that in the interest of their insular little people was an effective message his kingdom stretched from the edge of istria to the carpathians now he wanted the southern balkans to the west was the holy roman empire to the east the ilkhan mongols to the north the grand duke of lithuania only the south offered softness but unfortunately there were the hilltribes between him and the byzantines he wished that one of those poleornaments could be the infamous iskander beg the illyrian would pay that price one of these days if emeric could winkle him out of those mountains the hungarian heavy cavalry were at a disadvantage there in the broken steep country emeric hated the mountains if he could flatten all the damned mountains in the world he could ride all of his enemies down from the holy roman emperor to the grand duke and now those idiots in constantinople were going to give him his target on a platter help him to bypass iskander beg and his hilltribes he smiled grimly sat back on the golden throne amid the tapestryhung splendor of his reception roomhe loved this display of wealth and grandeurand let his eyes linger on the two victims outside the huge mullioned windows that view might unbalance the greasy byzantine the servant was still waiting for orders too used to his masters little ways to turn so much as a hair at the display outside the windows emeric raised a finger and the servant snapped to attention send the byzantine emissary count dimetos up to me those accompanying him also the servant bowed and whisked himself out the door the byzantine had been left to kick his heels for several hours that did no harm but little good either hed be used to that emissaries were often left in cold or overheated antechambers for hours or even days at a time a couple of wouldbe traitors on display on the top of sharpened poles would be somewhat more effective at impressing him count dimetos imperial emissary of alexius vi announced the majordomo from the arched doorway and his advisors normally emeric discarded the hangerson to any supplicant who came to seek a royal audience they tended to bolster the confidence of the supplicant an undesirable state of affairs but the byzantine count had been nearly imperturbable last time and very hard to read perhaps emeric would get more from the escorts expressions they filed in the effects of seeing the impaled men just outside of the windows were most satisfactory on three of the five anyway count dimetos calmly looked away the fifth man the blond oneunusual that hair color in a byzantinedidnt even blink or give the dying men a second glance he bowed along with the count two of the others forgot to bow and had to be prodded to it emerics curiosity and caution were aroused immediately by the indifferent one there was something very odd about that blond man it made emeric suspicious but he had no intention of revealing anything instead emeric nodded slightly barely acknowledging the respectful bows well count dimetos you have taken some time to get back to me the emissary held out his palms my apologies king emeric travel is slow at this time of year but for a few small details about which i am sure we can reach a speedy agreement i bring happy news emeric was careful to look unimpressed im not some turkishbazaar merchant count i do not bargain actually emeric was impressed the counterdemands hed made a few months earlier when the byzantines had first approached him with an offer for a secret alliance against venice had been extreme forty galleys full crews thirty carracks capable of carrying at least two hundred men each and five hundred thousand ducats to cover the cost of the campaign and zante and crete nothing less and all that in exchange for simply seizing corfu from the venetianswhich the hungarians would keep not the greeksso that the byzantine empire could finally be rid of the untaxed and commercially aggressive venetian enclave in constantinople to call it an unequal exchange would be like calling an elephant a mouse yet to emerics surprise the byzantines were apparently willing to settle on his terms it all seemed opportune much too opportune if alexius came up with the money emeric would know that it was indeed too good to be true there was only one place alexius could still raise that kind of money by making a secret alliance with lithuania emeric suppressed a vicious smile if grand duke jagiellon wanted to give him money and ships to do exactly what he had already intended to do so be it emeric couldnt see jagiellons exact plan yet but his target was plainly the venetian republic that was also fine emeric wanted venice and its holdings too eventually but he would take things one step at a time corfu first that would cripple the venetians and allow him to turn on the byzantines before that weak fool alexius knew what was happening emeric would have negroponte and then the hell with merely holding the golden horn as the venetians did constantinople itself would do and alexius himselfjagiellon also it seemedwould provide him with the wherewithal to do so now he did smile but pleasantly and his voice was smooth and urbane however please continue count dimetos i do not object to some small adjustment of the terms not necessarily just details to be arranged not really adjustments said the emissary fluttering his hands the agreement we spoke of the last time was not entirely complete hes nervous thought emeric incredulously the greek is nervous what did it take to make someone like dimetos nervous dimetoss quick flicker of a glance at the expressionless blond man answered that question emeric leaned forward introduce me to your companions count the count bowed he indicated the tallest man of his party your majesty this is admiral lord nikomos of volos he is our naval expert this is general alexiou he is as you might gather a military man mavilis here has come to support me with any financial details emeric raised his eyebrows that is one detail about which there will be no discussion he pointed to the blond man who looked back at him with dead eyes and who is this ah an advisor to the emperor the emissary stated uncomfortably decidedly uncomfortably milord aldanto is his name emeric nodded with feigned disinterest and yawned his voice at variance to the curiosity sparked by dimetoss reaction an italian name interesting where are you from aldanto milano there was a toneless quality to the voice that matched the mans stony expression toneless rather say lifeless emeric simply raised his eyebrows again and turned back to the emissary well count perhaps you should explain these little details that you believe requirewhat did you call itcompletion i believe there was a slight beading of sweat on the counts face well the galleys the admiral interrupted we just dont have that many ships to spare king emeric it would leave us with too few for if i had wished you to speak admiral i would have told you so emeric said curtly i need those vessels mine are not a seagoing people i have enlisted what i can but we are talking of blockades escorts and transports i can move men overland as far as the mouth of the narenta the rest will have to be achieved by sea if you dont provide those transports then the assault is a waste of time the narenta pirates have been brought into my fold for this task backed up by the galleys of byzantium you should be able to deal with any venetian vessels provided we time this right thats the key he studied the pole ornaments for a moment the one on the left had now apparently died also pity emeric had hoped idly that he wouldnt be too preoccupied to observe the last moments we must allow the eastern and western convoys to pass he continued looking back at the byzantine envoys the commander of the corfu garrison will send a request for replacement stores by coaster afterward at that point we attack if we fail to take the fortress and the island we will have some months to lay siege before the venetian ships can return the emperor alexius has arranged that neither fleet will be returning said the blondhaired man expressionlessly emeric had not asked for him to speak either but he let that pass instead he snorted the last time that was tried it failed this time it will not fail the man made that statement with the same certainty with which he might have said the sun will rise tomorrow which was also interesting emeric shook his head i dont gamble on my campaigns certainly not based on empty promises his tone made clear his opinion of the spendthrift and debauched young alexius we do not make empty promises there was such a cold certainty in that voice who was this fellow that he could make such pledges on behalf of alexius emeric dismissed that with a wave we will calculate as if you are not that sure first let us settle the important question money an unpleasant conviction was growing in his mind about this blond man he would have to check with the countess elizabeth bartholdy his principal advisor in magical matters despite his reputation fiercely cultivated emeric was little more than a hedgewizard compared to her he was now almost sure that the money was coming from jagiellon that did not worry him money was not a potential threat nor a potential spy gold had no loyalty and was never a traitor or an assassin what he hadnt expected and didnt like at all was dealing with jagiellon almost facetoface as it were he suspected the blond man was little more than a talking puppet the name aldanto rang a bell he would have to investigate the matter further emeric didnt want thisthingin his kingdom for one moment longer if it was what he thought it was talking puppets could become doorways the emperor wants to negotiateerpayment in tranches the little moneyman stuttered ppart as and when the work is ffinished so to speak emeric shook his head alexius thought he had best put a brake on the hungarian advance did he withhold the money if the hungarians moved into epirus ha no i cant see the vessels up front so ill see the money otherwise i might find myself caught like a rat in a trap without your ships but the blond man interrupted you will have the money within the month emerics eyes narrowed he was fairly certain now he was right so this was the face of the enemy across the northern carpathians odd in a way he knew this kind of possession was possible but it took demonic power and that demonic power too often ended up devouring the user emeric himself dealt with a power below but very very cautiously well he would need magicians for this project anyway he would consult with elizabeth she had a long memory and longer experience she even frightened him a little how could a woman that old look as if she were barely twenty she was truly beautiful too with the sort of allure that literally held men enthralled and she used that beauty like the weapon that it was ruthlessly and accurately it was fortunately for emeric the kind of beauty that he could close his mind to in the craggy and cliffhung little valleys on the north end of the enchanted island the nightwind was full of the clatterclatter of little goaty feet on the limestone and the hollow trilling of reed pipes the shepherd huddled down under his sheepskins in his little leanto it was a full moon out there this was when all good men stayed indoors kallikazori still walked on the high barren hillsides on these holy nights and a man might turn over to find his wife was not beside him if he was a wise man he went back to sleep and said nothing at all about it to her in the morning if he was a fool he might beat her for being halfasleep the next day but a man who wanted children fertile fields and fertile flocks would keep his tongue and hands still a wise man knew that here on corfu the old ones still walked and still wielded their powers a wiser man stilled his mind to the fact prayed to the saints and pretended he saw and heard nothing the wisest of all the wisest of all found a way to pray to the saints by dayand something else by night after all the holy word said thou shalt not have other gods before me it said nothing at all about having other gods in reserve part ii winter ad chapter eberhard of brunswick waited patiently in the antechamber he looked upwards and across toward the tall narrow windows of the throne room and then back at the empty throne weak winter sunlight patterned down through the windows and onto the mosaictiled floor of the throne room the mosaic a religious scene showing christ feeding the multitudes had been commissioned by the present emperors father at tremendous expense personally eberhard thought the byzantine splendor did not fit well with the gothic style of mainz the workers had been recruitedalso at great expenseby the venetians all the way from constantinople charles fredriks father nearing the end of his life had been convinced that the pious work would help to ease his path to heaven if god had the taste of a byzantine maybe it had eberhard grimaced he had been close to the old emperor if emperor walther had lived to see the work finished eberhard had a feeling that the old flagstones might just have been put down again on top of the mosaic he sighed charles fredrik would be here no doubt shortly in the meanwhile it would have been nice to have something other than these damn tiles to look at it was damnably cold for an old man he paced to warm himself and distract his attention from the mosaic when charles fredrik finally arrived with his aide baron trolliger eberhard of brunswick began to wonder if he would be arranging for more byzantine craftsmen to smooth this emperors path to heaven charles fredrik looked tired he looked more than tired he looked worn and he looked worried still his expression lightened when he saw eberhard he raised the old counselor up i see they have not even brought you a glass of wine to fight off the chill he shook his head disapprovingly and gestured to one of the footmen hippocras for my lord of brunswick and for us a few minutes later the three of them were seated in a small warm sideparlor an applewood fire burned merrily in the grate that and a goblet of rich spiced hippocras had helped fight off eberhards chill and had lightened the emperors expression even given some color to his cheeks charles fredrik still looked twenty years older and much closer to the grave than he should eberhard knew that the wounds he had received in a youthful campaign still troubled one of the emperors lungs winters were always hard for him still no news from my nephew manfred said charles fredrik heavily the roads and passes are snowed closed said baron trolliger there is no reason to get too worried your majesty the norse are honorable about their oaths charles fredrik shook his head i trust those petty pagan kinglets not at all the socalled christian ones not much more ive sent a messenger through to francesca in copenhagen baron trolliger touched his head that woman has secured us more cooperation with the danes in two months than you did in five years hans trolliger said charles fredrik almost snapping the words if i had twenty more like her i could afford to die without worrying about the succession as it iswell at least hakkonsen is with manfred between erik and mamzelle de chevreuse they keep one of my heirs on a reasonably even keel baron trolliger nearly choked that affair in venice nearly had him killed i still say we should have hanged every last one of those damned servants of the trinity charles fredrik smiled grimly if wed hanged as much as one the entire pauline church would have been in an uproar instead theyve excommunicated a few obvious bad eggs and we must put up with and isolate the rest as for francesca and erik i still say they kept manfred on a reasonably even keel in very dangerous waters without either of them he would have definitely been killed erik has made a warrior out of him and francesca has done even more shes made him think she might have led him by his testicles to that point but she actually made him think to my certain knowledge thats something no one else ever succeeded at doing the venetian affair has done a great deal for one of my heirs besides i enjoyed my visit to venice and to rome even if you didnt hans baron trolliger looked as if he might choke the visit was bad enough the months you made me stay there afterward eberhard of brunswick chuckled well your majesty at least prince conrad hasnt caused you as much trouble even if he hasnt provided you with as much entertainment what is manfred doing in norway anyway winter in scandinavia is not something id ever want go through again i did it with your father in smaland back in when we went in to bail the danes out far as i was concerned the pagans deserved the place to an extent charles fredrik agreed with his advisor though it was hardly politic to say so in winter it can be bleak nice enough in summer said the emperor mildly eberhard of brunswick had been one of his fathers closest friends and the old ritter was now one of charles fredriks most trusted emissaries hed spent the better part of the last year in ireland with the celtic ard ri representing the states general and the holy roman emperor to the league of armagh now he was home charles fredrik knew the old man had delighted in the thought of seeing his grandchildren again the ritter had dropped some hints in his correspondence that hed like to retire to his estates the emperor bit his lip the old man deserved retirement had more than earned it but men of his caliber were rare very rare in point of fact there was no one skilled and canny enough to replace him hed have to send the silverhaired warrior out again but not somewhere cold and wet this time that was the least he could do its still part and parcel of the same business eberhard well the aftermath of it the danes are content to hold the coastal lands but the chapters of knights of the holy trinity that my father established there after the campaign are still pushing deeper into pagan lands they stir things up and the pagan tribes tend to take it out on the danish settlers the knights are building little empires out there at this point theyre a law unto themselves eberhard snorted rein them in emperor rein them in hard we need the coast to keep the pagan bastards from raiding our shipping on the baltic but the hinterland not worth the price in blood the empire will pay for some barsinister ritter to get himself an estate the emperor nodded thats what manfred had gone to do last i heard it was in hand but then this business in norway cropped up and he went off to sort that out we havent heard from him in over a month it is near midwinter your majesty pointed out baron trolliger i know that treaty is supposed to be ratified on midwinters eve hed have sent me word the emperor rubbed his eyes tiredly i know hans the passes in norway are closed but ive had the servants of the trinity try to contact him by magical means also nothing to eberhard he said in explanation hes gone to telemark one of those little kingdoms on the norwegian side of the skagerrak dirt poor rotten with raiders and pirates because the land cant feed all of them we concluded a treaty with king olaf two years ago hes dead and his son vortenbras has taken the throne and so the treaty needs to be ratified again since vortenbras is pagan the oath must be sworn in the temple on odins ring at the midwinter festival only the rings been stolen manfred and erik and two of our best diviners have gone to see if they can find it no word from them all i can find out is that its snowing heavily in the north the old ritter looked as if even the thought of a trip into snowy scandinavia was enough to make him break out in chilblains nevertheless he said calmly do you want me to go your majesty the emperor leaned over and patted the agespotted sinewy hand no ive sent a message to a woman who will see to it the same francesca de chevreuse of whomhere he gave trolliger a sly glancehans disapproves but no matter what hans thinks of her capability i have confidence in her over any other possible agent in this case trolliger shuddered shes capable enough her methods work said the emperor even you find her attractive hans men will tell an attractive intelligent woman things they wont tell us theyll do things for her they would not consider doing for us for any amount of money theyll go to great lengths to help her they reduce us to the level of aquitaine your majesty said the baron sulkily the emperor pulled a wry face which is why our officials fail so dismally when we have to deal with the aquitaine im almost tempted to send you to francesca for lessons hans charles fredrik saw the look of trepidation on the old ritters face he smiled reassuringly at the older man not you eberhard you would enjoy her intellect and company though i can assure you of that baron trolliger here finds her physically threateningor her breasts anyway he fears they will cast a fascination over him and like samson leave him helpless to resist the ladys whims eberhard of brunswick shook his head it is not the company of an intelligent woman that i fear your majesty it is rather that i am concerned that youll send me to aquitaine i was hoping to spend some time in swabia with my family he touched his silver hair im not getting any younger your majesty especially for aquitaine you need younger men the emperor gave a small snort of wry laughter the last thing i need in aquitaine is younger men eberhard but relax i am not going to send you there however im afraid i cant let you go home to pasture either men like you are too few on the ground the holy roman empire still needs you i still need you the older ritter shrugged well i just hope its somewhere warm this time your majesty this winter seems colder than last winter or maybe im just older at least mainz is not as damp as ireland was charles fredrik allowed the corners of his mouth to ease into a smile would the holy land be warm enough and dry enough for you a pilgrimage for my soul has always been one my desires said the old ritter quietly eberhard of brunswick was one of the best and most reliable of officials in the states general he was an adept politician and diplomat but at the core he was a pious man his soul might need cleansing of what hed done for the empire but not for himself charles fredrik knew its more for my soul than yours old friend the emperor said equally quietly i dont know how many more of these winters i can take either he smiled wryly no mosaics this time though eberhard perhaps some churches in places that need them i havent lived your life and i have a feeling ill need a good many prayers to get me away from hellfire as well as a pilgrimage to jerusalem but i cant go you will have to go for me he lifted a heavy eyebrow of course there are some small tasks you can do for the holy roman empire while youre there and along the way eberhard nodded he understood politics thoroughly enough to know precisely whom in that part of the world a small task might be directed towards the ilkhan charles fredrik nodded weve had tentative feelers from them baron trolliger had a long discussion with a visiting jew from damascus during the months he remained behind in italy the man was there strictly on family business of course butas they often dothe mongols were using the jewish merchant as an informal emissary the ilkhan mongol empire stretched from egypt to the black sea and no one really knew just how far into the asian hinterland the ilkhan were themselves pagan but had no qualms about their subject peoples worshiping gods of their choice christians muslims jewsmany religionsall prospered in the mongol realm they enforced a degree of tolerance that the fiery christian metropolitan of alexandria might find irksome but it did make things peaceful in their dominions eberhards eyes narrowed they wont like that in alexandria the emperor shrugged politics and war make for strange bedfellows eberhard and it all comes down to grand duke jagiellon trying to flank me or force me to fight on two fronts and the holy roman empire trying to flank him the grand duke is building up quite a fleet in odessa then too theres this the news hans brings back from his long stay in italy leaves me concerned that the hungarians are up to no good either the ritter nodded the ilkhan could at least bottle them up in the black sea but surely emperor alexius vi can do that just as well from constantinople baron trolliger coughed we have a treaty with him yes but weve had word that a few shipswhich are definitely not from odessahave been discharging visitors who have gone on to visit the imperial palace the old ritter nodded slowly i see that would indeed leave our flank wide open very well your majesty when do i leave not until spring eberhard said the emperor even if you left today getting passage to acre or ascalon before spring would be impossible you can have a few winter months to spend cooped up with your grandchildren by the time spring comes even the muddy road will probably look appealing eberhard smiled there is some merit in what you say your majesty the last time i was home my daughters youngest was teething yes by spring it may even be good to be on the road without children charles fredrik coughed well not strictly without hes a bit old to be called a child these days but he is one of my heirs a look of horror came across the old statesmans face not manfred sire im an old man the emperor nodded ruefully its a symbol of great trust eberhard of brunswick i am feeling my age and my wound troubles me i may not survive another winter and such a trip will take the boy a long way from the intriguers of court if i die the succession must be a simple matter of conrad being the only candidate at hand not that i have the least fears about manfred wanting the throne but that has never stopped factions in the past on the other hand if by any evil chance conrad and i are killedas happened to the emperor maximilian and his soni want manfred safe and ready where no one can get to him easily besides youre the leading statesman of my empire i want him to learn from you if there is time ill send the boy to ferrara to duke enrico delleste to see if he can learn strategy and tactics from the old fox but statecraft needs to come first and youll find hes improved a great deal circumstances erik and francesca have made him grow up a great deal but all the old man said was manfred with a face full of woe the messenger bearing dispatches from the emperor to francesca de chevreuse only took ten days and that was by spending imperial gold like water a brief thaw and then a vicious freeze had made the roads full of ironhard ridges and ruts which was still better than fetlockdeep mud francesca looked at the imperial sealand the scrawl well the imperial tutors probably hadnt beaten him for untidiness she grimaced one had to wonder what vagaries of imperial policy had stemmed from some terrified official doing his best to interpret this handwriting it really was difficult looking carefully though she could see that was in part due to a definite tremor in the hand of the writer perhaps the rumors about the emperors health had some substance after all francesca looked out over copenhagen and the sound the water was gray bleak windchopped shed been out earlier wearing her beautiful sable coat and muff her new venture into vertical diplomacy instead of the horizontal kind still required appearances even though as the princes leman she was strictly offlimits men could be just as foolish when flirting as they could in bed more so sometimes in bed they werent trying to impress a woman with their brains so she needed to look as good if not more so than she had as one of the most soughtafter courtesans in venice that alas meant keeping up with her rigorous exercise regime the air had been biting cold and full of the dusty smell of coming snow just the time for a little venture into the norse wilderness ah well what the emperor wanted the emperor would get besides she was a little worried herself about the lack of communication from manfred she sat down at her writing desk and sharpened her quill then in a hand that was both beautiful and legible penned several letters she shook the sand off them and tinkled a delicate glassandsilver bell poor little heinrich could go out in the cold and deliver these chapter winter in the republic of venice was not as bleak as winter in the holy roman empire it was still wet and cold which made repair work a little more difficult than at other times this fact was relevant the casa montescue was busy getting a facelift true the great house of montescue was technically bankrupt twice over but that was a good reason to do it now if we dont do it said lodovico montescue calmly to his granddaughter katerina everyone will think we are down to our last ducat kat shook her head at him smiling but grandpapa we are down to our last ducat she couldnt bring herself to be hugely worried about it come financial ruin or any other disaster she had marco and it seemed now that the feud between valdosta and montescue was finally healed that lodovico montescue once the colleganzagenius of venice had found his verve once again he chucked her chin cara mia if we have the place looking too shabby then well have our creditors on our necks watch we start spending money theyll back off weve got political connections even if not business something will turn up she shook her head and sighed at him but without the despair that had plagued her waking and sleeping for so many years all that worries me is where the money to pay for this lot is going to come from if need be well borrow it he said making kat raise her eyes but watch things will begin to right themselves he stretched out his big liverspotted hands and looked at the slightly bulbous knuckles marco has not come yet he said hed be here by the terce bell kat felt the warmth of knowing this lift her good lodovico nodded his satisfaction i want him to work on these old hands again ill swear that boy of yours has magic in his fingers never mind his skills as a doctor he is going to be great physician said kat defensively trying very hard not to think about the other things that he was magician for one vehicle forsomething elsefor another lodovico chuckled i dont disagree with you girl im becoming very fond of the boy myself how is the annulment of that marriage of his going kat made a face this was the one shadow on her days for she and marco could not wed until he had been rid of the wifeinnameonly he had taken out of a misplaced sense of honor and obligation to his benefactor his wifes brother petro dorma slowly that angelina one moment its a nunnery and becoming a saint lodovico snorted with laughter saint puttana ill believe all the girls in the house of the red cat turned siblings first kat grinned in spite of herself you shouldnt use language like that in front of me grandpapa anyway one minute shes all set on being a saint and a martyr the next shes screaming at poor petro that he wants to lock her away and if you didnt hate her guts you might almost feel sorry for her said her grandfather still amused kat shook her head at him she was and is a spoiled selfish brat and stupid on top of it she got herself pregnant and got poor marco to claim it was his to save her face and then tried to run away with her lover anyway and shes still trying to manipulate things in her own favor no matter what that does to people around her and yes i sometimes hate her but at least i havent taken out an assassination contract on her head lodovico acknowledged the hit with a wry smile i was wrong that time and marco and benito lived through it besides if she delays any more with this annulment i wouldnt bet on you not doing just the same they were in a small salon just off the front hall and thus the pounding of the great lionheaded knocker was easily audible lodovico chuckled hes eager this young man of yours early too a faint frown creased kats brow that was a very forceful knocking shed come down to wait for marco often enough to know he used the knocker tentatively maybe bad news or good news finally about the annulment of his marriage to angelina she hastened out into the hallway whitehaired old giuseppe had not announced the visitor because he was gaping at the two of them they were enormous they loomed over giuseppe in the way that the church of saint hypatia hagia sophia loomed over the square outside it giuseppe and kat would have been terrified had the two blond giants not looked like two very lost little boys crushing fur hats in their hands hoping for a welcome pardon said one in italian so atrocious that only familiarity with erik hakkonsens accent enabled kat to understand him but is this the dwelling of the family montescue it is said kat blinking at him it wasnt just the accents of theseboysthat was outlandish it was every inch of them clad as they were in garments like nothing she had ever seen before oh in part they resembled some sort of norselander or icelander venice saw enough of those coming in and out of their ports but not all their garments were fur and homespun woolen they also rejoiced in leather leggings with fringes of a kind that no icelander had ever boasted and there were beads and feathers braided into their hair which was shaven on the sides but long everywhere else and in sheathes at their sides each of them wore a weapon that kat recognized erik hakkonsen favored that kind of little axe or hatcheta tomahawk it was called ah good the speakers face cleared and is the clan chieftain here chieflodiludo blessed jesu boy dont mangle my name further lodovico growled as he limped into the hallway i am lodovico montescue of casa montescue who the devil are you both boys drew themselves up with immense dignity gulta and bjarni thordarson at your service the speaker said and both bowed sent we were by clan thordarson a trade alliance to make from vinland we come for that purpose a corded oiledsailcloth bundle was at the mans feet and he used the hatchet to slice open the flax cords binding it it opened spilling out fine woven cloth dyed in rich hues not wool something finer kat thought the weaving was done in geometric patterns like nothing she had ever seen and when the boy bent down and pulled up a corner and handed it to her she stroked it and the touch grandpapa she cried involuntarily it is as soft as silk but silk made into wool it is alpaca said the one who had not yet spoken diffidently and this is cotton he bent and pulled out a snowy white piece and held it to her for her inspection she touched it as wellcotton she knew the egyptian and indian cloth was shockingly expensive so much so that only the wealthy could afford the gauzes and cambrics made from it this was certainly cotton we have these and other things furs spices we wish a trade alliance with clan montescue to make the first boy said proudly carlo had said at first kat wasnt sure she heard him correctly pardonwho she managed the boy knitted his brows in puzzlement you know him not carlo of clan montescue is he not here but he had said and that was when all hell broke loose marco walked in at just that moment which complicated matters further kat was weeping lodovico shaking the poor vinlander boy in a way that would have made his teeth rattle had he not been as big as he was and yelling at the top of his lungs while the other boy looked utterly bewildered somehow marco managed to separate lodovico from his victim get them all herded into a quiet room and relatively calmed down with marcos promptingwhile kat clung numbly to his handthe boys managed to piece together part at least of what had happened to her father his vessel had been taken by pirates who had in turn sold him to some strange vinlander tribe in the south of the continent he had escaped or been rescued by some other tribethe boys were rather vague as to which or how it had happenedand they in their turn had traded him up the coast until he came into the hands of the thordarsons now they had had to pay a great deal for carlo montescue and by their custom and law he apparently discovered that he couldnt just find a ship and come home no he had to earn his freedom until then he was what they called a thrall not exactly a slave but certainly not free and branded as such by the iron ring around his neck the boys were very matteroffact about it and although kat could have wept even harder with vexation the part of her that was a venetian trader to the core could see their point at any rate it soon was proved that carlo was going to earn his freedom in record time for exactly that reason records recordkeeping and accounting at which apparently the vinlanders were shockingly bad lodovico grunted at that so not all that cursing i did when he was a boy was entirely wasted evidently not our clanfolk have holdings down on the valley of the mother of rivers as well as trading posts at wherewatersmeet upon the eastern coast the first boygulta that wassaid proudly carlo made our profits to rise like a swan in flight it was he who said that a trading mission to europe and venice and perhaps the silk houses of constantinople might pay a very rich dividend and we sent him home to await us and prepare the way while we gathered goods and chose who to go but he never arrived the loss in her grandfathers face made kat gulp down her own tears if she began crying he might not be able to hold himself together it was a crumb of comfort that the boys looked stricken too we sent him home gulta halfprotested as if he thought they doubted him lodovico managed to reach out and pat the boy on the hand we believe you lad he replied his voice cracking a little but a great deal can happen between vinland and venice they were all thinking it including shipwreck all but marco it seemed who stuck out his chin stubbornly not shipwreck he said firmly i can promise you that whatever has delayed him it isnt that and until i hear otherwise i will be sure it is only thatdelay it wasnt sane it wasnt rational but kat took heart from his suretyand so did her grandfather who sat up straighter and nodded by saint raphaella valdosta you shame me he said if you a stranger to our family can have such faith how am i to doubt right enough my son has survived so much else how can he not return home to us exactly so sir marco agreed giving kats hand a squeeze now lodovico turned to the vinlanders and that being so young sirs please let us hear your plans and how casa montescue means to figure into them to anyone but a venetian that statement would have seemed callous in the extreme here lodovicos son had literally been raised from the dead only to vanish again and he was discussing trade alliances but kat knew and marco surely knew that this was perhaps the bravest thing that her grandfather could have done there was nothing or next to nothing any of them could do to help carlo wherever he was and this trade agreement was her fathers hardwon legacy to the house of montescue should they now throw it away because he had vanished again that would be like taking gold he had sacrificed to send them and flinging it into the canals and starving setting his sacrifice at naught because he was not there himself no she and her grandfather would trust to god and her fathers eminent good sense and cleverness and fight to preserve what he had given them lying in bed late that night kat realized her fathers ambitions were going to cost a great deal yes the profits from trade in vinland goods particularly this cotton could be very very lucrative egyptian and indian cottons were only for the very rich cotton was as expensive or more so than silk because picking the seeds out was such a laborious process either the vinlanders had some process to remove the seeds or labor must be dirt cheap over there still however it was done their prices would bring the fabric within reach of the merely welltodo but it would require offices and warehouses in either flanders or denmark or ireland to meet up with the norseceltic atlantic trade ships the family her father had tied in with were of icelandic stock the icelanders tended to run a denmarkvinland journey it was not a good route for serious volumes of merchandise it was too slow with too many overland expenses and tolls and tariffs yes from a port somewhere on the atlantic coast they could and would sell to northern europe but the east and markets on the mediterranean would be best served by meeting the venetian atlantic trading convoy and selling out of venice but that meant warehouses local agents and money lots of money are we in the fire still she wondered before she drifted off to sleep or have we at least climbed back into the frying pan chapter svanhild thordardatter was not a maiden easily intimidated she had faced in her time bears catamounts blizzards that piled snow to the rooftree drunken and aggressive skraelings who had gotten more aqavit than they should have and skraeling warbands she could make a wilderness camp milk a cow goat or sheep cook a meal without a single implement but a knife and read an icelandic saga like a skald she could hunt fish and ride as well as her brothers besides having all of the usual skills of a wellbred maiden she had during the rough crossing climbed into the rigging in her leather skraeling trews to help alongside her brothers she had not only been willing to go with them she had been eager valkyrielike she might well be but like the storied brunnhilde she had her soft side she wanted a husband children and a home of her own but the only way she was going to get one was to find a husband who wasnt somehow related to her impossible in vinland well perhaps not impossible but difficult the only unmarried men who were not somehow tied into the thordarson clan were thralls her mother would have died skraelings actually not unacceptable but she didnt really want to set up housekeeping in a bark lodge or a skin tent or trolls trolls at least so far as she was concerned nasty fat obnoxious hairy smelly uncouth elderly trolls so for both svanhild and her mother this trade expedition was heavensent for her mother it would be an opportunity for gulta and bjarni to find their sister a fine unattached nobleman and if this furthered their trade alliances all the better for svanhild well if unattached young men were so thick on the ground as all that back in the mother countries she would make sure that any noblemen that the boys presented to her were young and handsome or at the least not trolls she had strode confidently off the ship once it reached the harbor in veniceand then for the first time in her life discovered something that intimidated her as bears catamounts and blizzards had never been able to do the women of venice in the piazza san marco she encountered the women of venice and though gulta and bjarni were deaf and dumb to such nuances knew that although she might be considered to be one of the prettiest maidens in vinland here she was a troll the women of venice were tiny dainty slimwaisted and smallbreasted their perfumed hair was either dark as a ravens wing or a becoming honeycolored shade they did not stride they glided they did not wear leather and fur and homespun in tunics and trews nor aprons and plain dresses they wore elegant gowns of silk and brocade velvet and linen embroidered and trimmed with laces and ribbons their hands were soft and white their complexions pale and faintly blushed svanhild towered over them with her sunbrowned face and brassygold hair she looked like a huge cheap trinket among a box full of dainty goldset jewels or a cow among a herd of deer a goose swimming with swans and she knew it and they knew it she saw it in their eyes in the amused sideglances they bestowed on her no young man noble or otherwise would look at her with anything other than amused contempt in the time it took to walk from the ship to the lodgings her brothers had arranged for her she had read this lesson in a thousand eyes a thousand veiled smirks a thousand smothered laughs behind their backs gulta and bjarni were indeed oblivious to it all excited as children at christmastide by the newness and the bustle so she put up a good front for them marching with head high and cheeks burning with shame pretending that she did not notice what was going on either but she did and it didnt stop at the door of the lodging either even the servants here looked at her in that scornful way until she was afraid to leave her room lest she meet with their sneers and arch glances and it quickly became clear that venice had more people in a single one of its many districts than there were in entire cities in vinland so finding carlo and clan montescue was not going to be the simple matter of appearing on the docks and calling out the name while bjarni and gulta searched the city for someone who could take them to clan montescue she hid in her room took comfort in what luxuries the boys found for herfood primarily which was of immense comfort since food did not have sneers or scornful eyesand felt despair creeping over her and wondered ifjust perhapscarlo montescue plausible fellow that he was had somehow tricked them that his clan was not the leader of trade that he had said that he did not even have a clan that she and gulta and bjarni had come here on a fools errand and she the most foolish of all then her brothers finally returned after days of searching with the news that clan montescue had been found that it was as great as carlo had claimed that although carlo had unaccountably vanished between vinland and venice the ancient clan chief lodovico had welcomed them and their plans with every bit of warmth and enthusiasm they could have hoped for which was all the more gratifying since the resurrection and second banishment of the old mans son had been a heavy blow to him but then came a heavy and horrid blow to svanhild delivered lovingly out of the mouths of her own dear brothers and we are to come to dinner with them this night and sit in honor at their table crowed bjarni now we will be sought for and taken seriously in fact we are to come to their table most nights and feast with them and they will introduce us to all of the great clan chiefs of the city this will be your chance sister gulta said in a kindly voice as she felt the blood draining from her face for surely there will be many young men there ah but i must warn you do not cast those blue eyes upon the one called marco valdosta for he is spoken for by the daughter of clan montescue the daughter is clever as well bjarni tossed off casually well read and canny and of an age with you you must cultivate her the old one dotes upon her and it is clear that she has great influence upon him the bare thought made her stomach turn over oblivious as ever the boys tramped off noisily with more of the samples of the trade goods that they had brought in a sick panic svanhild looked over her best gowns then sat down and ate an entire basket of pastries and in food found what little comfort there was to be had if she ate like this all the time marveled kat the svelte svanhild would be the size of a barn by the time she was fifty unless she was one of those people who just never got fat looking sidelong out of her eyes at the vinlander kat decided this probably wasnt the case svanhild had a perfect northern complexion creamywhite with blossoming roses in her cheeks but there was already a hint of a second chin well thought kat uncharitably and just a touch enviously most men would be far too distracted by the magnificent and wellexposed frontage to notice that kat wondered what conversational gambit to try next her grandfather was deep in animated conversation about hunting with their male guests svanhilds brothers gulta and bjarni they were as blond as their sister and considerably larger not that svanhild was any midget they were partners in her fathers enterprise it behooved her as a good venetian hostess to talk to the womenfolk only what did one say to someone who answered your comments with ja or nu and continued to eat as if there were a famine coming do you like venetian food asked kat watching svanhild mopping the last droplets of mostarda di cremona on her platter with a slab of ciabatta the piece of prosciuttostuffed capon breast was long gone svanhild smiled nu kat was about to give up when svanhild at last volunteered something i like more cream ja oh we dont use cream much in venice there are not many cows on the islands svanhild swallowed the last mouthful not many young men either nu kat couldnt tell if that was relief or if the beautiful svanhild was upset by the lack well a lot of the young case vecchie usually go off to the trading posts of the republic they say venice lives on the patience of her women a lot of the men are at sea or away sometimes for years even those who are married i am supposed to make a marriage mama sent me with my brothers to europe for that purpose it was said so blandly that kat still had no idea whether she was in favor of the idea or not er any suitors svanhild shrugged none that are noble enough for mama ja mama wants a nobleman for me do you like any of them nu a pause are there desserts chapter manfred and his fellowconfrere erik hakkonsen made as much noise invading francescas boudoir or what passed for a boudoir here in the frozen and barbaric northlands as a small army then again between the two of them they were a small army the danish escort who had been cooling their heels here every day awaiting their return looked quite alarmed at their appearance and francesca didnt think that was entirely because of how battered they were she was pleased to see them though charles fredrik would be even more pleased the one thing that this room had was privacy even if it was cold enough that she could see her breath except when she was right on top of the fire and a lot of furs most of which were piled on top and around her in a kind of luxurious nest that francesca was loath to leavewhich was why she hadnt leapt to her feet to greet the emperors secondary heir as she probably should have still manfred was not the kind to stand on ceremony neither was erik instead francesca looked up tolerantly at the two men who were very much worse for wear than they had been when she last saw them then wrinkled her fineboned nose you stink and thats a thick lip and pair of black eyes you have there erik how did you get those they were unshaven and filthy and she shuddered to think of how many fleas manfred alone was providing a haven for she was not exaggerating when she told them that they stank in fact they reeked of sweat of rancid grease and something musky and animal clearly they had come straight here the moment they arrived within the walls of the fortresscumpalace complex whatever had detained them had been physically hazardous it seemed she could well believe it the norwegian town of telemark was some considerable distance inland from the sea the countryside was steep cold snowywhich was to say so far as francesca was concerned barbarous in all respects shed been born and raised in the aquitaine and spent most of her adult life on the sunny coasts of the mediterranean erik looked balefully at her id rather not talk about it manfred guffawed ill tell you for a consideration darling no you wont said erik immediately somehow francesca doubted shed be getting that story well ive brought a fair number of sleighs here at your royal uncles command she gestured at the wellarmed but nervous looking danes the emperor wants you back in mainz immediately is your business here done manfred grimaced it is although we had to agree to slightly modified terms give us a few moments to bid a farewell to queen borgny and herahconsort and we can get the hell out of norway its a nice country for bears theyre welcome to it said erik feeling his nose gingerly francesca nodded i saw some of the norsemen dragging a bear carcass earlier a big brute both knights laughed and she wondered why did it have anything to do with eriks black eyes or something else you can say that again said manfred where do you think well find the queen and that turk of hers erik erik gestured at the hall behind them back in her rooms in the palace by now i should think he said francesca stuck an enquiring nose out of her sables i thought this kingdom was ruled by a king vortenbras she didnt just think that it had beenbut apparently had was the operative term getting to the bottom of this was imperative enough to tempt her out of her furs erik laughed not any more you might say thats what weve been involved in although most of the time it just felt like we were trying to stay alive come on manfred well not introduce francesca to the queen there are enough clever women in this world without getting two of them together and the knights will be as glad to go as we are time they got back to sweden anyway francesca snuggled her toes down against the stillwarm brick at her feet from that i conclude the knights feel even one clever woman is too many but she had no real desire herself to emerge from her warm cocoon to meet this other clever woman the norse hall might be warm but going there would mean moving out of this nest still before we leave anyway nothing official but if shes clever shell already know about me just what did go on up there anyway she couldnt help but notice that neither manfred nor the icy erik showed any signs of romantic attachment to this woman that was a bit of a relief since that would be a complication they didnt need she wondered briefly just what a turk was doing here with a norse queen but thered be time for the story somewhere warmer say italy or even as shed been thinking lately alexandria shed had several very interesting discussions with a danish scholar about that city and that fit in very nicely with the emperors plans after all she was first and foremost the emperors servant and she never ever forgot it she couldnt afford to and neither if he was wise could manfred jerusalem manfred nearly fell off the bed in shock it was especially for these parts a very luxurious bed it was certainly one he was very glad to be in after all hed been through especially since it contained francesca youre not serious dear do go on with your massage manfred said francesca languorously turning slightly and giving him a view of her magnificent breasts he felt his blood heating up a little more just as well considering how cold hed been over the past several weeks hed been wondering if he would ever feel warm again i will say that the one good thing about all that drilling and training that erik insists on is that it gives you very strong hands youre the only man i have ever met with strong enough hands to give me a really relaxing massage she twinkled at him and you do want me relaxed dont you dear it gives me such a lot of energy manfred went back to his task but his mind was not distracted from her comment whats this about my going to jerusalem for charles fredrik francesca ran a hand down his hairy naked thigh nerves hed thought frozen numb for the duration became most delightfully alive again forget that i said it darling it just slipped out manfred raised his eyes to heaven but like a terrier onto a rat he stuck to his questions rather admirably he thought considering the distractions why jerusalem francesca i mean it has got to be an improvement on norway at this time of year butwell i thought id be involved in setting the knots to rights im only a confrere for another year and theres still a lot to do i think youve started the ball rolling she said playfully nearly distracting the terrier not quite but nearly never make the mistake of thinking others cannot do the job if not quite as you would possibly just as well he grinned they dont have my hands darling or erik to make theirs as strong now tell theres more to this isnt there politics francesca gave him a look of deepest innocence from under halflowered lashes spoiled only by a throaty chuckle how could you suspect that the emperor is an old man he feels his age he would like for the sake of his soul to undertake a pilgrimage to jerusalem himself but the emperors health besides his dislike of leaving mainz tch dont interrupt while i am betraying confidences manfred dear she tapped his lips with one long finger his health and the running of an empire do not allow him to take the six months or a year necessary to go to jerusalem but as age creeps up on him he would like to prepare his soul for the inevitable as would any man above a certain age manfred snorted the ilkhan do keep a substantial presence in jerusalem he stated and was rewarded by her sly little grin which told him he had struck dead in the black well politics then not his favorite task but he wouldnt be the one engaged in it he wasnt nearly crafty enough to deal with the mongols the swedes and danes were about at his level if he hadnt had francesca the italians would have had him raw on toast even with her help they nearly had anyway who is going to accompany me trolliger or brunswick francesca rolled over exposing a front draped only in the sheerest bits of lace and silk certainly not designed to conceal eberhard of brunswick but i do believe your uncle does want to make his peace with god and that he is feeling his age and lets not talk boring business right now unless you want to of course she cocked her head slightly lowering her long lashes and ran an elegant finger down his torso reviving still more nerves argh he sighed as a gloomy thought occurred to him i dont want to leave you for a year francesca not that there wouldnt be plenty of distractions in the sophisticated and ancient as well as holy city of jerusalem not to mention the other delightful metropolises along the way but they wouldnt be francesca she pulled him closer and began to do very distracting things indeed who said anything about leaving me behind you want to come with me he was startled enough to be distracted from her distraction but why had he thought shed want to be left behind why had he thought that his uncle would allow her to remain behind she was after all first and foremost the emperors trusted servant and he would be wise never to forget that still she was also francesca thats wonderful well it is warmer there is it not it was only later much later on the verge of sleep that it occurred to manfred that francesca did not betray confidences and she didnt let things slip out hed been very skillfully manipulated very skillfully indeed well it had been more fun than being told and even if he doubted that charles fredrik really needed any praying for another ten years jerusalem would still be interestingand much more pleasant to visit with francesca for company and if she was the emperors trusted servant well so was he she was wise enough to remember that even when he was distracted wise enough for both of them the thought gave him immense comfort chapter kat says i should have a talk with you said marco plainly uncomfortable benito put his hands on his hips he could read the signs big brother time he thought silently he wished marco would pick some other time for it he wasnt exactly hungover just blurry what is it he snarled marco frowned ever so faintly all right so it was a sulky tone he didnt need lectures from marco and even less from kat butter wouldnt melt in her mouth these daysbut shed been a nightbird a smuggler once moving very gray cargoes of magical supplies and unless benito misread the signs by the vacantspacetolet smile his brother wore these days she hadnt waited for the marriage banns to share marcos bed right now marco was not going to listen to a litany of kats past sins kats worried about you benito and so am i benito could tell by the set of marcos shoulders that his older brother wasnt enjoying this he also knew marco well enough to know that when marco had decided that something must be done it would be done still benito didnt enjoy this sort of thing either and he was damned if hed make it too easy for marco well stop worrying marco im grown up enough to look after myself im the one who usually ends up looking after you remember or do i need to remind you of your little escapade with the love letters to angelina that got you into such a mess in the jesolo marshes marco winced that was then im older and wiser now benito cocked an ear upstairs somewhere he could hear angelinas shrill voice berating a servant for something despite the fact that she was supposedly staying in one of the dorma villas on the mainland angelina was forever finding some excuse to come back to venice to the casa dorma and heaven knows youve paid for it marco what news on the annulment perhaps he could head marco off the lecture on his way of life marco looked gloomy shes balking about which convent and which order again i really dont think she wants to go to one i feel sorry for her shes not really suited to a contemplative life but marco was obviously determined not to lose track but i want to talk about you not my troubles you cant go on like this benito privately benito thought angelina would be better suited to a brothel than a cloister but saying that would offend marco marco was a sympathetic soul benito didnt like to offend him unnecessarily he was very fond of his brother it would also probably also offend petro dorma who was the doge and their protector as well as angelinas brother petro was not a sympathetic soul or wise to offend although these days benito was often tempted anything to get out of here like what brother marco shrugged helplessly the parties the women the drunkenness the fights benito shrugged in return the way i live my life is no concern of yours marco or of kats leave me alone marco responded by putting an arm over benitos shoulders youve got to get over her brother she had a right to make her own choices maria wasnt ever the kind of person you could force to do anything benito shrugged off the arm shes just a woman like all other women marco stepped back and this time he had more than a mere suggestion of a frown benito thats got to be about the dumbest thing you have ever said and youve said some really ahem the servant at the doorway coughed milor milord dorma wants to see you in his office immediately he left the two brothers still glaring at each other who did he mean said benito finally probably you said marco curtly kat and i are not the only ones to hear about your stupid escapades especially last nights stunt well id better come along and put in a good word for you benito tried to remember the details of last night truth to tell he couldnt he wondered what the hell he had done he certainly wasnt prepared to ask marco i dont need your help he said sullenly setting off up the passage when petro issued this sort of summons nobody but nobody actually dawdled it was a bit of a mystery to benito the head of the casa dorma was plumpish balding and goodnatured so how come everybody jumped when he said frog im coming anyway said marco his long strides easily catching up with his shorter brother we valdosta stick together besides he may want me not you ha but it was mildly said the valdosta brothers did stick together for many years theyd had no one and nothing else marcos loyalty touched him as nothing else and when they walked into petro dormas office and benito saw angelina already there looking ready for a fivestar tantrum he realized his brother might actually be the one who needed help this time petro had been calling for marco after all the doge looked at him with a mixture of irritation and surprise what are you doing here benito arent you are supposed to be at dancing classes or something best to dodge that one he was in fact supposed to be at an elocution and poetry class that dormas mother insisted he take to get rid of that workingclass accent neither poetry nor dandified dottori from the accademia nor a desire to speak like the case vecchie motivated him besides hed been sleeping off last night came to support marco he said stoutly hes my brother after all and grandfather said i was to look after him that was true enough and when your grandfather was duke enrico delleste one of venices greatest allies it carried influence even if benito had not spent much time with the old man since hed been eight years old humph stay then even though this really has nothing to do with you dorma tapped the inlaid desk in front of him this is a document of the annulment of your marriage from the grand metropolitan in rome you will both sign it now angelina i have arranged for you to take up the novitiate in the carmelite sisterhood with the cloister of santa lucia della monte outside verona your escort will leave with you before terce bell he said it like he meant it he said it in a way that petro dorma angelinas indulgent brother had never spoken before benito blinked what squawked angelina rage flying banners in her cheeks i wont you agreed to said petro calmly but implacably id keep my mouth shut if i were you angelina benito thought warily or he might send you to some pauline sisterhood in sweden angelina pinched her lips ive changed my mind i dont want to be a nun and certainly not in the backcountry i dont want angelina to do something that she doesnt want to either said marco though his eyes spoke volumes of despair benito raised his eyes that idiot brother of his his own marriage and happiness in the balance and he worried about this selfish spoiled brat petro turned to face marco and benito marco this is no longer a matter of what you or angelina want it is a matter of pledges and honor the honor of the dormas and the honor of the delleste i have promised your grandfather that i will see you married with all due pomp and ceremony in the doges palace within three months this is not an optionnot for you not for angelina marco blinked and petro turned to benito benito see that he signs that paper you invoked your grandfathers name see that his will is done he can sign anything he pleases snapped angelina im not going to id rather stay in town as the doges sister marco might be worth absolutely nothing as a husband but hes mine ive decided petro stood up he was not very tall he was definitely plump he still dominated the room he picked up a scroll of parchment from the desk and handed it to her sworn affidavits about your participation in the black lotos trade angelinas blossoming cheeks went white its its not true she tried to tear the parchment in two the vellum resisted the signori di notte and the council of ten also have copies petro said grimly he picked up a second scroll this is a warrant for your arrest benito watching his brother saw marco take a deep breath with deliberate intent benito stamped on his brothers toes hard having got marcos attention he shook his head fiercely angelina began to produce the beginnings of tears she wept as benito had reason to know very prettily there was an artful hint of a sob in her voice you wouldnt dare let them do this to me you control the signori di notte and the council besides mother wont let you petro dorma shook his head i would prefer you to go to a convent far from here verona is not as far off as id like the truth to tell i have been considering spain but i cannot be seen to be partisan the people of venice will accept your exile or your imprisonment and nod and forgive me as a slightly foolish brother they wont accept my condoning your actions and you forget our mother was addicted to that same drug marco was not going to listen to benito petro the head of the house dorma turned on him stay out of this valdosta shes my sister and only your wife by my insistence to give the baby legitimacy besides i have agreed with duke enrico to send you off to ferrara today under armed guard if you dont do this my way now angelina sign this tears abandoned as a weapon that no longer served cheeks white with anger angelina valdosta stepped forward snatched up a quill and signed good said petro you have until terce i suggest you spend the time saying farewell to our mother id say you should spend it with your child but i know you have not been into her nursery since you arrived in venice three days ago i didnt want her snapped the beauty petro dorma smiled wryly we do so we will keep her goodbye angelina he stepped out from behind his desk his arms beginning to reach for her she evaded them i hate you marco stepped forward too angelina and you too youre so boring she turned on her heel and stormed out marco turned to follow but benito grabbed his sleeve petro took the other im sorry marco said the head of casa dorma with more sympathy than benito had expected he had to wonder if petro wished hed had marco as a brother rather than angelina as a sister stay there are still things i need to say and i need your signature on that document before angelina can go to that convent i dont think i should sign said marco seriously i made my promises petro shook his head benito noticed that there was a tear trickling down the mans face i love her very much marco shell always be my little sister we spoiled her after papas death mother and i and perhaps that is why things turned out this way but there are two reasons both compelling why this is the best thing for her first she has been experimenting with black lotos herself shes been spending time over at the estate of a sister of count badoero the council of ten have spies watching it the badoero house suffered what should have been punitive financial losses when their attack on venice failed yet there is money and lavish entertainment at contessa mirafioros estate again badoero himself is dead but the trade he set up in that narcotic continues and my sister is in the thick of it marcos mouth opened then closed again he looked as if hed like to deny it he also looked as though he knew that he couldnt petro rubbed his eyes with a weary hand angelina was drawn into the wild set the contessa cultivates she is implicated in bringing some of the drug here to venice we both know how addictive lotos is the sisters are healers and specifically are skilled in the rehabilitation of addicts it really is the best thing we can do for her besides there is a large force of schiopettieri going to raid the mirafioro estate soon i really dont want her taken or possibly injured theres only so much that even i can keep quiet marco bit his lip i cant believe shed use the stuffafter your mother and the difficulty weve had weaning her off it i should think anyone with two eyes in her head would know better petro shook his head it does seem insane doesnt it but angelina always believed she was special different from other people superior maybe and immune to their problemsdespite her pregnancy proving that there was one thing she wasnt immune to besides it is a popular myth among those who buy and sell the stuff that the addictiveness is totally exaggerated and she was always readier to believe the people she wished to emulate than she was to believe people who love her he turned to his desk again and picked up another document there is another reason angelina has her ear to the network of gossips and rumor i wanted her away in isolation before news of this one reached her ears the document bore the seal of ferrara word from your grandfather caesare aldanto has been seen in constantinople benito went cold and quite sober trust the devil to save his own im going to constantinople then said benito ive got unfinished business there petro shook his head and once again it was in that implacable manner that warned of dire and inescapable consequences if his will was ignored you are not and for two reasons first after caesare had seen the emperor alexius he reembarked on a ship bound most likely for odessa so he is no longer in constantinople for you to find and for a second reason both the council of ten and your grandfather have placed considerable prices on his head we have more competent assassins in our pay than you would be and in this case we will not hesitate to use them benito looked mulish i know his ways how he operates they dont that may be true said petro calmly but he is not where you can find him now and what is more even if you could there is no reason to believe that he is not contaminated think benito there are only two sorts of power that could have saved him from his fateand of the two it was not likely the angels furthermore where he has gone to you are at a huge disadvantage the grand duchy of lithuania would eat you alive benito what has this got to do with angelina asked marco petro raised his eyebrows we know how aldanto works how he uses women and he looked pointedly at the two boys intermediaries angelina still claims he was wrongfully accused and refuses to accept he was in any way responsible for the attack on the republic just by being part of casa dorma she is privy to a great deal of information that the enemies of venice would appreciate i love my sister and no matter what she is and has become i will continue to love her but i know her weaknesses now and i love and have a duty to the people and the republic of venice too what i am doing here is the best for both of them marco bit his lip and then he stepped up to the desk took up the quill dabbed it in the ink and signed ill go up and try to see her now i still feel shes getting a very poor choice in all of this he said sadness tingeing his voice benito raised his eyes to heaven again he loved marco dearly but here marco had just received the freedom to marry the girl of his dreams had his mistakes corrected and he was worrying about the cause of those troubles no doubt hed be worrying about aldanto next well if caesare aldanto ever came within benitos reach benito would make sure his former idol was very dead theyd been used and the worst was theyd been grateful to be used by the traitor and murderer and he owed aldanto for marias account too he turned to follow his brother petro put a heavy hand on his shoulder i want to talk to you too benito seeing as youre here he led benito to the mullioned windows of his study they could see out along the quays busy with canal boats and lighters to the forest of masts of the ships at anchor in the bacino san marco benito knew it was the merchantprinces favorite view but instead petro pointed to the quayside to a solitary man lying in squalor against a bollard i know that man he used to be good boatswain made a pretty penny or two out of various colleganzas he should be comfortable welloff and happy so benito replied though he had a good idea what was coming sir he added belatedly petro sighed he cant find a job even when ships are desperate for crew if he doesnt drink he shakes and hallucinates hell do absolutely anything for another glass of wine he doesnt care how bad the wine is just so long as it is wine we dont like to admit it but too much wine can be as bad as black lotos it just takes a bit longer are you going to turn out like that old soak because it can happen to you too like my sister you are not immune youre behaving just like her at the moment nothing petro could have chosen to say would have made more of an impression than that last line for the second time that day benito felt something hit him with a distinct sense of shock hit him in a way that made him grow very cold for a moment finally benito shook his head petro patted the shoulder good because i dont think youd fit into a monastery any better than angelina is going to enjoy that convent id drive em all mad sir dorma managed a smile im far more inclined to send you out to factor in one of dormas trading posts outremer now that spring is coming than keep you here or send you to a monastery ive told mother that im wasting my time trying to make you into a case vecchie gentleman besides i think the valdosta and the casa dorma would lose something of value if they tried to cut and polish you its like trying to make a stiletto out of a perfectly good battleaxe more like a rapier out of a cabbage said benito gloomily but the truth to tell petro i really want to get out of here i dont care where to but out of venice and out of this education it doesnt suit me and i dont suit it petro sat himself down again very well after your brothers wedding and only if you learn to pull in your horns a bit ive no objection to some wild oats but it was only your status as my ward and something of a hero in the last attack on venice that kept you out of jail last night and you know venice theres only so long that you can trade on that before they start treating you exactly as you deserve benito nodded he really had to find out just what hed done last night ive always had a fancy for negroponte petro gave a snort of laughter benito you are to subtle maneuvering what a randy stallion is to subtle seduction if you asked for golden horn petro might smell a rat eh but negroponte is close enough to constantinople not a chance benito not a chance benito grinned in spite of feeling somewhere in the bottom of his stomach that his world was not right and probably never would be again it works on other people petro the head of the casa dorma smiled back he looked younger nicer less like the doge but not on me now go and try to stay out of trouble and pretend to be learning to be a good young case vecchie for my mothers sake she has enough to bear with angelina being taken away you can speak like a gentleman when you wish to do so part iii february ad chapter the forests of istria were dripping and bleak the mists seemed to hang heavy and cold around the trees that matched marias mood fairly well she was big bellied and uncomfortable what she really wanted was someone to have a good fight with a good flingplatesandbreakthings fight in that respect her husband umberto was hopeless for starters he was always off marking trees or accompanying the foresters the life out here didnt suit him but he was a fiercely conscientious man hed far rather have been in the dockyards in the arsenal back in venice this however was where he had been sent and after the affair with the previous chief forester he did his best to keep going out with the tree patrols at least he had listened to heror if he hadnt done so consciously some of her insistence that he look into the peccadilloes of those under him had unearthed the culprits still running the timberscam she tried not to be too irritated with him even so he insisted on thinking of it purely in terms of timber being sent away from venice rather than timber being sold tothe enemies of venice sometimes his focus was so narrow so parochial it made her want to scream and never mind that not all that long ago her focus had been entirely on running her cargoes and not enquiring too closely about where they were from or where they were going on being dazzled by a pair of blue eyes and not asking what was going on in the head that housed them well that had changed if only umberto had learned the same lesson at least he was on to the cheaters now and he was off every day trying to match his city strides with the long paces that the foresters took and sneezing a lot she envied him envied his long hikes through the forest envied that he got out of the house every day into the open beyond the four confining walls to her surprise shed found that the openness space and silences felt welcoming umberto complained of missing the people and the sounds of the city she enjoyed their absence in the first day here she had learned all that despite the fact that things had been quite chaotic to get out under those old quiet trees had been a pleasure she would never have anticipated so far as she was concerned all that had happened was that shed had a lovely walk and solved half the timber problemsand yes gotten a little lost and gotten home a little late but that was hardly anything to worry about umbertod almost had the baby for her to judge by the performance he had given when she came back at last and unfortunately she was no longer the sole arbiter of what she did she was a wife now and half of a couple and it behooved her not to send her husband into a state of panicthe resultwith her delicate condition in mind was being confined to the house and yard with an elderly foresters widow as a combination between houseservant and guard not that she was in any real sense a prisoner no she was just confined by chains of care and umbertos ideas of how it all should be and the proper arrangement of the universe women had their place it was a pampered and protected onewell as pampered as a caulkers wife ever got anyway it didnt include being out on the canals at midnight running graycargo nor traipsing about the woods like a forester it all chafed at marias soul she was used to her independence she was used to defining for herself what she would and wouldnt do and if her mother had plied her own boat until the very day of marias own birth why should she now be stuck within four walls tending to the housework as if she hadnt a care except that the floor be clean enough for that matter her world was so much wider now the last yearno one who had lived through what she had could be unchanged shed come up against challenges she would never have dreamed of and beaten them and if shed chosen to marry rather than try to raise a baby on her own well it was for the babys sake she certainly wouldnt have done it for her own so shed taken the husband that she thought would best love her baby no matter who the father was and now she found herself powerless to fight the trammels of umbertos gentle care she didnt even know how to start dealing with his hurt expressions when she didnt fit in with his expectations how did you fight this she really could use a good screaming fight issie the blackclad foresters widow who was supposed to help her tugged at her arm why dont you sit down dearie and rest your feet youll get little enough rest when the baby is born maria looked out into the black bare trees ignoring issie umberto was out there now trying to select good timbers for masts and keels when what he knew about was cladding the caulkers back in venice were undoubtedly going to be grateful for the improvement in the quality of deck planking maria was however sure that hed be getting more letters of complaint from the masters of the carpenters guild at least he got regular letters from venice it was more than she ever did she sighed it wasnt as if reading came that easily true shed spent more time working on it since they arrived here but there werent many people back home who could write in the first place she only ever seemed to get letters from kat letters full of marco letters from a life shed chosen to leave behind to try to forget benito was always carefully not mentioned the second reason maria found it difficult to pick a good fight with umberto was straight guilt hed married her loved her enough to take what fellow venetians would have called spoiled goods she had taken his offer not because she felt any deep affection for the balding slightly worried looking grayhaired man but because she needed a father for the child she had grown up without that social protection and she would not inflict it on her baby lately shed come to realize that umbertos affections had been transferred to her from his love of her mother her mother well she should have expected that even as a tiny child she had known that umberto followed her mother with his eyes every single time she was anywhere around the docks where the caulkers worked the older man had plainly been crazy about her he had even called maria by her name a couple of times by accident how could she start a good fight with someone who was still in love with her dead mother at least she wasnt in love with umberto herself if this was hard trying to rival the memory of her dead mother and win over someone she loved would be even harder maria sighed again she leaned heavily on the broom and some of the birch twigs cracked outside the chief foresters house the rain fell in heavy sheets once upon a time all shed wanted was a house that was warm and dry now she was almost tempted to go out in the rain it hadnt melted her in all those years of sculling her gondola through the wet winter canals of venice housekeeping cooking and preparing baby clothes did not fill up the day let alone her mind true being warm was good and so was being well fed but being cooped up being a good wife even a good pregnant wife was going to drive her crazy even if the final stages of this pregnancy were beginning to leave her feeling permanently exhausted really why dont you have a little rest dear clucked issie again maria swept irritably shed been just about ready to do that now she wouldnt the jingle of a horses harness was a welcome distraction ignoring the rain ignoring issies squawks of alarm maria ran out to the messenger who was wearing wet venetian republic livery it must be something important to bring the man out here in this weather the messengers of the republic were supposed to conduct their business with the utmost dispatch true but out here this far from the authorities in venice that meant when it wasnt raining the forests of istria were vital to the shipbuilding in the arsenal but they were also a long way from the messengers capi back in venice she was drenched the moment she stepped foot outside the door of course and she didnt give a damn of course this wasnt the canal she wasnt the same maria who hadnt but two dry skirts to her name there were several warm outfits inside that house that she could change right back into when she got inside issie could spread this one on chairs in front of the fireit would give the old cow something to do maria struggled with the buckle on the wet leather pouch ignoring the shivering messenger who was trying to tether his horse with numb fingers can you help me he asked finally maria looked up from her task with annoyance take yourself and your horse into the stable you fool are you not bright enough to get in out of the rain a smothered snort from the messenger suddenly drew her attention to the fact that she was apparently not bright enough to get in out of the rain she got the pouch off the saddle and retreated into the house issie clucking like a wet hen handed her a rough towel maria had no time for it now the fussing about while she was trying to get to the message in the pouch would drive her insane go get the messenger a drink she snapped hes wet through im just a little damp issie sniffed irritably hes not pregnant but she went anyway the pouch buckle finally surrendered to a superior will there was only one waxsealed missive inside the seal was that of the house dorma the doges house and not the familiar crest of the montescue it was addressed to her and not to the chief forester of istria oh blessed jesu maria tore at it with trembling fingers no one would send a special messenger to the wife of a forester unless it was horrible news the worst of all possible news no one from dorma would send me news by a special messenger it must be from marco it could only mean benito had been killed why hadnt she inside was kats familiar handwriting it started with the words glad news maria sat down with a thump on a hard oak settle and composed herself with a deep breath she patted her bulging stomach to still the flutters just under the skin if katerina only knew how close she came to causing your premature birth child she muttered blinking to clear her eyes before reading further ive got marco to use the dorma seal so this will get to you as soon as possible wrote kat fantastic wonderful things have happened that seal could indeed achieve great things it had nearly achieved an early baby thought maria wryly she read on learning of the vinlanders who would restore the fortunes of montescue of the annulment of marcos marriage to angelina and angelinas hasty internment in the cloister at santa lucia della monte outside verona it seemed that this had been a very busy week she tried not to think how busy she would have been had she been there how in the thick of it all shed be poling kat about of course and maybe helping her a little with the vinlanders and she wouldnt be getting the news of the wedding plans at secondhand like this petro dorma insists it is to be a great state function marco and i have had to agree on conditions first i want you to come and support me on that day second francesca de chevreuse will be returning to venice she is to be my other matron of honor dorma says he will make arrangements for you and umberto to return to venice for the occasion she had to read that twice and then a third time before it began to make sense and when it did maria could only laugh helplessly the flower of the house montescue and the heir of the house valdosta grandson of the duke of ferrara with a caulkers wife and one of venices most famous courtesans as her attendants to the altar well she could hardly refuse kat after all had come to her lowkey caulkers wedding in the same role but it would mean returning to venice returningshe looked at the date of the weddingreturning with a threeweekold baby if everything ran to time the back door banged and her head came up if it was issie a sneeze not issie umberto he came through to the front parlor maria took in the wetplastered gray hair and the faint bluish tinge to her mans lips he smiled caressingly at her and a wave of affection swept through her her man might have his faults and his rigidities but he was a good one people might become exasperated with umberto verrier but you couldnt really dislike him he was too mild a soul to engender anything so active as dislike and he was such a good husband a conscientious one at least he was shivering slightly and she beckoned to him smiling umberto come over to the fire before ice forms on your poor nose he did holding his thin hands out to crackling flames there is a message from venice one of the foresters said he saw a messenger in the doges livery coming across shed pulled a chair up for him by this time handed him the towel issie had been trying to press on her it was for me dear a letter from katerina montescue the lady who was my maid of honor at our wedding she is to marry marco valdosta you know the dogeelects ward in a great state ceremony in the early spring its all finally been sorted out and settled at last umberto looked at her wonderingly i have never understood how you came to know such a one the casa montescue she is a great lady i dont dare tell you how i know kat thought maria it was no tale to chance spreading about among all these foresters especially as issie had come in with a goblet of hot spiced honeyed wine her lined face alive with curiosity shed have it all over istria before tomorrow night the new chief foresters wife blessed jesu shes worse than we could have thought a smuggler poling her own canal boat and no better than she should be no doubt well the wine might be just an excuse to find out what was happening but maria was grateful umberto was in need of it there was more to it than just telling me that the wedding has been set or she wouldnt have needed a messenger she has asked that weyou and igo back to venice for the wedding she has arranged with petro dorma to make it possible umberto sipped some of the hot wine well it would be nice i have been thinking how i would like to go to town it would be very good to see people again perhaps to ask if i might take a post closer to the city but what about the he hesitated the baby maria patted her stomach baby should be born by then it had better be katerina has asked me to be one of her matrons of honor the goblet crashed to the floor neither issie nor umberto seemed to notice chapter youre not that old protested manfred for the fifth time the emperor smiled wryly thank you nevertheless i still want you to do it you will pray for my soul in jerusalem it needs it believe me and it wouldnt do you any harm to do some thinking about your own mortality erik looked at the emperors nephew manfred was trying to keep a straight face he glanced at charles fredrik and realized that the emperor understood the humor in this too erik could see the similarity between the two men in the facial lines of course manfred was bigger and had a darker celtic complexion but the family likeness was definitely thereand went deeper than appearances he could readily believe looking at the emperor that there were some sins worth praying about charles fredrik shook his head ruefully when i was your age i didnt believe in my own mortality either just do it manfred humor me im an old man i know that both in venice and now in norway the chances of you being killed or injured were remarkably good neither luck nor erik is going to stop everything so im putting in a formal request to the abbotgeneral of the knights of the holy trinity to furnish you with an escort of knights he has already acceded to my request that you go on a pilgrimage to the holy land for me while you are still in the holy order i dont think he will refuse this either you will be invested both of you as knightproctors and given discretionary command over the knights assigned to accompany you to assist you im sending my old friend and mentor eberhard of brunswick with you manfred rolled his eyes to instruct me in statecraft no doubt uncle this pilgrimage is going to be a real penance after all the emperor covered a smile with his hand yes poor eberhard is expecting to find it that for a certainty now francesca stay with me a while i would like to talk to you without that young idiot interrupting me go on you two ill want to talk to you as well erik but not tonight i think erik and manfred had little choice but to leave francesca waved as she walked over to stand beside the emperor did you see that said manfred fuming one minute hes dying and wanting me to pray for his soul the next hes stealing my girl shes scarcely a girl said erik latching onto the one safe point in the entire argument the disapproving look brought a grin to manfred among the things i can promise you she definitely isnt a boy or have you forgotten a certain night in a certain brothel francesca says youre the biggest stiff thing shes ever had between her legs your whole body was rigid with shock erik fumbled for something to say and failed the memory of the first time theyd met francesca fleeing from an ambush still embarrassed him theyd been ambushed in a brothel in which she was employed at the time and shed agreed to hide themby using the expedient device of hiding them in plain sight engaged in the sort of activity anyone would expect to see in a brothel erik himself mortified had faked his part of the thing manfred had not which was perhaps why manfred reveled in the memory its old age thats your problem memorys going first never mind ill get francesca to refresh the picture just some millefiori beads as i recall all she was wearing manfred you know thats not what i meant erik wondered just how he should deal with this have you no morals at all i meant shes a woman not a girl manfred snorted only you icelanders seem to worry about it vinlanders take it even more seriously its just not respectful manfred went off into a guffaw well thats something considering her former profession erik found himself blushing as usual confused by what his response should be to the former whore then courtesan now a princes mistress his conservative upbringing said he should treat her with disdain yet francesca he knew from experience lived by a rigid moral code too it just had a totally different set of rules about sex he decided to take refuge in something he was familiar and comfortable with come youre getting fat manfred lets go down to the jousting yard erik its snowing out there besides i know you just want to take it out on me there was some truth to that even if as the years went by taking it out on manfred was getting a great deal harder to do but at the new rapierwork erik still had the edge and always would have he was just faster than manfred could ever be then we will find a salle big enough for some more fencing practice come i have the quilted jackets in my quarters id rather go drinking protested manfred erik threw him against the wall with a rolling hiplock francesca looked severely at the emperor using me to tease your nephew is not kind charles fredrik smiled its one of the few pleasures left to an old man the smile widened and by now erik will have talked him into some training and will administer some bruises which his disrespect deserves you are a very bad old man she said shaking her head at the most powerful man in europe the first time shed met the emperor shed been quaking inside but when all was said and done he was also a man men she understood this one for all his power was a good man and behind the smiles she read genuine worry hes turning out well you know but he is still very young and very jealous if i were twenty years younger hed have reason to be now tell me francesca what do you intend to do now i am sending manfred to jerusalem but i have a place for you here in mainz youve served me well in denmark much though trolliger disapproves of your methods mind you i dont think he realizes that your methods are more refined than in venice and not horizontal in the least she smiled tolerantly wait until his spies are done reporting to himor until he finishes reading those reports hes already gotten i believe he will be astonished that i have become a veritable pillar of respectability good the emperor replied and sounded as if he meant it i gathered that already unlike trolliger i read the entire reports from my spiesand his by the waynot just the parts i deem are pertinent at the time well i may not be caesars wife she said thoughtfully with a long look through her lashes at the emperor but but you must still be above reproach as my nephews paramour charles fredrik agreed with her though a bit of banter between the two of us in private is harmless enough and in public she twinkled i find finance to be the most fascinating possible topic for discussion he chuckled as she had known he would francesca licked the corner her mouth slowly and catlike so whatever could he find to disapprove of in finance she asked innocently looking at him through lowered lashes she was rewarded with the emperors laughter which went off into coughing it took a while to subside and now he looked older gray and tired though still able to muster a smile dont make me laugh please he said breathlessly its a pity i find little to laugh at these days no wonder the danes were so willing to help you you must have had them wrapped around your littlest finger but what do you intend to do now because i would like to ask that you accompany manfred not for the reasons hed like lucky young dog but for my own interests and yours for that matter i pay well as you know francesca chose her words carefully she was aware just how dangerous these waters were she knew she was tolerated as the mistress to the emperors secondinline heir but more than that no i was planning on accompanying manfred not im afraid for the reasons he thinks but the truth is that mainz is not my sort of town and i fancy seeing the east alexandria tempts me alexandria she was surprised by the enthusiasm in the emperors voice what a place i went there you know as a young prince he sighed a paradise of a town for a young man but there is more to it a place of intellect too more than anywhere else in the world as i know it i regret in my old age that i didnt explore that aspect more i would wager you didnt regret it then true but ill have to tell you about it some other time right now i want to talk to you about eberhard of brunswicks mission to the ilkhan the emperor shook his head if i didnt know you better id have you burned for witchcraft she shrugged it is quite obvious the emperor shook his head again i just hope that grand duke jagiellon is not as intelligent and deviousminded as you are if he isnt hes bound to have someone who is she said the emperor looked thoughtful not necessarily the plots and machinations of jagiellon are not constructed as you or i would construct them youve given a lot of thought to western politics turn your mind now to the east there is a factor at work there you must not forget power in the grand duchy of lithuania is wrested by strength and cunning not just by hereditary right or as in venice by election he held up a hand yes i know there are intrigues and schemes here also but this is the playing of puppies compared to the fight for packdominance there jagiellon dares not allow anyone into his trust he must always act to some extent alone even his closest advisor count mindaug will pull him down if he can and thus is not privy to the innermost workings and plans and secrets that would require trust and a loyalty born of love not fear those are as alien to jagiellon as his kind of absolute enslavement is to us he gains their loyalty by robbing them of their will and their self our most trusted people can betray us his cannot but his cannot think or act independently either those jagiellon allows free thought to must be kept weaker and ignorant we dont have that problem although we do need to fear treachery we must place our trust carefully francesca looked at the emperor in some surprise maybe it really is a pity that you spent so much time in the pleasurepalaces in alexandria the emperor gave a small snort not nearly as much as you might think i learned a great deal about things that my tutors hadnt mentioned while i was there but a fool and his empire are soon parted alexius vi of byzantium is busy proving that and while i or conrad or even manfred might not be the best person for the job as my father said to me when i protested that i didnt really want to be emperor better those who have been trained for it but dont want it than someone who just wants it a man who wants this kind of power does not want the responsibility that goes with it he shrugged nobody would francescas smile was small tight and sympathetic i think most of them would just choose to ignore the responsibilities i think the holy roman empire has been fortunate in its emperor to my sorrow no one of the reasons that i want manfred to pray for my soul is that i know i have failed sometimes francesca too often he said quietly shaking his head and thanks be to the hard lessons i got from eriks father that i can acknowledge this responsibility you know i once said something stupid and arrogant about some peasants hakkon explained that if theyd said the same about me theyd have died and as i couldnt learn if i was dead hed simply made me wish i was dead it gave me an insight the imperial heir had previously lacked he paused lost in reflections francesca waited patiently now to return to the ilkhan i think we can benefit each other of course eberhard of brunswick will be doing the actual negotiation but i would like you to be able to shall we say smooth things over if there are difficulties he smiled this means i will have to trust you which jagiellon would not francesca shook her head so you will have to trust me which jagiellon would not but your majesty neither by the sounds of it would emeric of hungary trust me he is by all accounts a man who would match your image of the grand duke and he is closer too why do you focus on the grand duke charles fredrik sighed it is ill fortune to have two such men on the thrones of powerful neighboring lands but emeric is not threatening us at the moment the emperor smiled grimly i have reliable information that he is turning his attention to the southern balkans being involved in a war down there would be for him what being involved in the wars of italian principalities would be for us there is an illyrian chieftain down there who is giving him considerable pause what manfred shook his head you want me to take a couple of hundred knights with me thats an army uncle thats ridiculous you managed fine in italywith just erik and me escorting you the emperor shook his head i enjoyed that but we were traveling incognito manfred i am afraid that part of the point of this exercise is to travel in the full glare of public view even two hundred menatarms may not be enough manfred thumped a meaty fist on the table when i went to sweden i had seventy and for all the use they were i might as well have had none the emperor glared at him you were within my realms and supposedly protected by my hand the fact that you went off into norway to telemark with just on half of that when i had clearly and expressly told you to take a sufficient escort just proves to me that i have to dictate how many men escort you and i hear from the master of the chapter house at lodose that it was only on his insistence that you even took that many with you accept it manfred ive heard the story from erik your days of being the young happygolucky knight are over even in the knights of the holy trinity where you were supposedly anonymous and protected you were a target they tried to kill you manfred as a way of getting at me the day is fast approaching when theyll try to kill you just because of who you are you wont always have erik there besides you need some command experience the men im going to have sent with you are older tough solid veterans youll be younger than almost all of them less experienced youll spend half your life commanding men with the advantage over you of age and experience learn how to do it now when you dont have to do it in combat manfred groaned bad enough that ive got to put up with old eberhards moralizing and carping now youre saddling me with a bunch of graybeards who are going to spend the entire journey to and from jerusalem complaining about their rheumatism and grumbling how things arent like they used to be when they were young the emperor snorted you will treat eberhard of brunswick with respect manfred learn from him he is a statesman and a truly skilled negotiator one of the best ive always thought that if he hadnt been born a noble hed have been the richest horsetrader in the empire hes a valuable man probably worth as much to the empire as you are if you dont treat him with respect i will curtail your personal allowancewhich i imagine you and francesca would find difficult and as for the quality of the men im sending with you i took erik hakkonsens advice i have asked the knights of the holy trinity to send me a knight by the name of von gherens erik suggested i get him to select the men who will accompany you manfred brightened well thats not so bad von gherens can drink the emperor shook his head and laughed manfred what are we going to do with you i keep hoping francesca and erik have worked miracles and then you give me that sort of comment manfred grinned well i have made some inroads in teaching erik to drink he still does it badly though and ive failed with francesca entirely teaching her to drink properly that is ive had successes in other important areas of course the emperor shook his head again helplessly and im looking forward to visiting venice again some fine red wines those italians produce i hope erik beats you grumbled the emperor and im going to have a word with francesca too so long as you keep to talking said manfred warily chapter eneko lopez stared impassively at the face of the grand metropolitan he did not allow the thoughts roiling in his mind to show he hoped not anyway you obviously made quite an impression on emperor charles fredrik father lopez said the frail paleand powerfulman sitting on the throne before him the grand metropolitan held up a scroll almost as if it were a scepter the grand metropolitan had a reputation for vacillation however he was still the most powerful figure in the church and eneko was never certain how much of that vacillation was because of the holy fathers nature and how much was because in the end when one kept from making up ones mind things tended to sort themselves out without forcing one to take a stand i found the holy roman emperor to be a pleasant enough companion on the road here said eneko dryly a not overly pious man though the grand metropolitan gave a reedy chuckle it appears that he on the other hand did find you to be one it is a signal honor of sorts and quite honestly not a request easily denied god is omnipresent said eneko stiffly he can be addressed as well from mainz as from jerusalem the grand metropolitan gave another reedy chuckle a viewpoint that i am sad that i will not be able to hear you express to the metropolitan of jerusalem none the less it is the express desire of the emperor of the most powerful christian state that you should go to jerusalem to pray for his soul as he as the bastion stone of the christian empire cannot leave his duty to millions of other christian souls merely to indulge the desire of his old age eneko stood in silence he is a powerful friend of the holy church father lopez said the old man mildly eneko sighed i know but your holiness i had hoped the order i wish to found the emperor seemed quite well disposed to the idea the grand metropolitan scowled slightly more so than i have been your problem father eneko is that you have been a valuable tool for the church in your present role i need an agent of your caliber i am less sure that the church needs yet another religious order to create more schisms and infighting but the emperor is indeed welldisposed toward your scheme he goes as far as to suggest a name he seems to think a petrinebased order devoted to holy magic in the active and combative sense would act as a counterweight to the servants of the holy trinity he also thinks that father eneko lopez of the basque country would be a good man to head such an order i must read you his words the old man cleared his throat unfurled the parchment and held the scroll at full arms stretch then began reading from it in a slight singsong i find myself in agreement with your proposal that the hypatian order should open some chapter houses in swabia brunswick and prussia details may be thrashed out between our intermediaries but i would be happy to see as many as twenty of these established in the empires central provinces however one does not use a shovel to do a swords work and vice versa i am of the opinion that the order of saint hypatia in particular and the church in general have lost some of the militant purpose chrysostom imbued it with it has become very gentle and as a result we are seeing enemies springing up who do not scruple to use the darkest of magics against us the empire and the holy church need a force not lacking in some of the gentleness of the hypatian order but with the steel to meet the spiritual and supernatural evils of the northern darkness which threaten the mother church the grand metropolitan paused and peered at eneko over the top of the parchment he then proposes you heading such an order but i read further however i feel father lopez would still benefit from some broadening of his viewpoints before he takes up this challenge therefore my request that he undertakes this pilgrimage to jerusalem can serve a double purpose as one of the most pious men i have met he can pray for my soul which i fear stands in sore need of such intervention visiting the birthplace of our faith and then proceeding to the cradle of our learning alexandria will also broaden his outlook besides such an order as he envisages will need to consult the great library at alexandria extensively as it remains the greatest source and storehouse of arcane knowledge both christian and nonchristian in christendom and if alexandria cannot broaden his outlook then nothing can even the brothels there are an education eneko felt himself redden the grand metropolitan was plainly amused by his embarrassment i think the emperors assessment is very acute he said with a wry smile both of your piety and your need for a broader perspective eneko took a deep breath i have always wanted to undertake the pilgrimage to jerusalem your holiness he said seriously and the second pilgrimage to the heart and birthplace of the order of saint hypatia but the responsibility of another mans soulany mans soul never mind the holy roman emperorsis too much for me the grand metropolitan nodded only christ could carry such a weight he said gently but all that is asked of us is to do as much we can and he has ever promised us that he will help us to bear the rest you may choose some companionssay threeto help you i feel emperor charles fredrik would agree that such broadening of the structure that you envisage will be better if it has a wider foundation as it were now my son i have other interviews come take my blessing and get along with you you and your companions will travel as humble pilgrims to jerusalem and thence alexandria i have prayed on this and i feel you guided to this path it was said with a quiet certainty and deep humility it was also a firm unarguable dismissal when you travel with a small army you have to behave as if you are traveling with a small army muttered manfred irritably we should break this lot up into ten parcels of twenty knights and fit into inns rather than overflowing villages the grizzled and facially scarred von gherens smiled a good idea eh falkenberg we ride with the first twenty and prince manfred rides with the last twenty then he can apologize for all the damage and pay the peasants and put up with short rations because weve eaten all the food and drunk all the beer falkenberg who was riding on the other side of manfred was also a veteran though younger than von gherens and like von gherens manfred had discovered able to drink his weight in ale without showing any sign of it the knights of the holy trinitythe knots in popular slangwere supposed to be a religious order sworn to abstinence from the worldly trappings of wealth in practice manfred discovered that meant they ate and drank well when someone else was paying manfred was finding that being in an outofcombat commandespecially when you have a reputation as a tearaway yourselfwas a lot more difficult than hed thought in a way a miseryguts like sachs was almost called for the presence of someone whod put some fear and sobriety into this lot would keep the reckoning down the emperor had given manfred what he had considered to be an ample supply of gold for the trip at this rate they mightpossiblyget to ascalon hed have to sell them off as mercenaries to get back falkenberg looked at manfred with amusement sounds very good it would make a change from the way it is now the problem was that both of them had been in venice with manfred and erik when they had striven against chernobog the two of them von gherens particularly had been the catalysts whod broken up the fight in san zan degola when erik had refused to hand over the young woman who had claimed sanctuary there to abbot sachs von gherens had been at the final destruction of chernobogs vessel and had been terribly burned there they both liked manfred he knew that they were from northeastern frontier families from the borderlands of the empire where the battle between good and evil was stark and frequent there was no doubting the toughness or the piety of either man there was also no doubting their ability to soak up food and drink when it was available they treated their young commander with a sort of jocular respect and then did precisely what they intended to do no doubt about it in a fight theyd be what they weresuperb soldiers disciplined and ordered so how come they traveled at exactly the pace they intended to travel despite manfreds desire to pick the pace manfred was left feeling he was being tested he wished he could do with the troop what erik did in the daily drill session the icelander put them through they jumped when erik hakkonsen said frog there was always that sort of distance between erik and the rest of the human race and the barrier seemed to work in eriks favor no one not even old notkewho was fiftyfive if he was a daytreated erik as an equal that evening in the smoky room in one of the three crowded inns at brixen manfred turned to erik and eberhard and sighed what the hell do i have to do to get the knights moving i wanted to be through to bozen by now at this rate were going to take twice as long as id intend to get through to venice eberhard looked at him with a frosty eye i was knight of the trinity with your grandfather i had a commander like you once good fighter lousy commander when we werent fighting manfred had never really thought of the old man as a having once been a mere rankandfile knight but always as a prosy and disapproving important old man so milord of brunswick he said in as serious a manner as he had ever donned what should i do lecture them on diplomacy break a few heads said erik looking up from his platter you are too young and too popular eberhard shook his head that might work for you erik you will lead troops you already do that well but manfred is such a babeinarms he still needs them to teach him he will lead armies not troops and what he needs to learn is that you cannot lead armies on your own you need to delegate manfred stared at him in astonishment that was a solution that didnt sound like a good idea on the other hand eberhard had experience delegate to whom i mean wouldnt they just think i was trying to avoid responsibility eberhard gave his wintry smile this is statecraft which your uncle wished me to instruct you in i thought it was a waste of time but if you can see that there is a problem wellperhaps you might learn something after all he cleared his throat it is often a good idea to pick on the worst sources of your troublesand make them responsible if they fail then you must display very clearly that you have not abrogated your responsibilities by taking action against them personally but i dont suppose youll have either the intelligence or maturity to take my advice despite himself manfred knew that his face showed what hed have been likely to do if the old man were not nearly seventy instead he clenched his fists and walked off francesca hes going to drive me mad said manfred later in their chamber he treats me as if i were stupid and ten years old francesca traced his deltoid with a delicate finger hes a very bad old man to tease you so but i think he wants to make sure hes got your attention you think hes doing it on purpose demanded manfred incredulously francesca smiled catlike he is one of the leading diplomats and statesmen of the age manfred dear hes playing you like a lute manfred did not like the idea of being manipulated by anyone much less eberhard the old bastard francesca shook her head in admonition im sure hes only doing it to oblige charles fredrik manfred snorted two can play his game i wont rise to his bait tomorrow morning im going to call falkenberg and von gherens make those two carry the can falkenberg can do the damned accounting thatll stop him eating and drinking for a few minutes which should save us a few pennies anyway good then maybe we can get moving a little faster i had letters while i was in mainz from katerina i said i would do my best to be there for her wedding even if i cannot accede to her request to be a maid of honor francesca smiled wryly but i wouldnt mind being a trifle early to help with the organization von gherens will have to make them trot said manfred languorously leaning toward the caressing fingers chapter the woman didnt stop screaming shed gone beyond the edge of fear and into raw hysteria none of the three people in the room appeared to even notice any more than slaughterhouse workers might notice a bellowing steer jagiellon simply continued to whet the cleaver caesare aldanto stood like a blond puppet that someone had propped against a wall the position his arms were in was not quite natural and would have caused any normal man to alter it before more than a moment had passed aldanto stood as still as a log his empty blue eyes stared unblinking at the altar the shaman simply continued to rub the drumskin and walk in a widdershins circle producing a low murmur of sound that seemed to slice through the screaming the cut when it came did not stop the screaming that brutal chop was not intended to this rite derived much of its power from the suffering of the victim the quodba drum now was a fluttering weakening fast heartbeat perfectly matching that of the woman in the old face the shamans eyes burned with a fierce intensity sweat dripped from his forehead although the room was cold jagiellon showed no such signs of strain neither did caesare who had come forward now to kneel holding the stonecut bowl into which the womans femoral artery pumped jagiellon scryed for his foes in a dark magic built on blood pain and defilement there was a price a terrible price for this clear vision and not just from the victim but the black brain did not care that part of jagiellon was long dead anyway and this was no new ritual being enacted for the first time in the blood that now pumped feebly into the bowl jagiellon saw eneko lopez and a band of companions saw the canals of venice and a canal boat with what could only be a bridal couple abruptly that opaqued only a leonine winged shadow remained the blood bowl cleared showing a new vision eneko lopez again face uplifted at peace standing on the place which is called golgotha there was a high thin sound that pierced the brain like a whitehot needle the bowl shattered blood erupted out of it as if something had exploded within the depths of the bowl splattering everything and everyone within the magic circle the womans screams which had grown weaker and weaker were stilled cut off abruptly silence heavy and chill hung over the scene for a moment no one moved and then the shaman coughed breaking the stasis neither caesare nor jagiellon appeared concerned about being showered in fresh blood but something had plainly affected them there were sweat beads on both foreheads mingling with the splattered blood caesares eyes were wild and mad not dead as they had been moments before very powerful place very powerful man grunted the shaman fastidiously cleaning his drum i know where he is going growled jagiellon the forces of light marshal against us a pilgrimage and he intends to go via venice somehow this ties with the wedding of the other one marco valdosta that joining must be stopped or at least i must stop lopez reaching the marshes where the lion holds sway the shaman nodded and rubbed his shoulder wincing as he did so as if the shoulder was deeply bruised lion is very strong even if the young one is still unskilled he is strong i do not like failure you will keep watch around the lions borderland jagiellon cleaned the cleaver on the victims hair we will consult with count mindaug he has been studying the magics of the west he thinks i am unaware of this maybe he will know of some trap we can set the shaman nodded and the count was sent for as servants cleared the mess away moving with swift and fearful silence as well they might any one of them might be next if they drew attention to themselves until today the dead woman had been a chambermaid the count did indeed have an answer a stray fact plucked out of a grimoire from the ravenna region from the southern margin of the sequence of lagoons and floodlands that had once stretched all the way from there to grado in the north just off the southern margin of the ancient marshlands lay a grove of oak trees the local people would go nowhere near the place local legend said a terrible rite had raised something there something so evil that everyone for miles around found a reason to avoid the spot it was a lonely and not very fertile area anyway full of mosquitoes and malarial fevers it lay not far from the causeway that led to ravenna and then onwards along the coast toward venice i will open the way said jagiellon take a form to travel on land see what if anything lies in this place the shaman nodded and stripped off his jacket with a tinkling of brass bells the old body that lay underneath the leather was also tattooed and considering the age of that lined face the shamans body was in remarkably good shape scrawny yes but sinewy tough under the tattoos the old man blurred into a ferallooking dog with yellow mangy fur and yellow eyes and yellower teeth the dog slipped into the tunnel that jagiellon had made some hours later the shaman returned some old beast of kaos make nest there there are old magics which let it survive it is very strong but nearly mindless it exists just to feed master jagiellons cold eyes seemed to glow ideal it cannot leave that place master it would die no matter said jagiellon we will lead the priest and his companions to the beast before they can reach the marshes if it fails to kill them it may at least drive them back i want him away from venice and marco valdosta there is something about that meeting that i do not like the feel of your birds will continue to watch and follow when lopez moves first babies the wise old midwives all said were hard hard on the mother hard on themselves issie evidently agreed with the wise old midwives of canalside for the closer came the day that maria was due the more horrifying became the tales the old woman dragged out of her memory tales of birthstruggles that lasted for a week of every possible complication of girls that died and babies that died of both that died together and she had the unmitigated gall to bring in all the other foresters wives to regale maria with still more tales of birthhorrors until maria wondered why so many of them had gone through the ordeal not once but six or eight times maria had cause to thank all the saints together that umberto was never around to listen to these stories or if he was around when issie began one of her tales he was so used to ignoring her that he really didnt hear what she was saying as for mariawell issie had been one of the people who had tried to frighten her with stories of ferocious wild beasts in the forest the wild beasts had been no more ferocious than the occasional hare or deer and by this time maria was disinclined to believe any of issies tales that didnt mean she wasnt prepared for a hard go but her own mother had given birth and gone out to deliver a load the next day maria knew that she came of tough stock she wasnt expecting much trouble really she still wasnt expecting much trouble when the first pangs started and the water brokethough that was a shockand issie chased umberto out but then the real pains began and after the first hour maria was vowingbetween groansthat the next man who touched her with sex on his mind was going to draw back a bloody stump after the third hour she knew that it wasnt going to be the stump of his hand after the fifth hour when the pains were continuous wave after wave after wave and her throat was hoarse she couldnt think of anything but the pain there were women milling about everywhere praying out loudwhat were they doing there she hadnt asked them to come the air was hot and stifling her hair and bedgown were absolutely plastered to her with sweat and someone was burning some vile herb in the fireplace and all she could do was bite on the rope theyd given her and tear at the bedclothes and it went on and on and on and that was when she swept into the room she was a tall shape in a dark draped dress and all the praying women fell silent as she raked the room with eyes that gleamed in the firelight out she said and the women the horrible useless women fled before her like chickens before a falcon cackling in panic she flung the windows wide threw something on the fire that chased the stink out with the scent of fir and rosemary and came to the side of the bed she leaned over maria and the silver pentacle gleaming at her throat told maria everything she needed to know strega she gasped but in recognition not condemnation after all none of those women and all of their calling on saints and angels had helped her exactly so the woman smiled and placed a hand on marias forehead then sketched a sign in the air and murmured some words suddenly maria was there but not there detached from her body and all the pain and the mess floating within her own head dreamily watching as the strega helped her out of the bed and got her to walk then rest then walk again a little she was there but she did not care except in the most detached possible way her body strained and hurt but she did not issies friends all huddled fearfully at the door and the strega cast them glances of contempt from time to time but said nothing i should have come to you before she murmured in marias ear but i did not know your time was near did you think that we would leave one who was a friend to us alone with a flock of chattering monkeys in her time no then she made maria squat on a peculiar stool and there was a moment when maria was back in herself fully and shouting and then the baby dropped into the womans hands in three hard heaves maria went back into the dreamy state and the woman got her into bed again and put her little girl in her arms and with an imperious gesture allowed the silly chickens back in again and they cleaned the room and maria and made everything pretty so that poor umberto would not be horrified and she stayed awake only long enough to look into her daughters eyes and fall in loveand smile vaguely at her husband in reassurance when he came in the last thing she saw was the strega woman whose name she never learned sketching a sign of blessing in the air and leaving as mysteriously as she had come in the night the cliffs loomed dark and threatening the air was still cold the wind blowing from albania here in the craggy folds of the mountains winter still held firm and threading her way through the darkness came a woman she disappeared into the cliff a little later a second woman came threading her way along the narrow path later a third and then two more deep within the caves the chanting began georgio steplakis was a hill shepherd he had thirty sheep and twentytwo goats and a hut in the hills he could hear the chanting he had absolutely no inclination to leave his pallet rumor among the shepherds was that the women shed all their clothes for the dancing in the glades georgio had reason to know the truth of this story hed been curious enough and not superstitious enough to try for a closer look when he was younger you could be really stupid when you were sixteen or so he hadnt believed in the naiads either well hed learned the rite was as old as these hills and before people had chanted and danced the nonhumans had and it was a women thing men who intruded would regret it georgio sighed in remembrance sometimes it was worth doing something you knew you would regret she had been very beautiful her hair was silvered and as fine as the finest silken threads if shed been standing the tresses would have reached down to her knees she lay in the glade naked but for that hair her skin was very very white as white as almondmilk it was also very very old the breasts were wrinkled and empty they sprawled sideways across her chest the chest did not move her eyes wide open and sightless stared at the sky half of a peeled almond was still clutched in her wrinkled hand when the women who had come to tend the altar found her thus a low moan went up there was sadness and there was fear who would take the halfalmond from the worn stone altar when the winter came the cold lord must have his bride there would be no fertility without it they buried her with honor and according to the ancient tradition in a fetal position halfalmond still in the old hand she was buried with the others beneath the dancing glade once the glade had been much lower than it was now and the grass had grown less green over the spot she was buried the grass would grow greener the earth here lay many cubits deep and it had all come from the same source many many burials over long years many brides part iv march ad chapter a shadow passed over the road in front of their mules lopez noticed that his mule flattened its ears at it he looked up and did not like what he saw those were bluntwinged hawks not soarers goshawks he thought what were goshawks doing here in his former life eneko had flown hawks against game as every young nobleman did goshawks were used in forested lands not open plains because they could not soar aloft on thermal currents as the longwinged falcons or broadwinged buzzards could so why were those two up there laboring away do you see those two hawks up there francis the priest squinted well i can see two birds eneko theyre very high could be hawks i suppose eneko frowned this is the third day ive noticed them sometimes one sometimes both francis shrugged well there are always birds up there why do you think theyre the same ones weve done a fair number of leagues every day eneko since we left rome were already nearing venice lopez had actually opened his mouth to explain when abruptly explanations became superfluous darkness fell on them as if someone had just clapped a giant kettle over the road flames leapt and roared in the sudden darkness blocking the road ahead of them the mules were terrified bucking and cavorting as if there were caltrops under their saddles and venomous snakes under their feet only sheer determination had kept eneko in the saddle father diego had been less lucky but eneko had dragged him up across the saddlebow like a very ungainly sack of grain it is an illusion shouted francis over the wheezing and braying of the mules and the nearcurses of the riders father francis had refused to ride anyway so he had perhaps the advantage of not trying to control a mount but as eneko managed to get his beast under a little more control he could see the flames too this was one of the most difficult kinds of sending a kind of vision from afar thus too it was difficult to combat the foe was not proximal it was no use to attack the vision they had to reach the sender and to make something of this magnitude required truly unearthly strength abruptly eneko realized as he struggled with the wildeyed mule that there could only be one purpose in this exercise to delay and thwart them on this the first leg of their pilgrimage something wanted to prevent them going on or at least to hold them up perhaps whatever or whoever this wasand it reeked of chernobogwanted them to band together and try to pursue and find it what it didnt want was for them to continue on their way ergo they must francis he shouted a cloth francis might not care to ride but he at least knew what eneko was calling for and why there was no reason to use magic to settle the mules it would be a waste of effort and less effective than a scarf anyway he unknotted and pulled off the sash he wore in place of a belt or a rope about his robes and whipped it over the head and eyes of the nearest mule which happened to be enekos once the mules eyes were covered it stopped bucking and stood shivering all over that gave eneko the leisure to rummage in his pack and pull out the cloth that had lately been home to bread and cheese francis gave the next mule the same treatment and the next until all of them were blindfolded and no longer fighting to escape the illusory dangers the only inconvenience was that now they all had to dismount and lead their mounts as well as the pack animals and the mules were balky obstinate about going forward when they could not see mulish in a word but they were no longer terrified which meant that they were no longer an actual hazard to their riders the four pilgrims advanced slowly leading their mounts all four of them were chantingnot magic as such but prayers which were probably just as effective as sacred magic in this situation in enekos case given their proximity to venice he elected to pray to saint mark now they waded through sights and sounds that were nauseating rather than frightening chernobog had plainly realized that it no longer served to terrify the mules instead it flung alternate visions of sacrifice and torture at them then when that failed sybaritic scenes and succubi something together perhaps eneko francis muttered as eneko paused for a breath eneko nodded and led the pilgrims in the chanting of psalms at last the way seemed to be clearing ahead they were on a wellpaved causeway across a swampland of slimecovered pools and reed patches the relief almost beguiled them but as eneko was about to step forward something whistled off to his left flank an inhuman whistle the kind that actually makes your eardrums vibrate despite his resolve eneko lookedand saw an undine rising half out of the water she was wreathed in long green hair with magnificent bare breasts much like the other temptations and apparitions only she was thumbing her nose at him sticking her tongue out the gesture was so unlike the horror or the seduction of the other visions that had confronted them that eneko realized immediately this was no illusion as if to reinforce the impression the undine blew a raspberry at them then beckoned eneko felt his brows draw together follow it he commanded and he stepped off the causeway into what appeared to be waistdeep water we should stick to the path eneko said father pierre worriedly swamps are treacherous and why do want to follow this illusion for an answer eneko pointed at his feet because she isnt an illusion pierre my feet are not wet you look to be about waist deep it is the water that is an illusion we are already lost the horrors and visions were just a distraction while chernobog or his minions tried to trap us more subtly that undine is not an illusion it is real nonhumans can be treacherous pierre warned eneko stepped forward boldly not more than chernobog and if i judge this correctly she is the emissary of an ally of ours an alliance of convenience in which not much love is lost between the allies but the common foe is worse there was he thought no point in mentioning that he thought this undine had come directly from marco valdosta who had inherited his strega predecessors adherents that would complicate matters altogether too much at the moment they walked slowly toward the undine who smiled showing altogether too many sharklike teeth father diego glanced back perhaps feeling doubtful and yelped my god he shouted his voice rising a great deal look eneko turned with the others to see what it was that had diego so shocked behind them the illusion was dissolving ahead lay a far more dilapidated looking causeway they were just on the edge of the reedbrake around some swampy pools behind them the ground was in fact higher higher and lashing with something that hissed unpleasantly with distinctly reptilian tones the darkness lifted the sun long obscured came out and cast reflections onto the still pools and eneko felt a warm breeze and thought perhaps that he saw a reflection of something gold in the water the lion said pierre eneko nodded our guide has deserted us but i think we no longer need her the breeze swayed the reedbrake indeed it seemed to say father francis shook his head i feel we are in the presence of some powerful magic you and pierre seem to understand what is happening eneko led his mule forward chernobog made an effort to turn us before we could reach a place where he holds no sway when the ruse failed it tried to kill us by luring us away from the safe paths and deeper into the swamp and the bogs where something cruel and bloody lurks but we are now in the lagoons and marshes of an ancient neutral power one which is bound to a christian soul the lion of saint mark said pierre the winged lion of venice father francis looked troubled why would one of the neutrals aid us the undine stuck her head out of the water the lion bids you a grudging welcome to his marshes he sends messages to eneko lopez by the inner flames that must be you man the lion bids you come in haste he needs you for a bonding and he says that you should remember that although your god allows you free will he too has plans and that one such as he guides many threads the undine slipped back under the water then she popped her head up again oh sorry about the nosethumbing and the raspberry but the lion says the one thing chernobog cannot understand nor feign is humor she pointed the path is over there stick to it lopez remained thoughtfully looking out at the horizon for a long time after she had gone francis meanwhile had taken the blinders off all the mules finally pierre nudged him and he started whats wrong eneko the priest asked it strikes me that this was a singularly ineffective attack compared to what we have faced from chernobog before this lopez turned to look into the faces of his companions well pierre began then nodded you know youre right but we did weaken him considerably and this may be all he can mount we weakened his instrument pierre francis pointed out we never touched chernobog himself he can always get new instruments my thought exactly lopez replied with a frown so why this halfhearted try at stopping us because we arent as important as we think we are pierre replied your humility is appreciated pierre but he thought a moment but chernobog would assign an importance to us out of all proportion to how we actually rate in the lords grand scheme lopez said firmly we hurt him we hurt his mortal vessel physically and we hurt his prideand pride as you well know brothers is highly cherished among the dark ones no i think there must be another answer hes dividing his attention pierre hazarded into the silence eneko nodded i think it must be he is confined to a mortal vessel and has limitations imposed by that confinement at the moment something is occupying his attention that is far more important to him than we are francis snorted well i for one am going to consider that a blessing he turned and strode off up the road leaving the rest to follow but it was pierre who voiced precisely what was troubling lopez as he nudged his mule with his heels and sent it after francis if there is something more important to chernobog than we are what is it he asked aloud why havent we heard anything about it and why havent the grand metropolitans seers gotten any hint of it why indeed asked lopez and sent his mule after pierres whatever it is i fear it will come from a direction that none of us can anticipate chapter shes beautiful oh shes so cute kat peered into the crib at the baby maria yawned shes asleep that is beautiful enough for me right now shes so tiny oh look at those little fingers maria snorted but fondly you should hear her yell theres nothing tiny about her lungs she yelled almost the whole way here to venice on the ship then i took her to see umbertos sister to talk about the christening and the baby screamed at her youre lucky umbertos sister didnt seem to think much of being bellowed at i thought shed refuse to be a godmother and umberto particularly wanted her to be i insist on being one of her godmothers said kat loyally and whether he likes it or not marco is being the godfather maria smiled youre not losing any time putting your foot down are you kat smiled back start as you mean to go on when and where will the ceremony be at the chapel at st hypatia di hagia sophia we havent arranged it yet father pasquari the priest who married us has died since but we just need a small place therell only be a few friends ill talk to marco said kat firmly we have a wedding to arrange let him arrange this hes very good friends with brother mascoli of st raphaella maria smiled thats a canalers church hes a good man is old mascoli the more she thought about it the better she liked the idea small intimate and none of her friends would feel uncomfortable as they might in st hypatias marco will arrange it petro dorma blew across his steepled fingers of course a desire to please the holy roman emperor must be a major factor but well id have to clear a couple of great galleys its not just the entourage manfred its the horses and at such short notice the merchants are going to howl the republic of venice is not like the empire the case vecchie are all engaged in the trade i wish you were prepared to take carracks instead when manfred and erik and eberhard had been admitted to the doges private working chambers earlier hed been delighted to see them youve arrived in venice just in time for marco and kats wedding now that they were asking to hire vessels to transport them to the holy land he looked as if hed just drunk a large draft of vinegar the outremer convoy leaves in less than three weeks even deckspace is bespoke from the corner of the room a stocky young man spoke up what about the four galleys that are in the arsenal petro the ones that are going to cyprus they should be finished by the end of march manfred recognized the lad it was the hooligan who had taken part in the raid on the casa dandelo slavers which manfred and erik had participated in the one whod been in jail for supposedly killing the priest manfred had been properly introduced to young benito valdosta as dormas ward after venice had been rescued but now suddenly the connection made itself clear then hed been dressed like a beggarbrat now he was dressed as a venetian noble but a twist of expression as hed looked at manfred had let him place the face petro nodded its an idea he turned back to manfred would you consider remaining on in venice for a week or two after the wedding you would arrive in ascalon just as quickly as the vessels wouldnt accompany the convoy the convoy stops for two or three days at each port to allow for trade youd be spared all of that as well as all of the mess and confusion of herding pilgrims on and off again at each port and with your two hundred men aboard theyd be wellarmed manfred nodded that sounds fair what do you say eberhard the whitehaired statesman looked thoughtful a personal convoy of brandnew ships will look as if the empire and venice enjoy a very cozy relationship rome may not like that constantinople may not either manfred grinned were expecting to have the grand metropolitans very own delegation along in the shape of eneko lopez and his companions according to a letter i have from my uncle and as for alexius well let him worry the news is he may be a shaky ally at best a good idea to fill his mind with doubts in facton the whole i think it would not be a bad idea at all for alexius to think the empire and venice are on better than mere speaking terms eberhard looked speculatively at manfred i detect francesca de chevreuses hand here manfred did his best to look affronted i can think of ideas too you know the statesman shook his snowy head explain to him my lord dorma that a wise politician always tells the truth if one day it is necessary for you to lie no one doubts your veracity manfred snorted the truth seems pretty rare in politics eberhard that said eberhard grimly is because there are very very few wise politicians if you must play at politics play by my rules but petro had picked up on another point francesca he said with unalloyed pleasure you have brought her with you manfred nodded warily there was a little too much enthusiasm in the way petro had reacted to francescas name and he began to remember a few things from their last sojourn here how francesca had made it very clear to him that their liaison was not going to be an exclusive one that she had several clients and once to comfort him she had said lightly that one of them was balding and bignosed he found himself eyeing petro dormas balding head and lumpy nose with new understanding yes we have he said curtly trying to keep hostility out of his tone but understand this she is strictly off limits to anything but polite social calls dorma even if you are the doge of venice petro smiled not at all discomfited ah well my loss is your gain but francescas conversation is a jewel even more rare than her magnificent body manfred coughed hmm well we are going to be staying at the imperial embassy francescas already gone to see katerina montescue but she will be in this evening petro bowed i will come and make a call and i dont mind if rome and alexius of byzantium see it as venice wishing to cozy up to the holy roman empire ill send you a messenger when she gets in said manfred no wait a better idea well take young benito with us trusty native guide yknow well native anyway and then i can send him back without exciting comments about a messenger running between the two of us petro looked at benito who was grinning like a horsecollar why do i feel this is a bad idea prince well i can hardly refuse off you go benito looking at benitos eyes alive with devilry manfred himself actually wondered briefly if this was a good idea then he dismissed the piece of caution with the contempt it deserved what trouble could this young case vecchie cause that he manfred hadnt had erik rescue him from a dozen times already surely none well there is a font yes said marco thinking but it is a very small and very poor church maria likes the idea ill talk to brother mascoli then i dont think hed mind and his hypatian ordination allows him to do this ive hardly seen you for days with all this arranging come with me mascoli is a nice man so he and kat went down to st raphaella taking simple joy in just being in each others company brother mascoli didnt mind in fact he was delighted sometimes people seem to forget that st raphaella also does the work of an ordinary church it will be a pleasure to christen this child his eyes moistened the child is healthy well so many of those that i christen here their mothers just wish to make sure that at least their souls are safe since we cannot help their bodies marco has been to see them said kat he says the child is strong and healthy mascoli smiled well that assessment is good enough for me we can do it whenever suits the parents brother mascoli marco hesitated then as the little priest cocked his head to the side he went on brother mascoli would it be out of order to ask the waterpeople to come add a blessing of their own just in case you know umbertos family doesnt all approve of this marriage he decided he had better not say anything about the fact that the baby had been well early brother mascoli knew the dates of the wedding and the birth and he was fully capable of adding for himself brother mascoli blinked but to marcos relief he answered with no hesitation i think that would be an excellent idea would you care to ask or shall i would you he replied with relief if i ask they might feel well obligated if you do and theyd rather not therell be no hard feelings consider it done what was all that about kat asked as they left the chapel and stepped into her familys little gondola call it a little something extra he replied marias always made her living on the water and theyre likely to be in and out of boats all their lives i just thought it would be a good thing to get the baby a little extra blessing he left it at that and kat evidently forgot all about it for she said nothing else the next morning they gathered outside the church maria had underestimated her popularity and the grapevine among venices waterways there must have been at least thirty people brother mascoli clad as usual in his faded lightcolored robes but with a special surplice for the occasion smiled and let them all crowd in your friends said they would be happy to help you marco he whispered as marco and kat took their places beside the altar rail and that was all he really had time to say for the crowd parted for maria and umberto to come to the fore at that moment the only person missing was umbertos disapproving sister they were already inside the chapel voices upraised when both marco and kat realized that maria was looking around frantically for her whats wrong whispered marco the other godmother whispered kat she isnt here cant you do something marco marco drew his breath in and felt a deep roaring within him of anger and determination umbertos sister didnt have to take her disapproval of the marriage out on an innocent child he almost said something when he suddenly knew that he wouldnt have to it would be all right brother mascoli took the baby into his arms the baby girl didnt scream at him she is a beautiful healthy child my daughter he said now who is going to stand as the godparents to this child we are kat and marco stepped forward there was a hiss of approval from the crowd of canalers and arsenalotti marco had treated enough of their children many of them here in this very chapel and they all knew that he and kat had played very large roles in the salvation of venice less than a year ago and the other the presence light on the altar flared burning with a peculiar greenness from behind the statue of saint raphaella a voice came i do it wasnt as many of the stunned audience concluded the voice of the saint herself marco recognized it that was the voice of the undine juliette she plainly had the ability to cast a glamour on her appearance she came out from behind the statue to marco she looked her greenhaired greentoothed self he could even see the line of the scar but to the others in chapel she obviously didnt look quite like that marco wondered if they could see the pool of water she stood in brother mascoli smiled she is a lucky little girl to have such godparents he took the oil and anointed the babys head and the water which juliette contrived to touch marco was aware of the green glow to it baby alessia in her delicate white shawl was angelic throughout the ceremony juliette took the baby into her arms she will never drown and if her mother is not there to care for her she just has to touch running water to call me or my kin to help she spoke quietly so that only those at the altar could hear her maria sighed happily when the ceremony was over and the crowd had left the chapel looking at her daughter who had lapsed back into sleep thank you both i i so desperately want alessia to have what i didnt i must find that other woman who stepped in for umbertos sister and thank her too i really thought marco smiled reaching a finger to caress the babys cheek you wont find her maria but your daughter has a fairygodmother what maria looked at him as if she thought he had gone mad that was an undine said marco calmly one of the water spirits of venice what now her mouth dropped open with shock she gave alessia a powerful blessing too your little girl will never drown and can call on the watersprites for help but she looked just like an ordinary woman fortunately maria had far too much trafficking with the strega in her past to be offended by the notion that a pagan creature inhuman to boot had just become the godmother of her child for an answer marco pointed to the pool of water on the floor and the wet prints leading behind the statue of saint raphaella theres a waterdoor and a waterchapel through there it is a consecrated place too maria shook her head and stared at the footprints i dont think i am going to tell umberto about this marco patted her shoulder i dont think hed understand and it would cause complications besides he continued feeling a laugh rising in his chest given the glamour that she used to make herself look human i wonder if umberto would believe you anyway hed probably think youd just been seeing things well this is certainly an unexpected honor signor lopez said petro dorma bowing you are the second great visitor ive had today my companions and i are simple men of god milord dorma reproached eneko traveling with a letter that bears the seal of the grand metropolitan in rome not exactly simple id say however that may be you will do me the honor of staying here i hope rooms will be made available for you wed be pleased to but we do not intend to stay very long we want to find a passage to the holy land petro dorma allowed himself a small smile well unlike manfred of brittany you havent walked in here and asked me to do so for you he was here doing that not two hours ago andof coursespace for a couple of hundred knights andof coursetheir horses emperor charles fredrik doesnt mind asking the impossible the emperor is here petro shook his head no just manfred erik ritter eberhard of brunswickand an old friend francesca de chevreuse oh yesand two hundred of those steelclad teutons on their way to jerusalem on a pilgrimage manfred needs one i should think eneko lopez smiled i will talk to prince manfred i suspect our journey is for the same purpose perhaps hell have space for a few priests among his knights he seemed to assume you would be joining them in fact said petro or at least he said so in our conversation however ill pass on a message that you are desirous of seeing him as ill be seeing the fascinating francesca this evening and speaking as the person who organized his ships he does have space now not to make too fine a point of it signor but you and your companions appear to be generously splattered with marsh mud im sure youd all appreciate an opportunity to get clean put on some fresh raiment and then join us for our evening meal father pierre laughed you mean milord dorma we smell like a swamp and youd prefer us to come to dinner without the bouquet well i wouldnt have put it quite like that said petro dorma tinkling a small bell but yes were lucky we just smell of swamp said father francis looking across the piazza to the column where the winged lion of saint mark gleamed in the late afternoon sun a factotum arrived bowed you called milord alberto take these good men and see them to the rooms reserved for our guests arrange hot water baths and fresh clothes and the cleaning of their present clothes see them comfortable and happy please the factotum bowed again if you will follow me sirs chapter it was easier kat had learned to say yes than to plan a wedding the momentous day when marcos marriage was annulled and she had been able to actually say yes had been a wonderful one the trouble then began immediately although she had not realized it until the next day but the next day she awakened remembered with a rush everything that had happened but most importantly that she was going to marry marcoaccordingly she had plotted her way through a wonderful bath perfumed and luxurious that madelena set up for her before the fire as soon as she had finished breaking her fast a small wedding she had planned just the grandfathers benito mariaperhaps a few guests at st hypatia di hagia sophia dare i ask francesca she would certainly ask father lopez to officiate as the day progressed kat had gotten the sinking realizationsinking like a stone anchor at seathat the small private wedding shed been planning was going to be a matter of publicvery publiccelebration and she would have very little to say in the matter there was no question of wherethe basilica the basilica di san marco with the banquet to follow at the doges palace of course nor any question of who would be invitedeveryone those not important enough for a place inside would be crowding the piazza di san marco she had stopped worrying about who would pay for all of this once she got to that point this was no longer a wedding it was a state occasion and the state would absorb it the state would also absorb the feast for the common folk which she insisted on my friends will be out there she had said stubbornly so unless you wish to have the ambassadors sharing their tables with arsenalotti petro dorma had gotten her point immediately there would be a feast with enough to stuff every man woman and child in venice until they were sick on one other thing she put her foot down my attendants will be maria garavelli and francesca de chevreuse she said to dorma flatly when he presented her with a list of suitable bridal attendants just maria and francesca no one else she fixed him with her best glare the one that had usually cowed her most dangerous customers back in the days shed been smuggling in order to keep casa montescue financially afloat a canalgirl and a whore but also the woman who got you the arsenalotti and the woman who kept the knots on your side dorma caught in that glare folded maria garavelli verrier he agreed swallowing that will please the arsenalotti a great deal certainly and francesca de chevreuse has the good will of the emperor charles fredrik he did not ask her if she could render up the canalgirl in an acceptable guise he had wisely left her alone to deal with the piles and piles of paper this behemoth of a celebration had already begun to generate benito of course would be one of marcos attendants she didnt know who the others would be but it wouldnt surprise her to discover one would be his friend rafael two more interesting choices but at least this way none of the case vecchi can be offended because we wont have chosen any of them or if they are offended they can all be offended equally there had never been any question of what dress she would wear your grandmothers her grandfather had said with pride and a tear in his eye there was no choice really the dress would reflect casa montescue and that dress was perhaps the only piece of clothing in the entire house that reflected the fortune that had been in possession of the old house of montescue she had gone to the storeroom with no doubt in her mind that one thing at least would be as it had been in those happier times after all hadnt she rummaged out her mothers old gowns to remake for francesca and hadnt they been as sound as a bell the gown shed found to remake into marias attendants dress had been a glory of scarlet brocade still despite all these years so the ruin that met her eyes when she opened the chest that contained her grandmothers wedding gown came as a total shock silk had discolored rotted in some places the brocade was tarnished the bullion dulled and blackened the pearls she burst into tears there on her knees beside the chest in the storehouse and that was how francesca had found her francesca had taken one look at the contents of the chest and gathered her into her arms to let her sob rocking her a little and making hushing sounds while she stroked kats hair the last person to hold me like this was mother here now francesca murmured this isnt as bad as you think but its ruined kat wailed not quite francesca took her chin in one hand and tilted her face to look up first i dont think this is as bad as it looks and second her eyes twinkled and kat gulped down her sobs and sniffled ive been casting about for a gift that you wont already have three dozen of unless you really truly desire another incomparably grandiosely hideous silver saltcellar kat shuddered a twentythird none of which i dare have melted down francescas silvery laugh startled a moth up out of the chest you clothed menow allow me to clothe you madame louise has as you may have noticed a very accomplished suite of seamstresses working for her she still is very obliged to me i had noticed kat said a little embarrassed by the envy she felt for the wonderfully flatteringly fashionable gown that francesca woreand for the air with which francesca wore it next to the former courtesan she felt as ungainly as a calf just close up the chest and well have it taken down to the gondola i just came to thank you for the invitation to be your attendant and to explain that it would be better for a certain party if i declined it francescas raised eyebrow and one finger tapping a ring with an elaborate crest gave kat the hint oh oh she sighed oh bilgewater i suppose it wouldnt be a good idea would it yourfriend shouldnt be too publicly associated with me francesca agreed cheerfully now if you still want to name someone who will provide everything i can without the shock value she shook her head never mind then lets get this down to my gondola and well salvage every scrap that we can from itand what cant be salvaged well replace we she added again with that significant tap on her ring and kat found herself having to stifle a slightly hysterical giggle at the idea that manfred of brittany was going to find himself paying for the dress of a lady he barely knew and had not the slightest chance of finagling into his bed it was the both of them she and marco together who approached the last possibly difficult bit of the wedding plans that deviated from petro dormas orchestrations marco tapped on the door at precisely the time of their carefully made appointment one no longer sought the quarters of eneko lopez unannounced not now that he was openly the grand metropolitans representative and quartered in the palace of the doge come in came the harsh voice i assume it is you marco valdosta marco pushed open the door lopez sat at a desk where he had been writing he pushed his work away and raised an eyebrow when he saw that kat was with him i had wondered if you felt the need of spiritual counsel he said dryly actually we had a favor to ask of you kat said hesitantly the patriarch is conducting the nuptial mass of course but she couldnt get the words out marco squeezed her hand and supplied them wed like you to be the officiating priest for the marriage kat saw the imperturbable eneko lopez at a complete loss for words at least for a moment or two i would be very pleased he said at last in fact quite honored but why why me for a great many reasons kat said but it just seemed to us thatas a priest as the kind of priest you are you have to do so many things that are so difficult so dangerousand no one ever asks you to do anything that is well pleasant she hesitated corrected herself joyful then she added very softly we dont think you have nearly enough joy in your life and you cant do without it you know it reminds you why you have to face the bad parts for a moment she wondered if shed insulted him then amazingly the grim stern rather frightening eneko lopez reached up and wiped the merest glitter of a tear from his eye thank you he said simply i would be delighted the church of st hypatia di hagia sophia was silent that silence that speaks of emptiness for a moment kat wondered if shed come too early still it was supposed to be the night before her wedding day there would be much to do if she did go ahead and marry marco part of her the part that was pragmatic the part that most people saw said that she was being ridiculous at this point the thing had a momentum of its own and would carry her along whether or not she wanted it to but as patriarch michael had said humans were creatures of spirit as well as mundane flesh and her spirit was troubled it was always here that she came when she needed to sort that out ah yes there was a solitary sibling in her white robes kat walked to the counseling booth sat down and waited a few moments later a female voice said peace be with you my child how may i counsel you kat sighed by telling me im being stupid probably i am supposed to marry tomorrow the dress is ready it fits like a second skin and where francesca found all the bits on no notice at all i will never know i look like a queen in it and maria looks like a princess in hers the feasting has already begun the basilica is full of candles and flowers and priests everything is in place for tomorrow only ionly i am suddenly afraid and do you love this man more than anything on earth is there any reason why you should not be married daughter no kat twisted her hands the patriarch himself has sanctioned the marriage i see does your husbandtobe abuse you marco hes the gentlest soul in venice the kindest softest bravest then what is the problem daughter is it sexual the woman hesitated an element of doubt in her voice the siblings were all sworn to chastity and celibacy perhaps her counselor felt she might be out of her depth here no its its nothing like that its spiritual if anything ah marriage is a holy institution sanctified by our lord himself it is intended to be a union of bodies minds and spirits kat took a deep breath the man i am going to supposed to marry is possessed sort of um part of him is a pagan magical creature i am a christian there was a silence i think katerina montescue that it would be easier if we went out into the church and i used those murals you sometimes sit and admire to advise you you know who i am there was a gentle snort of laughter from the other side of the scrim katerina all venice knows who you are now but i have seen you come to this church for many years i knew exactly who you were when i sat with eneko lopez and listened to you tell of your problems with the smuggling of supplies for the strega i listened with some amusement when you put him in his place with questions about dottore marina then as now i listened under the seal of counsel i did not betray you then i will not betray you now just because i step outside of the booth kat went out to find the sibling waiting for her come let us go to the chrysostom murals they are not your favorites but they make my point well they walked down until they stood below the first mural the golden preacher was portrayed as a gaunt man with the eyes of a hawk his painted gaze was unrelenting they seemed to stare through her he reminds me of signor lopez said kat quietly the sibling nodded i think they were cut of the same cloth he was like eneko a very intense man and very charismatic not always right however nor always wise narrowminded and even outright bigoted at times yet with him our hypatia formed one of the most influential alliances in the history of the church it was the meeting of those two great minds that set the course of the christian church from thenceforth and put an end towell ameliorated at leastwhat had become an increasingly entrenched tradition of schismatic dogmatism and heresyhunting she paused for a moment i will not attempt here and now to explain the theological complexities of the matter in the millennium that has gone by since their tradition has become known as petrine just as that of saint augustine has been called pauline but as is so often true the names obscure as much as they reveal both creeds within the church are more like umbrellas than fences do not forget that if sachs was a pauline so was the courageous young prince who broke the back of chernobogs monsterand his companion erik belongs to the gaelic creed which has its own history and doctrines altogether her mouth grew a little tight nor should you think for a moment that simply because a man calls himself a petrine that he is not capable of the vilest sins and crimes the sibling pointed to the next panel which showed the two backtoback there you see hypatia writing developing the philosophy and chrysostom brilliant orator that he was expounding it he provided most of the driving force shewhen necessary which it often wasprovided the diplomacy because of that alliance hypatia and chrysostom were able to formalize a doctrine of compassion and acceptance that emphasized wisdom and learning but she chuckled not without a multitude of clashes and even more in the way of compromises and both of them left their own traditions which are somewhat distinct i represent one father eneko lopez another the church needs both you know the sibling turned away from her contemplation of murals all of this is the basis of the core tenet of the hypatian order within the petrine wing of the church which since you choose to come to this church i assume you are in sympathy with saint hypatia gave to us that all men and women of good will ultimately worship the same god no matter what form they attempt to place on the unknowable whether they are christian jew parsee or hindu strega muslim or even outright pagans and what has this to do with my marrying marco you would hardly say he was not a man of good will of course not and the lion of saint mark the guardian of venice we of the hypatian order know it well would you agree that it is a creature of good will of love sudden tears filled kats eyes it loves this place these marshes and its people i see yes thank you thank you it is a pleasure the sibling patted her gently i foresee yet another union a meeting of minds and spirits kat laughed a slightly watery sound marco can do the diplomacy in the end the thing did have its own momentum and kat and marco were carried not along with it but riding atop it it began with a pair of processions of gondolas that carried her and maria from casa montescue and marco and benito from casa dorma to meet at the piazza san marco and disgorge their contents in front of the waiting crowds kat veiled from head to toe with the finest of silk gauze saw everything through a sort of fog the veil was white but the overgown of her dress was as blue as the med on a sunny day and so stiff with bullion and pearls it could easily have stood by itself the flowercrown that surmounted it surrounded her in a second mist of the perfume of roses and lily of the valley kat had a sudden image of herself from two years before leaping into the canal to avoid a schiopettieri sweepwearing this outfit shed have gone down like an anchor not even quickthinking benito could have saved her the image almost caused her to burst into open laughter as it was she couldnt help but continue the procession with her face wearing a grin which she suspected was quite unsuitable for the solemnity of the occasion fortunately there were plenty of things to distract her they were met by two sets of minstrels who serenaded them with love songs as they made their way in twin processions to the basilica and the mobs of venice who could be so unruly when they chose parted like the red sea for them without a murmurand kept their chatter and cheering down to where she could hear the minstrels telling her of the delights awaiting her marcos procession arrived at the basilica first of course he was supposed to await her at the altar so she took her time trying to move like francesca with a willowy gliding walk that would make her seem to slide along without having any feet she was very conscious of the lion on his pedestal as she passed him was this something more than a statue she thought she felt his golden gaze on her warm and benevolent as she passed by she had thought it would take forever to cross the piazza it seemed to take no time at all she had thought she would feel pressed in by all the people instead she felt as if she floated on their goodwill the minstrels left them at the porch of the basilica and from within came the sweet voices of children singing she held up her head and saw the path to marco lying straight ahead of her and if she did not fly up it it was through no fault of hers she went through the nuptial mass as in a dream hands that wanted to reach for his clasped demurely in front of her but finally finally came the moment when eneko lopez stepped forward with his sober black robes enlivened by a blue stole and she and marco rose from their places and he raised the veil with shaking hands and put it tenderly over her head and they knelt together hands joined at last beneath eneko lopezs for the blessing and it was at that moment when she thought that her heart could not hold another drop of happiness that a faintly glowing paw of golden mist placed itself atop the hand of the priest you will be happy little sister it was not a wish it was a prophecy and her heart rose singing chapter manfred whistled softly holy mother see that blonde erik the original paps of anu i swear erik determinedly did not look up from the table ogling all the availableand for that matter all the unavailablewomen of the world was manfreds specialty not his it is impolite to stare manfred women dont like it manfred snorted then why do they wear clothes like that anyway erik youve got have a look ill swear she is one of those viking valkyries come to fetch you after all despite all his best intentions erik did look and was trapped there were occasional blond heads in venice a few lombards and travelers from further afield but this woman was a true scandinavian blonde her great cascade of hair straight and fine and so pale as to be almost white her face too spoke of the northlands the skin milkwhite with blossomed cheeks high cheekbones and as manfred had pointed out she had a magnificent figure despite himself erik caught his breath and stared manfred laughed coarsely it is impolite to stare at her tits isnt it erik you want me to organize a meeting for you a quiet little alcove somewhere ill distract the bodyguards and in this case my friend they really are bodyguards erik realized that hed been so taken up with looking at the scandinavian woman that he hadnt noticed the two men accompanying her once he did it was very clear to him why the blond woman was not being mobbed by cisebeos looking at the two of them erik was wary himself they were as blond as the woman even taller and much wider and they had beards something she lacked still she was a magnificent queenly figure who is she manfred took a pull from his goblet i only know half the women in venice erik ill have to find young benito he knows the other half erik shrugged wouldnt do me much good see the furs shes wearing and the jewelry and the escorts that is a very wealthy noblewoman the wildest kind believe me said manfred he stood up anyway francesca asked that i come up to speak with the happy couple shes scheming away for my uncle i suspect wasting her time marco is a nice boy even if butter wont melt in his mouth but theres steel in him that not all of francescas wiles will turn yknow one of my fathers duniwassals back at carnac caught me stealing arrows from the warstores to go duck shooting with when i was about eleven i was the dukes son and i wasnt really worried he fetched me such a clip around my ear i thought it might come out of the other side of my head i squalled blue murder and threatened to go to my father about him manfred pulled a wry face i still remember what he said i dont care if you go and talk to the ard ri himself boy siege stores are my duty i keep them frae pilfering by anybody even your father hisself now run along and tell him the old devil was as unlike young marco as possible but the two are cut from the same cloth in one way they know what they believe is right and you cant turn them from that erik nodded his eyes still following the blond woman besides if what francesca tells us is trueand after what happened here i have no reason to doubt ithe is at least in part possessed by the lion of saint mark dryly thats quite a creature to try to talk into something manfred snorted i dont think the lion half is as easily distracted by kats figure he turned and walked off erik made no move to go with manfred after the prince was out of sight he got up and found his way across to the three scandinavians goddag he greeted he wasnt surprised at the vinlander twang when one of the men turned and greeted him in return icelander what are you doing here he was the slightly larger of the two men who were obviously brothers as well as the older a smile on his facematching that on the other man and the woman alsonow displaced the wary reserve that erik had seen characterizing the vinlanders response to the venetian pomp awkward questions first dealt with as he had been instructed to do when he first took on manfred as his charge the role of the hakkonsen family in imperial affairs was not something discussed few if any people in iceland had any idea that clann harald to which eriks family belonged did loyal service to the imperial house of the holy roman empire it was best so eriks father had always said i am just passing through said erik calmly and yourselves my name by the way is hakkonsen erik eirikur actually but ive grown accustomed to using the danish version these continentals have less trouble with it hakkonsen was an honorable patronymic as was harald as a clan designation eriks own father was well known in iceland and there were always some of the clan in the althing true clann harald was not rich in fact wealth seemed to avoid them his fathers own holding at bakkafloi was a place of stark beauty but little else still it was a name that was well respected the vinlander obviously recognized the name the smile grew considerably bjarni thordarson at your service this is my brother gulta and our little sister svanhild were setting up a trading house for vinland goods we have a venetian factor and partner the big vinlander gestured this is his daughters wedding an honor to meet you all eriks smile might just have been a fraction brighter for svanhild but he thought hed done well keeping it under control so here you are invited to a venetian function and you dont know anyone and your host is buried in having his daughter married uncomfortable and it is quite an affair said gulta looking at the laden tables the richly dressed people as an icelander you must find all of this ostentation odd erik smiled remembering his first venetian banquet the ostentation had been overwhelming yes but it had been less so than the magical murder of the monk it was quite a shock yes but ive gotten used to it why dont we find a few glasses of wine and somewhere quiet to sit and talk it has been five years since i went to vinland where is your clan based if he could find a quiet spot manfred might actually not come and join them under the circumstances erik thought hed prefer that manfred had far more than his share of female attention anyway something about what hed said had made svanhild smile upon him erik found himself hoping manfred would stay away a long while she was stunning fortunately her brothers seemed to approve the thordarsons are a trading house said bjarni we have our headquarters at cahokia in the mississippi valley deep in the interior but we have factors on the coast also and i agree it has done us no harm to be seen at this gathering as guests of the doges wards wedding but im tired of all these people staring at my sister and none of them having the manners to come and speak to us erik reflected silently that hed nearly been amongst them i dont mind svanhild said but there was an undertone of faint unhappiness that told erik that she minded a great deal after all they dont know us either we must be odd to them we look like polar bears in a room full of lapspaniels said her tone well if there isnt any business that you need to be doing why dont we get out of the crush erik said but said it to her i like these people but i have to say that they must be the most obtuse lot ive ever seen nothing can be said or done directly and they use occasions like this one to chatter around and around subjects theyve already made their minds up about the older brother heaved a sigh of relief so im not the only one who thinks that i think i know where there will be a quiet room or quieter anyway erik caught a passing page by the elbow and gave him instructions just follow me one thing that his previous visits had done was to give him a good grasp of the geography of the doges palace and what was more let him know what rooms were likely to be closed off to the general invitees the little chamber off to the side of the council chamber for instance it was too small to be useful in a great gathering and there was no comfortable furniture for assignations not that something like that would stop manfred but fortunately manfred wasnt there oh svanhild said as he closed the door behind the three vinlanders she looked around at the rather somber room with no hints of gilding or the usual venetian opulence anywhere only cold stone and dark wood and grim portraits of former doges i thought all of the palace was red and gold not everywhere erik didnt tell her that this particular chamber was used for interviews with the spiesand sometimes interrogations at least they were interrogations that didnt require a trip to less salubrious quarters the kind equipped with pincers and tongs and ropes and hot irons here he purloined petros comfortable chair from behind the formidable desk for svanhild and offered the other uncompromising pieces to her brothers he sat on the desk just as the page returned with wine and more refreshments so tell me why youre here and about your clan holding in vinland he said with enthusiasm its been too long since i heard anyone speaking my own tongue svanhild simply lit up at that invitation if he was any judge she was desperately homesick and if shed been able would have flung herself on the first ship going west the brothers were full of enthusiasm for their mission and what they expected to accomplish in venice but svanhild wanted to talk about home about little thingshow she missed being able to hunt how horribly crowded this place felt to her just like a gigantic ship she said which actually was an excellent observation seeing how hemmed about venice was by water he asked her in between declamations by her brothers if she had seen much of the city and she said no in a tone that suggested to him that she didnt want to there are so many people she elaborated too many as many just in the inn in which we live as there are in all of our holding eventually her brothers announced that they had stayed away from the celebration too long there was after all business to be tended to and the venetians feel the same you know erik escorted them out the door and back toward the party they discuss business everywhere in church even at funerals i thought i would never get used to them or their ways but i can tell you that underneath it all theyre people who are no different from anywhere else youll find youve got plenty in common with them after all but svanhild cast him a glance that told him that in this much at least she was in total disagreement with him manfred sat down with thump next to erik who was sitting in an alcove staring at a wine goblet i never thought id see the day when id have to come looking for you instead of the other way around said manfred cheerfully two hours its taken me to find youat least to think of what i could have gotten up to a few years back if youd been like this then erik looked up his eyes bleak manfred i think im in love the young prince grinned dont worry ill get von gherens to give you some advice on how to do it i think youd prefer it from him rather than from me or francesca eriks voice was icy shut up or ill break your head its not like that manfred was silent for a few moments who he asked in a quiet serious voice this wasnt like erik this could be serious erik usually shied away like a nervous horse from women francesca and manfred had been discussing a hypothetical future partner for his mentor not a week back what had she said when erik falls hell fall hard that wasnt a problem manfreds opinion of what constituted a suitable girl for erik on the other hand was a problem shed have to pass the manfred test of approval and for erik manfred set very high standards svanhild thordardottar erik sighed such a beautiful name and she moves like a swan too manfred felt real alarm he started looking around he needed francesca who youre right she is like a valkyrie said erik dreamily a true shieldmaiden not one of those girls who needs ten servants just to get dressed in the morning and such a sweet nature toogetting stared at and snubbed and not a complaint out of her about it manfred stared at his friend mentor and bodyguard you mean the one with the big pair ofofbodyguards the blond one erik nodded at him scowling a bit you watch what you say about her i wouldnt dream of uttering a wrong word said manfred quite truthfully erik was ferocious enough on the training fields even when he wasnt mad about anything erik sighed not that it really matters i think i must have said the wrong thing we were getting on so well she wanted to know all about mainz next thing they got up and left polite but closing me out oh manfred tried hard to keep the relief out of his voice because of the hurt in eriks well im heading out of here this affair is beginning to drag erik stood up with a sigh yes i could use my bed i suppose manfredgiven the circumstancesdidnt point out that it hadnt been his bed he was seeking or at least not his own and right now erik wasnt picking up the undercurrent of manfreds words as he usually did in fact he actually wandered off to his own quarters without making sure that manfred was coming with him which suited manfred right down to the bone erik was welcome to a quiet night manfred had other plans the hellion benito would either be along presently or manfred would go find him manfred snorted with amusement at that thought it was a shock to find himself doing eriks usual job of slowing a tearaway down francesca was waist deep smiling on and politicking with old admirers manfred found being around while she dealt with them set his teeth on edge so the last set of plans hed made with the rascal were that they were off to a place benito had foundgood sicilian music and some dancers that according to young benito could make the tassels on their boobs do amazing things manfred finally got tired of waiting for benito to find him and traced benito down at the winebutts lets go tearaway i find myself consumed with curiosity about these tassels the boy swayed gently as he stood up he was already halfdrunk manfred was mildly surprised the last week benito had escorted him to choice taverns and nightspots but the boy seemed to have some degree of caution about wine what was it that hed said i dont want to end up as a lush it had seemed to manfred then that he was more inclined to drink enough to get up to devilry and stop there than to go on to the falldown stage odd distinctly odd but none of his business when all was said and done time to find the girls benito said and his speech was clear enough theres no one here worth bothering about chapter the evening was wearing on and maria found herself exhausted now that the ceremony was over and the banqueting begun maria had settled into having a tedious time shed been seated among the guests of honor among the gilt and brightness and had been very uncomfortable and kept her mouth shut yes she loved kat and she certainly had wanted to be with her for her wedding marco the bridgebrat shed seen grow up had a special place in her heart too but that was marco and kat marco valdosta and katerina montescue in their magnificent finery surrounded by casevecchie were more like jeweled butterflies than real people and as with caesare shed been painfully aware of her lowerclass origins every time she opened her mouth benito had been seated as far as possible from her and umberto hed tried to catch her eye once shed looked down umberto had also been plainly uncomfortable among all those people who ordinarily he would only see at a distance and a far distance at that now that the guests were mingling hed hastily gone off to join his fellow guildsmen she looked across to where he stood with several men all gray haired and all at this stage very jovial umberto looked happy for the first time in ages maria decided shed had enough out in the piazza thered be real music and singing real talk about things she knew not her trying to keep her mouth shut she got up alessia was in a room just off the banqueting hall with a dry nurse and by the feel of it alessia could use some feeding she walked across the crowded room to umberto moving carefully on the slippery marble pausing every other step to keep from jostling someone who was probably important it took an age to go thirty feet he was laughing when she reached him and greeted her with a smile that spoke of both care and happiness ah maria it is so good to be back in venice again nice to be away from rude nature she smiled back she couldnt exactly tell him that she was finding the smell of the canals hard to live with yes but i must go to the baby husband hed like that being called husband with respect in her voice and showing herself a good wife and a dutiful mother it would make him feel good in front of the other masters she must be fed and then i think ill take her to our lodgings it has been a long day and i confess im tired he took her arm ill come along to assist you home a woman needs an escort on a night like this irritation flared this being a good little wife was not something she did well this was venice her venice shed sculled a vessel around it alone since she was fourteen she shook his arm off but did it gently so it didnt seem as if she was rejecting his help i still need to feed alessia and then probably to change her that would put him off quickly enough it will take a while then the nurse can accompany me she can do something to earn the wage that katerina has paid her and well take a gondola you stay please youre enjoying yourself and i dont want to spoil that for you you wont see the other masters for a long time again youre sure he was plainly tempted but he was dutiful a solicitous hand touched her elbow absolutely enjoy yourself she kissed him on the cheek and went to find alessia she found the salon easily enough by ear alessia was bellowing the dry nurse was nowhere to be seen there were however five or six empty goblets one of which lay on its side in a pool of spilled wine wine stained the satin of the chair that had been provided for the nurse and alessia was demanding instant attention hastily maria struggled with her lacing and quelled the bellows rage building inside her that she had to tamp down lest it affect alessias feeding shed just fed winded and changed alessia when the nurse returned with a goblet in her hand slightly unsteady on her feet maria put alessia down carefully only then did she round on the slut whod deserted her baby where the hell have you been she demanded anger putting an edge to her voice that only a drunk could have ignored the nurse it seemed was just such a drunk and beamed at her just went to get a glass of wine dearie the poppet was sleeping beautifully fury passing all ability to use mere words seized maria she grabbed the woman and shook her like a rag doll you you puttana she hissed into the wineladen breath the woman swayed youre drunk you left my baby all alone anything could have happened anything the nurse wrested herself away clumsily and looked down her nose at maria her face reddening with more than just wine youre nothing but a canaler even dressed up like that why should i sit here with your misbegotten brat she spat you begrudge me a glass of wine maria stepped forward pulled back her arm and slapped the woman hard and hard again the nurses head jerked back and her cheeks each had a scarlet handprint on them but maria wasnt done she seized the woman by the front of her gown and threw her at the seat it cracked as the dry nurse fell onto it her eyes wide her mouth falling open with shock it didnt breakquitebut maria knew with satisfaction that it was damaged the dry nurse was going to have to answer to one of the doges upperservants for it i might be a canaler she hissed but im worth three of you at least i always did what i was paid to do honestly maria snatched up alessia and stormed out out into the crowd out past the crowd too angry to even hear if anyone was trying to hail her she was still so angry she wasnt really thinking just walking once shed got past the revelers but when she got out of the palace and past the fires in the piazza the night air was cool it helped to cool her temper and her anger too after a while she paused and took stock of where she was with a sense of surprise rather than shock she saw that she was on one of the walkways bordering the canals and must be more than halfway to their lodgings shed walked farther than shed intended in this dress the hem and the petticoat hems would need washing her feet crammed into shoes that were too narrow for her complained one of the disadvantages of marrying umberto had been that she had to wear shoes all the time his position he said demanded it well her canaler feet demanded space she kicked the shoes off then struggled to pick them up with alessia fast asleep in one arm she gritted her teeth as she realized that the shoes were meant for dancing in ballrooms not striding along canalside the pretty doeskin would be ruined she sighed irritably there was little point in spending money on a gondola now anyway the gondolas would be as thick as flies down at the piazza san marco and few and far between anywhere else she might as well walk the rest of the way cross the rialto bridge and go to the apartment not more than a few hundred cubits now besides shed been walking and poling for most of her lifeher own two legs were good enough she was just a canaler after all canalborn and canalbred and the day she couldnt make it anywhere in venice on her own feet they might as well start building her coffin so she walked on quietly with half of venice already drunk on the doges wine and the other half trying to get to that state there probably wasnt a bullyboy or a pickpocket anywhere nearer than naples shed be more than safe enough tonight the riot and rumpus met her just short of the rialto bridge schiopettieri a lot of them the professional soldiers who served venice for a police force had two struggling figures in their midst yelling and fighting like young bulls maria stepped up onto a mounting block partly to avoid the press of schiopettieri partly to see what was going on she looked across the headsand straight into benitos eyes as their eyes locked he stopped and a look of absolute horror transfigured his face that was the opportunity that the schioppies needed they piled onto him maria caught a brief glimpse of benito upended over someones shoulder he wasnt wearing any trousers or smallclothes maria with alessia in her arms stood transfixed watching the tide of schiopettieri bear benito and his large companion away the large companion seemed content to be restrained all the fighting had obviously come from benito the tide passed and moved on away from her and maria stepped down off the block and walked on for a brief moment shed nearly waded into that crowd of schioppies to help benito then alessia had stirred against her and how could she interfere in a drunken brawl with a baby in her arms she couldnt exactly have put alessia down benito had gotten himself into that trouble whatever it was benito would just have to get himself out of it it wasnt her job to rescue him anymore if it ever had been this close to midnight even when there was a great wedding on at the doges palace with feasting in the piazza san marco the stalllined wooden rialto bridge ought to be quiet it wasnt there were several groups of people mostly local women gossiping eagerly about what had just happened one of the women her eyes bright with excitement in the lamplight that the republic provided to make bridges and sotoportegos safer turned to maria as maria tried to get past her did you hear did you see isnt that younger valdosta a scandal her voice was full of glee maria could not restrain her curiosity no i wasnt there id just come from the celebration what happened what did he do she did restrain the this time shed been about to add the woman pointed at one of the crossbeams that held chains that supported the center bridge section he was up there well benito climbed things he always had been like a little shaved ape what was he doing she asked warily the woman shook her headthen told her scandalous in a public place like that maria felt herself redden you mean he was an older woman looking out of her halfshuttered window snorted well he was so drunk that itd be better to say he was trying to good thing for her the girl is a dancer the doge will have to make an example of him pronounced the first woman halfprimly and halfgleefully the last time and the other man asked maria hastily oh he was just singing some bawdy song and cheering he only got involved when the schioppies got here hes as strong as an ox maria walked on to think that that was benito her benito no not hers never hers and not her problem so she told herself and maybe if she told herself often enough she might believe it and pigs might fly erik stared balefully at manfred and pointed a finger through the bars you are quite safe and i am going to leave you here i have searched this stupid town for hours now i thought youd gone to bed and suddenly im dragged out of my blankets and sent on a hunt that i should have known was going to end here he glared and an unrepentant manfred glared back then dropped his eyes and closed his hands around his head looking very much the worse for wear i am going back to tell francesca that waking me up was a waste of everybodys time and that she should go back to sleep i am going back to sleep back to my bed that i should never have left for a drunken oaf i am going to leave you here locked up like a common felon until this town goes back to normal business after the wedding that should maybe happen by vespers bell manfred held his head dont shout whatever you do the jailor says ill only be up for disturbing the peace and creating a nuisance just leave me some money for the fine and ill get myself home but find out what theyve done with the kid erik dorma is unlikely to forgive me if ive let him get into serious trouble that was a change manfred thinking about someone elses woes rather than his own erik sighed and shook his head just what did you do just what did he do that boy must be the first person ive met who is worse than you are manfred uh i dont think ill tell you about all of it but the first part involved some fellow bearbaiting benito took against the bears master the bear bears can swim cant they erik put his hand over his eyes why did i ask well when benito set the bear after the schiopettieri manfred continued and paused when erik groaned he set the bearagainst the schioppies why did he sent a bear against the schioppies dont answer that he added hastily as manfred opened his mouth it was a rhetorical question manfred raised his eyebrows and managed a hurt expression it was very funny at the time erik the tavern did get busted up a bit but the girl seemed to like that oh god erik shook his head ill go and see petro dorma and get it sorted out he promised oh good but not immediately in no small part because benito is getting exactly what he was asking for it will be after i have told francesca that you are where you deserve to be chapter manfred was more than a little nervous about this interview the hangover had barely subsided he had not even been back to the embassy to changeand after last night these were not the clothes of a gentleman any more besides he had a definite feeling that the doge was not going to be very pleased to hear what manfred had gotten up to with his young ward even if manfred was here on an official imperial visit and was a noble of a great foreign power he was therefore both surprised and pleased to see that petro was smiling albeit slightly when he entered the room ah prince manfred i apologize for my people arresting you said petro urbanely they didnt realize who you were and i didnt see fit to inform them manfred had the feeling that the more honest he was about all of this the better off hed be less embarrassment all the way around ive paid the fines im afraid i gave your clerk a false name for his records wise dorma said quite as if he had expected something of the sort but i still must apologize normally my agents would keep an eye on visiting dignitaries and keep them out of trouble or at least out of jail should have left him there grumbled erik glaring at manfred a glare like that should have qualified as an offensive weapon manfred felt sheepish and very much inclined to encourage just about any other thread of discussion especially if it involved going home to bed but there was the question of young benito um about benito he was surprised to see the doge go off into helpless laughter eventually though petro stopped and shook his head i am going to have the justices come down on him like a ton of bricks if only to stop every other damned young blade in venice from doing the same thingor trying anyway i doubt very much if theyd succeed the boy has managed to make himself a legend from the canals to the palace the whole city is talking about it this morning and there are bets on whether or not he actually did what he was trying to do just one thing i do want to know where on earth did he get a woman willing to go up there with him manfred felt his ears glowing as erik stared at him she uh shes an acrobat at that place where they have the alexandrine dancers the stomachdancers although there is a lot more to it than just the stomach he amended weakly petro put his head in his hands his shoulders still shook and the bear we didnt really mean that to happen he pled it just did the poor thing really was being mistreated petro sat back in his throne and closed his eyes for a moment the corners of his mouth still twitching prince manfred erik what do you think i should do with the boy give him to me growled erik ill take him away from venice and sort him out and right now i need someone to beat besides manfred petro dorma blinked gave them both a penetrating look and smiled broadly you know i think i might just take you up on that i was going to send him out to corfu as my factor for a year or two anyway you two can take him along with you if you dont mind that is prince manfred manfred nodded of course not with a wry smile he asked how much trouble can one boy be petro snorted in the case of this one plenty i will arrange this with the chief justice he keeps a straight face better than i do i of course am far too angry to even see him he has damaged the reputation of our fair city and the casa dorma and his brother and hes quite spoiled the dignity of his brothers wedding but hasnt he asked erik seeming rather puzzled by dormas good humor dorma smiled please erik this is a port city its not quite as decadent as aquitaine but we are not icelandic puritans here the venetians are shocked yes of course venetians love being shocked it is a wonderful story and will grow into the most improbable legend and benito will acquire a reputation twice as large as it is already i must send benito out of town before he is forced by a desire to live up to the legend to do something even more crazy erik shook his head you venetians are all crazy petro laughed and shook his head there is something in what you say now tell me manfred benitos um partner in crime do i have to get her out of prison too who lolita no she took off like a scalded cat petro laughing like a mad thing manfred remembered that quite clearly her little bare rear was just as luscious as the front petro raised an eyebrow but said only good i would hate to think benito had gotten someone other than himself into trouble manfred snorted in this case your worry is wasted effort nevertheless said the doge with an attempt at seriousness i feel i should investigate these dancers it sounds like a lively spot that young hellion would find a lively spot in a shetland town grumbled erik and if he couldnt find one hed make one benito was in trouble and knew it more trouble than hed ever been in before hed never been in this room before this was where they took people who had done things that were just short of murder or robbery a darkly somber room that left no doubt in the prisoners mind that he had trespassed on at least five of the ten commandments there was pretty little doubt that everybody was still nearly incandescently angry with him the chief justice had not so much as cracked a smile when the affair with the bear had been related to him by the bears former owner by the time it had got to the challenge on the rialto bridge well he sounded like god himself thundering out the law the rialto bridge is one of the most important landmarks of our fair city your drunken and licentious behavior has brought shame onto us i gather only your drunkenness has saved you from the more serious charge of public fornication the chief justice had eyes that could pierce a fellow like a pair of stilettos that you should do this on the occasion of your brothers matrimonyand as a ward of our dogesimply makes your lewd behavior and other offences more heinous still the justice paused he seemed to be waiting for benito to say something yes milord he said faintly the floodgates opened again this is not the first time you have been in trouble in this court i see the record indicates you have been fined for brawling here before i therefore sentence you to a fine of one hundred ducats and the owner of the bear is to be recompensed for the loss of his animal and you benito valdosta are hereby given a choice remain imprisoned here for a year or be exiled from the city of venice for a period of five years benito swallowed this was serious really serious this time one hundred ducats that was a years earnings for a gentlemanatarms more money than he had dorma had paid him an allowance but he had a feeling that would not be available any more all right hed pawn everything he had somehow hed take care of the fine but he was damned if hed turn tail and run away into exile hed messed up hed take it like a man ill take the impri but he was interrupted pardon milord justice if i might be permitted to speak it was the one and only member of the public who hadnt just come to gawk at venices latest scandal marco benito wished like hell he hadnt come the chief justice nodded approvingly permission is granted milord marco valdosta no protested benito damn it marco you cant get me out of this one the justice looked sternly at him silence or i will have you silenced benito valdosta marco cleared his throat your honor as benito my brother is the ward of the doge no special consideration can be shown to him the justice nodded gravely well said indeed i have a message here from petro dorma instructing me that benito valdosta is to be treated in the same way that any other citizen of venice would be treated marco nodded nonetheless i would like to appeal on the basis of his youth and the fact he grew up without the guidance of good parents as an orphan and that in the fight to save venice last fall he fought and led with great courage many here can testify to that perhaps some part of thisah incidentis due to a nature that requires an outlet and there has been nothing of the sort to purge him of his excess of spirits there was a murmur of approval the justice however was shaking his head marco hurried on i do not appeal for the sentence to be reduced i just ask that the option of imprisonment be removed your honor many of venices wildest young blades have gone out to the outposts of our empire and served well and faithfully and returned as upright and respectable citizens i do not think benito would be improved by a year in the dungeons i think he might learn if sent elsewhere benito felt his mouth dropping open and snapped it closed the justice nodded the look he bestowed on marco the very image of benevolence i find this a reasonable plea marco valdosta he turned back to benito and god on high was back very well benito valdosta the option of imprisonment is withdrawn you are exiled from venice for five years you will remain in custody until a passage is arranged for you out of the city marco stepped forward he tapped a pouch which jingled your honor i have here monies to pay the reparations and the fines for benito valdosta the justice pointed the clerk will see to it and benito his leg irons clanking was led out marco did not even look at him on the whole that was probably not a bad thing he did come down to the cell later petro would have added twenty lashes to the sentence he said grimly the first words out of his mouth not are you all right or we were worried about you benito shrugged im sorry brother the evening started in fun it just got out of hand several people including prince manfred have said that you were simply looking for trouble said marco who could have passed at this moment for one of the chief justices prize pupils he was doing a very good imitation of god on high himself petros had some of his spies keeping an eye on you you pitched one of them into the rio san felice youre lucky that was not another charge you faced by the way but then suddenly the whole stern image collapsed as his brother added plaintively petro says youve been so much better the last while and then this benito shrugged his shoulders sulkily he wasnt going to justify himself to marco he wasnt sure he could justify himself to himself and he sure as hell wasnt going to let marco know just how wretched hed felt when hed seen maria with the baby in her arms and she wouldnt even look at him marco sighed i havent even had a chance to tell you yet but kat and i stood as godparents to marias daughter benito felt truly as if the wind had been kicked out of him but he had to knowhe was as starved for some word any word as a swampy was for a decent meal is she all right i mean with having the baby and all in a very small voice she wouldnt even speak to me marco marco looked at his younger brother with a compassion that hurt almost as much as marias silence so that was what it was all about was it benito said nothing what could he say he couldnt deny it but he sure as hell wasnt going to admit it marco shook his head shes fine seems happy enough benito the baby is fine too but then he smiled that purely marco smile with a touch of mischief shes got something unusual though she has an undine as one of her godmothers that caught benito off guard what he said not sure hed heard right umbertos sister was supposed to be one of the godmothers only she didnt approve of umbertos marriage you know she always kept house for him i suppose she must have thought that no one was good enough for him but she absolutely hates maria so at the last minute she didnt show up the lion in me i think the lion must have guessed she might do something like that i asked if the waterpeople would add their blessing and the priest said hed see about it well i think the lion sent an undine to take her place so that was the reason for the mischief benito could hardly believe it marco doing something just for the reason of giving someone who deserved it their comeuppance all things considered since theyre going to be around water all their lives you could hardly ask for a more useful godmother marco pointed out with just a touch of glee that little girl will never drown benito tried to imagine the scene and failed i wish i could have been there marco looked at him hard and raised an eyebrow and who would that have pleased or helped benito nobody would ask you to be a godfather benito shrugged i just feel oh i dont know i just feel i owe her some help he sighed she saw me that night you know so i have heard said marco dryly she told kat he paused as if he was considering something then evidently made up his mind about it theyre shipping out for corfu in a couple of hours youll have your chance to help her if you can manage to stay out of trouble long enough to do anything useful youre going there too its a small place youll probably see her every day benitos mouth fell open in horror and worst of all the horror was so mixed with a thrill of delight that he couldnt tell where one started and the other ended what he squawked i cant id rather go to prison marco he gripped the bars pleading go and talk to petro tell him about this all right he had to admit it he had to it was the only thing that might save him seeing her is what sent me over the edge please marco ill go anywhere else but i cant go there marco nodded i thought so ill ask him he sighed but dont get your hopes up he was pretty grim about this and had made up his mind and anyway there arent a lot of places you can go now the terce bell had rung before he returned im sorry benito petro says if he cant learn to behave like a gentleman then let him take the consequences hell have plenty of opportunity no benito whimpered you didnt tell him didnt you tell him about maria marco sighed i told him everything including how you felt about the christening and how seeing maria at the wedding just made you crazy he said youd have plenty of chances to help maria in corfu he said you could offer to be a dry nurse since the one maria had was unsatisfactory benito groaned and dropped his head in his hands chapter the great carracks and the smaller tarettes in the bacino san marco twitched and jerked at anchor responding to the winds the short chop on the water and the loads being swung on board from the lighters the fleet would proceed slowly to outremer hopping from lissa corfu zante candia negroponte and points east as far as distant trebizond the loading would proceed for another week yet but already many of the ships had to stay in deeper water weddings and celebrations were fine things in their way and at the proper time but the ships must sail soon so finery and jollification were best put in the past to be talked about later now venice hummed with industry spring was here the time for trade was at hand and the ships were outbound over at the quayside the great galleys bound for flanders were at the point of final deckcargo they would not proceed slowly navigating out through the pillars of hercules and then across stormy biscay with such a voyage ahead there was no spare time to waste their stops were few but they would pause at corfuthe last safe port for a final refit at the little arsenal there the trip to corfu was a good seatrial revealing problems especially with new ships and in corfu the ship would discharge a new assistant foreman for the little arsenal umberto verrier maria knew that the new posting was in a way her own fault if she hadnt led to umbertos men capturing torfini and rossi in those first few days well umberto wouldnt have acquired a reputation for sorting out problems quickly and efficiently the more senior guilds at the arsenal were on the whole not pleased with his woodselection abilities on the other hand they were satisfied that he could fix problems and the little arsenal apparently had plenty so umberto had his new posting it was farther from venice but as he said it was in a real town maria wasnt as happy as he was about that part but at least it would be back beside the sea it was one thing to be married to umberto it was quite another to be married to umberto and feeling as if she was going to have to be responsible for his success while at the same time allowing him to bask in the illusion that his success was due entirely to his own effort and it was a third to do so while caring for a baby two babies umberto is as much a child as the little one but that was unfair he was a good man he cared for her he cares for what he thinks you are he loved the baby and that insidious voice in her head could say nothing about that she had thought that she was going be able to settle down and now they were moving again on yet another ship so umberto would be ill again two babies to tend in the close confines of a ship another set of new people to meet and deal with another strange place to try to make into a home harder this time she could not count on a fortuitous accident to show her what she needed to know and she already knew that although umberto was good enough at dealing with honest men he was lost when it came to those who were less than honest she had only traded one set of problems for another in marrying the man but he cared for her and would do his best for her even if it killed him it was up to her to see that it didnt if she could not love him she certainly owed him maria stood on the quay watching the corded trunks and canvas bundles being loaded as little alessia nestled into her arms and nuzzled maria looked down at her child and sighed to think a year ago i hadnt even been beyond the fringes of the lagoon she said half to herself and now here you are daughter off to another distant place beside her kat gazed at the ships and her eyes were still luminous with happiness maria thought that she had never seen a more contented person and yet she knew that kat was not blind to marcos faults nor for that matter was marco blind to hers they had both known exactly what they were getting into and yet they were two of the happiest people maria had ever known how very different maria thought forlornly from the way i felt after my wedding i wish you werent going kat said with a sigh or i wish we were going along with you id like to visit corfu alessia stirred and kat reached for her let me hold her a little it may be years before i see her again maria handed the baby over she watched with some amusement at how awkwardly and carefully kat took the child just on three weeks ago shed been just as tentative when i left for istria i was never coming back kat never ever now here i am again things change who knows petro dorma might get so sick of marco that hell ship you both off to corfu kat shook her head marco is as much part of venice now as the canals involuntarily maria glanced across the thronged piazza behind them to the tall pillar where the bronze statue stood or as the lion of saint mark kat nodded the lion is venice after all and marco is the lion too he cant leave maria alessia twitched gave a tentative whimper and then burst into full bellow kat rocked frantically an expression of raw panic on her face whats wrong my cherub there there help maria what is wrong i didnt do anything to her what do i do now maria found laughter a welcome gift by the smell i think shes probably done something to herself dont worry thats not whats making her cry it doesnt seem to worry her kat hastily held out alessia at full arms stretch as if she were a precious piece of porcelain suddenly found to harbor a poisonous spider maria did not reach for alessia ill show you what do about it she said cheerfully kat searched frantically for rescue ah er i see papas vinlander partners are here idid better go and speak to them ill come back and see you in just a moment she thrust the bellowing alessia at her mother and bolted maria familiar now with all the less pleasant aspects of babies took alessia off to change glancing as she went at the tall large blond contingent that kat was greeting and there hastening down the quayside from the doges palace was marco probably been to see benito benitos face when hed seen her had been quite a study she scowled as she thought about it if umberto was one sort of child benito was anothera brat a bridgebrat destined to hang no doubt but venice would not forget that latest exploit of his in a hurry being venice it would embrace it as quite a favorite story eneko lopez was on a high balcony of the doges palace his eagle eyes looking out over the jesolo marshes when marco finally tracked him down the stern visage cracked into a smile on seeing marco and how is wedded bliss marco valdosta marco felt himself blush um blissful thank you senor this reply lightened the stern visage further it is intended to be you know that is why christ sanctified the institution of marriage with his first miracle he pointed out toward the sky tell me what is happening up there marco peered into the blue id say that a bird or a pair of birds rather are being mobbed by seagulls the gulls around here can be quite territorial and there are thousands of them the part of him that was the lion stirred and so am i it said within him they do not belong here of course eneko lopez could not hear that voice and marco did not feel easy enough to explain but he knew now why the gulls were attacking the hawks the gulls were as much part of the lagoon as the water was and the hawks were the eyes of the lions ancient enemy the lion would blind that enemy if he couldand if he could not he would at least deny him the use of those eyes over venice eneko nodded a pair of what i should guess were goshawks although i am not an expert on birds are such things common over venice well ive seen hawks in the reedbrakes and barene close to the fringes of the marsh but not really out here marco temporized they dont belong here the gulls will see them off the gulls will kill them if they can i have seen two hawks in the sky rather often of late they appear to be hawks at least said eneko i have attempted to scry them birds are difficult to connect with and raptors most particularly difficult they think mostly of hunting and killing and not a great deal else well this was the opening marco had rather wondered how to make but if you were scrying and it turned out they were not hawks wouldnt you be very vulnerable he took a deep breath brother mascoli said i should ask you for help with magical defenses for protection against evil he felt the eagle gaze again mascoli is a good man but he sees only good in everything if he thought you should consult me on this i must conclude that something particularly evil happened tell me about it so marco explained eneko lopezs eyes narrowed when he came to the part about the undines and san raphaella i was aware of this i was also aware that the undines that live in the lagoon have a great deal to do with the strega mages in particular with the late luciano marina something about the way he said it filled in the word unlamented before late marco nodded but innate honesty forced him to defend chiano the strega mage might have intended to kill him to save venicebut hed also saved marcos life before that and been a friend when a terrified boy needed one and it was entirely possible probable chuckled the voice in his head that the knife had been intended for some other purpose in the ceremony bloodletting does not mean killing some ceremonies require the spilling of a token of blood given freely ask your blackrobed friend he knows luciano was a good man even if he was not a christian marco said with more firmness and he helped the undines and they liked him yes brother mascoli said it was not wrong to aid nonhumans no evil creature would come to the sanctified water and no evil creature would ask help we differ in levels of trust and points of theology said eneko dryly but continue i accept that you are a christian soul even if you are bonded to a creature about which i am less certain he smiled and i do not mean your wife whose christianity i know well enough from the counseling booth of st hypatia she gave me a lesson in honesty once when i was her counselor marco took a deep breath well according to brother mascoli it was only the strength of that other that saved me i got the fright of my life senor it was like being thistledown slapped around by a maelstrom just for an instant the ward candles nearly burned up completely in that instant whatever it was it was waiting out there for me when i went looking for the triton it was lying in ambush so to speak waiting to kill me eneko pursed his lips the power of the lion is very much tied to the area of the old marshes is it not marco nodded and you were scrying outside of this area and you were attacked marco nodded again eneko stood in thought his heavy brows hooding his eyes i conclude that chernobog still retains an interest in you i cannot see why any other creature of power should take such a risk with a mage you see as much as you are vulnerable so is your attacker i should imagine that chernobog uses an intermediary or a lesser servant rather than direct intervention still that servant is likely to be one who is himselfor herselfvery powerful and dangerous there are defenses the first one however is stay home without you the lion of saint mark would be somewhat less effective am i correct well in times of crisis one of the four families must direct the lions power agreed marco and if i am correct all that remains are three montescues and two valdostas of the old blood marco bit his lip well benito hes my halfbrother sir we had different fathers eneko nodded that is easy enough to guess without even seeing him just to judge by his behavior so in fact it is only yourself and the three montescues one of whom is away and one of whom is very elderly this is a good reason to want you dead and it is a good reason for you to keep scrying as the aspect of magepractice you use only in dire emergency however i will teach you to attack when you are attacked and how to best defend yourselfif you will agree to restrain your scrying to matters that are vital to your survival marco nodded if you will extend that to what is vital to the survival of venice then i will you see the lion is venice in a way so by defending it i defend myself too a fair caveat agreed eneko he took marco by the elbow and turned back to the chamber come let us go inside the gulls appear to have driven the hawks away gulls are less formidable than hawks but gulls are certainly more numerous marco watched with interest as eneko lopez laid out a few very simple objects four wardcandles which he placed in each corner of the room a silver mirror and of all odd things a sharp needle stuck in a cork with the mirror on a low table between them lopez invoked the four wards as marco had learned to do and set up the circle of protection around them it was all done very quickly neatly and efficiently now your first and best protection when you attempt to scry when you do not know if something is watching for you is to arrange so that you are not noticed but how do i do that marco asked by finding some other thing that is in the area and concealing yourself within it those gulls for instance scry for one of those gulls over the lagoon just now obediently marco bent over the mirror and easily called one of the gulls into its silver surface which was silver no longer but reflected the blue sky and white clouds very good now move in closer eneko instructed in the mirror and in his mind the gull loomed nearer nearer until he was looking directly into its black bright eye closer he couldnt imagine how he could do that but then that familiar warmth inside him gave him a nudge and now he looked down on the lagoon felt the wind in his feathers adjusted the tilt of his wing for better lift in a thermal good said a voice from very far away as he went very still and quiet now dont actually do anything just sit and watch and when another gull comes near make that same jump to it it wasnt long before a second gull joined the first and the two locked gazes long enough for marco to make that jump practice this for a while move from gull to gull but dont try to interfere in what they do just observe it was a littlea very littlelike being the lion the gulls didnt have much on their minds but food and flying he made the jump into four more gulls when enekos voice came back now think about flying toward the piazza and landing on one of the piers but the gull didnt want to do that he felt the resistance you could make him but that would make you noticed at the moment unless a magician was aware that you were riding this particular gull there is no way that you would be detected this is how you can scry and not be seen so find another bird and see if you can jump to one that will do what you ask it took two more birds not one before he found one that felt that landing on the pier would be a good thing this was a big strong bird who often managed to snatch food from lesser gulls down there with a tilt of its wings it made a dizzying plunge down toward the water skimmed along the surface and made a graceful landing on the stone good now reverse how you got to the first gull pull back see the gull in the mirror and before the voice was done marco was looking into the eye of a fine brighteyed gull then watching it strut nonchalantly along the stone walkway of the piazza he was startled to see that eneko lopez had his left hand firmly in the grasp of enekos own with the needle poised over it as the mirror went to ordinary silver again excuse me father but what are you doing a precaution eneko replied immediately letting go of his hand in case you got lost in the gulls thoughts a sharp reminder to your spirit that it still has a proper human body would swiftly recall you back it would marco was impressed by that he could think of any number of ways that he could practice this trick with kats help if this was the safeguard he needed to take oh yes indeed eneko smiled how are you feeling um tired he was suddenly but he knew why now this leaping about from gull to gull was something that had all come out of his own reserves can i draw on some other power to do this next time only at the risk of being noticed eneko warned you will make the gull look different to another mage if you start drawing on more power just as if another mage was to try to scry the bird you were riding he would notice you unless you take care to be very still and not draw attention to yourself but could i scry say a bird over cremona and ride it he hazarded yes lopez said but if there was anything watching for you it would find you your risk would be less once you began riding the bird but it would still be there marco nodded but what about defending myself he asked quietly that will be the next lesson i want you first to learn how to make yourself so inconspicuous when riding a bird or a beast that a mage will have to be very skilled to find you eneko softened his stern look with a little smile after all the very best defense is not to need to defend yourself at all chapter the ships made their way cautiously under oars the leadsman calling depths as ship by ship the first great spring fleet rowed around the sandspit at the end of the lido in the deeper water of the adriatic something watched if the shaman had been in his own white sea he could have named many of the denizens of the cold deep and sunk all of the vessels above here the massive eellike creature that was his seaform was restricted to watching he was eighteen cubits long but that was still not large enough to take on ships as always his bodyshape dictated his appetites ships were full of food that would be nice to suck dry he flicked his powerful tail and began swimming southward best to see if the other fleet and army was well hidden this water was too warm and the monk seals werent worth eating the galley had a number of its berths taken by the vinlanders that kat had rushed over to see maria had watched them for a few days now and she was fairly certain that the two men who looked like a pair of giant warriors were really nothing much more than boys not much older than she was they were very happy to be at sea and she had the feeling that although they probably were quite fond of their sister they were also just a little tired of having her fastened to them all the time back in venice no doubt theyd been able to get out and about on their own but here they were forced into each others company with no chance for privacy maria came out to put the wicker crib on the deck other than the helmsman the poop deck was empty except for the blond womanwho was dripping tears over the stern of the ship it looked to maria as if she might join them to splash into the water amid the kitchen peelings the cook had just tossed there maria bit her lip shed better go over and see what the matter was after all the vinlanders were kats grandfathers business partners and alessia looking like a particularly plump and pretty cherub was fast asleep maria walked over quietly moving easily with the rolling of the ship whats wrong the vinlander woman nearly fell overboard the woman sniffed hastily scuffed a sleeve across her eyes and turned to maria with a fake smile plastered over a face that still had tearstreaks running down the cheeks nothing i thank you she said i am well truly she looked as if she was going to dissolve into tears in the very next moment fine you and i are the only two women on this ship young lady and were going to the same place i think we had better be friends one thing she had noticed about the vinlanders was that they seemed to be very direct in a way that suited marias canaler sensibilities so she decided to be direct herself no you arent well she put an arm over the blondes big shoulders im not blind she continued feeling a hundred years older than this poor young thing you can tell me whats wrong im a friend of kats that earned her a look of puzzlement from the woman katerina montescue i mean katerina valdosta ah ja the girl sniffed again and bit her lipbut a tear escaped anyway you were with the bride in the beautiful crimson dressyou are the brides friend ja such a pretty girl and such a fine husband i did not recognize you in those clothes it was plain this meant a huge leap in status to the vinlander and thus in acceptability as a confidante you know them well then kats my best friend maria said and was a little surprised to realize that it was true and her husband is very very good to my people in venice any more would be too complicated to explain at one sitting maybe later i know that your she searched her memory for the word that erik used your clan is going to be trading partners with kats family and i know that kat wouldnt want to see you so unhappy if there was anything she could do to help so can i help i cannot see how the girl replied mournfully well why dont you just tell me about it maria said reasonably that cant do any harm and its better than crying here all alone over the turnip peelings the girls face worked for a moment as if she was trying to hold herself back but it all came out in a rush anyway i am so unhappy she wailed softly in tones of such anguish that they imparted a sense of heartbreak to the banal words i will never see him again for one sharpedged moment maria was tempted to join her in her tears for the words called benitos stricken face up in her own memory i will never see him again but she was older than this poor childin experience if not yearsand she held onto her composure the moment passed maria patted the blond womans arm awkwardly what the hell did you say to a cry of pain like that she settled for there there even this provoked another flood of sobbing he was such a nice man the nicest we have met here in all europe and so tall too how could something that sounded so silly also sound as if the girl had lost her first and only true love tall well that counted out benito didnt he i mean couldnt you maria floundered she really didnt know how to deal with this what happened why wont you see him again i did not want to go but bjarni said mama would never allow it i know mama would not be happy but his eyes are such a beautiful bluegray and his chin is so so squarecut and manly she sniffed and then obviously overcome by the vision shed conjured up began to cry again i cannot sleep for thinking about him she sobbed from the tone of her voice that was nothing less than the truth and a great deal less than she felt why wont your mama approve maria ventured cautiously is he married or something the woman mournfully shook her head erik is not married but he is just a lowly bodyguard we are the thordarsons we are one of the wealthiest families in vinland i cannot just marry a nithing mama wants me to marry a man of position that would help the family but but he was so wonderful she began to hiccup and maria patted her back good lord how long has she been crying like this hours days she knew all too well what the girl felt like shed been therebefore she learned just what a scumbred bastard caesare aldanto was cogs began to turn in marias head though and if this erik was the erik she knew he certainly wasnt a scumbred bastard who was he guarding she asked the vinlander girl shrugged as if anyone other than erik was of no importance at all and pulled a handkerchief out of her sleeve by the sodden look of it she had been crying for hours i do not know a guard is a guard maria bit her lip again you dont know the rest of his name do you erik what hakkonsen it is a good family maria almost choked just a bodyguard ah well have you heard of prince manfred svanhild nodded of course the heir to the emperor the son of the duke of brittany he was at the wedding her tone turned bitter it is very good for business these connections that katerina brings to the thordarsons ja well hes actually not the heir thats his cousin conrad manfreds next in line after him that makes him the third most important person in the holy roman empire which is the most powerful state in europe maybe in the whole world ja the girl said indifferently and also the duke of brittany has great standing in the league of armagh he is a very important man if only my erik could have such friends she began to sob again maria shook the womans shoulders just a little although it was like trying to shake one of those teutonic warriors that had come into venice among the knots mostly she was trying not to laugh listen to me erik hakkonsen is prince manfred of brittanys personal bodyguard and masteratarms only bodyguard is the wrong word to use to describe him its more like she scrambled for some phrase that might describe what erik did besides keeper or maybe nursemaid and if benito only had someone like that to knock some sense into him hes a sort of teacher or companion andwell he keeps manfred from getting into too much trouble being a bodyguard is just a small part of it kats friend tells me they are really much more like friends what he certainly isnt is a again she searched her memory for what the girl had said a nithing i suspect if you asked manfred he would say that erik is very important to him the sobs stopped abruptly and the blond woman stood up from the stern rail a look of fierce delight on her face really she breathed hope replacing the despair in her seablue eyes so quickly that marias breath caught maria nodded firmly really the blonde hugged maria svanhild thordardottar is forever in your debt she said thickly i must now go and turn this ship maria didnt try to tell her that you cant alter the course of a great galley in the venetian western convoy not short of being the borawind in person but by the looks of it svanhild would have a damned good try bless her heart the girl had a good steel spine to her when she wasnt sobbing in heartbreak well the captain had survived alessias bellows hed survive svanhild the next day svanhild and her two brothers sought maria out where she alessia and umberto sat in the lee of the mound of deckcargo there was a bright steely look in svanhilds eye the captain says you and your husband are going to corfu she said maria nodded do you know how often the ships sail back to venice from this port demanded svanhild and can you recommend to us a good vessel and captain not like this stupid captain we even offered to buy his ship he said it was the states ship not his to sell what kind of captain doesnt own his own ship at least as a partner umberto stared at them openmouthed then he shook his head maria was just as dumbfounded as he was buy a venetian great galley she couldnt even begin to guess how much that would take even if one were for sale we dont know corfu umberto stammered weve never been there explained maria sitting alessia up and rubbing her back the baby rewarded her with a milky belch svanhild deflated a little oh we thought but some of francescas gossip had come back to maria and shed been saving it for the next time she saw the girl but svanhild you dont want to go back to venice erik and prince manfred are coming along somewhere behind us theyre going to the holy land one of svanhilds brothers looked speculative and asked this ship will also stop in corfu umberto nodded almost all of our ships do the big vinlander patted his sister there hildiyou see it is good that we did not turn the ship we can just wait for them they wont be more than a few days behind us umberto offered helpfully a pair of weeks at the very most butif they go to the holy land svanhild began desperately then maybe the boy replied manfully maybe we need to see about the trade opportunities in the holy land too sven and olaf can go to set up the warehouse in bruges and then go back across to the family and tell them we will be delayed svanhild burst into tears again but they were tears of relief as her brothers seemed to recognize and she nodded smiling around the tears she had maria thought a lovely smile she only hoped that erik was going to be receptive to it or manfred or no manfred svanhilds brothers might just break him in half high on the hillside overlooking the sea the king of hungary watched unmoving out on the whiteflecked adriatic the venetian convoy sailed past he counted ships sixteen great galleys carrying a small volume of valuable cargo pilgrims toorich ones high quality furs from as far afield as vinland bullion amber twentythree round ships of varying size laden with salt fish timber strange that venice should export timber but really venice was just a clearing house the produce of europe was funneled through it half a dozen minor galliots carrying anything from pilgrims to arms a lot of ferrara steel went to the east he would have loved to seize that convoy just as he would have loved to seize the convoy of ships that had overwintered in outremer but it would not be wise to make the attempt even with the help of genoa or aragon or even the barbary corsairs the eastern fleet of the republic was not a target to take lightly not at sea where land bombards and fortifications could be brought into play as alexius could manage in the bosporus it might be worthwhile the atlantic fleet had been smaller but it was all great galleys so it had more men and was far faster emeric had been in no hurry to tackle that either not even outbound for flanders laden with the rich goods of the east hed get it all if he just waited the greek galleys were no match for this number of venetian ships but later when traffic was down to occasional vessels they and the dalmatian pirates out of the narenta could seize anything that came through the straits of otranto his bodyguards shivered in the bitter northeasterly wind if it would quicken to a gale he might yet have some of the loot on those ships but alas the bora was not forthcoming he must look into weathermagic some day when the last ship had begun its upwind tack he turned to go his bodyguards knew their master well enough not to utter a word they rode over the ridgeline below lay the huge sprawl of their camp nearly fifteen thousand men waited there among them four thousand of his precious magyar heavy cavalry it was a measure of the kings command that not one single fire burned the narenta pirates were too afraid of the venetians to light a fire the hungarian forces however were more afraid of their king from croat light cavalry to slav pikemen every last soul of them knew you freeze to death before you light a fire if emeric so commands three of his officers rode up to meet him looking wary the set of their shoulders altered the king noticed as he smiled his grim smile he was pleased a good general was valuable but they must fear him good generals could become threats otherwise he nodded to their bows the atlantic fleet will have left corfu another week if our informants are correct and the eastern fleet will be on its way then within two days i want us at sea nine days from now we must be on our way to corfu we need to strike fast and hard my cavalry are ready your majesty said count ladislas im still waiting on the siege cannon said the artillery commander even with double teams of oxen we keep getting stuck in the mountains your majesty the mud is over the axletrees in places another thing emerics officers learned and quickly was not to lie to him the man was scared but honest emeric knew the value of tolerating failure up to a point besides hed come over those roads himself and wasnt surprised nor did he blame the officer this early in springwhich hadnt arrived in the mountains yetthe roads were just mud or still waistdeep in snow he waved dismissively if we have to move without them we will if we have to lay siege then well have time to ship them in the relief on the officers face was amusing but best not to let it go too far two weeks mova ik or ill have your head he noted that the croat cavalry captain was looking even more tense he waited the man simply couldnt take it after a minutes silence your majesty the scouts you ordered sent out south seven of them have not come back one squad the king nodded find them youll find their bodies or their mounts then when youve found what became of them find the nearest village and crucify all the men make the women watch emeric raised a forefinger you have eight days part v april ad chapter emeric erased the circle and the pentacle scratched in a section of his pavilion where hed pulled back the carpets to expose the naked soil then he eliminated all other traces of the ritual hed followed to reach the chief of his spies on corfu cleaned himself and put the carpets back in place the work had to be done carefully since he was only guided by the light of a few candles night had long since fallen as always emeric was irritated by having to do such menial labor himself instead of ordering a servant but he dared not do otherwise even the king of hungaryeven a king suspected by his subjects to be a manwitchcould not afford to have anyone observe him at such times not at least anyone knowledgeable in such matters and it was always difficult to tell who might be several features of those rituals were satanic in nature not simple witchcraft hungary was after all a predominantly christian countryand those portions that were not christian were mostly muslim his polyglot subjects would tolerate a great deal true but not open trafficking with that prince emeric didnt particularly fear rebellion as such his army was quite capable of crushing any combination of peasants or townsmen as it had demonstrated several times over the past years the problem lay with the army itself none of emerics officers was burdened with any great moral sentiments still the open use of satanic rituals would if nothing else give an ambitious general the handle to organize and lead a military overthrow of the hungarian dynasty emeric did not follow all of his aunts advice but he had never failed to observe countess bartholdys strictures on this score keep it secret from all except those you trust and trust only those you can control finally done he soothed his irritation by ordering wine and cuffing the servant who brought it he finished the goblet ordered another and cuffed the servant again throughout it never occurred to himas it had never occurred to him beforeto wonder why his aunt had given him those secrets in the first place starting when he was a boy of six to wonder why she had violated seemingly her own rule like his master petros fianelli erased all the symbols and signs of the ritual himself in his case not in the luxury of a kings pavilion but in the squalor of a basement owned by one who appeared to be a simple seller of secondhand goods in kerkira the chief town of corfu which indeed fianelli waseven if most of his income came from the criminal ring he operated on the island as well as the subsidy he received from the king of hungary there was only one way to perform these rituals on corfu to create the symbols in fire each one was created on a special platen made of obsidian filled with oily cotton fed from a reservoir of defiled holy oil when the oil was lit the symbol burned in the element that corfu could not counter the devils own but the platens had to be carefully hidden when he was done if anyone found them it would be awkward if anyone who understood what they were for ever found them the consequences would be dire that done he took the taper and mounted the stairs to the kitchen it was a large kitchen centered around a large table little cooking was actually done in the kitchen these days since fianelli had quietly murdered his last woman a few months earlier after shed become tiresome had her murdered rather by two of his three bully boys fianelli hadnt wanted to risk it himself given his own short and pudgy stature shed been a large woman fullhipped as well as bigbreasted with the shoulders of the scuoloborn washerwoman shed been before fianelli made her his concubine no loss shed been a poor cook and fianelli preferred to dine in public eateries anyway besides it made it easier to use the kitchen for its real purpose which was to serve as the headquarters for his various criminal enterprises his three enforcers were already sitting at the table lounging back in their chairs and enjoying the bottle of grappa hed opened for them before going down to the basement all right its on he pulled out a chair and sat down himself zanari poured him a glass of grappa i just got the word none of the three enforcers asked him how hed gotten the word or from whom in truth they didnt care a large part of the reason they obeyed fianelli despite his unprepossessing appearance was that they all considered him a veritable wizard when it came to knowing the right things and the right people paulo saluzzo grimaced treasons a dangerous business the more danger the more profit grunted fianelli besides what do you care who rules corfu im from florence by way of naples i could care less whether this island is run by venetians or greeks or hungariansor manticores or unicorns for that matter so long as we get our cut well get it and then some whats next asked zanari fianelli considered for a moment the casarini bitch i think if you want to betray a town under siege youve got to have an inside link with the big shots she can get it we cant the third enforcer hitherto slouched in his chair sat up straighter smiling slightly he emitted a soft whistle hed seen bianca casarini in the streets from time to time fianelli scowled at him forget her good looks papeti just forget it the enforcer frowned obviously a bit puzzled fianelli normally didnt care in the least what his men did with women he hadnt even cared knowing full well that papeti and zanari would have raped his discarded woman before they cut her throat and sank her in the sea casarinis dangerous never mind the details just take my word for it this is strictly business the enforcer shrugged but since the gesture was one of acceptance not indifference fianelli let it go he wasnt planning on using papeti as his intermediary with bianca casarini anyway casarini lived in one of the better parts of the citadel the venetian elite wouldnt tolerate someone moving in their quarters who looked like a thug especially a greek one of his three enforcers saluzzo was the only one who could carry off the needed pose in that area there were traces left of the florentine bravo hed been in an earlier life thisll be your job paulo i dont know where she lives only seen her in the streets and cafes a few times you dont need to know where she lives for the moment just approach her on the street tomorrow shell be passing by the corner where the dockroad crosses the road to the inner wall gates you knowwhere dendragos old bakehouse used to be how do i know shell be there there was a whining undertone in saluzzos voice like any such man he hated to workand for him spending a day lounging about waiting for someone to show up who might not constituted work dont worry about it shell be there fianelli spoke with confidence hed taken the time after receiving his instructions from emeric to use the magical symbols and rituals to speak to casarini herself that very moment bianca casarini finished the samevery close at leastsatanic procedures in her case in the luxurious room her aunt and uncle had provided for her in their house in kerkira after her arrival on the island the year before the face of her mistress appeared hovering like a ghost above the bowl they have approached me mistress as you predicted countess bartholdy smiled cheerfully surely you didnt doubt me this was dangerous territory surely not mistress bianca said quickly do as they say then elizabeth commanded she cocked her head a little studying the woman who had become over the past few years something very close to her slave bartholdys quick mind had detected the slight traces of discomfiture surely the fact that some of it will be unpleasanteven worse undignifieddoes not bother you again dangerous territory surely not mistress the countesss beautiful face became just a bit taut harsh even insofar as that term could ever be applied to it immortality has its price bianca casarini many prices rather cavorting about with whomever i require you to cavort with and copulating with animalseven real onesis one of the least so do as they tell you i need to remain informed at all times concerning the progress of their treachery once the siege begins my own plans require precise timing she did not explain what those plans were and bianca did not ask did not even think of asking in fact by now she was well trained yes mistress bianca was able to say the last rather easily her own mind was quick as well and shed already realized that she could shift the worst of the work onto anothers shoulders several others in fact in the year since shed been living on corfu shed ingratiated herself into the social circles of the venetian aristocrats and the greek libri doro with the skills shed learned from countess bartholdy shed been able to detect which of them possessed inner demons and vices the ones which were most obvious at least shed start with sophia tomaselli she decided when the time came the wife of the captaingeneral would be easy like leading a pig to a trough after the image of bartholdy vanished and shed erased the symbols bianca laughed aloud leading a slut to an orgy more like casarini was beautiful herself if not to the extent that bartholdy was but unlike the countess a sneer distorted her features badly so from long practice she suppressed the expression that was a bit difficult thinking about the wife of captaingeneral tomaselli after a bit of practice sophia wouldnt care if her partners were pigs in a trough that sour thought was suppressed even more firmly than the sneer had been the day would come bianca knew when shed have to undergo the rituals of bestialism herself immortality had its prices but there was no reason to dwell on any of them beforehand the last work in erasing the traces of the rituals was on her now bianca made no attempt to keep the distaste from showing on her face a simple expression of distaste unlike an outright sneer was expected on the face of a noblewoman which she was not in actual fact but had long since mastered the art of appearing to be shed even successfullyand easilyfooled her relatives into thinking she was their niece she brought the bowl to her lips it wasnt the taste that bothered her blood was blood the problem was that there was so much of it that had to be drunk she was normally a light eater and drank little beyond an occasional glass of watered wine but it had to be done so she got on with it she comforted herself with the thought that at least she hadnt had to drink the nieces blood there had been no rituals necessary in that work the silk scarf bianca had used to strangle the girl had left no messy traces at all it was odd really elizabeth bartholdy discovered herself these days often coming to visit the monster in the glass jar true shed created the thing and she usually enjoyed studying her handiwork but the unnatural elemental fetus shed brought into being was unpleasant to look upon even worse perhaps was the aura of malevolence that emanated so strongly from the trapped monster as to permeate the entire chamber where she kept it nonetheless she came almost every day the creature was the blade shed created for a masterstroke and if the stroke succeeded moved by a sudden thought she left the chamber in the dungeons and made her way through the castle to her special bathing room once there she studied the obsidian bathtub gleaming with the sheen of oil in the light it had taken a year to get it carved and polished and she had gone through several craftsmen not to mention blocks of volcanic glass before one had managed to complete the task without shattering the tub now she regarded it as a carpenter might measure a cabinet ill need a bigger one better order the work started on it now this will be no dainty little virgin chernobogs blood will slop over in buckets each drop worth more than diamonds chapter maria looked around the whitewashed empty house it was made mostly of stone with plaster over the stone and a floor of flagstones the windows were small but they had glass in them in wooden frames that could be opened it wasnt much not compared to the wooden home in istria the few other houses here were crowded around like quizzy neighbors it was on a small scale reminiscent of cannaregio the house is a big improvement on benitos little place in cannaregio though she thought a smile tugging at her lips you could be happy in all sorts of places if you tried still from what the porters had said any house here on corfu was a symbol of status from what maria could see there wasnt much to build with except rock and that had to be quarried from the main island itself there were only a handful of houses up here between the two fortificationtopped hills of the small island that formed the citadel corfus great fortress the two hills were in a straight line running out to sea hence the fortress on the seaward side was called the castel a mar the one on the landward side the castel a terra the town of kerkira itselfcorfus largestwas on the main island separated from the citadel by a shallow channel perhaps sixty yards wide at its narrowest dimension the town and the citadel were connected by a causeway and a bridge most of the other staff of the outpost lived between the outer and inner curtainwalls of the citadel or in the barracks built into the walls of the fortifications only a few most of them high officials and their families lived in one of the castles on the hilltops she pushed open the shutters looking out over the citadel at the bright waters across to the brown smudge they told her was albania the spring sunshine licked in at her along with the tang of salt in the breeze off the sea awash with a sudden need for affection maria turned to the wicker crib and lifted alessia into her arms and hugged her alessia was sleepy full and warm the baby made the small groaning sound that maria had learned meant contentment and seemed to snuggle into her maria stood there rocking her loving her lessi its a home and its near the sea its peaceful and youll always have a mama umberto came in and smiled at the madonnalike scene when maria turned at his footstep how is the most beautiful chubbiest baby on this island doing he asked cheerfully umbertos attitude toward babies now that alessia was born was far more relaxed he was as proud of the baby as any father could have been admittedly he still didnt look comfortable holding her but he did delight in her maria smiled at him her good mood spilling over onto everything around her shes fine umberto smiled back the house is good enough he asked cautiously it is not as big as in istria its wonderful that was an exaggeration but so what at the moment it felt a minor one the whole place feels welcoming good umberto was plainly relieved theyll be bringing our boxes and things up from the ship presently can you come with me to be introduced to the captaingeneral then i must get down to the little arsenal he shook his head it is in a sorry state the old foreman is well old they walked along the narrow lane up to the gray stone fortress on the hilltop it was cool here inside the thick walls a guard a bit more sloppily dressed than any venetian schiopettieri or one of the doges swiss mercenaries led them up to the captaingenerals office the door was open and the voices of those inside it were quite clear to anyone approaching we dont have accommodation for visitors signorina snapped a sharp voice from inside i cant help it if you think that kerkiras taverns are too lowclass for you rent a house we have been trying to ja maria recognized svanhilds distinctive voice and accent she sounded tired everything decent they want a years lease on we should only be here for days rumbled a deeper similarly accented voice that must be one of svanhilds brothers thought maria usually they hire for either the summer or winter to fit in with the convoys explained the sharp voice definitely a venetian probably the captaingeneral himself thought maria oh dear umberto would have to work under him and he did not sound like an easy man you should be able to negotiate a six month lease but we only want it for a few days until the eastbound convoy comes said the svanhild voice unhappily maria peered into the room it was svanhild indeed and both of her large brothers and a comparatively small dark man at a large untidy desk the room was generously proportioned but it looked overfull of irritated vinlanders the man at the desk sighed snatched a piece of parchment from his desk and scrawled something on it here count dentico has an estate outside of the town he has a second villa some miles away perhaps he would be prepared to lease it to you for such a period perhaps there will be rooms enough for your escort i do not know now please i have business to attend to he pointed to the door you can hire horses and a local guide at the taverna just across the spianada goodbye svanhild and her brothers emerged the statuesque blonde blinked to see maria and umberto what are you doing here she asked though her surprised tone made it very clear that she was not being rude we have come to see the captaingeneral said maria my husband will be working here svanhild sniffed and rubbed her hot forehead leaving a little smudge he is not a very helpful man she said unhappily and walked off following her brothers the military commander of corfu stood up and limped across to the doorway he looked at umberto and maria and glared magnificently this is not an inn or an employment office umberto looked more than a little terrified my name is verrier i have been sent from venice i am to be a foreman the glaring eyes cleared ah you must the man theyve sent to deal with the little arsenal weve had some problems with the local labor and the guilds the captaingeneral bowed to maria this beautiful lady must be your wife i am captaingeneral nico tomaselli for my sins the council has stationed me here come in he added in a more pleasant tone of voice as he walked back to his desk you must tell me how i can serve you my people were supposed to see you in to your home and invite you to come up to see me the little arsenal is the heart of this outpost of the empire maria scowled at him behind his back then quickly smoothed her expression into something more pleasant she was always wary with people who handed out the flattery too liberally especially when shed seen the same person ready to backhand those he disliked or looked down upon but at least he was not letting his anger with svanhild wash onto umberto though poor svanhild could hardly know that the conditions she had found in venice would not hold in corfu umberto bowed umberto verrier i am a mastercraftsman in the guild of caulkers i had heard there were problems i mean i had been told that there were some difficulties that needed smoothing out could you tell me more the captaingeneral shrugged its quite simple really the local men whom we employ as laborers in the repairyard are an undisciplined bunch theyll do any job the journeymen complain theyre encroaching the locals say that as they cant be apprenticed why should they obey prentice rules they all drink too much and get into fights about it umberto who was a slight man looked alarmed in the shipyard but guild rules the captaingeneral blew out through his teeth were a long way from the guild halls of venice signor if you throw one of these guildsmen out it may be six months before you can replace him the greek labor should be easy but the honest truth is they dont much like working here the venetians say theyre lazy but the truth is that theyre an independent lot greeks live on past glories and expect to be treated as if they were all sons of ulysses or odysseus as theyll insist he should be called tomasellis practiced glare was back this time aimed at the open window and the town beyond i can guarantee you wont be there for more than a week before you have at least one of the greeks calling you an uncivilized italian upstart theres always trouble weve got a fair number of illyrians from the mainland as a result and they fight with the greeks too he shrugged as i said theres always trouble youll need a firm hand part of the problem is that they work frantically for about six weeks a year the rest of the time there really isnt enough work for half of them but to keep a skilled force weve got to employ them all year round umberto had the look of man who in the attempt to avoid a dog turd had stepped into a scorpion pit instead the town fanned out from the citadel on the main body of the island maria crossed the causeway and walked south toward the quayside she had asked for directions to the market areas and got several vague pointers in this direction it made sense this was where the ships came in this was where the traders would congregate as she got closer she realized she could have just followed her nose the stalls along the pavements were full of things that were both familiar and fascinatingly different barrows piled high with crocks of olives bunches of dried fish boxes of filberts trays of fried cuttlefish mounds of cheeses jostled with racks of embroidered jackets and starched white fichus next was what was plainly a baker with the enticing smells of fresh bread and a display of strange stickylooking confectionary maria went into the narrow little shop and up to the counter where a little darkeyed woman studied her with undisguised curiosity in a smallish town like this the shopkeepers probably knew most of their customers the little women bobbed and how may i help you kyria kyria what does that mean she asked tilting her head to one side the shopkeeper smiled at her curious and friendly tone you are new to corfu it is a polite greeting it means milady how do you like our town are you just here with the fleet or do you stay on in corfu a woman bustled in wearing an elegant walking dress with her hair dressed up on combs in the height of last years venetian fashion she paused briefly beside maria waiting for her to cede her place then when maria didnt move shoved her aside make way for your betters woman she snapped maria had never taken very kindly to being pushed around and this woman had bumped alessia into wakefulness maria had broad shoulders and strong arms from sculling a gondola ill have three dozen of those the woman found her orders cut off abruptly by a strong arm pulling her backwards i was here first you can wait your turn the womans jaw dropped she caught it pinched her lips took a deep breath and emitted a screeching do you know who i am youyou she looked at marias fairly plain unfashionable garb you corfiote puttana maria put alessia down carefully i dont care who you are but if you like i can throw you into the harbor to cool off with luck your head will go underwater and spare me from having to stare anymore at what the elderly maiden aunts of the case vecchie were wearing last year the last part of the statement made the womans eyes bulge she looked uncommonly like one of those fancy poodles that had become the latest fashion among the case vecchie of venice her eyebulge was more fashionable than her hairstyle youyou how dare you ill tell my husband of your insolence do then i can toss him into the harbor too said maria advancing on the woman hes clearly not doing his duty in beating you often enough to curb that tongue of yours the woman retreated tripping over her petticoats in her haste you havent heard the last of this you corfiote cow maria turned back and retrieved alessia who was going into full wail it took her a short while to soothe her down the little woman shook her head incredulously kyria do you know who that was maria shook her head her temper cooling no who that is the wife of the captaingeneral sophia tomaselli maria said something very indelicate the little woman just about fell apart laughing and trying to restrain herself they say thats what she was before the marriage maria gritted her teeth shed better tell umberto about this it was not a very promising start to their stay in corfu she bought some fresh bread and headed back to the house umbertos gloomy expression got deeper when she told him about it more troubles im getting somewhere with the senior journeymen i am not winning with the corfiotes or the other masters oh well we must expect things to take time there is a reception and dinner tonight for the new people sent out by the senate we will have to attend maria had done certain small adaptations to the dress she had worn for kats wedding she only had five dressesthough that was more than she would have ever dreamed of owning once more than most ordinary women would ever own this one however was special francesca with her impeccable eye had picked out the fabric from among all of the gowns that had once graced kats mother francescas dressmaker had remade it knowing it would adorn one of the ladies who would get an enormous amount of attention at the wedding the dressmaker had wanted to be absolutely certain of two things first that the dress would fill every aspirant of fashion in the casevecchie with a desire to own it and second that the owner would love the dress so much that she would send all those who asked about it to madame therase and indeed the dressmaker had succeeded beyond her expectations even among the haut monde of venice by the standards that prevailed in little outoftheway corfu the winered gown would excite envy to a fever pitch the red velvet with a pattern woven into it of high and low pile was the sort of stuff that would never go out of style and was appallingly expensive the low square neckline and the flattened bosom were of the very latest style as was the natural waistline rather than the line that came just under the bosom as was proper in a married woman the undergown of the finest linen covered most of her exposed chest right up to the collarbone and it was pulled through the myriad small slashings in the sleeves which were faced with scarlet silk the sleeves themselves were enormous like a couple of hams maria often thought that she could probably smuggle most of what her old poleboat used to carry in those sleeves they ended in tight cuffs though which would make getting anything into them rather impractical the beautiful pillowlace that finished the sleeves of the undergown showed at the cuffs and trimmed the edge of the undergowns neckline the bodice of the overgown was sewn with tiny seed pearls in a latticework pattern a pattern that was repeated on the sleeves the captaingenerals wife had worn a gown with a high waist and no slashings in the sleeves at all and while her gown for this festivity would probably be of more opulent materials maria doubted that it would be of more recent date jewelry well she only had two pieces theyd not pass a jewelers eye but the three ropes of pearls of glass and fishscale would stand up to any lesser scrutiny francesca had seen to that and if anyone knew jewelry it was a courtesan and there were earrings to match maria felt some pride when she looked at herself in the mirror she gave a vixenish grin at the elegant woman with her dark lustrous hair done up a la didon as francesca had showed her she was sorry that caesare couldnt see her like this then shed have been able to spit in his face and laugh at him hed always played her origins against her in a nasty game designed to keep her feeling at once utterly inferior to him and at the same time terribly grateful that he deigned to honor her with his attentions she could see that now with the benefit of looking back from a distance and from the positively old age of nineteen she bit her lips to redden them make them fuller and used just a touch of belladonna around her eyes to make the pupils widen umbertos sharp intake of breath when he saw her brought a smile to her face she took his arm and allowed him to reverently escort her to the reception feeling a wave of warmth for her husband yes granted umberto was unimaginative often even stodgyin bed as well as everywhere elsewith not a trace of caesares golden charm or benitos wit and bravura and so what he was conscientious considerate kindly scrupulously responsible in his family duties and in his own sometimes fussy and always respectable way he doted on her that was its own treasure after all which she would repay in full with loyalty and affection maria did not love umberto not really but slowly and steadily she was growing very fond of the man the captaingeneral and his wife stood beside the elderly podesta and his wife to welcome the guests maria managed to keep an absolute deadpan face when she was introduced sophia tomaselli did not the captain generals wife saw the face first and then just as she was about to explode took in the elegant hairstyling and the dress maria smiled vaguely at her as if shed never seen the now ashenfaced woman in her life before it got worse the podestas wife was frail and white haired she smiled at maria with genuine warmth instead of the case vecchiegreetingthelowlyscuolo attitude that the captaingeneral and his wife adopted my dear maria welcome to corfu i have had a letter from the doges ward about you begging my kindness to a dear friend marco tells me you are a close friend of his wifes who was of the casa montescue the little whitehaired woman twinkled at her husband making light of a friendship between one of the scuolo and a case vecchielongi house like montescue my dear alexio stole me away from that scamp lodovico montescue lodovico was a terrible tearaway when i was young the scandal of the town but very charming i remember him with great fondness have you met him i yes i know him milady he is a grand old man gallant as anyone half his age he can still be very charming the podestas wife laughed and patted marias arm i am delighted to hear it we must have a talk later i cant wait to hear what that old rogue has been up to i look forward to it milady said maria with trepidation how would she cope with case vecchie gossip it was bad enough keeping her mouth shut in case her tongue betrayed her origins in a crowd where everyone simply said polite nothings back thenseveral lifetimes ago it seemedshed dreamed of being fine enough to be a case vecchie wife for the aristocratic caesare well a mastercraftsmans wife stood far lower on the social scale but it was still a long step from canalwoman a oneonone conversation would be hell but for umbertos sake shed had to try maria couldnt help flicking a glance at the captaingeneral and his wife sophia tomasellis face was white under her makeup and two red spots burned in her cheeks maria didnt need to look at her fulminating eyes to know that shed acquired an enemy for life aside from their confrontation now thanks to marcos wellmeaning attempt to smooth her path the woman also knew that maria and umberto had powerful political connections if maria knew anything about that kind of woman the captaingenerals wife wouldnt let that stop her shed just honey her spite in publicand plot scheme and gossip in private and doubtless nag that husband of hers he poor man obviously knew his wifes expressions well he was already looking nervous then maria realized shed done more than merely make the captaingenerals wife look like she was wearing her mothers unaltered gown which someone like sophia tomaselli would consider an insult of the first water umberto smiled at her phillipo here tells me you have quite stolen signora tomasellis thunder my dear she is used to being the center of attention everyone in our community considered her to be the most beautiful lady on the island tonight there are far more people looking at you you cast her into the shade he meant it well but maria was hardpressed not to groan all it needed was that she looked across the hall to where sophia was saying something to two other women they both suddenly glanced at her and hastily looked away chapter she stood at the head of the stone breakwater her long blond hair streaming like a banner in the wind farther back along the breakwater maria could see the inevitable brothers were lounging against some crates along with four or five of their vinlander escort to the north the galleys of the outremerbound venetian convoy cut the bright water under full sail maria suppressed a chuckle svanhild was making absolutely certain that the first thing that erik saw was going to be her the dockyard tarts were also on the quayside but svanhild was making damn sure she got her hooks set before the islands hookers did but that wasnt really fair maria knew she was thinking like a canaler the vinlander woman wouldnt see it that way her heart might know what she was really doing but her head would be telling her that she only wanted to get the first possible sight of the convoy and of erik maria left off watching the convoy coming in they were still under sail theyd have to drop their sails and come in to port under oars maria hoped svanhild felt like a good long stand because she was going to be on her feet there for a while but maria couldnt wait about she had food to prepare the one thing that corfu had going for it was the presence in the market of even better fish than were available in venice shed bought some small octopus this morning umberto loved them and he was having a rough enough time at work for maria to wish to improve his day just a little umberto was used to working within the framework of rigid guild discipline where a mastercraftsman said something and was obeyed instantly and precisely here away from venice what was needed was a sharp clout from the master before the prentices would stop their pretense of immobility the small house was redolent with the scent of zuppa con popli and umberto was still sitting with a glass of white wine the frownlines easing around his eyes and forehead when someone knocked at the door maria went to it angry cant you even leave the master to eat his meal in peace she yelled the little arsenal would work day and night now until the fleet left and she expected it to be yet another problem for umbertos attention but when she flung the door open she saw it wasnt someone from the shipyard instead it was a very woebegone looking svanhild and her brothers and their men the narrow roadway seemed very full of large vinlanders maria was taken entirely aback oh i i thought it was someone for my husband from the shipyard im so sorry erik is not on the ships by the reddened eyes svanhild had already been crying the poor womanchild seemed to spend her life crying oh that seemed a very inadequate thing to say maria knew the vinlanders had almost certainly extended their stay in europe for a whole season on the basis of what shed told them about eriks plans the only reason they were here at all was because of what shed said about the convoys stopping at corfu i know prince manfred is definitely going to the holy land she protested katerina told me herself and she got that from uh from mademoiselle de chevreuse shes ah a close friend of the prince none of them are on the convoy svanhild repeated halfwailing ive lost him i believe i can help you my lady said umberto diffidently from the table where he had hastily risen to his feet prince manfred and his knights of the holy trinity are coming with four special great galleys that have been built for service off cyprus i heard from the admiral of the outremer fleet that they were doing final outfitting in the arsenal the day his fleet left he says they should not be more than a week behind the outremer convoy gloomily he added the little arsenal will be sore pressed to fix those vessels as well if we havent got the outremer fleet out by then it was like the sun coming out on svanhilds face again and it looked as if she would gladly have flung herself at umberto and kissed him if it hadnt been so improper to do so so maria did just that for her he was a good man far enough away from the house not to be spotted in the darkness two women studied the figure standing in the doorway talking to the enormous and crude vinlanders sophia tomasellis expression was tight and pinched with anger that of her friend bianca casarini simply cool and calculating maria verriers face was illuminated fairly well by the lamps inside her house after a moment bianca turned away and began walking slowly toward the castel a terra ill recognize her sophia whenever i see her again let me give the matter some thought you should have seen her earlier hissed tomaselli the slut she must have spread her legs for half the case vecchie to afford a dress like thather a scuolos wife umberto verrier is not exactly a scuolo murmured bianca yes he started as a simple guildsman but he occupies a considerably more prestigious position these days she glanced at sophias face which was momentarily welllit by a lamp in a taverna they were walking past be careful sophia she said softly whatever her past maria verrier is wellconnected now better than you are to be honest and her eyes slid down to sophias midriff please take no offense but shes also got a child as bianca expectedthe tomaselli woman was so predictablethat drew an angry glare but even sophia had enough sense to understand the point a married woman with a child in provincial corfu even more than in venice had a certain aura of respectability that a childless wife like sophia didnt especially when the wife in question had now been married for several years to a man as generally disliked as captaingeneral nico tomaselliand was herself detested by almost everyone except her cronies over time quietly snickering remarks had spread speculating either on sophias frigidity or her husband nicos impotenceneither of which enhanced her status at all they walked on in silence for a bit diffidently bianca cleared her throat querini has been no help i take it sophias scowl was heavy enough to spot even in the sliver of moonlight that pig bad enough he ruts like one but he doesnt even manage the job ah his lovemaking does leave a lot to be desired in the way of finesse i admit i rather enjoy his energy myself but then she issued a soft laugh ive been taking precautions to make sure i dont get pregnant unlike you i have no convenient husband to assume hes the father again they walked on in silence for a time and again bianca cleared her throat i have another lover who might do the tricktwo actuallybut hearing the pause sophia seemed to shrivel a bit you think its me bianca tell me the truth casarini kept the surge of triumph from showing hard that she truly enjoyed snaring her prey i hate to say it but it could be yes crude he may be but querinis certainly not impotentand i know of at least two bastards hes sired sophia tomaselli seemed to shrivel still further bianca watched sidelong gauging the moment i might be able to help there she added i know someone whos well a stregamage i think or something else but similar sophia made a face bianca laughed softly again no no sophia not what you think ha aldo morandos no shriveled up crone thats for sure quite a handsome devil actually in fact ive been considering well the point is hes an accomplished apothecary and knows a number of magics have you i certainly wasnt trying to get pregnant my problem was the opposite actually if morandos as good at fertility as he was at abortion youll be fine they were now near the entrance to the castel a terra where the tomasellis lived bianca drew to a halt so do you want me to set you up with him sophia didnt hesitate yes she hissed if i could get that problem taken care of she glanced over her shoulder back the way theyd come her eyes narrow that bitch bianca issued her soft friendly laugh again and placed a hand on tomasellis shoulder one thing at a time sophia ill give someha she broke off as if struck by a sudden thought what is it it just occurred to me that morando might well be of help on that problem also apothecaries and magicworkersgood ones anyway which he isoften know you know poisons hexes curses the words seemed to fill sophia tomasellis figure removing any trace of hunched shoulders yes set it up for me with this morando bianca bianca nodded and began to turn away headed toward her own domicile in a less prestigious part of the citadel but sophia stopped her with a sudden hug youre such a good friend that was a bit startling it was the first time sophia had ever expressed any affection for bianca beyond the gossipy and sniping camaraderie of two women of like temperament their friendship was close after all these months that bianca had spent cultivating it but only in the sense that two spiteful conspirators were intimate with each other there had never been any warmth in the thing before immediately bianca returned the embrace rather fiercely in fact partly to maintain the posebut mostly to disguise the sheer thrill from showing she loved that moment when the trap was sprung well asked morando closing the door behind her and giving bianca his wellpracticed arching eyebrow morando bianca knew thought the expression gave him a certain enticingly satanic air it did in fact studying him for a moment bianca decided to let him finally seduce her that would help snare him as well all the more so because a man of morandos type invariably thought of himself as the conqueror of all prey predators were the easiest besides bianca was tired of querinis clumsy lovemaking herself shed only initiated the affair and continued it in order to tangle sophia tomaselli in her web morando would probably make a pleasant change if nothing else hed be too suave to grunt well he repeated its done she should be coming here before much longer morando waved at the table where an open bottle waited and two glasses not all that suave alas so be it bianca had had worse and would have much worse in the future gracefully she slid into one of the chairs and allowed morando to fill her a glass before it was halffinished shed accepted his invitation to tour his establishment it proved to be quite a bit more impressive than shed expected later after morando fell asleep she slid out of the bed and tiptoed into the hallway there she paused for a moment listening carefully to be sure that she hadnt awakened morando fortunately he snored though not as badly as querini yes he was sleeping soundly bianca made her way to the flagstone in the floor that was actually a trapdoor prying it up slowly and carefully making sure to remain silent she peered down into the darkness all she could see in the dim light were a few steep wooden stairs she rose and padded still nude to the door to the bedroom after listening for a moment longer to morandos snores she decided he was a heavy enough sleeper to risk further investigation she went to the kitchen and picked up the oil lamp burning there with it in hand she returned to the trapdoor and went quickly down the steps she left the flagstone pried up rather than closing it behind her that was a bit risky perhaps but less risky than finding herself unable to lift it when she wanted to emerge the damn thing was heavy once she was down in the cellar she spent little time examining what was obvious morando had already shown it to her in the tour hed given her earlier shed had a hard time to keep from laughing then and now found herself smiling sarcastically morando had been quite proud of his secret magical lair dropping a number of hints that he was even skirting the edges of satanic rituals but to someone like bianca casarini for whom those rituals were a reality and had been for several years morandos fakery was obvious the man was a charlatan pure and simple somewhere along the lineperhaps in milan in the days when casarini had first met him as they each plied their separate swindleshed learned just enough of the trappings to be able to put on a reasonably good show good at least to anyone who didnt know the truth she wasnt interested in any of that the only reason she examined the satanic altar at all was to check for a secret passageway there was none as shed expected that would be too obvious there had to be a bolthole somewhere morando would not overlook something that basic the man might be a charlatan when it came to magic but aldo morando was a genuine professional when it came to his real trade trades rather since morando was many things procurer swindler narcotics peddler seller of information anything really that was outside the law and involved no muscular effort other than copulation when bianca had discovered him on the island a month or so after she arrived herself shed practically crowed with glee hed make the perfect instrument for her plans countess elizabeth bartholdys plans rather working through morando bianca could manipulate both sophia tomaselli and king emerics agent on the island fianelli eventually she found the bolthole it was hidden not by cleverness but by the crude expedient of size an entire wall in a very small side chamber in the cellar could be swung aside not easily or quickly though at least morando kept the hinges well oiled bianca frowned morando was getting careless hed been on corfu too long two years longer than casarini herself and it was evident that hed picked up some of the slack nature of corfus society in milan hed have made sure to have a bolthole he could get through in a hurry duke viscontis agents were ferociously shrewd as well as ferociously brutal so be it bianca casarini had no intention of finding herself trapped in that cellar after all shed mainly wanted to find the secret escape route to see if she could get in not out the countess wanted the coming siege protracted long enough to force her nephew emeric to come to her for help eventually however the hungarians would overwhelm the citybiancas orders were to delay emerics victory not prevent it and when that day came she wanted to be well out of the rapine and carnage that was sure to follow it had occurred to her when morando gave her his tour earlier that the cellar would make the ideal place to hide during the sack of kerkira shed have to make sure that morando was out of the way by then of course but bianca was not particularly concerned about that most likely in the long months of the approaching siege morando would outsmart himself and get arrested by the islands venetian authorities if not bianca herself would see to his removal when the time came after with considerable effort prying the wall open wide enough to slip through bianca used the oil lamp to guide her down the narrow passageway beyond she had to stoop bent almost double to make her way through it the tunnelit could hardly be called a corridorlooked to be ancient in its construction it had probably been built when the stone building was first erected centuries earlier it wasnt long some twenty yards down after a single sharp bend sophia found herself in front of a grating looking out onto an alley the grating was old too the iron coated in rust from the outside to anyone passing by in the narrow andshe had no doubt though she couldnt really see it in the dim light thrown by the oil lampfilthy garbagestrewn alleyway the grating would attract no notice at all a town as old as kerkira had a multitude of such architectural oddities inspecting with her fingers she discovered that here also morando had taken care to oil the hinges on the inside of the grating he hadnt grown that careless when and if the time came the grating could be openedwhere most such would be rusted shut so all that remained was to examine the latch it was a simple bolt on the insideher sideof the grating tucked out of sight of anyone in the alley she experimented a bit and satisfied herself that she could reach through the grating and pry it open when the time came a good nights work now moving quickly bianca retraced her steps and soon enough was silently lowering the flagstone over the secret entrance to the cellar she returned the oil lamp to the kitchen then made a quick inspection of her body to make sure there were no telltale traces of her activities beyond cleaning the soles of her feet and wiping her hands on a rag there was nothing bianca unlike morando had not grown careless with the passage of time she returned to the bedroom and eased her way back into the bed morando grunted faintly as her weight depressed the mattress but didnt wake up bianca started to sneer in the darkness sloppy oaf but she removed the expression almost instantly first reminding herself that she had a powerful motive for always remaining careful which morando lackedher quest for immortality and secondly reminding herself that too many sneers would eventually disfigure her face eternity was forever chapter benito was frogmarched onto the galley still with leg irons on the justices were making absolutely sure he didnt escape he thought grumpily as if hed want to while he was still here in venice hed spent a number of days in prison any one of which was a day too many it had brought home to him just how valuable being able to do things really wasespecially being able to come and to go at times of your own choosing reluctantly benito came to acknowledge that maybe marco knew him better than he knew himself staring at those walls for a solid year would indeed have driven him crazy and if the food wasnt quite as bad as the swill the casa dandelo had fed their slaves it was pretty close even the water was vile wine was a vain dream so he kept his head down he kept his mouth shut and he behaved himself irons and all it was only when he saw erik hakkonsen with manfred staring down at him that he realized theyd played yet another trick on him erik had the keys to his manacles they dangled loosely but obviously from his left hand i have been given the duration of the voyage to corfu to drill some sense into you said erik coldly i have nine days perhaps so we will start right now you will address me as sir you will speak only when you are spoken to and if you arent quick enough to do as you are told i will beat you what the hell am i doing on board ship with you bonito blurted more in surprise than anger he got a sharp slap about the ear from erik have you already forgotten what i have told you sir speak when you are spoken to do everything as fast as your flesh will allow benito found himself fiery mad clear through to the core why the hell should he put up with this it wasnt as if hed been alone in his carousing manfred had been there too he stuck his chin out make me in later years he would say that this proved the wise proposition that stupidity provides its own punishment erik proceeded coldly and methodically to prove that yes he could make benito do what he was told to do or at least regret that he had failed to do it as he lay against the bulkhead later groaning he looked up when manfred leaned over the princes grin was cheerful but sympathetic best just do it benitoboy erik is mad with both of us for partying when he thought i was tucked up in my little bed whats even worse hes crossed in love hes in the vilest temper ive ever seen him most of the knights are creeping around on tiptoes me too benito heard eriks ominous voice manfred i think it is time that you and i had a little more drill together manfreds big shoulders shook with suppressed laughter not again erik you beat up benito for a while that should do youve got all the way to jerusalem to take it out on me and my ribs are still sore from yesterday eriks face loomed over him his chill eyes back on benito up he said you arent nearly as damaged as you think you are and once youve warmed up properly most of your bruises will stop hurting benito was engaged in eriks idea of warmingup exercises which he suspected would have him dead on the deck when relief in the shape of marco and kat arrived to bid him farewell and to his surprise petro dorma was with them petro had brought with him benitos rapier main gauche and also several porters with the rest of benitos clothing you sail within the hour and it may be some years five perhaps before i see you again i have taken one liberty i have given to your grandfather the broken sword that was in the armoire in your room the duke requested it he says he will have it reforged since one day you may wish to give it back to sforza in which case he says it will be more useful if has a point with which you can drive it home i will have it sent to you somehow that polite civility made it all worse thank you and petro yes im really sorry i made all this trouble its just petro smiled that is behind us you understand that as the doge i have to be seen to be fair dispensing justice rewards and punishments with an impartial hand even to my wards perhaps especially to my wards now go well enjoy corfu report to my senior factor there couldnt i go somewhere else begged benito please no petro shook his head emphatically you will just have to learn to live with her there too i suggest you go and see her make your peace if after a year or two i hear good reports from my factor you will be transferred elsewhere to learn more of how the dorma business is conducted now farewell godspeed and try to stay out of trouble boy benito swallowed ill do my best petro the farewell to marco was harder he wouldnt be seeing his brother for years theyd never been apart for more than a month even when marco was hiding out in the jesolo marshes at least benito had always known where he could try to find him if he needed to now it would be a long time before they saw each other again goodbye marco im sorry ive been such a fool marco was as gracious as petro and more understanding perhaps after all hed done stupid things for love too weve both done that benito please take care i know you usually ended up looking after me but i wont be there to help remember to write to us i will said benito gruffly kat i hope i didnt spoil your special day for you you know i wish you both to be very very happy kat smiled radiantly at him i dont think anyone could have spoiled the day for us benito and we didnt even know about your adventure anyway until after lunch the next day she blushed rosily and looked sidelong at marco we didnt get out of bed until then benito reevaluated his brothers enjoyment of premarital favors beds are better than bridges he said with perfect sincerity benito they shook their heads at him in tandem his brother sighed and smiled youre impossible benito kat grinned but if he wasnt well we might never have met properly marco and he did sort out our misunderstanding dearest well have to forgive him marco hugged his brother im going to miss you benito yeah likewise kat hugged him too listen try to be understanding about maria give her and little alessia my love when you see them i will do i promise the capitano of the galley came up and bowed respectfully to marco well need to be getting underway milord valdosta he said so kat and marco went the ship cast off and the rowers began edging her out into the lagoon toward the sea benito watched and waved and then erik bellowed in his ear by the time benito collapsed into sleep that night he was first sore in places he hadnt even known he had muscles second awake to the realization that erik was possibly an even better swordsman than caesare had been benito was a lot of things but a fool he was not not about learning combat skills anyway erik had had him in a quilted jacket practicing with a bluntedged roundpointed rapier until he could barely keep the point up then erik had pulled up a grizzled old knight who was at least as broad as he was high semmenss weapon of choice is the axe or the morningstar he will drill you for an hour youre not really big enough for those weapons but knowing how they work will help you to stay alive when people armed with either are trying to kill you then when it seemed things could get no worse eneko lopez came up on deck i have been asked by petro dorma to see to your spiritual welfare this task is probably beyond me but i will do my best he did with an incisive tongue when he finally left benito realized that having his brothers superb memory would have been more useful at this point than an ability to climb buildings he also knew a great deal more than he had about saint hypatia saint simon and aspects of ecclesiastical magic hed never even considered before magic was more complex and more frightening than hed realized he wished marco wasnt involved in it then more drill then erik produced a stocky bowlegged knight with the characteristic bluespeckled facial powder burns of a bombardier the bombardier had a peculiarly high voice totally out of keeping with his pet a small cannon chased ornate and heavy erik hakkonsen has told me that the best way to your mind is to drub it into your hinder end with the flat of a sword however i am prepared to give your mind a chance if it fails i will assist it with this cleansing rod if you are lucky i will only beat you with it by the time the day ended benito was only too glad to collapse into an exhausted sleep to think hed once dreamed of being one of these knights the great eellike creature burrowed into the ooze and lay as still as if its physical movement could betray it to that which sailed above the adversarys presence and magic burned like a balefire on an overcast moonless night to the shamans perceptions he lay still and tried not to even think if he could sense the adversary then surely the mage could feel him for weeks now his hawks had watched the roads away from the great marshes he had driven them into it at first he had nearly lost both birds doing that not only had the ancient lord of that place detected his hold and sent his creatures to harry the hawks but it had also attacked and somehow weakened the bonds that the shaman used to control them the shaman found his creatures far less biddable now they would turn and hunt even when he commanded them to follow and they would not go out over the open sea it was contrary to their natures but that had not stopped them obeying him before they were becoming wilder more their own less his above him the ships sailed on at last he felt safe as soon as he was sure this was the case he called master open the way not with his voice of course this shape didnt have a voice the answer came immediately a kind of hole in the real world opened before him with a shimmering greenblack curtain across the mouth of it that kept off the seawater not a round hole though more a kind of rift an outline that changed constantly warping and writhing like a living thing the great eelshaped creature swam through the twisty contorted gap between the real and the spirit world the passage too twisted and writhed from moment to moment but the monster was well shaped for negotiating it he fell out of the passage onto the floor of the palace where jagiellon waited the shaman shook himself back into a shape that could speak taking care that the shape was prostrate on the floor before he tried to utter a word one could not be too servile with jagiellon he bowed his head right down onto the stone master the adversary is at sea he sails south from venice only when the report was given did he look up the black eyes glowed i fear he must somehow have gotten wind of my plans for corfu the old shrines there must be far more powerful places than i had realized they must be found and the rites of blood enacted there and if possible we must destroy eneko lopez sink him beneath the waves before he gets to corfu where are the byzantines and emeric master emerics galleys are already at sea his army should be landing on corfu by morning the rest of his fleet is still to the north of the island i am aware my slave aldanto is with them emeric plans to blockade the straits of otranto it will be difficult to do this effectively but maybe his blockading fleet and those that come with the rest of his troops can be used to kill eneko lopez that could be worth more than corfu itself in the long run jagiellons eyes flared you will return keep a watch over my adversary i will use the slave aldanto to direct forces against them there are several of the galliots with the transport fleet of carracks between you and the slave they can be directed to contact the blockading galliots we will direct them like a pincer on eneko lopez the priestess in the cave was old the magics drew more from her each year soon she must find another acolyte to serve the great goddess someone who could chant the ancient words and who could instruct the women in the rites it was no small responsibility and there must be a new bride for him of course ideally the two should be one and the same but that happened very rarely not for many centuries now she sighed well spring was here and though men might war and burn the earth and the women of the island would bring forth new life chapter the outcomes of great ventures often hinge on small things in this case it hinged on a southerly wind and the price crates of cuttlefish were fetching at the fishmarket at kerkira a few copper pennies increase in price had formed the basis of taki temperades decision the best time to catch cuttlefish in these parts was the twilight and the predawn and the best place was the bay of vlores some ninety miles north of corfu the southerly wind had delayed emerics carracks the galleys were forced to anchor in the bay of vlores and wait captain taki left corfu with four crewmen some cheap wine a lot of cuttlefish jigs and a sailfull of southerly wind in the late afternoon the moon was full and the run simple the wine was bad but not that bad the wind was dropping toward early morning taki was pleased by that it meant it would swing to the north by dawn takis ratty little fishing boat rounded cape gjuhezes the corfiote skipper looked at the town of vessels lying there in the seamist bloody illyrian sons of bitches slurred the captain hed had quite a lot of that wine stealing my fishing he shook his fist at the multitude of ships spiro looked up from where hed been busy with his horsehair lines well the cuttlefish must be as thick as flies on horseshit for so many vessels they sailed silently toward the ships ghosting in on the last breaths of the wind it had been dying and turning to westerly anyway or there would have been no wind here at all the moon was nearly down on one of the ships a horse snorted someone said something to someone else across the water the voice carried clearly it wasnt greek or italian frankish turn taki turn now whispered spiro his eyes were wide taking in the size of the vessels they were now nearly between those arent fishing boats taki didnt need telling he swung the rudder hard across the sail flapped lazily pull it down he whispered urgently ill get the others up we start rowing quietly taki wasnt drunk any more just scared as quietly as they could expecting yells behind them at any moment the fishermen eased themselves out past the cape out of direct sight taki slumped against the tiller saint spirodon preserve us thats the last time i drink that terrible kakotrigi of yanis we nearly sailed into them lets get that sail up and get out of here who the hell are they asked kosti the youngest of the fishermen hauling on the coarse rope to pull the single patched sail up again byzantinestyle galleys said spiro also hauling for once not being sarcastic and narenta galliots added taki shortly like spiro and most of the islanders taki had done a stint or two as crew on venetian ships it was hard work but the money was good if you could hang onto it he knew a pirate galliots looks from close up that was why hed come home and become a fisherman a fishing boat was such a poor target with so little loot most pirates wouldnt bother mostly as a fisherman you didnt go hungry and the wineso long as you didnt set your standards too highwas cheap on corfu but horses exclaimed kosti and what did that person say it wasnt greek i dont know i reckon it was trouble though and thats our catch gone said taki sourly up on the headland a serb guard stamped his feet in the cold the bay behind him was shrouded in seamist but what was that out there on the dark water it could be a sail he squinted at it for a while and then went off to call the guard commander make it that son of a bitchs decision whether to wake someone else emeric stared at the shivering serbs guard and commander a small vessel why didnt you report it earlier where had it come from yyour majesty the guard pointed out of the tent mouth the mist i just saw it i called micholovich the man looked like he was going to soil himself but what hed said was true no one could see far in this and the man had at least reported it most likely a coaster or a fishing boat emeric decided as likely as not the mist had hidden the fleet too there was not much use in sending a galley if the mist was this thick at sea theyd never find it but it was a sign waiting would not do sooner or later vessels would find them and he wanted to strike an unguarded target one more day and carracks or no carracks theyd launch the attack by the next day when the story got home to kerkira it had grown somewhat by afternoon the story was all over the streets of the town by sunset the commander of the garrison had captain taki temperades in his office taki had a good memoryat least when fueled by fear he remembered fairly closely the foreign words hed heard even if he hadnt understood them and the garrison commander had been stationed in istria commander leopoldo knew a little hungarian enough to recognize one swearword the detachment on corfu was a relatively small one doing little more than policing work nine hundred men some mercenaries some venetian marines fifty cavalrymen nominally under the command of captaingeneral tomaselli in practice leopoldo saw to the daytoday running of most things not just the garrison itself this was gino leopoldos first command post and he was determined to do well rumor had it that this could be tomasellis last command and he might be able to replace him the commander had the capi of the cavalry in his office before the sweating fisherman was going to be allowed to depart the cavalryman was skeptical i dont know captain these greeks exaggerate probably one vessel with a horse on her taki wrung his hat your honor it was a lot of ships i dont count too well your honor but narenta galliots i know and greek imperial ships my cousin dimitri did service on one i went to see him when he was stationed at levkas i saw them in constantinople too and there is no way he makes up hungarian blasphemy said leopoldo i want some men stationed on the slopes of pantocrator i dont know if this man was seeing things i dont know if theyre coming here but im not taking a chance we have to start preparing for siege he pulled a face ill have to go and talk to the captaingeneral and the podesta if people are going to be called into the citadel he has to authorize it and stationing my men on the mountain its a waste of time you should talk to tomaselli about that the young commander looked at him in absolute silence eventually the capi said all right then itll be done but it is a waste of time commander leopoldo looked at taki and you stay here before you chase the prices up in the market taki leaned against the wall i think youre too late the capi may not believe me but the peasants do youll find the peasants are driving their flocks up into the hills and sending their wives and children up too the garrison commander snorted you stay in that corner the table king emeric thought reflected his genius there molded in damp sand was a reasonable scale model of corfu and the albanian coast hed studied the island from the albanian shore hed assessed it from the seaside nearly two months prior to that it will be a threepronged attack said the king pointing to his model count ladislas you will disembark with your men three hundred of your finest here on the western side of the island directly in line with corfutownkerkira as the greeks call it you will proceed with as much speed as you can overland seize a few locals for guides make sure that they give no warning you should arrive at kerkira about dawn they have a habit of opening the gates at that time to allow inside the women of the town who work in the fortress if possible you are simply to occupy the fortress admiral volos you will be in charge of the galley fleet coming around from the south should my flag be flying over the fortress you will have a holiday there was polite laughter see that you enter the strait between the mainland and the island at dawn not before if we have not taken the fortress your men are to land and join the assault the few cannon we have already will be landed with you he turned on the chieftain of the narenta pirates chief rappalli you and yours will sail through the strait from the north you are going to carry the croats set them ashore to the north of the town you will then take up the positions assigned to you in the north channel sink any vessels attempting to flee the island i warn you if i find your men ashore looting while boats flee and spread the word emeric drew his finger across his throat now we are undermanned for this the carracks with the bulk of our men have not yet been sighted the fortyeightpound siege cannon are still coming behind them if we need to put the island under siege well the men and the cannon will be here but in this speed and surprise are our allies we still outnumber the garrison five to one if my magyar cavalry can strike at the fort as it opens at dawn were in taki had sat quietly in the corner of garrison commander leopoldos office it was a big dim room officers and officials had come and gone the scruffy greek fisherman went on sitting in his corner it was cool and comfortable it was only when the garrison commander was finally ready to call it a night that taki cleared his throat and asked can i go home now the commander had started in surprise i forgot you were here he said gruffly yes get along with you youve heard all sorts of things you shouldnt have on the other hand i dont suppose it makes much difference so taki had found his way to his cottage on the western shore late and for a change sober hed done a fair amount of thinking sitting there in the corner early the next morning hed gone around to the houses of his crew im not going fishing anywhere grumbled kosti we might meet those galleys i thought id go and visit some relations in the mountains were not going fishing said taki were just making sure that weve got a boat to go fishing in when all of this is over now get up well need spiro and my cousin yani yani kosti asked curiously stirring himself into an upright position what do you want him for hes got a dingy said taki shortly well need it to get home kosti pulled his shirt on he pointed up the hill hes off burying his wine i think it can only improve that last vintage taki snorted i wouldnt bother putting it underground myself kosti chuckled spiro offered to drink it all for him he reckoned it would end up in the ground that way anyway taki shook his head spiro would drink anything kosti laughed thats what he says about you skipper it is is it well ill go and wake him up said taki i went to bed sober last night i hope hes got a sore head on him this morning you go and see if you can find yani ask him to pick us up on the place we collect firewood from together they sailed the old boat out to a little rocky islet offshore the current side of the islet was piled high with driftwood and debris from the winter storms taki made a habit of coming out here in the summer every year when it had dried out nicely to load up with firewood you reckon theyre definitely coming spiro asked holding his head i dont feel like doing a whole lot of heavy labor for nothing the last time i felt like this i was in venice i got beaten up and nearly killed by a case vecchie kid who turned out to be a lot tougher than he looked this time it was just the wine taki shrugged where else could they be going once this is done im going to spend a few days up in the hills once they get over their looting and burning we can come back and get the old boat in the water again theyll want fish whoever wins using some logs as rollers they began to haul the fishing boat up onto the islet do you think the venetians stand a chance asked kosti taki shrugged again what difference does it make to us or any fisherman or peasant spiro grimaced according to my grandfather theyre not the worst landlords but theyre not greeks said kosti at least it would be a greek island again spiro grunted with effort and the boat moved up some more you should hear what sorts of taxes some of my mothers people on ithaca pay so little they have to eat roots and bark to pretend theyre being starved uhhuh is that the people you said were no better than shut up kosti said taki hastily young kosti still hadnt learned that it was all very well for a man to insult his own relatives but youd better not do it for him even if he had said it to you earlier lets cover the old scow up with this driftwood i want it to look like its all part of it that shouldnt be hard said kosti taki gritted his teeth and set about stepping the mast kosti really had better learn to watch that mouth of his spiro was as sarcastic as a man could be but somehow you always knew that he was joking yani came along in his dingy at about midday hurry up taki ive still got some wine to move out with the four of them in the dingy water had been slopping over the gunwales still they made it back to the shore without throwing kosti overboard then yani and taki loaded a few limestone boulders into the boat took the dingy back out into the cove taki launched out of having firmly anchored it with some rocks in a netbag they sank it yani knew his cousin well enough not to doubt what hed seen off the albanian coast and taki was ready to bet there were a good few carefully sunken boats around the island a sunken boat couldnt be burned smashed or stolen with a bit of patience and a few oxenor even enough donkeys or just strong backs it could be hauled out again maria put the platter of grilled fish on the table in front of umberto the prices in the marketplace today are just unbelievable i wanted some chestnutflour to make castagnaccio apparently never mind chestnutflour there is no flour to be had at all whats going on umberto the grayhaired man rubbed his eyes tiredly theres a rumor about that there is a fleet of ships up the coast of course everyone believes theyll come here its probably nothing more than a bunch of pirates theyll not trouble venetian shipping or venetian possessions put off buying for a few days the prices will come back down and maybe ill be able to get those idle fools in the boatyard to stop begging for news and doing some work instead he finished irritably theres no truth in it she asked rocking alessias cradle with a foot he shook his head i doubt it some fisherman came in with the story the mans a notorious drunkard to hear the locals tell of it youd probably find the ships were pink and crewed by worms if anyone bothered to question him properly maria nodded and resolved to go and buy what she could as a canaler rather than a guildsman she had a lot more faith in what fishermen claimed to have seen shed already bought basic household supplies in the first days being pleasantly surprised by the low prices here this far from venice of things like olive oil honey and wine shed been unable to resist the bargain of a huge crock of olive oil she had ample flour for a month salt fish had still been available dried figs theyd get used eventually i did think we might buy a goat there is a pen in the back yard and a chicken coop ive never kept these things but the goat would be useful for milk and cheese chickens lay eggs umberto nodded so long as you dont spend too much on them very well ill see what i can find will you be back for lunch umberto shook his head no ill take something with me there is a sea of paperwork to catch up on he sighed this is not an easy task the yard is an unhappy place full of fighting and the greeks and the guildsmen are all as lazy as can be my predecessor made up for lack of method by ordering huge stocks of everything so i have several years worth of stock of cladding timber some keel and mast timbers well likely never use and enough pitch to caulk the entire venetian fleetbut no brass nails and barely a handful of tow when he had finished his breakfast and gone back to work maria took her largest basket and alessia and walked there was no point in heading for the market not when she was looking for living things instead of foodstuffs but this was not such a big place that she couldnt reach a peasant cottage outside town after an hours walk maria was less convinced shed find what she was after by the deserted status of the peasant houses they certainly believed there was trouble coming she was now away from the coast and she could see the scallops of azure bay and kerkira white in the morning sunshine the air was already thick and warm and full of the scent of the fineleaved shrubs by the roadside bees buzzed lazily while collecting their bounty from the flowers except for the empty cottages stripped of everything moveable it would have been hard to believe there was anything that could go wrong in this eden eventually she found a man and his wife struggling to remove an iron bedstead from a cottage there were a couple of hens in the yard good day day to you too kyria maria was startled kyria lady shed dressed in an old dress a relic of her days as a canaler then she realized that she spoke venetianaccented frankish not greek the venetians had been here for more than a hundred years and all the islanders shed met could certainly understand the language but maria had rapidly gathered that there was a strong divide between even the lowliest venetians and the local people among the women of the garrison this seemed to be even more of an issue greeks were servants and one had to keep them in their place you didnt speak to them you gave them orders besides she wore shoes that set one apart from peasant women maria set the basket and alessia down and took a hand with the bedstead it was obviously the poor cottages pride and joy and the most treasured piece of furniture a bed and the bedclothes were the one thing that the rentcollectors could not seize for debt so they were usually the finest piece of furniture in the peasant houses shed been told the man and his wife nearly dropped it when maria came to help their jaws certainly dropped the doorway had two broad buttresses outside inside the door to the room that they were trying to take the bedstead out of was at such an angle that the bedstead just couldnt do the corner without hitting the strut after a few moments of struggle maria asked how did it get in the man shrugged i do not know lady my grandfather put it in before i was born there was only one room then marias patience was exhausted besides shed walked a long way carrying a baby on a hot morning she took charge there were some advantages to being a lordly foreigner the peasant wouldnt have taken such instructions from his wife put the end down itll have to stand on end to get it out at an angle stood on end and scraping the whitewashed clay the bedstead came through the peasants grinned lady you are clever and strong too said the man admiringly where do you come from venice the peasant shook his head cant be eh eleni the women who come to the garrison and villas they all are weak the wife nodded anastasia is in service at villa foiri she says the woman cannot even pick up a dish for herself maria laughed they arent weak just lazy too lazy to do for themselves what they can pay someone else to do this provoked laughter from both why lady they say we are the lazy ones alessia stirred and maria went to her the peasant wife looked longingly and adoringly at the baby she is so beautiful lady maria wondered why people always said babies were beautiful she loved alessia more than anything but she wouldnt have called her baby beautiful plump yes soft and tiny yes adorable yes she is very lovely when shes asleep the peasant was plainly keeping out of this womens talk eleni why dont you bring us some of that young white wine and some food it has been hot work but now thanks to the lady the worst job is over eleni nodded sit lady she motioned to the bedstead her husband had already taken up the important task of supporting a tree by sitting against it in the shade ill give you a hand maria offered i was brought up to know my way about a kitchen never mind what the others do they went into the cool dim cottage the kitchen was around the back actually a separate little roomthe only light coming either from the hole in the roof or the door the only furnishing was a hearth a few inches high and a few small sootblackened shelves by comparison maria realized her little home was a palace the young peasant woman had plainly decided that such a person could be trusted with the innermost secrets of the heart questions about pregnancy and birthing followed as she took bread olives and cheese and a clay jug of wine from places in her kitchen and loaded these onto a board i think i am pregnant she confided in a whisper i have not yani and i have been married for three years and i have had no children but this year i have been to the mountains to the holy place for the dancing she giggled it was very cold without my clothes on but i will be blessed this year she touched alessia with a gentle hand she seemed to assume maria knew what she was talking about they went outside and woke her husband the wine was cool and crisp the bread crusty the olives wrinkled tiny and black were flavored with some rosemary they ate in silence peasant table manners were simple talk and food did not go together maria smiled back in the days shed been trying to learn to be more ladylike to please caesare one of the hardest things shed had to try to master was the idea of eating and talking at the same time it gave you indigestion it was pleasant to slip back into the business of taking food seriously and talking later but when the eating was done then it was time for talk and for business maria found herself learning a great deal about the fleet that had been spotted at the bay of vlores she also found herself walking back to corfu town leading a kid that did not wish to be led and with a dozen fresh eggs a crock of olives and some cheese and with two disgruntledlooking brown chickens in her basket their feet tied with twine and attached to the wicker chapter on the slopes of mount pantocrator two bored mercenary cavalrymen were preparing a late dinner of a skinny fowl that some peasant was going to be very upset about in the morning spatchcocked and grilling over the flames it had more of their attention than the seawatch their not very impressed capi had ordered them to keep they had every intent of finishing their chicken and some young wine and sleeping beside the embers of the olivewood fire gurnoec was a slovene and his companion from lombardy their loyalty to the venetian republic was purely financial still when the one got up from the fire and wandered into the dark a bit to relieve himself of some of that young wine he did glance at the moonlit sea he nearly wet his boots chicken looks about done gurni said his companion from the fireside forget the sodding chicken wed better get to our horses his tone of voice told his lombard companion that this was no joke the man stood up and came away from the fire what is it the slovene pointed at the sea this wasnt the stupidest idea that commander leopoldo ever had after all the chicken untended burned the cavalrymen riding through the dark olives had other things on their minds was a real war worth what they were being paid and would it be possible to go somewhere healthier both of them now saw with crystal clarity the folly of taking service which involved being posted on an island the bells were ringing in kerkira three hours later the sound carried a long way up in the hills other church bells took up the chime the sound carried across the water count ladislas ground his teeth well so much for surprise he said grimly his second in command patted his horses flank theyll be expecting attack from the sea if we can cross the causewaybridge well still be in well take them count ladislas said nothing but that in itself was a condemnation they landed at a fishing harbor on the western coastnothing more than a beach with a few boats pulled up the island hills loomed dark beyond the moon was down and ripping a local or two out of their beds ought to have been easy but count ladislas soon realized that theyd been watched the doors were still swinging in some of the little whitewashed houses as they rode past finding a guide was not going to be that easy after all however there was a track leading inland and it was a distance of not more than two or three leagues to the venetian fortress on the other side of the island the magyar cavalry rode off on the heavy horses up through the olive groves vineyards and fields it was very dark and the trackfor it could hardly be called a roadwas quite indistinct two or three leagues can be a very long way in the dark especially when she who watched over the island did not love invaders the hills and mediterranean scrub on them were a good enough grazing place for goats theyd found the goats but not the goatherd just a deadend valley in the darkness the scrub oak and myrtle bushes were sweetscented pleasant for a ramble the place was hell for an officer in a hurry they found two peasant farms and huts but no peasants dawn eventually found them on a hilltop a good league from the eastern shore and a league too far to the north by the smoke puffs the croats had already entered the town of kerkira and were now attempting to assault the fortified citadel the citadel was most definitely closed up and was most definitely returning fire on the croats the venetian fortress as ladislas could now see was going to be no pushover it was on an islet just to seaward of the town the wooden causeway he and his men had been intended to take by speed was reduced to a few smoking piles on the far shore so much for rushing it the burning houses in the town outside the walls showed the croats had been busy it was unlikely theyd done much to the fortified citadel though all theyd achieved was to get shot at count ladislas sighed king emeric was not going to be pleased he never was when his plans went awry which they frequently did because he was inclined to excessively complex ones the failure of his plans was always blamed on the errors of his officers when they went wrong and attributed to his genius when they went rightdespite the fact that success as often as not meant that some officer had disobeyed still theyd better get down there taki leaned back against the big granite boulder and looked at the hungarian cavalrymen saint spirodon those horses were big he and old georgio had had quite a night up here with the devils of course they hadnt really been chasing after them or even georgios goatsas they discovered when they abandoned the goats it had just seemed as if they were being followed theyd choose a place no sane man would goif he wasnt chasing youand the horsemen would come around the bend theyd covered a good three leagues in the last few hours and these crazy soldiers must have ridden a lot more he watched in relief as the three hundred horsemen set off for the viros road kerkira was burning down there he looked gloomily at the scene at the backs of the hungarians then at the black smoke from what had been a sweet taverna once he wasnt surprised to see other corfiote heads popping up from the underbrush of another hillside they wouldnt be able to stay up here forever but until the worst excesses were over a lot of the peasantry would stay in the hills it was still not summer still cold at night but at least it wasnt winter and maybe she would provide you never knew there really was nothing worth destroying out here the town of kerkira outside the walls of the venetian fortress was ruined or burning out of range of the arquebusiers on the walls the croats and hungarians milled about ineffectually by the screams some of them had managed to find a woman or maybe not a man with his privates blown off screamed like a woman sometimes riderless horses roamed wildeyed the air was full of gunpowder smoke and shouts occasional cannon fire from the walls increased the carnage and the invaders without cannon were unable to even return fire count ladislas knew by then that it was a complete fiasco the fort and its cannon could defend the harbor very effectively the buildings the croats had been firing indiscriminately belonged not to the venetians but to the locals they provided at least some rudimentary cover from the cannon fire so the croats were burning them wonderful true the fortress was in reality designed to defend from attack by sea the larger cannon would be there but no doubt they could be moved ladislas couldnt really see how the situation could get any worse and then looking back down the slope he realized it couldat least on a personal scale that was one of the kings messengers and by the way he was riding his majesty wanted someone in a hurry with a terrible sinking feeling in his gut count ladislas realized that emerics messenger was looking for him emeric of hungary believed in personal comfort hed come close to the fighting but not close enough to risk actual combat still hed been close enough on his hillside outside his hastily erected palatial tent to have seen count ladislas and his precious magyar cavalry arrive too late he watched them discharge their wheellock pistols ineffectually at the fortress wall across the empty killzone the narrow streets of kerkira were no place for a cavalry charge emeric instead of watching the victory hed expected had seen his plan totally unravel as count ladislas had known someone was going to suffer for this and he had a feeling it would be himself the king stood outside the tent count ladislas dismounted and gave his great warhorse seventeen hands at the shoulder and his pride and joy a last pat he hoped theyd find a good master for him he knelt before the king there were little livid spots of fury on emerics sallow cheeks you incompetent bungling fool a quirt slashed at the counts face he did his best not to flinch as the blood began trickling down his cheek where have your men been why did you come after the attack are you a coward ladislas i dont tolerate cowards or incompetents count ladislas knew the truth would serve him badly sire the peasant we took as a guide was there simply to betray us he led us into an ambush the venetian scum had prepared for us your heavy cavalry flattened them sire but they knew we were coming someone must have betrayed us the count played on the kings passion for heavy cavalry and his belief that they could ride anything down it was not a hard belief to feed the count believed in it himself he also played on emerics belief that treachery lay everywhere for a brief moment count ladislas thought it had been enough emerics cruel eyes narrowed then he shook his head the peasant you found just happened to lead you into an ambush ha the quirt lashed at the other cheek viciously where is this peasant no use looking to see how many of your troops the cannon were taking down when you charged straight ahead and devil take the hindmost scarred cheeks were a small price to pay for his life sire i ran him through myself the village was deserted except for this one man he was hiding but not well he ran out of a building my men entered he claimed hed come down secretly after the others had left to steal some wine emeric stared at him then shook his head truth or not ill have to make an example you love that horse dont you the count had held back the cold sweat with difficulty now he felt the sweat pouring out sire he croaked that horse is great bloodstock some of the finest bloodstock weve bred dont kill him sire kill me emeric reached out his hands and put them on the counts shoulders im not going to kill your horse it is far too valuable you on the other hand count ladislas are not your horse is going to kill you the kings brows flared satanically youve heard i am a manwitch youve heard that i derive my strength from the pain of my victims that wasnt all the count had heard ssire please the king smiled like a killmad weasel agony washed through the count flowing from those hands it is true all of it the magyar officers stood in a silent circle the corral that had been hastily knocked together contained their former commanding officer and a horse hed trained to follow him like a dog count ladislas had been a brutally efficient officer but hed loved that horse now his eyes fixed on the once beloved steed were full of terror the king reached out his hands and touched the horse the animal screamed like a woman reared and backed away the king stepped out through the gate the horse was shivering its eyes rolled and its lips peeled back it turned then its mad eyes suddenly fixed on the count he tried to climb the corral but the magyar flung him back at the kings command he scrambled to his feet in front of the advancing horse the horse lunged forward to bite and lash out with his ironclad hooves ladislas dived but the warhorse was faster a hoof caught him and flung him into the rails blood flew the count was a tough and a strong man though he grabbed at his horses mane and vaulted onto its back the great horse went berserk it dropped and rolled kicking epileptically it took a while to kill the count but eventually the horse stood head hung low and in a bloody ruin lay the remains of the magyar commanding officer emeric walked into the corral the horse backed off emeric spat on the corpse and turned to the silent audience of magyar cavalrymen learn if i order you to be at a place at a certain timeyou will be there towards midday king emeric gathered his commanders on the hilltop overlooking kerkira smoke and ruins surrounded the island fortress called the citadel but it was undamaged we have a handful of fourpounders not enough to make a dent on their walls we have however an effective sea blockade in place we have even if the greeks fail to stop the returning convoys some months to reduce their defenses he pointed to a savagely scarred man you general krovoko are going to remain here youre in charge of the assault on the citadel youll have cannon shortly even if i have to go back to the narenta mouth myself to find dragorvich the rest of troops and the rest of my cannon in which case heads will roll he pointed to the greek admiral and the chieftain who headed the fleet of narenta pirate galliots you will arrange the blockade i will have one ship captains head for any vessel that escapes on the other hand the loot is yoursexcept for one fifth which is mine you will arrange how it is divided admiral i leave it in your hands make me satisfied with the arrangements he turned to the second in command of the three hundred magyar cavalry you are promoted into count ladislas shoes see that you fill them better than he did commander hegedes the cavalry will be of little use in this siege phase see the locals are suitably cowed strip the venetian estates one fifth for hungary two fifths for the besiegers on success two fifths for the cavalry when youve done that let these corfiotes know who their new masters are sire it will be done to perfection hegedes stated crisply youll be proud of us id better be said emeric youve seen what happens to those who fail me as she held alessia close maria listened to the thunder of the cannon a pall of smoke hung over the city outside the walls the fresh morning breeze bringing the smell of gunpowder and burning war might sometimes be the stuff of song and full of dreams of glory for men but a part of her knew without any telling that for women and children wars were hell and sieges were usually worse she looked through opened shutters at the small walled courtyard the goatkid was eating the grass that straggled through the paving stones ignoring the patch of grass farther back the chickens were pecking about cannon fire hadnt put them off laying it was still a pitifully small extra ration toward the siege she knew would come it might be five or six months before some relief came to the fortress maybe longer the raiders had timed this well the venetian convoys were gone until autumn occasional vessels would have come past little tarettes trading up the coast but it could easily take two or three weeks before the news even got to veniceif the invaders werent sinking every vessel they could find if they were then it would take longer except there were the vessels that prince manfred erik and the knights were traveling to the holy land in great galleys if she remembered rightly they should get away surely the thought of these vessels brought svanhild to mind lord she was out there somewhere in an unprotected villa maria bit her lip what could she do about it a prayer maybe smelling the smoke marias thoughts turned to the peasants shed been with only yesterday would they have managed to hide from the raiders a mangy viciouslooking yellow dog hanging around the edges of the crowd snarled at a cavalryman who had made a move to kick it the cavalryman picked up a stone and the dog slunk off into a gully but the shaman had heard and seen enough he walked away toward the waters edge to assume his other form the sea attack on his masters adversary needed orchestration he was becoming quite casual about following the adversarymage now the mage did not seem to be able to detect him that was very odd but quite welcome and foolish chapter the other guild foremen and assistantforemen have got to go and see the captaingeneral said umberto unhappily he has sent for us i hope it isnt his wife complaining about the chickens said maria but youd think hed have other things on his mind it is a great pity that you should have fought with her maria she seems to wield a lot of influence here im sorry umberto it just happened shes a vindictive bitch sophia tomaselli had found small ways to needle at the verrier family already its a shame she hasnt got any children to occupy her time mused umberto looking at his wife rocking alessia they certainly occupy enough of it said maria dealing with a milky belch wave goodbye lessi maria assisted a fat little hand the baby gurgled and umberto managed to leave with a smile he was back a little before the terce bell frowning the commander wants to draft our men in as soldiers he says the boatyard is sitting idle while the siege is on and he hasnt enough men to guard his walls it makes sense i suppose said maria if the citadel falls well all be in the soup what happens to you umberto the mastercaulker shrugged he says he will brevet us as officers but thats not the point maria he simply cant do this the guildsmen will refuse she blinked she could remember all too clearly the fighting in the streets and canals of venice and calling out the arsenalotti why wouldnt they help now but why not i mean if the hungarians get in theyll butcher half of the people at least umberto shook his head the arsenalotti are already part of the military reservebut of the arsenal not of corfu he is not our commander we are part of the militia to do militia duties when we are not at work to assist local authorities at any time in dealing with fires disasters and in dealing with immediate military threat it is very clearly stated in the deeds of the guilds it is one of the oldest privileges we are not soldiers under his control and it is not within the right of the captaingeneral to terminate our employment even the podesta cannot do that such an order can only come from the full senate in venice umberto pulled a wry face the guildsmen here are hazy about their duties but their knowledge of their privileges is crystal clear theyre absolutely insistent on the maintenance of the same i wish they felt the same way about their duties he sighed im afraid their hardness of attitude has made the commander equally awkward well be doing shifts of guard work every night it was a peaceful and beautiful spot if a little isolated reflected svanhild from where she sat on an outcrop just above the villa the villa was perched above a little fertile valley of patchwork fields olive groves and some saltpans beside the bay she sat plaiting sedgestems and looking out across the sea of course the ships would not come from along the western coastline but anyway she reached for more sedges shed never been able to keep her hands still as she did this she noticed a column of white dust coming down the winding roadway that lead to the villa could it be news bjarni had ridden over to corfu town earlier the greek servants had been full of some story the day before yesterday about an invasion then yesterday none of them had come to work today bjarni had insisted on riding to the town despite the fact that theyd offered the port officials handsome bribes to send them word if any ships were expected and theyd been very reliable with the last fleet she got up and began walking down toward the villa she could see the riders blond head by now bjarni was flogging that poor horse and it wasnt really up to his weight in the first place to arms all of you she heard him bellow by the time she got to the house the vinlanders were strapping on bucklers and breastplates what is happening she demanded corfu town is under siege he said wrestling with a recalcitrant breastplate strap and there are bands of marauders out looting and burning the great houses who she tugged the strap through for him how do i know all these continentals look the same to me all i know is that the one group i saw had red sashes on and horsehair plumes on their helmets theres a bunch of them not half a league hence and i think they saw me he turned to one of the men olaf go up onto that little knoll behind the house give sven a wave if you see them coming gjuki open that front door there are not more than twenty of them well give them a welcome i want men with arquebuses hidden at the upperstory windows he pointed to the darkhaired kari karis mother had been an osage tribeswoman tall strong and handsomeno mean hand with a bow and a knife herselfand shed raised her boys in many of the tribal ways kari and his brothers had been trouble all the way across to europe and through it now they would come into their own kari you take your brothers out by the outside wall i want this place looking open deserted svanhild you go back up to the knoll with olaf svanhild nodded she also took a bow with her and a beltknife she hadnt worn since shed left the holding on the mississippi the marauding horsemen had indeed spotted bjarni they came on at a groundeating canter riding huge magnificent horses there were in fact only eighteen of them and they were loot and captive hungry so far theyd met no resistance and they needed to beat the croats to as many more villas as they could find they yelled in delight and eagerness seeing the villa with its open front door it was plainly a wealthy noblemans residence the looting of venetian villas had so far been a very profitable business indeed much wealth flowed into the venetian republic up the adriatic and not a little of it stayed here in this colony corfu was fertile and had a good climate and all the trade passed through it the doorway was fortunately too low or they might have ridden into the house itself instead they scrambled from their mounts in their haste for loot yelling like banshees the first eight were in through the door when svanhild heard bjarni yell fire there were six arquebusiers at the upper windows all veterans of vinland campaigns all of them could shoot and shoot well kari and his three brothers leapt over the wall and pulled down the only magyar knight who hadnt dismounted or been shot they attacked the last of the knights who was on foot outside before hurtling into the fray inside the house from the knoll svanhild could hear the boom of a wheellock pistol and clash of metal mixed with screams she saw briefly someone emerge at a run from the front doorway and leap for a horse it was a welltrained animal and the rider was a great horseman almost flat on the horses neck the rider clung and spurred it to a gallop svanhild took careful aim the horse ran on but the rider lay dead sprawled on the track a feathered shaft between his shoulder blades bjarni came striding out of the house get the horse he bellowed svanhild loosed but neither aim nor heart was in it she loved horses and this one was a beauty god rot it hildi said bjarni furiously now theyll have a riderless horse coming back to tell them that someone is killing these useless nithings come back to the house hrolf has a cut that needs tending and we need to gather food and gear we cant stay here he brightened perceptibly when she came up to him at least we have got some nice horseflesh out of it and gjuki hit one of them on the headwe can find out just what is going on here bjarni cracked his knuckles explosively he is going to be telling us or ill pull his ears off and forcefeed them to him it wouldnt be ears hed be pulling off if he left the work to kari the skraelings had some gruesome means of getting information out of captives where are we going to go bjarni asked svanhild hastily scrambling down to him the huge blond vinlander shrugged his shoulders lets see what the prisoner tells us we can base our decision on that but i suspect well have to hide out in the mountains to the north unfortunately the domicile from which fianelli ran his operations had been built right against the fortifications the walls of fianellis kitchen rattled every time the citadels cannons fired so at least it seemed to bianca you get used to it grunted fianelli he raised the bottle offering her some more but she declined with a little wave of her hand bianca casarini didnt have a good head for wine so she never drank more than a glass at a time half a glass when she was in the presence of men such as fianelli and his goons fianelli set down the bottle after refilling his own glass been through it before he said twice bianca frowned fianelli was only in his midforties corfu hasnt been attacked in not here someplace else he provided no details and bianca decided not to ask she wasnt afraid of fianelli but she was cautious around him a man like that it didnt pay to press questions bianca didnt know what had happened to the woman hed once been keeping as a bedmate but she did know that the woman had disappeared a few weeks after she got bold enough to start nagging at fianelli nagging at least as fianelli would consider it the criminal chiefs definition had a pretty low entry bar so best not to ask any questions not directly relevant to the work at hand bianca leaned forward in her chair a bit i think ive got the man you want and the way to trap him fianelli cocked an eyebrow cant be just some common soldier youre playing with bianca suppressed a spike of anger i dont copulate with common soldiers you but she suppressed the reaction first because while she didnt sleep with common soldiersnot lately at leastshe was in no position to be finicky about her bed partners second because the moment was too delicate for anger to be muddling her third because a part of her was enjoying the vengeful twist in the game querini really was an oaf hes a cavalry captain querinis his name alfredo querini one of the three men who were also lounging around the huge table grunted bianca thought his name was zanari i know him a bit not well whats the hook asked fianelli he likes to gamble and hes not good at it even in the best of times give it a few months bianca let the rest of the sentence trail off shed been in a siege once herself but saw no reason to let fianelli know sieges get boring true enough mused fianelli and since before too long everybodys on rations theres always a lot of loose money around idle hands and idle money so there always starts to be a lot of gambling he squinted a little looking at bianca the expression was not exactly suspicious but close i dont run the kind of gambling establishments that a cavalry captain would frequent no but you can make contact with someone who does count dentico and his sons fianellis suspicions rose closer to the surface why not you youre closer to those libri doro circles than i am this was the tricky moment fianelli was right of course in the year shed been on corfu casarini had made it a point to cultivate good relations with a number of the greek aristocrats on the island the libri doro they were called after the golden book in which the venetian masters of corfu had recorded the names of those corfiote families who were given preferential treatment the truth was that bianca could easily introduce querini to the denticos she knew all of them after all but bianca was determined to keep herself at least one step removed from the treasonous links she was creating fianelli like almost all criminals shed ever known tended to look at the world solely through his own eyes he thought of what he would do giving little more than cursory attention to what the authorities would do other than the obvious understandable enough given the generally crude and sloppy methods of police work followed in most italian or greek cities sloppy and crude when it came to simple criminal activity that is when it came to treason those same authoritiesgiven the history of italy and the greek territorieswere far more energetic and astute bianca was pretty sure that fianellis activities in the past had steered clear of politics though so he wouldnt really understand the difference but she did sooner or later there was a good chance the venetian rulers of corfu would detect treachery at work they were almost bound to even with a captaingeneral as incompetent as nico tomaselli first because anyone with any experience knew that treason was the single most acute danger to a fortress under siege so theyd be looking for it second because in this instance bianca would also be undermining the traitors as well as the authorities her mistress elizabeth bartholdy wanted corfu to fall to emeric true but not quickly fortunately bianca had prepared for the moment she squirmed a bit in her chair doing her best to let a trace of an embarrassed flush enter her skin i cant she murmured count denticohis son flavio too well lets just say were not on good terms any longer fianelli smiled thinly one of his thugs smiled broadly papeti his name was he had the annoying habit of openly ogling bianca shed noticed she was sure that her veiled suggestion that shed had sexual relations with both the count and his oldest son would make the man even more aggressive toward her in the future probably to the point of becoming a real problem in fact but the future could take of itself bianca casarini was not worried about her ability to handle a common thug countess bartholdy was still withholding many secrets from her but shed given bianca a great deal of other training her ploy did the trick fianelli leaned back in his chair visibly more relaxed she was not surprised another characteristic of criminals was their ready willingness to believe the worst of people the worst as they saw itand they had a very limited imagination in point of fact while bianca knew the denticos shed been careful to keep a distance from the family once shed assessed them fully early on shed decided they would be the easiest among the libri doro to lure into treason when the time came for one thing they were fairly open about their probyzantine inclinations for another they were almost blatantly corrupt but that had become apparent so quickly that shed seen no reason to develop intimate relations with either the count or his sons she never lacked for bed partners after all and she wanted no obvious links between herself and those whom she was fairly sure would eventually be executed all right fianelli said he cocked his head a little glancing to the man who seemed to be the chief of his little squad of enforcers that was the florentine saluzzo see to it paulo since zanari already knows querini he can start that side of it put on your best italian manners and start cultivating the denticos saluzzo nodded he murmured something in addition but bianca didnt catch the words the kitchen was rattling again i hate sieges grumbled fianelli finishing his glass and reaching for the bottle good for business surebut risky bianca wondered what arrangements fianelli had made with his master king emeric to see to his own safety once the hungarian troops finally breached the walls and poured into the citadel she was sure they were quite good arrangements fianelli was too experienced a criminal to be careless about something like that she was even more sure that fianellis arrangements would be meaningless when the time came fianelli was accustomed to dealing with criminals and corrupt officials he simply had no idea what the king of hungary was like emeric took as much pleasure in betraying his own once they were useless to him as he did in betraying his enemies more actually bianca suspected she did herself after all bartholdy had trained both of them well the difference between emeric and bianca was that emeric was too egotistical to realize that sooner or later his greatgreataunt would have the pleasure of betraying him bianca on the other hand had no illusions that eventually the countess would betray her as well try to rather bianca casarinis skill and strength were growing constantly someday she shook her head slightly the future was the future and now was now the kitchen walls seemed to be rattling again im on duty tonight on the vidos wall apologized umberto ive volunteered for the fourth vigil if i take it then none of my underlings can complain maria wondered how many of the men doing militia duty had a small restive child in their homes but she said nothing just wake me ill prepare some frittata jemma and rosa have been laying well those hens are a blessing the goat howeverit has eaten one of my gloves said umberto crossly maria shook her head i see why they are used as a symbol of satan the beast seems possessed by an eatingdevil well if she doesnt take care well dine on her said umberto even if she does we probably will maria thought but did not say chapter up drill time benito groaned but after nine days of eriks discipline he knew better than to argue the wind had been blowing steadily from westsouthwest since yesterday morning and they werent making good speed it looked like this purgatory would continue for at least two more days oh well it was only purgatory not hell besides hed realized the truth in what manfred had said erik was savagely unhappy about some woman benito had exorcized his own demons in this respect with strong drink wild antics and occasional fights erik dealt with it by a regimen of training that would make mere war gods weak at the knees he pushed benito he pushed manfred he pushed various of the knights of the holy trinity most of all erik pushed himself personally benito thought his own method of dealing with the decisions of those irrational creatures was easier if not better it wasnt something he was going to point out to the icelander however erik shared the inclination to an occasional fight and benito had realized by this time that you really really really didnt want to fight with erik benito understood now how the corfiote seaman who had tried to rob him must have felt when he had seen his intended victim turn and realized that what he faced was an unleashed wolf benito kept quiet as quiet as ever he had in his life maybe quieter manfred however was allowed to complain so long as he actually did exactly what erik demanded of course just now it was dark and erik was toeing them both in the ribs its before dawn you icelandic madman grumbled manfred in a voice like millstones grinding gravel this is a time for sleeping for snuggling down next to a warm cuddlesome woman just because you cant dont take it out on me the fulminating look that erik gave manfred promised that in fact the icelander would take it out on him which suited benito just fine however on this particular occasion both of them were saved from being eriks frustrationrelease by a yell from the masthead sail ahead blessed jesulots of sails within a few minutes the knights were all awake and on deck the capitano peered nervously forward from a perch on the bow erik joined him with benito and manfred in close attendance theres a lot of them he said unhappily no reason for a fleet that size to be here my lords except for trouble therell be cannon on them too he shook his head well have to turn and run my lords no we wont said erik grimly pointing to the northeast behind them now that the gray dawn was breaking they could see a fan of other smaller vessels under oars stroking toward them the capitano turned looked and blanched his lips moved silently as he counted twentytwo galliots no twentythree pirates by the looks of them thats the biggest fleet of galliots that ive heard of since my grandfathers day when admiral gradineri broke their power off otok brac and burned their lairs on the narenta they dont seem to have stayed broken said manfred dryly the capitano shook his head theyre like rats milord you can never find all the holes what are we going to do were trapped between them run with the wind and fight our way out of whatever trouble catches us said manfred no benito hadnt meant to say anything but the words just came out of him without thinking he couldnt believe that neither the capitano nor manfred nor erik could see itbut it was so obvious maybe it was all that time on the rooftops as a boy but he could see the battle in his minds eye as if on a map look at the pattern the galliots are aiming to cut us off look at them theyre not rowing toward us at all theyre heading toward where well be if we turn and run id guess we were spotted from the shore yesterday and this was planned between them those carracks there are bearing down on us with the wind the galliots only have to burn our sails and stop the oarsmen from getting a good stroke with a peppering of arrows and the carracks and their cannon will catch up with us we need to drop the sails and bull straight into the wind eriks eyes narrowed well evade those carracks they cant quarter close enough to the wind for that but the galliots are smaller lighter and faster theyll catch us benito smiled savagely seeing it all unfold in his mind theyll have to row a good dogleg to do it and then they can face our cannon we dont outgun all those round ships but we do those little things then he looked at erik and said uh sir erik snorted that was for training speak if you have sense to speak and it certainly sounds to me like you do someone clapped it was eberhard of brunswick well he is speaking it now that is the old foxs grandson talking that is thinking real strategy manfred nodded give the orders captain and make signal to the other vessels he turned to the knights right gentlemen below and arm yourselves into armor they wont be expecting fifty knights on each of these ships erik held up a restraining hand wait those galliotsthe rowers fight too the capitano nodded yes one or two of them might have small cannon but they rely on boarding vessels and handtohand fighting good erik turned to manfred i dont think we should have the knights don armor yet if we give those galliots a long chase theyll be good and exhausted by the time they do catch us for the first time since hed come aboard erik gave benito an encouraging smile or what do you say young benito benito nodded looking inwards at the map in his mind yes if we can keep up the chase for long enough we can turn again and quarter on the wind well be upwind of the carracks the galliots will change course to cut the corner but thatll mean that they have to keep rowing while we can rest on the oars manfred bellowed no armor gentlemen not yet youll all be taking a turn at the oars the grumble at this order was stilled by falkenberg who swatted an already gauntleted hand against his breastplate you heard the prince those of you already in armor strip it off falkenberg yelled manfred sir ill want a roster of what order the knights and squires will row in i want them to spell the rowers but not exhaust themselves set it up for me in the meanwhile the capitano had sailors on the rigging with orders flying a sailor on the poop deck was making signals to the other vessels as the sails came down four steersmen swung the great rudder hard over oars came out and the steady drumbeat began the carracks are resetting their sails said erik squinting across the water the vessels were benito judged still more than a league away wont matter they cant sail close enough to the wind eberhard of brunswick looked thoughtfully at benito just how do you judge this i know from speaking to your grandfather that you are not a sailor youve never been outside of venice before benito shook his head i i can see it milord in my head i know how close to the wind the galliots can sail weve done that for the last two days the capitano said to erikyesterdaythat he was lucky this wasnt a round ship they cannot get enough points to the wind benito shrugged and held up his hands helplessly its a like a picture in my head from a high rooftop i can see where people are going i can see where they can go the ritter nodded i knew your grandfather well i was based in milano some twenty years back and he and i met on a number of occasions once when he had delivered a crushing defeat against the odds to phillipo maria of milano in some minor border dispute i asked just how he did it he described something similar only he spoke of it in chess terms chess had been one of few things benito had discovered in his life as case vecchie that was more enjoyable than the way hed lived as a messenger and thief it is a great game milord eberhard smiled wryly when this is over you must give me a game and if you desire a true challenge that man is the master he pointed to eneko lopez the cleric looked away from the sea raising his eyebrows it is a challenging game but the only man i know who sees a battle like a map is carlo sforza he looked very penetratingly at benito someone had obviously been telling family secrets benito said nothing so eneko continued it is your birthright boy a godgiven gift see you use it wisely in his service eneko lopez straightened up i will go below francis pierre diego and i will see if any protective magics may be worked better if you could blast them all to ash grumbled eberhard the pagans i fought in smaland had a magician who could do that until someone put an arrow through his eye eneko shook his head it is not fitting to destroy human souls for thus is evil magic defined in wars among christian men it is common for kings to claim god is on their side but that is vainglory god is on the side of those whose souls need him god decides on rights and wrongs of a cause not kings and our magic will be as sand in the wind if we try to use it to attack but evil magicsah now those are best countered by ecclesiastical power he turned and went below decks eberhard snorted he said much the same thing to the emperor can you believe it hes a stiffnecked man that one he looked wryly at benito i dont think you got much else from carlo sforza boy you should be grateful for that skillfrom both your father and your mothers side yes i know too benito half the world does benito felt his face grow hot as he flushed and he thought of maria and what she had said they keep expecting me to be like one or the other of them im not im myself the elderly ritter tugged at his white moustache some of us struggle to live up to the reputation bequeathed to us by our blood others struggle to rise above that reputation it can be done boy but we are shaped by it its whether we allow it to rule us or whether we direct it that stiffnecked priest is right you have a gift use it well use it as benito valdosta would use it not the wolf of the northnor even the duke of ferrara falkenberg came up to the deck and spared him having to answer milord of brunswick here is the roster for the rowers prince manfred asks that you control this matter he says it will take true statesmanship the old ritter smiled ruefully i detect francescas hand im supposed to be training him and instead hes manipulating me he took the list well you dont have a monks fist falkenberg whats this i see manfreds name heads this list erik said it would set a good example milord he said all chieftains take a hand at portage and therefore manfred could do some rowing manfred swore at him the ritter raised his eyes to heaven well i daresay if nothing else that will make it impossible for any other knight to claim rowing is beneath his dignity very well young valdosta i suggest you divest yourself of any extra clothing rowing is hot work ive been told youre also in the first shift manfred had had von gherens assign places to all of the passengers von gherens had arrived at where to put everyone by the simple expedient of counting an equal number into each cabin under their vow all of the knights of the militant order were officially equal regardless of former station or present rank so knightproctors had ended up in broom cupboards while several squires had the third best stateroom except of course for manfred and francescas cabin francesca had smiled at von gherens they had the very best stateroom eneko diego francis and pierre on the other hand had nothing but some floor spaceif they all exhaled at the same time the others were waiting for eneko theyd plainly anticipated what he would try to do scry to see if this was some part of a larger evil eneko knew the dangers here at sea the alignment of the consecrated area wouldnt stay aligned the candles were prepared the incense was in the censer diego was taking a bottle of water out of his pack weaving the sevenfold circle in this confined space took care but one thing eneko had learned magic required precision there was no room for mistakes in nomine patri et filii et spiritus sancti fiat lux enclosed in the magical curtain of light the four joined hands and began the ritual of searching this was not simple scrying in scrying one knew where one wanted to look but not necessarily what one wanted to look for here they knew not only where but in general what this might be nothing more than the ongoing battles of venice against pirates or pirates and some greater enemybut lopez did not think so here they had one of the possible heirs to the emperor and one of chernobogs great enemiesmore than that really in the form of erik hakkonsen and the four priests these fleets this alliance might be what the black brain had been focusing on when it had let them go so lightly back in the jesolo swamps this then might well be what lopez had feared and if it was then there would certainly be an agent of the black brain somewhere nearby that was what they were looking for each of them undertook the invocation to one of the four archangels of the compass this was no time for mere wards but not without a moment of thought you pierre or me in the north he asked of the others they all knew which creatures were the most likely to be under chernobogs sway pierre considered it perhaps six months ago i was your superior in combative magic eneko he said soberly but i think you have surpassed me i will take the east though which is another source of trouble very well this would mean that pierre would begin the invocations and eneko would end pierre faced outward raised his hands and began to intone the prayer to request the presence of the archangel gabriel in their work the fact that instead of a simple wardpillar they got something that was a towering blue flame vaguely manshaped was not comforting and yet in a way it was they now knew for certain that this was what they had been expecting dreading waiting for it had begun when it was enekos turn to invoke the archangel uriel he had barely intoned the first sentence of the prayer when his ward roared up in brilliant gold flame nevertheless he completed the prayer ending with a bow of thanks it was francis as the representative of the west who blessed the chalice of wine that they would use as their mirrorthough it was not the standard shape of a chalice being more of a footed bowl to provide a satisfactory surface to use as a mirror they exchanged glances pierre looked fierce diego somber francis resigned eneko did not know what he looked like his face just felt stiff they focused their concentration on the chalice of blessed wine and began the first careful probes for the taint of evil since there was no earth as such and not much chance that even the black brains creature could force a spirit of fire out over so much water eneko joined with francis to search the waters and pedro with pierre to survey the air they expected that the creature would be subtle it wasnt eneko felt the nausea the icy chill and the shock of encountering naked unshielded evil the result was near instantaneous the wine seethed and began to boil the light curtain pulsed as if sheet lightnings striated within it and the north ward was filled with the sound of great angelic wings all four of them reeled eneko was the first to recover perhaps pierre was right perhaps he had grown in skill but this was no time for pride though the confidence that the fleeting realization gave him was a bulwark under his feet they were now no longer within the bowels of the ship they and their circle wards and all were elsewhere not quite out of the world but not in it either it was a place of swirling darkness green and black flame and sickly polluted clouds moving sinuously through it looming over them wassomething serpentine but it was no serpent black and green with a mouth of needlesharp needlethin teeth long as stilettos and twice as lethal piggy little eyes and a strange spiny crest it confronted them no it confronted lopez it focused on him and drew back to strike that which cannot abide the name of christ begone eneko lopez drew strength from his companions strength from his faith and from the archangel of the north to strike at the thing perhaps it had not expected the blow for it did not move out of the way perhaps it had expected that they would be paralyzed with fear it neither dodged nor did it invoke shields the blow a sharp lance of golden light modeled on the archangels own weapon pierced the things hide it opened its maw in a silent scream then huge slimy and vastly strong the creature bled and fled and they whirled away out of that notworld and were back in the belly of the ship there was nothing left but the faintly glowing wardcircle the overturned chalice four thin wardcandles and a puddle of blood on the floor just outside the circle the blood was black and stank well now we know that it is more than just a conflict between commercial rivals said eneko grimly the eelthing smelled of the far north that is confirmed by the archangel of the norths intervention i perceive the hand of chernobog but eneko there was more to it than that it knew youand feared you the target of all these ships is nothing other than you we must pray and summon intercession said francis and that was no eel added diego eneko raised his eyebrow it was human once but it looked like an eel to me it was a lamprey said diego with certainty a hagfish but it was enormous said pierre diego shrugged it is very old fish dont stop growing as long as they are alive lampreys are parasites arent they trust pierres basic curiosity to get him sidetracked they can be they like to feed off living flesh and trust diego to follow him down that diversion francis cleared his throat in all of that was i the only one to hear the panpipes further off but still distinctly panpipes mused eneko as we heard in the scrying in rome yes eneko shook his head no i did not hear them but id guess you were right this is another attempt to either kill us or to lead us from the course again and that course leads to the place where there is already some old power elemental crude and which does not love us we know now where chernobog and his minions focus their attention corfu brothers eneko said carefully i believe that the lord will not be averse to the judicious use of magic in the material plane after all if this galley is captured or sunk pierre grinned mirthlessly it will be after all purely in selfdefense purely eneko assured him the wards flared as if in agreement chapter benito was right said erik up on the poop deck after a spell at the oars the carracks will pass to leeward of our stern they might be in cannonshot for a short time said the bombardier depending on what cannon they have on board that would depend on who they are genovese most likely erik squinted into the distance the pennant on that lead vessel is a black horse in flames eberhard of brunswick drew a breath between his teeth emeric of hungary our spies reported he was massing troops but it was assumed that they were for his campaign against iskander beg where does he get a fleet from and where is he going with it asked francesca from where she stood under the canopy the old statesman narrowed his eyes and nodded a good point helmsman yes milord do you see anything that gives you any idea whose ships those are the helmsman the sort of man who looked as if hed been at sea on the very first hollowed log and had only come ashore briefly since nodded aye not genovese sir byzantine you can tell by the way they rig the foresail the old ritter turned a grim face to francesca alexius has allied himself with emeric of hungary francesca frowned the only possible reason i can see for that is to attack venetian properties i can see that alexius might want to do that but hes too weak to go on military adventures against venice also it puts emeric at his throat instead of venicewhich if anything is worse i must admit i cant see why emeric would attack venices colonies by sea instead of venetian holdings nearer home to come overland through fruili would make more sense francesca nodded there will be a reason that is less than obvious from what ive heard the reason could be that alexius is too weakwitted to see what hes doing eberhard snorted i dont know if youre joking francesca but you are being too accurate and now i think it is time for a change of rowers these men have nearly learned what they should be doing therefore it is time to change he walked over to forerail and began calling the next group of knights and squires to oarduty it was midmorning before the knights were actually called to leave the oars and don armor the round ships were well astern by then theyd turned and were attempting to take a tack that would bring them closer the galliots having started in a tight group were now trailing out in a long arc the knights had made strong if inept rowers although theyd been getting better with practice however what this had meant was that the great galleys had kept going under oars for nearly three hours now and the actual rowersthe venetians who were professional at itwere still reasonably fresh the enemy galliots were close now the great galleys sails were hoisted and they began to run with the wind now the galliot crews thought they would reach their prey and their oarsmen began putting extra effort into their stroke manfred came up on deck if we can keep this up for another half an hour we wont even have to kill them the beggars must be halfdead already erik ascending the companionway behind him smiled wolfishly and the fools have not had the sense to regroup the capitano shrugged theyre pirates milord they fight for loot the best loot goes to the first ships manfred felt the handle of his great sword so does the best dying all right erik you too young benito seeing as you seem to have developed a genius for this sort of thing how do we deal with them benito blushed and got up to leave ive only really been in the battle in venice and to tell you the truth that was all just handtohand skirmishes our battle plan went to pieces after the first few heartbeats he knows the difference between strategy and tactics anyway said erik dryly stay and learn youngster youre not too bad when youre not out causing trouble erik pointed at the galliots they still outnumber us if they want lootlets give them some casks of wine will do for a start half empty ones so theyll float some of them will start on the jetsam and that will break the followers up well at least you want to start on the halfempty ones grumbled manfred and what else tenderize them well with cannon when they get close keep the knights down until theyre trying to board and keep lots of casks and buckets of water on hand for the sails said the capitano gloomily fine horseflesh grunted bjarni like to take them home svanhild could only agree she was having some difficulty riding as the saddles were nasty heavy things and not the simple pads that the skraelings used and had taught her to use but the horses themselves were magnificent the horses at home had been bred for the most part from chunky little icelandic ponies with the occasional importation of something larger or more exotic or the odd spanish barb taken from the infrequent spaniard expeditions come looking for gold and finding death these on the other hand were bred for war not packing steady patient big and strong and smarter than they looked rather like her brothers they rode northward along the high ground keeping away from the smoke plumes heading for the mountains they did see some local peasants doing the same they scattered the moment they saw the horses leaving their goods and fleeing real fighters said gjuki disdainfully svanhild kept her own council the peasants they saw were armed with next to nothing and certainly not mounted how could they even hope to accomplish anything by standing and fighting except to get killed of course why are they running away wondered olaf looking at the disappearing backs we could use some guides and we mean them no harm dont be more stupid than you have to be snapped bjarni at the lanky duniwassal were riding cavalry chargers and we are plainly foreigners how many blond heads have you seen here oh i hadnt thought of that your trouble is you seldom think its going to make finding shelter difficult bjarni swore fandens osse i hadnt thought of that svanhild bit her lip suddenly that nasty little inn overrun with bugs and rodents where shed have had to share a bed with six other women she didnt even know didnt seem so bad well manage bjarni she said stoutly well find something the riderless horse joined up with another troop of magyar cavalry the officer in charge of this detachment of looters looked at it carefully and felt his heart sink it had once belonged to hegedesthe commander who had promised king emeric hed be proud of the looting campaign that everything would go well it looked as if he had been wrong it also looked as if he wouldnt be around to take the blame the cannon roared kicking back against the restraining ropes venetian gunners arent worth shit said the highvoiced knight bombardier with dispassionate professionalism he moved in shouting instructions cuffing heads the next shot hit the second of the galliots the stern cannon bearing now on the closest galliot began firing the nearest galliots crews rowed frantically pulling hard to close to get near to the galleys so that the cannons could not be depressed enough some fifteen of the galliots were close enough to pose a threat others were so far back that either they would never catch up or they knew they would arrive far too late for the looting their crews had already stopped trying the gunners were now working as fast as the knights bombardier could drive them and that wasnt going to be fast enough the first galliots were already too close already burning pitchsoaked arrows were being fired at the sails sailors scrambled with buckets of water the arquebuses began firing in volley from the great galley despite this there were wildeyed men standing up on the bows of the first galliot grappling irons in hand then the pirates werent there anymore they might have been safe from ships cannon but the bombardier had his own little twopound cannon loaded with fragments of steel and ready for them to benito it looked as if some giant blade had abruptly scythed through the crew of that galliot but the second vessel was already coming plainly they had decided to concentrate their attack on this ship the bombardier could not reload in time for that one one of the venetian gunners grabbed a cutlass put that down you fool yelled the bombardier reload there are still other ships behind this one you sink those and we only have this one to deal with the knights still waited silently behind the rampart of crates and boxes the raiders targeted the bowas far from the poop deck as possible grappling irons came along with a bunch of yelling gleeful loothungry boarders then the knights stood up behind the rampart and the yowl that went up from the mob of boarders was no longer one of glee even in the wilds of dalmatia they knew the armor of the knights of the holy trinity to get to the knights theyd have to mount the rampart the narenta pirates were unarmored they had boarding axes a miscellany of swords and knives and occasional pistols the steelclad knights with their broadswords were backed up by venetian sailors with pistols and arquebuses manfred had positioned two further sets of ramparts up on the poop deck benito had elected himself an exposed but potentially deathdealing position the great galley carried four grenadiers and an ample supply of black powder grenades out on the end of a wildly swaying mainmast spar with a bag of grenades and a slowmatch he could pick his targets so long as he could cling to the spar with his legs he could virtually drop grenades into the attacking vessels youll be partly hidden by the bell of the mainsail benito manfred had said seriously when benito had suggested taking this position but youll also be a good target the canvas and the spar are no protection at all against arrows or gunfire also if they succeed in firing the mainsail youll be fried you work to my orders dont draw attention to yourself wait until the melee starts no one will be looking straight up while theyre fighting then you see if you can drop something directly into the attackers boats but not beforehave you got that manfred demanded jabbing a forefingerto the first joint it felt likeinto his chest yes sir erik snorted you can quit that right now i dont know how well youll fight in actual combat but i do know you can climb things manfred grinned yes ive seen him do it dont take company up there hear benito held his tongue hed never live that one down but he was still thinking about it despite the coming battle when he reached the spar end he had a birds eye view of the boarders from up here he also realized the one fault with his idea the sway out here was wildly magnified he clung lit and threw only he hadnt factored in the roll to his horror he saw that the grenade was going to hit the great galley not the galliot alongside he gritted his teeth and restrained himself from closing his eyes it hit the rail and bounced harmlessly into the water he lit again as fighting raged below him waited for the roll realized how short the fuse was and hastily flung the grenade as far as he could not worrying about where he threw it just wanting to get it away it exploded in the air between two galliots not if hed tried for a twelvemonth could benito have used a single grenade so effectively the explosion sent steel shards flying at those who remained on both galliots lighting the third grenade took immense determination especially as a couple of shots were now being directed at him but he knew when on the roll to light and throw now it landed in one of the galliots a brief shower of sparks and it failed to go off he waited on the roll to light another a shot burned across his shoulder sending the slowmatch spiraling downwards he was left with a newly lit grenade in one hand and another four in his bag he did something incredibly dumb but the bullet graze had both frightened him and given him a rush of pure insane strength he dropped the lit grenade into the bag then in a smooth movement drew his main gauche and slashed the strap with the other hand he flung the entire bag it splintered into the stormdecking on the prow of the latest galliot to join the fray and a moment later erupted and blew a smoking hole in the bow at the waterline the little vessel started to go down almost immediately benito began edging his way backward along the mainsail spar his shoulder was oozing blood and didnt seem to want to take any strain out here hed get shot again for sure and there wasnt anything more he could do up on the mainmast spar anyway looking down he saw it was still going to be a vicious fight theyd sunk some galliots and simply outrun others but because all of the little vessels were concentrated on this one the knights on board were badly outnumbered they outclassed the pirates to be sure but sooner or later the mainsail would go down more vessels would catch up and eventually the carracks would get here as he thought all that he saw a little sortie of pirates had indeed managed to get up to where the mainsail was tied benito saw one of the band slash at the portside mainsail rope as the saber struck the rope the man was thrown back in a great gout of sparks the cable was undamaged but the pirates who had fought their way up to the sail were shrieking and diving over the side of the galley not caring whether they hit water or their own ships of course the shrieking wasnt in frankish but benito was still sure he guessed what it was witchcraft what had been a determined assault rapidly turned to a frantic attempt to reach their boats clinging to the ratlines benito noticed the mast was actually thrumming and the mainsail was now cracking with the strain it was hard to say where the wind was coming from but it was certainly driving the galley forwards the sail was glowing a bright royal purple the other galliots which had been closing were now beginning to fall back by the boom of the cannon they were back in cannonrange benito just went on climbing down the mainmast rigging struggling to do so with one arm not working properly by the time he got low enough to jump down the fight was turning into a rout with pirates jumping into the sea rather than remain on board an accursed vessel superstition can be a wonderful thing when it is someone elses problem chapter manfred winced thats sore you know why are men so brave about battles and so scared of having their wounds tended asked francesca calmly cleaning the bullet graze on manfreds side i thought armor was supposed to protect you from this sort of thing ow its less than perfect against firearms pretty fair against swords or magical efforts and what is effective against firearms she asked sprinkling on basilicum powder getting out of the way or a nice thick earth rampart even stone can be shattered by big enough cannon but earth absorbs it ill get you to carry one next time she said beginning to wrap a bandage around his ribs i would hate to have had to explain to your uncle what had happened to you and if anyones big enough and strong enough to carry around his own rampart its you the last was not said in an entirely admiring tone of voice francesca had spent a number of hours under that weight of bone and muscleand manfred did not always remember to support himself on his elbows she finished pinning the bandage with a cabochonencrusted broach its all i have in the way of pins other than hair pinswhich would certainly stab you she kissed him there youll do now tell me where do we go from here eneko lopez says we go to corfu some of the surviving pirates talked they say emeric of hungary has invaded the island and the citadel is under siege they also say we have no chance of getting back to venice or even across to italy there are some fifteen galleys between us and the mouth of the narenta and more galliots onward is a risky proposition too there is a fleet in the straits of otranto so they intend to keep venice bottled up manfred shook his head the capitano thinks thats a ridiculous idea the venetian convoys would punch holes through any other sea force trying to block the adriatic francesca was silent for a while i think i must go and talk to eberhard at sea the venetians have mastery of the mediterranean but alexius controls the bosporus and the dardanelles and if the outremer convoy has already sailed for trebizond then he can prevent their return if they hold corfuwell the straits of otranto are only twentyfive leagues across they can harry shipping even if they cannot stop it well maybe manfred shrugged and winced for hed momentarily forgotten his wound im no naval expert but bickering between venice and the byzantines is nothing new venices trading privileges and possessions like corfu zante and negroponte have driven a succession of byzantine emperors to try and redress matters it doesnt happen imperial greek naval power is no match for the venetians and the depth of the byzantine empires money pouch is far shallower than venices this time alexius has gotten hungary in to be his muscle i suspect his muscle may end up eating him but if it gets to that point the empire will distract emeric we really dont want a powerful hungarian empire all the way through the balkans and greece we also dont involve ourselves in petty fights between our allies but francesca had other news that she had not thought relevant until this moment i think it may be more complicated than that not to mention nastier according to petro dorma alexius vi has recently been entertaining a visitor who possibly came from odessa an old friend of eriks caesare aldanto manfred grinned showing his square teeth the pretty blond who set him up to be arrestedor more likely killedin the brothel youd better not tell erik that or hell want to go chasing straight to constantinople aldanto already left there a shade ahead of the duke of ferraras best assassins i gather francesca frowned and tapped an elegant finger against her lips as she tried to recall everything else the doge had told her dorma hinted that the council of ten has put an unprecedented price on aldantos head too but manfred the reason i must talk to eberhard is that this cooperation between jagiellon alexius and emeric puts a very different slant on the holy roman empires desire to remain uninvolved alexius may want venetian possessions emeric may want byzantium but jagiellon wants only one thinga route into the underbelly of the empire manfred grunted i guess well just have to stop him succeeding corfu is a large island if i recall one of my more boring tutors surely there is more than one fortress francesca smiled in spite of herself you didnt pay attention so you rely on the fact that i did of course she waggled a finger at him youd better start learning to pay attention someday youll be somewhere where im not and youll curse yourself for not having the information when and where you need it he grinned sheepishly she delivered a frown then gave him what she knew there is only one real fortress there are a number of small fortified towns and villas built to withstand attacks but nothing that will stand up to modern siege weapons except the citadel at kerkira the fortress there is on an islet and the actual rock makes part of the ramparts the byzantines and then the venetians have improved on what nature had already made fairly good manfred assumed the impassive oxlike expression that francesca had learned indicated deep thought i think we need to hold a council of war he said eventually i dont know enough of venices affairs their military strength on corfu the ability of the venetians to withstand a serious siege or what our best course of action is i have to think for the holy roman empire not venice or eneko lopez i think i will go and call eberhard eneko erik benitoif theyve finished with his woundand falkenberg its a pity von gherens is on the other vessel id also ask the capitano to join you if hes gotten over having a divine gale push his ship he was still gibbering according to falkenberg ill ungibber him manfred cracked his knuckles hes been at sea in the service of the venetian republic for fortyfive years man and boy as he has repeatedly informed me a man of his experience shouldnt let a little of what father lopez assures us is ecclesiastically sanctified magic worry him manfred looked regretfully at francescas lush form i know it seems a pity but maybe youd better put some more clothes on he looked appreciatively at the outfit i havent seen that one before why were you wearing it when we were going to be attacked practicality dear he looked puzzled it doesnt look very practical except for one thing francesca my legs are not enveloped in clinging petticoats and we fight with what we have i know full well when mens bollocks start thinking their brains stop if i put on breeches and took up a sword even one of these attackers little brothers could kill me but if the best of warriors is intent on undoing his breeches well i have two knives there are certain other features about this outfit that are less obvious than knives too she did not add that if the fight was lost dressed in this fashion shed almost certainly be booty for the captain manfred would possibly not understand that sometimes the things one did to survive were not pleasant and she had a great deal of practice in that vein manfred took a deep breath youd probably get raped ah my dear tell me something i dont know francesca gave a wry smile a nuns habit and a wimple wouldnt stop that manfred now you go and get the others and i shall get changed he looked admiringly at the diaphanous outfit which was intended to hint at rather than reveal what was underneath i admit the need because i want your input at the council but it does seem a waste of time dressing is never a waste of time manfred dear because undressing someone again is part of the pleasure i shall dress and contribute what i can to your councils then later you can help me undress and contribute something to me as well she said lowering her lashes and now im supposed to concentrate on military matters grumbled manfred eneko lopez looked gray with exhaustion the capitano looked as if his eyes were still about to start out of their sockets he chose a position as far away from eneko as possible the others looked battered in various degrees too noted eberhardexcept for the old dukes grandson benito benito had a bandaged shoulder but it didnt seem to have slowed him down much he looked like one of those fused grenades hed tossed so effectively his eyes reminded eberhard of a sparking and sputtering wick as if he were alternating between wild excitement and exhaustion eberhard was an old man and a politician now but hed been a soldier once this one loved danger you had to watch that kind they took chances and they took others with them into their danger privately eberhard was pleased by the way manfred had handled the battle manfred would serve the holy roman empire well with some more experience very well indeed eberhard noted he was able to take advice that was rare especially when combined with an ability to act decisively and effectively and even rarer when combined with the ability to lead advice seekers often wanted others to make decisions not merely advise or else they merely wanted their own opinions confirmed and didnt listen when advice ran counter to it this meeting too showed a maturity that hed not expected merely calling them together like this proved that he was thinking past the successful escape of course eberhard wouldnt tell the young prince that but manfred had come a long way from the spoiled brat hed had the displeasure of meeting when hed been in mainz some years before i suppose the crucial issue is how well this venetian fortress at kerkira will withstand the siege basically it is the only fleetsize anchorage around the capitano made a wry face it could withstand nearly any siege if it were well enough supplied and had enough men milord but last time i was there the garrison commander was complaining bitterly about how few men he had commanders always complain about that said falkenberg the venetians couldnt have taken and certainly couldnt hold the island without enough men but francesca was already shaking her head there was another one whose still waters ran deep thought eberhard the old diplomat had a good idea that manfred had learned as much at the white hands of francesca as at the calloused ones of erik hakkonsen probably more in fact it wasnt taken she said the corfiotes invited the protection of the venetian empire more than a hundred years ago because they were having a lot of trouble with illyrian raiders the venetians sorted that out with superior sea power very quickly and easily they set up a feudal system of puppet local greek aristocratsthe libri doro as theyre called things have gone a little less smoothly lately andcorrect me if i am wrong capitanothe captaingeneral has little more than a policing force to make sure taxes are paid and venices rules obeyed the capitano nodded theyre mostly mercenaries dregs signorina id guess at less than a thousand on the whole island the barracks are almost empty and several of the buildings havent been used for some time there are a couple of other castlesvidos in corfu bay for instance but a lot of the places have just got a local capi and a few men all right for dealing with petty crime and the mercenaries he spat pah theyre not worth much as soldiers ones who would take a job like that theres no fighting so there is no opportunity for extra profits bonuses or loot but you wont get killed either lazy and stupidand maybe cowards locally recruited asked erik not so as id noticed milord said the capitano if i remember right i heard tell that the present byzantine emperors father sent agents across to corfu and stirred things up told them that theyre greeks not venetians that byzantium regards them as its own and that they would be rewarded with venetianheld positions and estates if they got rid of venice its true the corfiotes begged the venetians to annex corfu and protect it but as is the way of things the best jobs went to appointees of the senate sent out from venice the venetians have taken over a lot of estates the local greek nobility has a bit of an attitude about venetians as if they didnt want us in the first place the corfiotes are quick enough to take our money though francesca raised a perfect eyebrow and of course the venetians are as innocent as lambs and do nothing to exacerbate the situation she said dryly the capitano laughed coarsely except treat the locals like shit sorry signorina pardon my language too much time at sea and not enough talking with ladies i forgive you capitano she looked at manfred pointedly im used to occasional lapses eneko lopez yawned forgive me too but i am very very weary this discussion is all very well but i must get to corfu if chernobog seeks to prevent it then there is a reason even if the citadel stands or falls i must get to the island he regarded all of them broodingly that fleet was sent with one end in mind to sink us rather than to allow any of us to reach there that may have been because of me and my brothers or because of the large number of armed knights on this convoy or because ofwho we carry he blinked slowly however i do know this much before we reached venice a similar attempt was made to stop me and my brothers i must conclude that this was no coincidence and that chernobog wishes to keep us specifically from reaching corfu i dont know why chernobog is doing this but there must be some farreaching reason he has scryed he does not play for small stakes the holy roman empire or even christianity may be threatened you can put diego pierre francis and me off on a beach on the north end of the island erik cleared his throat arent you forgetting something senor lopez eneko blinked at him quite possibly erik the magic we worked was draining i am exhausted and not thinking at my best what is it they tracked you here chernobog tracked you previously too he can sense your movements and now you tell me that you wish to land on an island occupied by his allies erik was not normally inclined to irony but eberhard sensed the tone now you are a great mage senor but an arrow or sword can kill you as well as it can kill me especially if you are exhausted as you are now and unless you and your brothers have learned something new about turning invisible i think this is not the wisest of plans ive seen that on the northern frontier rumbled falkenberg mages can fight great magics but when all is said and done they need ordinary men and ordinary steel to guard them against purely physical threats ive seen a pagan mage that could blast men to ash chopped down unresisting because knights with cold iron and the holy cross attacked while he dueled magically eneko blinked again still i must go he said tiredly danger or no danger forgive me i cannot even think now but i see my duty clear eberhard patted him on the shoulder go and rest eneko lopez you are no use to us or your duty when youre exhausted leave it to us ordinary soldiers to get you into the citadel youll be protected there and on corfu will that do eneko stood up i believe it will but we will pray for guidance when you wake up said erik with rough kindness go and sleep now the cleric nodded and stumbled out leaning a hand against the wall when hed gone erik shook his head you may have just offered to do the impossible ritter eberhard or volunteered us to do the impossible we only have two hundred knights even with the ship crews and the squires we muster perhaps twice that breaking the siege is more than we can achieve emeric must have at least say ten thousand men there and his siege cannon will prevent any access by watereven if we fought our way through his fleet we lost two knights and five damnfool gloryhungry squires in that last effort some injuries too gunpowder should never have been invented grumbled falkenberg eberhard smiled dryly while the prince was being bandaged and you and erik were seeing to the men i saw to questioning one of the pirates it helped that knights of the holy trinity have something of an unholy reputation and that hed just seen some very terrifying magic we didnt even have to resort to torture the man was a mere sailor but he had a very good notion of just how many ships were employed in the attack on corfu most of them most of the troops and most of the cannon are still behind us to wit that fleet of carracks we avoided so right now there are at a guess no more than three or four thousand troops investing the citadel at kerkira actually there will be fewer than that as many are out ravaging corfus countryside if we can reenforce the citadel then it can hold until venice and the empire will send more forces to break the siege manfred grunted wed need to send word to get them here maybe send one of these vessels running for bari and send messengers overland to venice eberhard was dubious the sailor seemed to think more vessels were on their way from constantinople even so it seems a fair idea said erik split up squeeze all the knights onto one vessel land as much force as possible on the western coast of corfu storm the besiegers and hope that someone has the brains to let us into the citadel before emerics troops can regroup er said benito tentatively why dont we just sail up to the citadel manfred made a face siege cannon would smash the ships to kindling wait a bit there are no siege cannon according to our pirate informant anyway said eberhard wed hear and see the cannon duel from a good league off if it is happening itd be a risky enterprise nonetheless wed have to sail into the strait between corfu and the mainland at night there are bound to be patrols it might succeed for sheer audacity benito had been looking thoughtful throughout all of this it is not as risky milord as all that the moon is down from about three in the morning we can come in under oars from the south if we need to we can turn and run with the wind and it has to be the last thing theyd expect us to do arent you forgetting something asked erik somehow something is tracking eneko lopez benito shrugged it still has to marshal its ground or in this case water forces look at the trap we have just escaped its as likely to follow us at sea as to intercept us coming into corfu erik still wasnt convinced the other problem is that even if there are no siege cannon the venetians are as likely to sink us with their own cannon in the dark theyll be watching for sneak attacks we could unfurl the pennants benito countered theyre unlikely to fire on the lion of saint mark not in the dark erik pointed out manfred brought his hand down gentlemen francesca weve got at least a days sailing before we have to decide i suggest we eat and rest i will think about the various ideas and reach a decision but now i need to concentrate on the various contributions possible eberhard wondered why francesca smothered a smile chapter manfred had had them bring four of the knightproctors and the captain over from the dolphinswordfish and san raphael to the san nicolo the captains cabin was rather crowded manfred wondered if he ought to ask them to breathe in shifts right first the bad news we are being followed galliots under sail have been spotted from the masthead that was why we changed course in the dark last night a different sail was spotted this morning they are spread out and looking for us second more bad news corfu our next port of call is under siege by the byzantines and emeric of hungary i have it from eneko lopez that making sure corfu does not fall into the hands of these foes of venice is vital to the future of the church eberhard of brunswick says it is also vital to the future of the holy roman empire obviously its also vital to the republic of venice a state with which we are on friendly terms if not formally allied manfred looked at his audience which wasnt difficult since half of it was looming over him and the table and the other half was crushed in against him so we need to reinforce the garrison at corfu we also need to get a message back to venice and to emperor charles fredrik about what is happening here we have four vessels two hundred knights and fair number of sailors we need to achieve both of these objectives we need to split into three parties one ship to run on one to attempt to dodge backand two ships to attempt to relieve the citadel at corfu or at least to add men to its garrison well make landfall on one of the diapondia islands i will be taking the knights and what sailors and food can be spared to corfu capitanos selvi bortaliscono and da castresof your vessels one must come with us it may be sunk and i cant promise anything not even safety one of you must run for the open water of the mediterranean and sail on to rome his expression was grim youll face interception interference and you wont be any safer than we are if you get through messengers can be dispatched from there to venice and mainz eneko lopez will provide letters to the grand metropolitan of rome i will provide letters under the seal of the empire for our embassy there the other ship will attempt to return by sea to venice ill do a note for petro dorma but the captain can give the story best in his own words he cleared his throat all of these ventures are fraught with risk there are vessels pursuing us there are supposed to be byzantine vessels on a blockade ahead prince manfred how do you intend to relieve the siege asked captain da castres surely the vessels with the knights on them can offload you at some small fishing harbor or something then we can sail as a convoy that will be a great deal safer manfred smiled wryly captain da castres had an exaggerated notion of safety if he thought four ships were going to be any safer than two the key to defending corfus citadel is actually getting the knights and as many sailors as possible into the citadel weon horsebackcould possibly take the besiegers by surprise hope that someone inside opens the gates and that the causeway bridge is intact we and our squires all mounted could undertake that if fortune favored us if we took the enemy by complete surprise if the cannon from the citadel didnt simply fire on us we could get maybe half of the knights into the citadel with no extra supplies and none of the crews of the ships we could add maybe a hundred and fifty men to the defense he shrugged not a great help but some however we know the besiegers have several thousand menbut no cannon manfred pointed benito valdosta there you all know the boy you all know his bloodline benito looked furiously at manfred manfred knew why for benito his bloodlineat least that on his fathers sidewas not something he boasted of manfred was using that reputation manfred gave him a quelling lookdamn right i am he would use anything he could get his hands on right nowand went right on he came up with the plan that got us out of the pirates grip now hes come up with another idea the only way i can see that will deliver an extra five hundred men to the citadel as well as whatever supplies can be loaded into the vessels when he put the idea forward i thought he was mad ive pondered on it all night talked to capitano douro here we can indeed sail to the citadel itself by night but once theyre in the ships wont be leaving and assuming you succeed in the madness of sailing by night through the fleet of the enemy the guns in the citadel will sink you said the oldest of the captains selvi it has to be the most harebrained idea i have ever heard ah prince manfred manfred now knew which skipper to send onward that one he shared a look with benito who gave him a slight nod milord valdosta do you think it will work asked da castres ignoring the older man benito nodded more vigorously i cant see a better way captain there are some things in our favor i have thought about it long and hard believe me we know from the interrogation of our prisoners that only eight or so vessels remain at anchor out of cannonshot in the bay the northern entry is guarded by narenta galliots the south is blockaded by some of these eight vessels the rest of their fleet is out in the straits of otranto more ships are probably due from constantinople and if were going to do anything we need to do it before they get here he pointed at the sky the low cabin deck rather for a second thing the moon is down from early morning we can approach under muffled oars capitano douro here has found a corfiote serving among the oarsmen this man swears he can navigate safely to kerkira under those conditions the enemy will have less confidence in unfamiliar waters in the dark finally the guns of the citadel will not fire on the lion of saint mark eneko lopez and his companions say they can work a holy magic which blazons the banners as brightly as if in broad daylight well never get a better chance to get more men and supplies into the citadel with the fewest losses manfred patted benitos shoulder proprietarily there you have it capitano selvi besides well have our trumpeters on the foredeck sounding the battle hymn of the knights of the holy trinity there are few soldiers anywhere who would not recognize that finally this is not a matter for discussion he hardened his tone straightened his back and tried to sound as much like his uncle as possible this is what i have decided this is what will be done all of the vessels will take the parts i assign to them all i have called you together for is to finalize details to decide which vessel will have the honor of joining in our attempt to assist the citadel i am captain of my ship said selvi stiffly and responsible to the republic of venice for her safety von gherens stood up and put his hand on his sword captain i am a soldier of christ i am sworn by a holy oath to serve the church senor lopez is a direct emissary of the grand metropolitan ive been in combat with him i have never met a man who serves christ as well and with as much integrity as eneko lopez he has said that the church needs our aid if i have to chop your head off and sail your boat myself to get there ill do it benito looked at von gherens and manfred watched sudden realization dawning in his eyes well not surprising he hadnt lived with von gherens the way manfred had benito had never really understood the bluff hearty knight there was a core of deep piety under that harddrinking exterior if von gherens truly believed in the rightness of his deeds it would take a cannonball to stop him that could be a problem when his ideas were wrongbut when they were right there was nothing short of an armored elephant that it would be better to have on your side the captain also plainly realized hed misjudged its a ship not a bboat he stuttered iof course ill do my best to assist but ill volunteer to take my ship to corfu said the plump da castres he smiled revealing skewed teeth yellowed like a mules im more afraid of that knight than i am of either the senate or the enemy besides my wife says im too fat a siege will be just the thing and if it lasts long enough maybe absence will make her heart grow fonder ill explain that to her when i get back to venice said the lean dapper bortaliscono are there any other little services youd like me to render while im there you know da castres shook a fist at him grinning bortaliscono bowed mockingly to his fellow captain and turned to manfred ill need those letters before this evening prince manfred as soon as it is dark well sheer off westward the farther south we go the more ill have to beat back ill want to head for the italian coastline and creep up it manfred nodded well need to bring the ships together and transfer the knights horses and food i think we should be prepared to split up this evening selvi it looks like youre going on to rome its the course i should have chosen anyway prince manfred said the captain sourly but not too loudly manfred ignored him it will still be dangerous but it could also be the crucial route a message from there to flanders could beat the atlantic convoy theyll have to return posthaste i suspect the outremer convoy will be out of contention stuck in the black sea and the enemy will know that da castres pointed out they can count if there are only two of our ships in the harborand you can be sure they have spies everywherethen theyll know that the other two are running back for help he smiled nastily as selvi looked a little green manfred went below to write the letters benito was left scowling trying to think if there was any obvious hole in the plan that had now been laid squarely at his door he was scowling too at manfreds reference to his parentage i think that went off rather well said francesca to him smiling so why do you look so unhappy benito as if he was going to tell her oh nothing she looked quizzically at him it was that reference to your blood wasnt it its not exactly my favorite point of public knowledge he said grumpily she patted him on the arm benito it is public knowledge and manfred needed to mention the fact that you are descended from not one but two of the greatest strategists of the age to prevent any doubt that doesnt mean i inherited anything from either of them he pointed out still irritated but his irritation was fading fast it was impossible to stay outoftemper around francesca particularly when she was exerting herself to be charming maybe she was a little old for him but on the other hand older women were he forced his mind away from that line of thought francesca nodded benito whether or not you have inherited your strategic sense nevertheless you have itand if its suggested that you inherited it from the fox and the wolf both people will accept it as genius and be willing to act on it instead of thinking youre just an impudent boy benito sighed well that much he could accept but manfreds a commander manfred is neither a seaman nor a venetian he isnt even italian had this scheme been put forward as his idea the seamen might have refused they trust you and they trust that reputation von gherens could have severed a few heads said benito though he didnt really mean it well maybe he did she shook her head manfred and especially erik are well aware that it would not have helped you can threaten a weakkneed captain that way but not entire crews knights are not seamen if the seamen thought what was being proposed was suicidea hundred von gherens wouldnt have stopped them da castres bortaliscono and douro are not cowards even if capitano selvi is i suppose so but tell him i wish he hadnt done it francesca dimpled he knows that just because manfred is big people think he doesnt notice things besides she pecked benito on the cheek it wasnt his idea i told him to do it i apologize i wouldnt have done it if i hadnt thought it necessary but i think you let it worry you too much being illegitimate is not important is it he asked sourly she raised an eyebrow was it important when you were staying alive by your wits on the canals of venice he shrugged not really i suppose half the canalside brats and bridge boys didnt know who their fathers were so it was one of the case vecchie who mocked you about it caesare did admitted benito back after i went to live at casa dorma francesca gave a little snort of laughter and you are letting the opinion of such a one as caesare worry you a liar a spy a breaker of every oath he ever made who was for sale to anyone who had the money he was a bigger whore than ever i wasat least i always keep my promises benito acknowledged a hit i hadnt thought of it that way she smiled its all right benito you may be of the bloodline of the strategists of the age but i am a woman and therefore infinitely more perceptive and now id better go and correct manfreds spelling for someone of royal blood he is near to illiterate mind you should see his uncle charles fredriks handwriting the emperor normally has a scribe but anything he considers confidential or really important he insists on writing himself as she left eberhard of brunswick came across from the other side of the table and clapped him on the shoulder i hope this complicated plan of yours works boy i dont actually like complicated plans too much can go wrong when the actual fighting starts benito nodded i dont like plans where things have to be well coordinated or rely on something else happening right or exactly on time either um in my misspent youth milord i was involved with a thief who worked like that it got him killed caesare aldanto also liked multifaceted multipronged plans benito cleared his throat i admired him milord i did understand that often his plans only worked because he was very good at what he was doing and he changed his plans as he went along he also didnt mind who else got killed or hurt as long as he was all right the old man smiled wryly ive dealt with commanders like that when i was a soldier ive dealt with kings and chieftains like that as a statesman if they must go down theyll pull everyone and everything down with them but theyll sacrifice anyone and anything to keep from going down themselves well yes except most complicated plans rely on other people and if the word gets around they cant rely on you your reputation is ruined people need to know they can trust you to be where you said youd be and do what you said youd do before theyll even consider taking part in complicated plans which is why you wish to be seen as reliable benito blinked actually i hadnt thought of that what i meant is these people dont really know me so this plan doesnt rely on other people it might be crazy but it is dead simple really it doesnt rely on others having done something its just a simple sequence of events eberhard laughed events that just wouldnt occur to most commanders benito smirked ive found plans work best when the enemy isnt expecting them chapter swimming silent and deep and as far behind the ships as he dared while still keeping some kind of trace on them the great hagfish followed the encounter with the adversary had been terrifyingall the more so because the adversary had been not only supported by his companions but linked to them in a way that was as alien to the shaman as motherlove to link together thus was to open your mind and will totally to your companions the shaman would never do that voluntarily he could think of no one he would dare trust like that he soon realized that the vessels above and ahead of him had diverged hagfish can pick up blood and other scents in a part per million the darkness above was no cloak at all to the chemicalsensitive barbels around his mouth for a moment he dithered before deciding make it his masters problem his masters slave aldanto had virtual control of all of the byzantine ships and by virtue of exploiting ignorance control over the galliots the captains of those little vessels were superstitiously terrified of aldanto he could direct pursuit of the other ships the shaman could tell the master where they were heading a little later after this was done the shaman returned determined to follow and if possible arrange an attack on the two vessels heading for corfu the adversary was in one of them father francis frowned bracing himself against the bulkhead while the vessel lurched much of this plan relies on the enemy not being forewarned but eneko if we are being followed by some magical creature and it was able to direct those fleets to attack will it not warn the besiegers eneko nodded he was tired and he had rather not do this nowbut there was certainly no time to wait so we shall have to try to drive it away diego stretched bah so we have to deal with that thing again you know eneko i think i can still taste the slime well soonest done quickest mended when will we try it before the ships turn to make the tack back toward corfu it may conclude that we plan to make landfall that is well and good if it is in contact with the landtroops let them patrol there while we attempt to reach the citadel he stood brothers let us cast the circle and call the wards i believe that we will have much the same aid this time as the last perhaps forewarned we will make better use of it perhaps he thought this time the surprise will be on our side two hours later the shaman had retreated with desperate haste to deep water and was begging the master to open up a passage jagiellon answered with the same twisting passage through the spiritworld but it seemed an eternity to the shaman he fled up it and was spewed out onto the stone floor in a heap gracelessly the hagfish transformed into its human form and the shaman started screaming his wrinkled skin was blistered with long raised lashmarks even transposition could not heal them jagiellon allowed him to scream for some few moments before commanding be still the shaman had little choice but to obey despite wanting to scream and scream and never stop screaming it had not been a sword nor a lance that met him this time but a great fiery form that had dragged him into some neutral part of the spiritrealm and lashed him with a manytailed whip while he frantically tried to crawl away he had not gotten in a single blow of his own hed barely managed to escape eat skin commanded jagiellon come i go to eat some myself the shaman picked up his quodba drum with blistered fingers he could not help noticing that the skin of his onetime foe now the drumhead was singing vibrating just faintly all by itself benito a corfiote seaman capitano douro and erik stood in the captains cabin peering at a chart of the island if they have patrols out it will be here milord said the seaman pointing between kavos and the mainland it is only oh maybe three leagues across the strait there theyll have lookouts on both sides i presume asked erik studying the chart the seaman shook his head fiercely not on the mainland the lord of the mountains would never allow that the lord of the mountains iskander beg he is chief of the illyrians over there he is a very bad man the corfiote shuddered so there will be a watch on the corfiote shore mused erik but probably just a ship at anchor well off the other shore do ships sail this strait at night asked benito the sailor managed to look shifty evasive and shocked all at the same time oh no it is dangerous it is not allowed the podesta has orderedstrictlythat there is to be no shipping in the straits at night but you just happen to know how to sail it said benito dryly the sailor shrugged fishermen do it there are some fish best caught at night ah fish which would pay taxes if they were landed by daylight you neednt worry my friend chuckled benito im not a tax collector in fact a good friend a very very good friend of mine used to be involved in smuggling stuff into venice someone all of us here know in fact except maybe the capitano and i wouldnt be too certain about that the sailor looked hastily at the venetian captain and said nothing benito looked at the captain too capitano douro unless im a lot stupider than i think i am youve got some goods you werent planning to pay taxes on when the ship reached ascalon the captain looked startled well im not planning on telling anyone said benito and this ship wont be getting to ascalon i just wish to reassure our guide the captain nodded a matter of some amber just a few small choice pieces the seaman looked at benito shook his head and chuckled youre too sharp for one so young milord yes wed bring cargo in and land it right on the wharf in kerkira ive been up the strait in the dark more times than i can count there are a few places you need to avoid this time of year the current runs strong the worst piece will be the last bit we need to approach close to the mole farther east well rip her guts out but as i said to the skipper i can get us in the captain grunted not as well as you could if we had a load of taxable cargo on board he countered but he did so with a smile the oars were bound in sacking men sharpened weapons the gunners prepared the cannons though they were not to be used except as a last resort armor was readied but not donned if they got through the screen of guard boats then the armor would be hastily put on boarders and armor did not go together and they might have to board a guard ship it was an awkward combination of circumstances the moon a hazy object often hidden behind gathering clouds was slipping beneath the horizon it was going to be as black as the inside of a cat out there if they came upon a guard boat suddenly the knights would act as boardersno firearms just swords and murderous haste a single shot fired would mean retreat and landfall elsewhere after that if they were spotted theyd run for shore and try to beach the vessel the knights had already planned to smash out the cladding timbers between the ships ribs and swim their horses to shore once again armor was likely to drown both the knight and the horse so for that it would be helmets and shields only but in the final attempt to reach the citadel they aimed to bring the ships to rest on the shingle just off the northern side of the islet sea access to this was between the islet and castle on vidos and the corfu citadel itself the biggest difficulty was going to be keeping two silent darkened vessels in touch with each other they had one steersman and two ships a long line between the two helped a man on the bow of the second ship kept a coil of this line in his hand keeping the line tight without allowing it to pull he had to feel whether it was pulling away to any direction or if the front vessel was slowing or speeding up a second man in the bow of the second ship was ready to listen to softly made gull cries one for port two for starboard gulls shouldnt be calling in the small hours of the night but benitos ingenuity deserted him on this one at least it wouldnt sound as unnatural as voices by the time they reached the southern channel it was so dark that all that could be seen was a shape of deeper darkness where the landmasses lay well except for the cheerful lanterns that burned on the four equidistantly placed watch vessels how nice of them to show benito where they were it was all benito could do to stop himself laughing helplessly they slipped through relatively close to the lanternlit vessels just in case the enemy had put unlit vessels between in the tense darkness manfred snorted were past lets give a rousing cheer to celebrate there are more hurdles said benito listen you can hear the cannon fire they could a distant deadly rumble the steersman pointed those lights are lefkimi were passing lefkimi point now how long is it going to take us to get to kerkira whispered erik the man looked at the sky if we get the sail up now we should be within hailing distance just before dawn benito caught the flash of teeth or within cannon shot i hope those priests can come up with the magic they promised milord or the venetians own fort and vidos castle will blow us apart theyre very powerful christian mages those priests replied erik stiffly the corfiote didnt seem especially impressed ive no faith in priests magic on corfu we have some real old magics scary things but powerful sirs maybe more powerful than anything youve ever seen eneko lopez is one of the most scary men in the world and he is not going to let us down benito spoke quietly with a faith he hoped he felt i reckon well get a chance to see if that is true if he fails were shit fishshit soon enough said the steersman with morbid humor on the main deck the seamen were raising the carefully blackened mainsail under oars it had been tricky to keep the two vessels running in tandem under sail it would be virtually impossible the second vessel would just have to do its best with a helmsman following the dark patch that was the sail of the lead vessel they still had a good few leagues to go before the final dash theres a small vessel ahead also running without lanterns running away from us smuggler must be weve made someone shit themselves the seaman grinned manfred came up on deck what was that smugglership avoiding taxes said benito knowledgeably manfred halfchoked and just who is collecting taxes right now benito oh hell do you think it was a watchboat wed better run for shore no said erik decisively if it was a watch vessel someone would have fired off a signal what you saw there was a sign that things are pretty bad on the island that smuggler will have a human cargo hes taking refugees away not bringing illegal goods in ive got three sisters and a brother in achilleon said their steersman quietly i wonder whats happening to them its to be hoped that your brother was also involved with the night fishing sailor said the captain dryly emeric of hungary has a vile reputation for how he allows his soldiers to treat conquered citizens there was a chuckle spiro is my older brother thats how i came to be involved in the first place chapter there was just a hint of lightness in the sky dawn was still a little while off but morning was definitely stirring in the bed of night you can see the citadel against the sky it seems pretty quiet now said the corfiote steersman well maybe we can sneak in said benito i hope so if we have to use the priests the minute those banners are visible the gunners on the ships that are sure to be lying just out of range will open fire on us uhhuh falkenberg grunted his agreement thats a sure sign that the hungarians havent gotten their cannon yet when the cannon get here theyll pound those walls night and day but the venetians in the citadel will be watching for a sneak assault by sea according to our captain there are places men could be landed outside the walls if men could get inside the fortifications they could spike the cannon and nothing could hold off the assault er not from what i can gather said benito diffidently falkenberg had after all been at a dozen sieges as opposed to his nonehard to believe in a man that relatively young but still falkenberg was a veteran of the northeastern frontier of the empire where hed been born and raised there are three walls an outer curtain wall the inner wall and then the two castles on the hilltops a wonderful place for a holiday said falkenberg dryly great defenses are more than just three walls benito theyre enough menwith good moraleenough ammunition and enough food and water perhaps most important of all a loyal and determined population supporting them with no traitors and even if youve got those theres a lot to designing walls so that they work effectively making walls that can stand endless cannon fire is simply not possible entrenchments are more effective he went on to give benito a concise study of siegecraft ive been years in the learning of this stuff and before that i had the best teacher in the world it occurred to him that he should pass it on to me before i had to spend thirty years relearning it i think maybe ill start passing it on to you just in case you never know you might be able to make some use of it benito was sharp enough to understand the unsaid falkenberg thought most of them would die and he approved of benito valdosta and wanted to pass his knowledge on it might be spring but it was still bitterly cold here on the outer curtain wall in the small hours of the morning especially after crawling out of a warm bed from beside a warm wife true the warm wife had gotten up as well and had given him some food and a small flask of wine maria had her moments but generally she was a gem privately umberto acknowledged that his advancement was largely due to her and her connections hed entered the marriage with a lot of qualms but had come to treasure it more than anything hed ever had in his life still maria was back in that warm bed now and he was out on this cold tower by the grumbling from the other arsenalotti they were feeling equally miserable about the situation while staying within the lawjust barelyof venice and guild alike captaingeneral tomaselli was doing his best to make sure that they felt the misery of thwarting him umberto stamped his feet they were frozen already he would dress more warmly next time he stared into the night just what would he do if a hungarian or a croat stuck his head up over the parapet right now panic probably hed been a craftsman all his life not a soldier and had spent a lifetime holding tools in his hands rather than weapons the arquebus felt as unfamiliar as the issue rapier suddenly the darkness was lit by a bright golden blazon out on sea and then a second sound the alarum yelled someone to the guns to the guns there was a boom and a flash from out in the dark strait and virtually a heartbeat later an answering shot from the walls umberto ducked instinctively he looked seaward again and saw clearly the lateen foresail and the pennants of two vessels out there were glowing with a golden winged lion that outshone the darkness hold your fire he yelled hold your fire its the lion of saint mark his voice he found was being chorused by many others and then echoing above the pitterpitter of arquebusfire from the shoreineffective at this rangecame the bright glad sound of trumpets it was the battle hymn of the knights of the holy trinity and it struck fear into the hearts of their foes umberto recognized it and was deeply grateful hed never faced it as a foe looking at the light from the glowing emblem of venice he could see that it was gleaming off spiky helmets and armor the captured shore was now a mass of hastily running figures the enemy hadnt expected a night attack and certainly not here at the main point of their own assault san marco san marco the men on the walls yelled and cheered there was another flash as yet another one of the byzantine or dalmatian pirate ships fired a cannon the ship was plainly in pursuit of the two galleys that were flying pennants with the strange glowing winged lions the vessels looked like typical great galleys in the dim light from the pennants bring the guns to bear on those who follow umberto shouted the words without thinking about whether or not he had the authority to give orders to the bombardiers he might not be familiar with weaponscertainly not cannonsbut hed been a foreman by the time he was thirty commanding men in practical tasks was now second nature to him already he saw there was cannon fire from vidos i hope to god theyre firing on the pursuit the two galleys with their golden winged lion pennants streaming were now within cannon shot of both fortresses the venetians fire seeking for targets in the darkness might have been hampered by the lack of visibilitybut luck or the winged lion was certainly with one of the gunners sudden fire flared out on the dark water behind the two galleys perhaps a ball had struck a banked stove and scattered embers into a smashed powder keg whatever the cause there was now a vessel on fire out on the water and it wasnt either of the two flying the lion and the sky was definitely lighter umberto could see that the greatgalley crews must be stroking as if their very lives depended on it which in fact they did the blazoned winged lions so clearly visible made them easy targets the cannon fire from the citadel and vidos would discourage pursuit but theyd still be within cannonshot of other vessels but they were firing their own sterncannon now if they were in range so too were their foes along the shore the trenches were flashspeckled with the muzzleflash of arquebuses if they planned to make landfall there theyd do it in the face of stiff opposition but it looked to umberto as if the vessels were bearing down directly on the citadel the usual anchorage behind the bermbreakwater would be directly under smallarms fire from the shore behind him umberto heard horsemen the captaingeneral and the bulk of his cavalry were coming down at a hasty trot umberto saw that many of the troopers were still trying to buckle themselves into their breastplates people too were streaming out of the houses behind the curtainwalls heading for the wall direct your fire on the trenches keep the buggers heads down bellowed an officer the galleys are going to make a landing here beneath the wall umberto found himself holding his breath there was a strip of shingly beach below the wall on this side of the berm on the seaside the berm would provide some shelter and the ships would be at least three hundred and fifty yards from the enemyheld shore that was well and goodbut was the water deep enough close in enough to allow the vessels to beach umberto was a shipbuilder he doubted it and moreover the gate that had been used for workers to get access from the citadel to the port was at least a hundred and fifty yards closer the storehouses of the little arsenal lay just inside that gate he hastened over to leopoldo the garrison commander milord permission to take some arsenalotti down to the port gate we can push some heavy balks of timber onto the beach for them to shelter behind leopoldo peered at him umberto verrier go to it here sergeant go with him to provide my authority to the gate he turned to one of his captains ill want all the fire we can muster from the northeast tower see to it domenico umberto hurried down calling to various people as he ran he wasnt much of a fighter maybe but he could handle timber and he loved shipsnot sailing in them the ships themselves the thought of those ships ripping their bottoms out was not a pleasant one maria had slipped back into sleep after umberto left but the sound of the cannons woke her it sounded serious she got up and listened harder it was serious had the hungarian king got his cannons onto the island then was this the moment theyd all been dreading for days if so if so then every able body would be needed on the walls there was no way she could leave alessia and she had a horrible feeling she might need both hands so she tied the baby to her back in a large shawl then she took up the wheellock pistol that kat had given her when theyd gone out in search of marco in what seemed a lifetime ago she also took the largest cleaver in her kitchen on her way to the door as soon as she was outside she headed for the wall she had no doubts as to what her fate would be and that of alessia if the hungarians breached the walls if nothing else she could fling rocks you didnt have to be a soldier to fling rocks down on those below she went pelting down the hill along with several hundred others all showing signs of hasty dressing and of seizing the first arms that came to hand here a rolling pin there an arquebus or a boarspear or a breadpeel half the citizens of the citadel seemed to be running to the outer curtainwall then she heard the cheers san marco san marco that didnt sound as if things were going badly in fact it sounded more like a welcome than a calltoarms and it was coming not from the landward side but the seaward side her headlong run slowed slightly she looked out into the darkness peering at where the shouts were coming from for a brief moment she thought she was seeing things the winged lion of venice was coming across the sea and it was as golden as the sun itself then she realized it was just an image of the winged lion glowing from lateen sails and pennant flags there must be a couple of vessels out there corfu wasnt being attacked it was being reinforced she went to join the throng on the wall to join the cheering now rather than the defense the two vessels now easily visible in the growing light looked as if they were racing each other for the shore they were rowing toward the sheltered water of the lshaped bermexcept that they didnt seem intent on getting into it which would have put them right up against the enemyheld shore instead they were heading for the seaward side of the berm she saw the lead vessel shudder and heard the snap of oars as the vessel hit some underwater obstruction she could make out a stickfigure frantically waving at the other vessel from the poop the other vessel bore hard to seaward the first vessel was still edging forwardshe was barely thirty yards from shorebut obviously leaking and sinking the silence from the wall was now profound people were hardly breathing cannon still roared from the landward wall but here it was still the second ship passed over the obstacle and with a sugary crunch they could hear from the wall slid to a halt it was still in the water but not very deep water men began pouring off it jumping into the shallows on the eastern side of the vessel with the ship between them and the firing from the trenches on the mainland of corfu then part of the cladding timbers were smashed out of the side and knights waistdeep began hauling horses out of the hole in the hull of the ship by now it was obvious the other vessel was not going to get much farther water was overhead deep to judge by the men swimming ashore to her shock maria recognized the stocky figure who emerged dripping from the sea benito valdosta yelled up at the watchers hands to these ropes all of you move she was even more shocked when she recognized the emotion surging through her dont be stupid she snarled at herself joining the little mob racing to help with the ropes chapter benito was nearly thrown overboard when they struck the rock he knew straight away they were in trouble the galley had a draft of one and a half fathoms when she was this heavily laden they were relying on hitting the shore at speed to beach the vessel so that the men could emerge without swimming now theyd lost their momentum and she was holed the ship would ride deeper than her one and a half fathoms the sailors could easily manage the twenty yards to shore if they could swim the knights in heavy armor had not a chance get them to strip their armor yelled benito takes too long bellowed manfred above the bedlam of screaming horses and shouting men get a rope to the shore commanded the captain benito took the end of a light line get the anchor rope on the other end he shouted and dived overboard on the beach he saw hed arrived in the shallows just ahead of the corfiote steersman who also had a rope hands to these ropes all of you move he commanded maria saw how the port gate had opened farther up the shore toward the hungarian trenches great balks of timber were being thrust out and now in the shelter of these hundreds of men and women from the citadel were streaming to help maria ran to join them it was only when she was out on the shingle that it occurred to her that a woman with a baby on her back shouldnt do this it was too late by then though so she ran on by the time she got there the men were hauling at the anchor ropestwisted hempen lines as thick as her armof the galley still wallowing and sinking further out they were using the second galley as a bulwark and by the looks of it the arsenalotti who had pushed out the timber barrier were extending and raising it still shots whistled overhead as handspan by handspan they hauled the other galley closer someone had unlimbered a small boat from the first galley and it was hastily paddled out the fifteen remaining yards or so to begin bringing people in get men with shovels and start digging a trench we need to unload shouted a voice maria recognized erik hakkonsen what a bitter irony svanhild was not in the citadel but out there somewhere hopefully safe what the hell are you doing out here maria benito looked anything but pleased to see her andjesus weptwith your baby get back no stay here its safer here ive come to help you out of your mess she snapped back and my child goes with me at her age she has to merde well just stay behind the dolphin at this range theyre not going to get a bullet right through her he ran out regardless of his own safety getting into deeper water come on shes only neck deep on a short knight lets have what people we can off and then well haul her a bit further in another five yards and well get the horses out maria saw francesca and eneko lopez and some other clerics coming ashore in the small boat she waved but they didnt notice her well thered be time for greetings if they survived all this a group of very brave magyar cavalrymen or perhaps just very stupid ones had swum their horses across the channel between the citadel and corfu island the cannon and gunfire from above had had a devastating effect on what had been perhaps four hundred men who had set out to cross the gap now the remainder had won the sand strip and were charging down it a handful of arquebusiers had taken up position behind the balks of timber the gate swung hastily shut behind them but there was timber in the way it could not be closed what had started out as a glorious rescue mission was fast turning into a fiasco and then maria realized that knights of the holy trinity were already swinging themselves into the saddle perhaps only thirty of them were ready to mount but they were up and riding broadswords out hurtling toward the oncoming hungarians when the hungarians had begun their charge theyd outnumbered the knights by five to one by the time they clashed however those odds had been viciously reduced the wall on their right was lined with peoplesome soldiers firing but the rest just men and women throwing whatever they had in their hands even cobblestones the knights were still outnumbered three to one but these were the knights of the holy trinity perhaps europes finest they hit the hungarians on a narrow strip of beach too narrow for either side to ride more than eight abreast for the swim across the magyar knights had reduced the weight of their armor to breastplates they were very much at a disadvantage compared to the knights in full armor even as the first handful of knights charged more knights were mounting yelling and swearing at the venetian sailors in their way the sailors too were running to the timberbalk barrier with arquebuses pistols and cutlasses if the magyars could have carried their charge to the open gate it would have been a different story speed had lent them some protection from those on the wall but now stopped and completely defenseless against the attack from above they were being annihilated and the second galley was now discharging more wet angry knights let them handle that roared a bulllike voice manfred strode through the small waves and grabbed the anchor rope haul on the count of three manfred had both the voice and the presence for command so more men rushed to seize the ropes the ship however was filling up settling heavier much heavier maria who was now hauling the water for their little house daily knew just how much water weighed one two three heave the vessel moved sluggishly it wallowed like a drunken cow and again one two three out beyond the ships the magyars were being reduced to bloody fragments maria promptly dismissed them from her mind and went back to something she could do something about the rope snapped manfreds first heroic impression made on the corfu garrison was of himself sprawling on his backside in the shallows legs in the air the roar of general laughter was inevitable if hardly kind to his dignity because only one rope was now hauling the boat it slewed sideways a bit till the prow touched the stern of the other vessel i wouldnt have put my nose there said one wag erik had returned to the scene up all of you the ships must be unloaded he too had the presence of command those who had been hauling on the first rope if they could not find space on the second fell into a line heaving bags and boxes and unidentifiable bits into the fortress maria found herself sharing a burden carrying in a grain bag with another garrison woman the woman looked at her with the liveliest of curiosity you look terribly ordinary after the stories id heard what stories asked maria warily what have you heard from whom i had it from rosalba benelli who heard it from her maid whose sister is one of the poor girls who work for sophia tomasellis friend melina that milady verrier had been seen in an alley in kerkira with your dress up and two sailors she snickered clearly not in the least inclined to believe itnot now at least maria snorted shes talking about her own daydreams im a respectable married woman besides when would i have time i do the work of my household myself and thank you i dont need twenty little girls to do it for me she felt slightly guilty saying that since alessia wasnt umbertos child but she owed it to alessiaumberto too for that matterto kill any such rumors the woman slightly plump and with a distinct twinkle in her expressive eyes clicked her tongue tch and there i was going to ask how you managed two she rolled her eyes i cant even manage my alberto he keeps falling asleep especially now theyre doing these guard shifts maria grinned i think we women should complain to the captaingeneral the woman at the other end of the sack snorted and have randy tomaselli offer to help out no thank you very much marias mouth twitched maybe we should suggest to dear sofia that he needs a little the other woman began giggling what that would be beneath her dignity besides it would spoil her makeup only she if she smiled which seems unlikely maria said thoughtfully as they tramped over shingle that slipped and rattled under their feet or maybe she doesnt just plaster her face does she have to do the whole body the plumpish woman looked as if she was going to fall over and drop the sack oh lord and saints if she could hear you she went off into shrieks of laughter they reached the gate and the pile of food bags just as maria was beginning to think the woman would kill herself laughing they dumped the bag and the woman hugged maria you cant know how nice it is to hear someone being malicious about milady sophia tomaselli for a change my name is stella mavroukis i dont care if weve been told by her ladyship not to talk to you maria verrier im married to stella grinned wickedly we know all about umberto i even know what you send him for lunches thats the trouble with corfu small community not much to do but gossip but it used to be fun back before her ladyship got here come on lets fetch another sack by the time they got back with the next sack maria knew the names ages childhood diseases and mischief of all five of stellas brood as well as several intimate details about her alberto that maria was sure would never allow her to meet alberto without blushing or at least laughing she also knew that alberto was a greek venetian son of one of the many craftsmen that the republic of venice had seduced into her state with offers of citizenship money and employment also of course theyd torn sophia tomasellis character appearance and morals to shreds very pleasurably benito staggered under his load falkenberg in full armor was no lightweight he was also not helping much theyd been up on the beach where the battlehardened knight had just gotten his precious horse to shore hed clapped benito on the shoulder well we made it although this last bit has turned into a horses then a stray ball hit him it was one of those flukes that happened it had hit his visor which had shattered the knight had fallen slowly so slowly that benito had been able to catch him now they staggered toward the fortress benito no longer thought of strategy or tactics just of getting the bleeding man to help and off this beach a venetian came and took the other side of falkenberg and together they staggered to the gate while the firefight raged and the knights ripped the magyar heavy cavalry to pieces falkenberg was now totally unconscious and lolling between them what happened panted the venetian with a little sense of shock benito realized it was umberto verrier the man who had married maria he was hit in the face by a ball they were inside the gates by now lets put him down see if we can stop the bleeding they laid falkenberg down on the cobbles and benito bent over his face feeling sick if only marco was here my god what a mess fragments of steel had torn into the eye and right side of falkenbergs face and head the inside of the helmet was a mess of blood and fleshshreds it was still bleeding what the hell do we do he asked the older man for an answer umberto had already run over to two other men he brought them over to the knight with a couple of broad slats these men are from the hospital theyll take him up there the chirurgeons will help him will he live whispered benito too early to tell said one of the hospitalers critically but well have him on these planks and up there in two shakes of a lambs tail if youll get out of the way sir hastily benito complied meanwhile umberto called to two of the men who were struggling to push the timber further out so that the gate could be closed the timber at the bottom is not going to move alberto theres too much weight on it so what do we do asked the other we need to be able to close this gate umberto took a critical look theyre still using it as a shelter lets move what we can on the top its only two or three of the lower balks that should be a problem maybe if we can get a lever of some sort to them benito found himself manhandling huge pieces of keel and strut timber when maria came past she was so busy talking to another woman that she didnt notice her husband or benito working sidebyside with verrier benito was finally coming to accept not simply acknowledge the truth of what everyone had always said about umberto he was a quiet good man who loved his craft and he was by the looks of it very good at it benito had met umberto once or twice over the years briefly if not socially a bridgebrat went everywhere and saw everything he knew him to look at if not to talk to but everybody always said the man was a solid fellow working with him benito had to concede that they were right hed prepared himself to find reasons to dislike umberto now he found that it was impossible and it stuck in his craw and he hated that it stuck in his craw did life always have to be such a confusing mess benito left organizing the offloading of the galleys and the orderly retreat from the beach to manfred he concentrated instead on helping to lever the pile of timber a little further out while umberto organized ropes on each timber so that they could be snaked back over the wall umberto was a typical venetian in that way not wasteful benito was rewarded when a little while later he saw maria still walking with her friend still talking stop abruptly and gawp at the two of them working next to each other chapter i cant deny im very glad to see reinforcements prince manfred ive been wishing i had some way of getting word to venice captaingeneral tomaselli limped over to a cabinet on the wall hauled out a metal flask and a tray of venetian glassware and limped back to his table try this gentlemen i think we all need something a great deal stronger than wine its from the mainland they distill it from plums i believe he poured the clear liquid into glasses and motioned that they should help themselves he took one of the glasses is a lady permitted to try some too asked francesca of course of course the flustered venetian handed her a glass unless you would prefer some wine this stuff is frightfully strong francesca lowered her lashes i think milord after the morning weve had id better have some strong drink she tossed it back without any sign of discomfort that was more than could be said for erik he choked and spluttered even manfred went a little red benito sipped the clear liquid cautiously it burned his throat and all the way down to his gut only von gherens managed to drink it with anything like francescas aplomb the captaingeneral stared at her with respect for the first time seeing something beyond her cleavage saints alive he shook his head i cant drink the stuff like that did you enjoy it francesca smiled and nodded her head the captaingeneral sat down shaking his own well back to the matter in hand the podesta has offered the officersand you of course prince manfredquarters in the castel a mar your escort also we can quarter all your other men and horses here at the castel a terra he sighed softly truth to tell we could hold several hundred more men there was no perceived threat here and were badly undermanned four thousand men would be an optimum number for this fortress i had twelve hundred under my command but that is on the whole island only nine hundred and fifty odd are here where are the rest asked manfred about a hundred and seventy are on vidosthat small islet out there the rest were stationed in various towns and villages still this siege cant hold there are relatively few men out there and they dont appear to have any siege pieces manfred looked grim the guns and a lot more men are on their way im afraid youre in for the long haul how are you for food and water there are a couple of springs on the citadel and we have reservoirs here in the castle the reservoirs are full and this soon after winter the springs are strong as for food were not so welloff winter is over but with the fleets coming and going were used to reprovisioning wheat particularly on the autumn convoy so were about half way good for eight months at the very least arms are the one thing we have plenty of well even rocks will do when it comes to defending walls said erik rocks and enough people is what we need and we have enough rocks even if we could use more people we brought you a good supply of knights and some extra citizens said von gherens with a smile how are the corfiotes outside the walls being treated the captaingeneral blinked weve seen a lot of fires could be venetian villas burning could be some peasant villages weve seen some atrocities from the walls why sir one of the things ive seen over and over again on the northeastern frontier where the peasantry resent the hand of their overlords we push forward easily enough emeric of hungary is renowned to be a harsh man a firm believer in the lash and the knout i know my friend falkenberg was involved in some fighting down in bohemiaagainst emerics fatherbefore the emperor concluded the peace of brno he said it was like a knife through butter the peasants were fawning on the prussians as if they were saints showed them all the hungarian defenses traps and so on found them food and fodder and guided them and tore their former masters apart when they had the chance its different up in sweden there the tribesmen even the karls resist us to the last man belike if your men out there stir up trouble itll be more than emeric can do to hold this island one of the captaingenerals officers sniffed disdainfully i hardly think that will apply here the greeks are degenerate cant work cant fight all they can do is talk about ancient glory the plump captain of the dolphin snorted ive had corfiotes in my crew theyre good oarsmen better than dalmatians better than venetians even seems to me youve got a local problem with them he turned to benito and how is ritter falkenberg by the way milord valdosta the chirurgeon says he will probably live but hes lost an eye i was across there too said von gherens shaking his head his face is a mess and he looks like hes been cupped fifteen times but hes alive and has his wits he said he got hit on the only soft spot in a head thats as solid as a rock he also said the last thing he remembers is you lugging him in boy the landing wasnt the success i had hoped it would be admitted benito glumly hells teeth boy its a damn sight better than wed have done any other way snapped von gherens we lost three men and we have three more with serious injuries if wed tried to charge our way in wed have considered ten times that light war means casualties yesbut von gherens slapped his breastplate with a mailed hand but me no buts our comrades get hurt our friends die falkenberg is a knight who swore an oath to serve the church and to defend the weak hed be the first man to tell you to stop puling and start planning because what we are doingat risk to ourselvesis what we have sworn to do the west relies on us it is a risk we take with pride it is an oath we honor even when some soft southern burgher mutters about us we know the reason he sleeps soft and comfortable why his wife is able to complain about the price of cabbages as her most serious problem and why his children dare to throw dung and yell knot when we pass its because we are what we are for all our faults we stand for law and light he smiled and his tone softened a good plan is one that keeps our casualties light and costs our enemy dear keep making them benito valdosta manfred cleared his throat and that brings us to discussing the defenses of this place with all respect captaingeneral we have veterans of a dozen sieges here we offer you our expertise as well as our arms your arms are appreciated the captaingeneral said stiffly but this is a venetian fortification under venetian command manfred opened his mouth to speak and francesca kicked him von gherens unfortunately wasnt in kicking range he snorted youre undermanned underprovisioned and badly organized you that will do von gherens barked eberhard in a tone so stern it made even manfred blink i apologize captaingeneral the ritter spoke out of turn and we appreciate your hospitality and especially this drink added francesca throatily holding out an empty glass but is it already being rationed the captaingeneral lost his train of angry thought and gawped as she poured charm on him my apologies signora of course not allow me he poured out another after a moments hesitation von gherens put out his glass i spoke hastily there captaingeneral apologies accepted said the captaingeneral stiffly he limped forward and filled the knights glass anyone else benito watched francesca calmly empty the glass into the purse hanging from her chatelaine while the venetian officers attention was on von gherens perhaps later she said putting down the glass right now i am dying to put off these salty clothes and have a wash she fluttered her eyelashes at him erik nodded yes the armor especially the joints must be cleaned and oiled the salt water does it no good von gherens groaned that was the worst aspect of your plan benito the captaingeneral rang a bell ill have one of my men show you to your chambers francesca smiled at him thank you captaingeneral tomaselli you are too kind you may call me nico signora he said bowing over her hand and kissing it benito felt rather than heard the low rumble from manfred he also caught francescas wink to the prince while the venetian officers head was down well its a nice bed said manfred testing it naturally enough the bed complained but i dont know if it was worth you nearly seducing that venetian ass for a good bed is past price darling said francesca carefully emptying her purse she looked at it sadly you will have to get me a new one manfred i think the leather will be quite ruined by that vile drink i thought you liked it said manfred with an evil grin you nodded when fancypants asked you i saw you i had to nod i couldnt speak im afraid the disgusting stuff may have ruined my vocal cords forever besides if i had opened my mouth i might have been sick she sniffed cautiously at the reticule bleh even if it doesnt ruin the leather i refuse to live with the smell and there i thought youd finally learned to drink manfred shook his head sadly ill admit the stuff was strong enough to make me pause he might run a lousy garrison but he certainly has a drink that would put hair on your chest i certainly hope not said francesca but it was all part of the show manfred manfred stood up and reached for her laces i better check about the hair he teased what do you mean part of the show i hope you dont mean the hair she lifted his hands aside kissed them and said later when you dont smell of oil and old iron and fish and seaweed what i mean by part of the show was that it was our little captaingenerals attempt to show how tough he was think of it this is a backwater of venetian defense its a major point in their resupply and trade routes but for a commanding officerwell its not a place venice expected to be attacked a junior posting more like a backwater posting hes not so young she patted manfreds broad shoulder now think you are a given such a postinga good trade spot but militarily a sign of being relegated to someplace where you cant do any damage and suddenlya siege he hasnt done too badly really from what weve been told had he been a totally arrogant ass like that fool who told us greeks were no good the fortress would have fallen to emerics sneak attack instead someone did some preparation saved the citadel and saved a good many lives outside it doesnt look as if hes doing too badly so far all things considered venice will be proud of him thats what hes thinking and then in come a couple of hundred of the empires greatest knights in the most dramatic style poking a stick in the eye of the enemy led by a prince of the blood who offers to assist him in conducting the defenses manfred swallowed it was well meant francesca i know she said gently but then im not a thinskinned minor noble with a dying military career and i nearly ruined my toes kicking you i wish i could have kicked von gherens too manfred grinned hed have asked why you were kicking him chapter benito was assigned a room in the castel a mar after washing he found himself in no state to sleep so he set out to do what he had been told to on arriving in corfu reporting to the dorma factor asking directions benito set out got himself thoroughly lost and eventually found his way to the mans residence he was not at home so benito left a message and walked across to the hospital to see how falkenberg was doing you cant see him said the monk hes finally asleep hes in pain young man sleep even assisted by laudanum is the best thing for him tell him ill come back later is he going to be all right the monk shrugged if he doesnt get secondary infections weve prayed over him weve used such skills as we have we have used a fragment of the blessed saint landrys hand benito wished desperately that his brother were here but all he could do was thank the monk and leave he stood outside on the street looked about and bit his lip finally with a feeling in his stomach as if hed been kicked there by von gherens asked a passerby where can i find the home of umberto verrier the man shrugged never heard of him hes a master caulker just come out from venice try the storeyards down at the outer northeastern gate so benito passed out through the inner curtain wall and on down to the storeyard given the way his day had been going so far he was not surprised to find that umberto had taken a belated breakfast and was now back at home which was inside the curtain wall look for the last house before the road to st agathas between the hills hes got a goat in his yard you can usually hear it it leans over the wall and bleats at passers by they feed it only man i know with a watchgoat said the corfiote laborer grinning its got a weakness for kourabiedies benito knew exactly which house the man was talking about then hed passed it on his way to look for the dorma factor and again while walking to the hospital he sighed it had been that sort of day whats wrong enquired the burly laborer nothing much ive just walked down from virtually next door anyway thanks the man grinned showing missing teeth youre welcome i saw you coming in from the ship this morning and working with old umberto hes not a bad soul for a venetian so benito walked back up he found the house the goat leaned over the wall and bleated at him taking a deep breath he walked up to the door and knocked maria opened the door baby on arm benito what are you doing here you know this young fellow asked umberto smiling and getting up from the table he gave me a lot of help this morning come in young man we never got formally introduced i know your face from venice this is my wife maria but you already seem to know that benito bowed maria was very good to me while i was growing up im benito valdosta marco valdostas brother umberto looked faintly awed the ward of the doge and more trouble than hes worth said maria it wasnt exactly welcoming but at least she wasnt yelling at him benito held out his hands pacifically im trying to reform really back when maria met marco and me we were both bridgebrats and always in trouble maria snorted you were marco wasnt he was a trainee saint even then benito grinned even when he ran off into the jesolo after writing loveletters to angelina dorma maria shook her head a reluctant shadow of a smile coming to her face he was a young idiot he grew up oh i agree about the saint part and the idiot part which he never grew out of i still love him dearly he sighed and if this wasnt such a hideous situation id wish he was here now maria smiled properly now he and kat are both idiotsat least by your standards benitobut i also love both of them very dearly theyre our alessias godparents you know i know said benito she couldnt ask for better ones umberto beamed on both of them well why dont you come in and have a glass of wine with us you being by the way of things a sort of goduncle to my daughter then you can tell us what we can do for you you have a place to stay benito had to swallow hastily he nodded looking around maria and umbertos little home was small spartan and lovingly tended from the simple tablecloth to the little wicker cradle in the corner umberto certainly hadnt been able to smother maria garavelli in worldly goods but hed given her what shed needed a home stability and a reliable father for her baby someone who wouldnt go doing crazy things that might get him killed i have a place to stay thank you i just came to pass on kats messages she sends her love to you and to little alessia she said i must tell you to write i also came to offer my help if there was anything useful i could do for you he finished lamely it didnt seem like a very good reason for seeking someone out he looked at the baby and maria standing madonnalike she looks wellfed at least you didnt say she looks beautiful like everyone else does said maria tartly here hold this wellfed baby while i get the wine she passed the plump bundle over benito found himself with a soft milkybreathed baby in his arms after the initial shock it didnt feel too bad the habited woman on her knees tending the flowers outside the hypatian order chapel looked up as eneko lopez and father pierre approached and how can i help you my sons she asked pleasantly were looking for a sibling eleni explained pierre the sibling got up dusting her knees she had the ageless sort of face ornamented by bright brown eyes that eneko tended to associate with hypatian siblings there was something about the cloistered life that kept age at a distance that is me actually there is only me here how may i help you eneko nodded its rather a long story sibling but we have here a letter from the grand metropolitan of rome we were on our way to jerusalem before our ship was diverted here the nun smiled it was clear then as fine lines appeared around her mouth and eyes that she was if not old certainly no longer young if it is a long story let us go into the chapel god doesnt mind listening out here but it is cooler for us there she nodded politely at eneko your reputation and description go before you senor lopez im afraid i dont know you she said to the priest accompaning him father pierre he said simply smiling ah she said nothing else until they were within the tiny chapel and seated on some stools she brought from the back of the building well now how may the hypatian order on corfu serve you youve come to heathen parts im afraid she shook her head but with more fondness than irritation the locals attend church faithfully but i know for a certain fact that many of them continue their worship of a pagan deity a bloodthirsty goddess of some sort i suppose that is i suppose she is bloodthirsty because the men seem to hold her in some fear the womenwell they keep their secrets to themselves she sighed its all nonsense of course but they are happy in their nonsense and we try to educate them slowly the island is simply stiff with such superstitions you would not mind sibling if we enact the ritual of the veil of divine privacy eneko shook himself ive just seen two birds of prey high in the sky i know there is a war on and the hawks and eagles come to feast but ill swear ive seen those birds following us since we left rome the sibling spread her hands wide you may do as you wish father lopez you know the hypatian order believes strongly in the appropriate use of christian magic whenever needful the chapel was built with a careful alignment to the four cardinal directions statues of the archangels michael gabriel raphael and uriel stood on plinths in their corners eneko and pierre set about raising the wards soon the distant sounds of the citadel were shut off inside the veil it was with a feeling of relief that they returned to their stools we have had scryings both of great deeds and portents of magical conflict here sibling eneko said certain now that nothing could overlook him evil in the shape of chernobog and an ancient power that we could not identify the small sibling started here here on little corfu oh no father eneko nothing ever happens here the locals talk about magical corfu but it is small magics if there are any at all superstitions and mutterings about the goddess but never have i seen a sign of great pagan power there are a few jews who may be involved a strega charmseller or two virtually every hamlet has its socalled wisewoman who might dabble in birthing spells but that is it she shook her head emphatically unless it is something the hungarian invaders have brought with them not something from here hmm might we try a scrying as an afterthought eneko added and also a contact spell if there is any chance of contacting him brother mascoli of st raphaella in venice could pass word to the venetians about the siege and perhaps get it relieved of course the chapel is yours father i wish i could help you but i fear that i myself am very unskilled in such matters the sibling smiled but wistfully you know that the order welcomes those with many skillsand there never seemed to be a need for a magician here so they sent me im better with small children and gardens than i am with great magic a little magic to make my herbs grow a soothing spell for a colicky child that sort of thing i do not believe these will be of service to you now on the other hand i could not soothe a child lopez felt impelled to tell her in fact i rather think i would give it nightmares the lord welcomes all who serve sibling but a few minutes later when concentrating on brother mascolis image eneko lopez discovered that now the greater magics were beyond him too it was a shocklike reaching for something you knew was there only it wasnt or waking up to find that someone had amputated a hand look at the archangel uriel whispered pierre roundeyed eneko turned slowly to look what he was looking at just wasnt there the golden glow haloing the statue summoned by the invocation was gone there was no ward of the north we enacted the veil ritual without any difficulty a power great enough to attack an archangel he took a deep breath and tried to steady himself no wonder our scrying didnt work pierre shook his head its not so much attack as nullify it just isnt there eneko lopez stared at the statue of uriel it cant be the creature of chernobog we sent that scuttling and the archangels were potent enough against him anyway why the keeper of the creatures of the earth maria watched sidelong to see how benito took alessia waiting to be amused at his awkwardness to her surprise there was none he didnt as kat had hold alessia as if she was made of fragile porcelain he didnt as umberto did seem to have a problem knowing what to hold he took and held her as if it was the most natural of things he supported her head without being told and he looked oddly pleased not something most men looked when handed a baby maria went into the kitchen drew a jug of wine and sighed at times like this benito she shook her head firmly snatched up three wine cups and returned to the outer room benito was rocking alessia with a peculiar smile on his face after maria put down the wine and cups benito handed alessia back to her mother you know thats the first time ive ever held a baby theyre heavier than they look he sat down and took the cup of wine that umberto poured out thank you maria smiled wryly and noisier too you know benito there is something you could do for me ive been trying to think how to get a message to him since i saw him this morning do you know erik hakkonsen prince manfred of brittanys companion sort of a bodyguard benito grinned wryly you might say so hes beaten me drilled me till i fell over and made my life a misery for the last ten days or so oh she said sounding disappointed but with a twinkle in her eye well then youre probably not the right person to tell him that a vinlander girl called svanhild who was on the ship with us has waited on corfu to see him her and her two brothers a whole crew of them in fact benito jumped to his feet almost spilling the wine grinning ill go and find him right away hes been like a bear with a sore tooth because of this womanif it is the right woman svanhild you say shes called ill go and ask where is she maria lost the twinkle and sobered thats the bad part shes outside the walls somewhere on the island i forget the name of the count whose villa they were staying in oh waityes dentico i think it is he stared at her in shock out there but why arent they inside i mean i thought all the people would have been called into umberto shook his head nobody was called in see some of the townspeople and venetians who got wind of it just happened to be here the call has to go out from the captaingeneral the commander readied the citadel but when he asked tomaselli if the cavalry should go out and escort the people in the captaingeneral refused permission benito swallowed so theyre out therewith the enemy burning raping and looting and you want me to tell erik she nodded benito took a deep breath well i thought he was bad before but i have a feeling that this is going to be worse she definitely wanted to see erik the corners of her mouth went further down they waited here on corfu getting off the atlantic convoy just so that she could see him she was on the breakwaterhead waiting when the outremer fleet came in because she thought hed be on it she was in tears because he wasnt on it added umberto oh like that is it said benito i got the impression that shed given him the push maria sighed it was a bit of a bit of a misunderstanding tell him to come and see me and ill explain benito swallowed the last of his wine in that case id better see if i can find him todays been my day for not finding people easily thank you for the wine umberto smiled it is our pleasure come again benito gave a wary look at maria i will if i may maria snorted if you stay out of trouble which probably means no in your case benito grinned ill do my best but i think youve just landed me in it with erik anyway ciao goodbye alessia he waved to the baby benito walked out and set off in search of erik full of mixed feelings yes it hurt seeing maria listening to her acerbic tongue but still he found himself curiously at peace he had always regarded babies as good things for other people something to be personally avoided at all costs but his heart had gone out to marias child he must think of ways to help her to help maria and umberto for that matter the search for erik was like the rest of his daya roundabout erik was not in his quarters he was not with the knights who were assembling under von gherenss tongue lash von gherens told benito to try manfred and francescas rooms it was where had benito thought about it he should have gone in the first place he knocked with some trepidation on the door manfred benito had noticed was cavalier about the privacy of others but protective of his own the door opened manfred grinned down at him ah benito so have you run to earth all the taverns in this place and maybe some exotic dancers benito shook his head i cant run anything to earth in this place besides im trying to stay out of trouble manfred laughed and opened the door wider thatll be a shock to the world a first time i should think come in and have a drink francesca wont she enjoyed the captaingenerals liquor so much that she wont touch ordinary armorpolish like mine and erik is so crossed in love that im keeping him off the drink um is erik here manfred nodded he is indeed in his personal cloud of gloom worrying about the atlantic convoy and not this siege why are you in need of some drill benito hesitated then realized that not telling erikimmediatelywould put him in worse trouble than anything i need to talk to him he said firmly talk to me then said erik from the corner i thought a private word erik sighed i havent any advice to give you benito erik plainly wasnt going to make this easy well i wasnt really looking for advice i just heard about a girl called svanhild erik crossed the room in a single lunge picking benito up by the shirt front with one hand i have enough of this from manfred you leave her name out of it you leave her out of it do you hear me he put benito down with a thump against the wall glaring at him shes looking for you said benito in a kind of undignified squeak he had the satisfaction of seeing erik totally rocked on his heels what where demanded the icelander the look of hope in eriks eyes took away the satisfaction benito took a careful step away erik its bad news shes here on corfu but shes outside the walls erik sat down his bluegray eyes bored into benito but it was manfred who spoke where do you get this from benito this no subject for your practical jokes his voice bantering earlier was now deadly serious benito held up his hands no joke i swear i got it straight from maria and umberto who specifically told me to tell you its true someone called svanhild from vinland who was on the atlantic convoy stopped here so that she could wait and see erik specifically maria said she had two brothers with her and a number of other vinlanders only they stayed in a villa outside town nobody warned them about the siege eriks eyes were still boring into him it was at times like this that benito understood exactly why the holy roman emperors relied on clann harald for their closest bodyguards erik hakkonsen practically shrieked deadly maria you know benito halfbabbled er katerinas bridesmaidat the weddingwas on the ship with her svanhild that is she asked memaria that isto tell erik i swear it and her husband umberto confirmed it erik got up took a deep breath and gave himself a little shake benito i owe you an apology benito shrugged and grinned and paid back the scores of an entire week of training its nothing no one expects logic of a man in love then he lost his smile im sorry that i had to tell you shes out there you can see fires up and down the length of the island erik swallowed has she got her bodyguard her brothers and their hearthmen still with her benito shrugged again i dont know ive told you literally all ive heard maria said you should come and talk to her about it the rangy icelander put a hand on benitos shoulder will you take me to her please now benito nodded hed expected as much probably maria had too if svanhild had been as irrational about this as erik was but if the girl had a pile of brothers and whatnot with her that were like erikwell maybe she and they were all right in fact maybe he was going to feel a little sorry for the invaders manfred turned to francesca i think wed better tag along as well francesca stood up yes id like to see maria anyway i never really got to know her she raised an eyebrow at benito this is your maria isnt it the one you got into trouble over benito reddened ive got over that now umberto verrier is a very decent man gives her what i didnt francesca smiled if you can come to terms with that youve grown up more than most men ever do come manfred erik wants to go manfred took her arm do we need horses benito shook his head horses were one of the aspects of being promoted to the case vecchie that he really could do without living in venice hed not been on the back of one until he was fifteen and then he hadnt stayed there for very long its close five minutes walk francesca looked down at her little pearlfringed venetian leather shoes and grimaced oh well i have ruined the purse that matched them already lets go erik was already halfway down the hall forgetting that it was benito who would have to show them where to go and as they walked he was constantly having to check his long strides for the rest of them to catch up benito didnt like this at all it was fairly likely the icelanders sweetheart had fallen prey to king emeric of hungarys forces erik was like a loose cannon with a lit wick on a crowded deck whenifhe found out shed been hurt or was dead someone was going to pay in blood probably captaingeneral nico tomaselli chapter maria decided that skirting svanhilds reason for considering her true love ineligible was probably wise erik didnt seem to care anyway all he wanted to do was to get out there and find out if she was all right so you say her brothers and their party stayed with her maria nodded two of them went on saying they were going to return to vinland but the other fifteen or so stayed with her her two brothers included erik shook his head angrily i dont understand why she didnt stay here the podesta has lots of space up at the castel a mar he told me that it is quite usual for important or highranking travelers to be their guests maria made a face um she had a clash with the captaingeneral and instead of sending them to see the podesta he gave them directions to count denticos villa they had been trying to find place for a party of sixteen in the town but kerkiras tavernas um werent good enough apparently the thordarsons are very wealthy a powerful family in western trade said erik svanhild would expect everything of the best in a taverna she would have to share a bed with other women strangers maria blinked well of course she almost said aloud after all what else you put up in a taverna you were going to have to share the accommodations with other travelers that went without saying didnt it erik seemed to read her thoughts but a bit to her surprise he didnt react angrily or defensively he simply shook his head smiling a little youre not telling me all of what she said im sure because you think id be offended at the thought she found me unsuitable until she learned about manfred but i understand her maria and you dont well enough anyway vinlands not really that different from iceland i lived there myself you know for three years maria had forgotten that about him if shed ever known but it explained eriks skill with that peculiar vinlander weapon called a tomahawk and with the skraeling style of wrestling shes from a very wealthy family erik explained softly but has no experience with towns and cities sent by her family im sure to find a proper husband a girl whos known few strange men of any kindand those men whose customs she understands vinlanders or skraelings who at least in some ways arent all that different manfred was staring at erik oddly you understood all this about her then why he winced erik shook his head clann harald is true to its oath to the imperial family always i could explain nothing to her even though it was obvious to me that he waved his hand curtly ah never mind the point here maria is that shes probably never shared a room much less a bed with any female she didnt know shes never been away from home before and im sure in all of the places shes stayed so far they fell over themselves to give her a room to herself here so crowded not all the money even the thordarsons have could buy a private room in a taverna he sighed and her brothers naturallyyou have no idea how protective such can be in matters like thiswould not have dreamed of asking her to do something so outlandish well they did seem to have plenty of money i suppose you look at things differently when you have that kind of money maria said erik nodded glumly shes as far above me as the earth is above the moon oh nonsense muttered manfred oh nonsense maria snapped the words like a whip she was blubbering about you on the ship the moment she found out your status was suitablehowever those odd vinlanders calculate such thingsshe stopped blubbering and tried to buy the damn ship to turn it around i couldnt believe it then when that didnt work she got off here in order to wait for you she was down on the dock every day watching for the galleys to come in and her brothers didnt seem in the least unhappy about her interest either if that helps any maria ended a bit lamely her voice now less sure of itself it had just dawned on her that under the present circumstances the girl might as well have been on the moon if not further away the same realization seemed to have come to erik as well he was subdued now punctilious in thanks and farewells but not really there maria watched them go feeling obscurely sorry for him the last time she had seen anyone that mad for someone it had been kat for marco or maybe benito she pushed that thought away firmly poor erik she felt savage for a moment and this was all captain tomasellis fault well ifor whenerik discovered svanhild had been hurt or worse umberto would be getting a promotion again probably could someone be promoted from the arsenal into the captaingenerals job eh it probably wouldnt matter if the captaingeneral was dead at the hands of erik hakkonsen and the siege was still on the captaingeneral would be whomever the governor said it was and the governor and his wife both liked umberto maria closed her eyes and recalled to herself those huge brothers and equally huge followers maria had never seen erik hakkonsen fight herself but both kat and benito had described to her the icelanders ferocious ability in combat if these northlanders were all like that maybe umberto wouldnt be getting that promotion after all she hoped so in fact she prayed so they trudged back up the hill now it was no effort to keep pace with the icelander which was a pity an idea was brewing in benitos head but he wanted to talk to manfred about it first when they got up to the castel a mar erik finally obliged him manfred suggested a spot of rapier practice erik shook his head i think i want to spend some time alone manfred ive much to think about ill give you a bout manfred said benito as manfred stared openmouthed at erik erik nodded you go and give the boy a lesson or two ill be in my room if you need me he turned then to benito i am in your debt i have used you very hard over the last while forgive me s nothing i understand said benito awkwardly hed rather have erik chewing him out than being like this erik nodded and went into his room well lets get the quilted jackets and the buttoned rapiers said manfred far too heartily theyre with my gear when they got to manfreds chambers francesca said firmly your swordplay will have to wait benito i need to talk to manfred benito grinned so do i and the truth to tell all i feel like doing is falling asleep once im done talking i didnt sleep at all last night the last thing on my mind is rapier practice manfred grimaced except it is never the last thing on eriks mind im worried about him up till a couple of weeks ago id have thought hed rather fence than make love to a woman cut line benito talk quickly i need to discuss this with francesca benito cleared his throat well i thought a siege especially with that captaingeneral in charge im not going to see a lot of action he looked pensively at manfred the prince had folded his arms across his massive chest and was now looking at benito in the totally expressionless oxdumb manner that benito recognized by now as a sign of manfred in deep thought so i thought well i cant do a lot of good here maybe i should go to where i canout there im pretty sure i could swim with the current using a float of some kind and come out clear of the troops tonight i could probably even have them lower a small boat over the walls on the seaward side then i could do what von gherens was hinting at raise the peasantry against the hungarians and i could also find out what has happened to eriks girl its not likely to be anything good but hes going to be torn up until he knows manfreds eyes narrowed slightly ill think about it the captaingeneral wont approve benito shrugged i dont think i really give a damn but i do need your help to signal back what i find out about the girl ill think about it said manfred ill come and talk to you later now go and get that sleep you need i need to talk to francesca francesca pointed to a seat actually i think benito had better stay and no manfred you are not going out there with benito manfred shook his head how the hell did you guess to benito plaintively the womans a witch i swear it francesca smiled knowingly your face doesnt give anything away but i know just how your mind works the minute you said youd go and talk to benito later i knew just what you were planning and quite simply no you cant do it you with your rank and the knights at your command are the only person who can effectively influence the defense of this citadel the captaingeneral will lose it to the enemy hes done well enough so far but hell swiftly be out of his depth you are the only one here who outranks him and you of everyone are the only one here who can command the knights to lock him in a room if necessary and take over command given how his own men have reacted to his commands i do not think you will find a great deal of opposition if you are forced to that action she glanced at benito and there is one thing that needs doing a lot more than raising the islands countrysideits rather little countrysideagainst the hungarians that is getting news to venice in time the news garbled and distorted will trickle overland but unless the two ships that did not take part in this landing manage to get to rome or veniceand i doubt they will now that ive seen the effort emerics put into thishelp will be many months in coming it could take a month or two if the blockade is effective before the venetians even realize there is a blockade well get you a small boat a few seamen and you should go across to illyria forget it manfred shook his head francesca im barely a mouse to your elephant as far as your knowledge of politics is concerned but i do have some military acumen you know he grinned even if erik wont admit it look assuming benito got across all right his chances of crossing the balkans alive are nonexistent darling why do you think a nonmaritime power like hungary is transporting its troops and weapons by sea the answer is pretty obvious even to the nonmilitary mind emeric is coming by sea because even with an army of tens of thousands he probably couldnt get through the balkans theres a fiercely independent illyrian chief over there named iskander beg who is welding the tribes into a nation and one thing that all those tribes do is kill people who try to pass through their territory do you imagine id have paid dorma a fortune for the hire of these four vessels to transport horses if i could have sent them overland we could have sailed in one vessel and met them at constantinople however crossing over the adriatic and going via rugosa down the old roman road to constantinople is out of the question these days francesca raised a perfect eyebrow what was it that eberhard said to you the other day if all politicians had to be soldiers first they wouldnt ask soldiers to do the impossible manfred shrugged he does make good points occasionally francesca laughed deliciously the poor old man every time hes getting to approve of you you do the next rash thing according to him but as it happens i dont agree with him miracle of miracles manfred grinned why not for once he is simply making sense because it would make for monolithic thinking all solutions would be militarily influenced and military men dont always understand how civilians work either anyway forget benito for a moment you too benito lets get back to what should be done for erik manfred flopped into a chair making it groan in protest i was all for erik getting over her quite honestly benito you and that exgirlfriend of yours have stirred up something i had hoped would blow over francesca had come to stand behind manfred she rubbed his shoulders benito couldnt help but notice how small her hands seemed on them i dont think it is going to happen quite as youd like manfred dear she said slowly hes a very intense man a serious one he is torn between his duty to you and his shall we call it infatuation with this woman hes stuck here fortunately as far as im concerned cant we get him another girl to chase i am not convinced shes good enough for him i set high standards for erik francesca shook her head and smiled manfred you know as well as i do that that might work for you but it wont work for erik in your company he has been trailed past more attractive ladies than most men would see in three lifetimes manfred grunted and half them wanted that cleancut face of his and he didnt notice them at all no i suppose youre right as usual but the point is that hes still stuck here shes probably dead by now anyway francesca patted him too little sleep thats what it is manfred erik is an icelander he probably has spent more time in small boats than he has on horseback that means hes as capable of getting out of here as benito he is staying here out of loyalty to you and tearing himself apart in the process worst of all for him is the uncertainty erik is one of the most effective warriors alive hes used to taking initiative right now loyalty means he cant manfred flicked himself onto his feet from reclining to standing in an instant benito realized again just how strong the prince was not simply strong as an ox might be but phenomenally athletic as well well no point in that im as safe here as a man can be with three thick walls and a moat around him well sea channel and a small oceanbetter yet erik should get out there set his mind at rest and either bring this charmer home or bury her francesca sighed for an example of why only exsoldiers should take part in politics youve just failed manfred you regard this place as militarily secure manfred nodded cheerfully it would do better with twice or three times the garrison with six thousand men youd be able to hold this place against virtually any force as long as the food and water held out but it is not too bad actually according to captaingeneral tomaselli with his forces our men the ship crews and the militia we have maybe two thousand men the food stocks should last that number a couple of years with rationing and yet said francesca there are at least eleven thousand souls here in this citadel aside from children that is does something not strike you as odd manfred made a face uh these guys have four wives each no wonder they look so dozy how did you get this figure francesca francesca laughed dozy indeed i asked the podestas secretary meletios loukaris hes a very efficient little greek the local eminences fled to the citadel when the warning came on the night before the attack most of them are corfiotes the local gentry people of the libri doro who live in town and have estates in the country the citadel refused to allow in arbitrary locals but in addition to these some people had chits signed by the podesta there are nearly six thousand of them the captaingeneral is not well pleased with this benito blinked you mean he wanted to leave them outside but this is supposed to be a venetian protectorate true said francesca in an absolutely level voice that conveyed as much by its evenness as her normally expressive tones did unfortunately the senate did not vote the captaingeneral a budget to allow siege provisions for the people of kerkira or so my little greek informant told me manfred bit his knuckle are you telling me this ass is planning not to feed them they outnumber his troops oh nine to one and hes not going to feed them fortunately the podesta prevailed on him that this would be foolish theyll be issued a ration smaller than the venetians of course there is no love lost between the locally stationed venetians and the greeks manfred shook his head how do you find all this out so quickly francesca here we are sitting on a powder keg waving slowmatches and i thought it was quite safe she smiled demurely it is because i am just a woman and not a soldier youre not ever going to let me forget that are you grumbled manfred insofar as a man could grumble while grinning she chucked him under the chin no but i am also not going to let you forget that many more fortresses fall by treachery than by strength of arms and this fortress with its divided populace is probably in more danger than most manfreds eyes narrowed it sounds like the captaingeneral is going to have to go that could be difficult its difficult from more than one direction the corfiotes themselves reciprocate the feelings the venetians have about them they wont cooperate unless their lives are in direct danger francesca smiled gleefully to think i thought i would be bored during this siege manfred between eberhard and myself we will manage the captaingeneral and keep an eye on the locals the actual commander of the garrison is quite young but a better soldier apparently relax erik wouldnt be any good at this sort of thing anyway he might as well go and look for his svanhild she looked consideringly at benito you however would probably be very useful here because she broke off cocking her head a little what is happening out there they went out following the people who were streaming to see what the commotion was about the strait was full of sails emerics cannon and the rest of his army had arrived chapter capitano da castres pointed out something else glumly quietly a hulk under tow my dapper friend bortaliscono wont be going to comfort my wife after all benito realized the implication of the burned and battered remains of the great galley those messages would not be getting back to venice by sea of course there was still a chance that the other vessel might have escaped and headed for rome but benito had his doubts of capitano selvi who if he had managed to evade the blockade was probably halfway to the arabic emirates or the khanates by now he turned to manfred if erik is going to go this means he has to go tonight manfred nodded true by nightfall emerics men will already be getting those cannon into action by tomorrow night they will keep up the bombardment sneaking out thereafter will be nigh impossible ill go and talk to him also i think id better go with him manfred shook his head francesca wants you here benito took a deep breath and began his plea he knew he would have a very limited time to convince manfred of what he needed to do before it was too late to do it i believe i can get a message back to venice manfred francesca is capable of all of her schemes without a little guy like me id rather stay and fight id rather go out with erik and organize guerillas but i believe my duty to venice to petro dorma is to get back to venice magicians can send word to the fleets warning them venice itself can prepare to relieve corfu i believe ive got an idea of how it could be done without going through the balkans francesca nodded and smiled if you could do that it would be worth more to us than your skills in fraternizing with lowlifes would be ha how come i cant do the fraternizing with lowlifes while erik is away protested manfred assuming an expression of hurt ive got years of experience francesca smiled because as a leadership figure we need the people all the people to look up to you spoilsport muttered manfred mind you benito mentioned an option i hadnt even thought of eneko lopez manfred grinned maybe we can keep your lowlife fraternizer here after all if the clerics can send magical word the taverns of the citadel will not have to lose such a valued customer eneko lopez shook his head tiredly no magically we are hamstrung we have tried repeatedly together and separately to invoke the guardian archangels of the cardinal points one simply does not respond the angels did once for a minor magic since then we have failed eneko sighed and rubbed his eyes i do not know what magical knowledge you have but this is fundamental we must operate behind our protections as well for a knight to go into battle having forgotten to armor himself still we ventured on a harmless minor spell to see what would happen a blessing on the flowers around the church magic has a feel to it manfred this was like wading through thighdeep mud there is something here about this place not so much opposition to us as a simple resistance in the end the magic we worked was words merely words nearly without substance chernobog asked manfred thinking of the terrible powers they had defeated in venice or something like that eneko shook his head a puzzled frown on his face no i have encountered various nonhuman powers chernobog this is as unlike that as is possible the black brain is a violent and malevolent force it is unlike the lion of etruria too that has a personality a shape this seems amorphous unfocusedalmost as if it had lost its focus somehow but one thing is certain it too is our enemy if only because it does not love us at all he sighed it must however have human agents well try to find those but i wish i could contact rome there are magicworkers in the service of the grand metropolitan who are as far beyond my brothers and me as we are beyond a charmseller benito had never been entirely at ease with the intense cleric which considering how they had met was not surprising im thinking of trying to get a smuggler or a fishing boat to drop me across on the italian shore father eneko ill make my way overland to venice do you want me to try and deliver any messages enekos dour expression lifted i will prepare letters perhaps i dont think i want anything in writing benito interrupted im going to have to go as a fisherman or a common sailor i dont want to get searched and have embarrassing things turn up dorma will believe me without such evidence eneko nodded yes i quite see that he exhaled through his teeth unfortunately the grand metropolitan might respond to something written in my fist whereas a traveling youngster like yourself is just not going to get an interview with the grand metropolitan he smiled wryly it is difficult enough for high potentates to do so i think the best possible thing would be for you to proceed straight to venice there you could speak to siblings mascoli of st raphaella or evangelina of st hypatia di hagia sophia your brother can establish your credentials with the former and katerina with the latter eneko raised the bar of eyebrow again i dont think theyd recognize you from your regular visits for counseling manfreds shoulders shook if you want messages to the tapman at barduccis thats a priest and a chapel more likely to recognize him eneko cracked a wan smile at this this is probably the case of the pot calling the kettle black prince manfred shrugged meaning no offense but the way i see it the average barman has the experience of life to make him a better counselor than the average oblate who has grown into a cloistered monk anyway what do you want benito to tell these priests i want him to get some rest before this next stunt of his eneko nodded as benito yawned copiously he should be at his sharpest for such a venture and he doesnt look it a couple of hours and ill be fine benito yawned again ive just got to track down that corfiote seaman that guided me onto a rock coming in ill see to that said manfred firmly you are heading for bed alone too get along with you when manfred spoke like that one went so benito went even the thought of the coming venture couldnt keep him awake far above in the blue two hawks circled bjarni knocked karis arm up hastily the shot ricocheted off the limestone rocks and svanhild winced thank goodness bjarni had more sense than the rest of them or theyd soon be fighting both the locals and the invaders and the locals knew this area like the rabbits in the rocks did what the hell do you think you are doing you idiot but chief he threw a rock at us protested the young vinlander of course he threw a rock at us you mindless fool and now well be lucky if the locals dont shoot at us you shoot at the hungarians they already shoot back the kids throwing rocks we wave at and shout friend friend and when they throw more rocks growled gulta wiping the blood off his face the little devil hit me duck faster next time bjarni said flatly if a kid with a rock can hit you you arent paying near enough attention to whats going on you cant hit anything with wheellock pistols anyway more than a few paces off and theres no way to use an arquebus on horseback but bjarnis orders were unnecessary word must have run up the valleys ahead of them nobody threw rocks and there was nobody they could shout friend friend at either locals seeing them ran maybe we should ride one of them down suggested kari we could explain afterwards bjarni snorted you should be thinking of this as if it were the plains around cahokia and you were a foreigner chasing your mothers people this is their place their rocks and paths ten to one theyd get away from you here and if they did that then the fat would really be in the fire no well find a spot to fort up and sit tight until things settle down theyll come to us in time they rode on toward evening they came to a gorge kari pointed you wont let me shoot rockthrowers can i shoot us some dinner instead bjarni looked up sure i never was that fond of goats anyway kari missed again twice in the end laughing svanhild used her bow to kill the goat meanwhile scouting ahead gulta had found them a cave they use part of it for penning goats theres another section where we can sleep it isnt luxury accommodation but it is better than the houses in the burnedout villages weve passed at least the caves still got a roof theres a lot of cloud about too it looks like it could come on to rain is it defensible svanhild asked other considerations no longer applied bjarni shrugged is anything manfred knocked on eriks door there was no reply he knocked again waited and then was about to turn his heel and leave when erik said come in erik was seated in a chair by the window staring out he turned to see just who had come to disturb him with a look that said it would be the worse for them oh manfred i thought it would be some servant or orderly or something ive had a chambermaid and a page come looking for you all in the last hour ive come to talk to you about this svanhild erik sighed yes im sorry manfred ive let myself be distracted from my task its just i wish well i cant ill try to put it aside my oath comes first manfred grinned hiding emotions far from humor besides as a confrere knight of the holy trinity you are supposed to be celibate and not think such things listen i have talked it over with francesca and young benito manfred chose his words now with extreme care you are sworn by clanoath to be my personal hearthman to guard me and also prepare me for the possibility that i might become heir to the throne of charles fredrik to keep me alive to take appropriate longterm steps to make sure this happens erik nodded dully it was a matter of note on his mental state that he did not snap that he knew all of this yes that is my duty if my bodyguardyou that isarrived with a severe chill or was injuredid send him to bed until he was well enough to be effective id use another bodyguard if he insisted manfred waited for a response i would insist if i was sick erik did not even look indignant who would you nominate erik shrugged von gherens i suppose or falkenberg had he not been injured manfred nodded i will have both of them falkenberg if he recovers because you are sick im sending you off to get cured benito a corfiote seaman and you are taking a small boat out tonight you will go and see if this sweetheart of yours is alive come back when youre well erik gaped at him and then closed his mouth and shook his head i cant do that manfred had come prepared for that your responsibilities go beyond those of some simple daytoday bodyguard erik youre responsible for my longterm safety how would you best ensure that putting you in a padded cell and feeding you through the keyhole said erik still staring at him be serious will you besides uncle charles fredrik said im supposed to go to jerusalem how would i do that in a cell the answer is breaking this siege and the answer to that is getting word back to venice and thats exactly what i want benito to do but without you hell probably fail was erik following all this it was impossible to tell from that poleaxed look on his face look his plan relies on sneaking out of here in a small boat lowered from the seaward walls but the rest of emerics troops and cannon have arrived you can bet emeric has shore patrols aplenty out now especially after last night the boys a fighter but hes not in your league and he doesnt have your experience of small craft hes venetian but a citydwelling landsman really now finally he was getting a reaction out of erik the icelander nodded slightly manfred went in for the kill but the crunch is that hes got to move overland by night to a fishing port well away from here the boy can move around a city like a ghost but i dont think hes ever been outside a city hell get killed for sure if you dont go along with him once youve got him safeyou can give your time to hunting for svanhild manfred paused but erik my friend you do know what usually happens to beautiful young women when an army invades erik nodded yes she may be dead or she may be raped and enslaved but i have to know he sighed im sorry i cant accept your logic what you say about benito and a message to venice makes excellent sense even if you are using it as an excuse but i cant desert my post oh for heavens sake manfred sat down on the bed it complained beds generally complained when manfred sat on them i didnt want to do this ive lugged this around since venice manfred hauled a letter out of his pouch it was plainly much traveled he unfolded it here come and have a look at this uncle charles fredrik sent it to me when things started to unravel in venice erik came over the letter dangled half of the seal of the holy roman empire the sprawling spidery handwriting was unmistakably that of the holy roman emperor himself read from the top of this paragraph commanded manfred erik did manfred the most valuable coin the house of hohenstauffen has is loyalty the house has no coin of a larger denomination than the loyalty of clann harald the reason is simple they owe their loyalty not to the empire or the emperor they owe it to us the hohenstauffen the clann have repaid their debt to the hohenstauffen many hundreds of times over yet they still answer the call why nephew first it is because theyre raised and bred to it theyre a very honorable house even by the standards of a very honorable society but that is the lesser of the reasons the reason is that they are our friendsbecause we are as loyal to them as they are to us always remember that an imperial house has very few true friends they are more valuable to us than to ordinary folk for that reason in every generation the time has always come when we the hohenstauffen must put that friendship that loyalty to our friends above all other obligations do not fail me in this manfred when the time comes you will place eriks interests above your own i order this do not fail me or our house im not going to fail him said manfred grimly you will be on that boat this evening this is not a matter of duty erik it is a matter of friendship i wont see you dying by inches in front of my eyes with your heart somewhere over those walls erik stood up came to stand before manfred and put his hands on manfreds shoulders thank you he said gruffly i was not happy when the summons came for me to come to mainz to serve willing because it is our sworn duty but not happy our regard for the empire isnt high in iceland or vinland either for that matter my father said something to me then that i didnt understand at the time he said you will find it is not service manfred felt those powerful longfingered hands squeeze his shoulders i understand now you have been a friend for some time now i just hadnt understood if i have sons i will send them to learn this too the clann harald are loyal to their oath they are also loyal to friends linn gu linn the emotion in that voice told manfred that his uncle had been perfectly right manfred also knew that buying loyalty wasnt his reason for doing this manfred stood up and put an arm around erik he felt emotion thickening his throat and voice and didnt try to stop it wouldnt have mattered a bugger what uncle charles fredrik said anyway you need to go youre going ive made up my mind erik took a deep breath very well under certain conditions which you will swear to me first von gherens will become your constant bodyguard second you will not leave this fortress unless i return or the siege is lifted you will not make it a repetition of the affair of the red cat you will not come after me promise me this manfred was intensely grateful that erik had not been there when francesca had explained just how insecure the citadel really was if there is a sally i must lead the knights erik you know that yourself and this is a siegegod knows what will happen if emeric breaks through but within those limits ill swear my oath on it if there is a sally but dont stretch it erik took a deep breath manfred i didnt think you understood what it meant to be in love with someone thank you thank you from the bottom of my heart that didnt make manfred feel much better about svanhild but all he said was well lets go and organize a small boat and see if we can find that corfiote sailor who doesnt know the draft of a great galley chapter sitting under a tasseled awning in front of his tented pavilion king emeric regarded the citadel in the growing dusk oxen had proved more of a problem than hed anticipated the islanders seemed to rely heavily on donkeys unfortunately the heavy fortyeightpound bombards really needed teams of oxen to move them and the cannon of the citadel and the island of vidos commanded the deepwater landings for some distance the carracks had too deep a draft to bring them in the way that those bedamned galleys had run up the beach the bigger guns were too heavy and too unwieldy to unload onto lighters and bring in they needed a dock a quay next to which the ships could tie up unfortunately the nearest spot theyd been able to find was the village of patara nearly a league away emeric had had his cavalry scouring the countryside for oxen or even mules to move the guns and now to make matters worse it looked like rain he was scowling ferociously when the senior byzantine captain of the seven carracks that had just come in from constantinople arrived the greek saluted smartly well captain sire the venetian outremer convoy had arrived in negroponte before we left they should be on their way to the golden horn by now except for the vessels heading for the holy land while that is good news i wanted to know if youd brought the supplies alexius agreed to provide and why you are late the captain bowed contrary winds sire and this morning we met engaged and captured a venetian great galley i have her captain and most of her crew prisoner the captain cleared his throat they were carrying certain dispatches addressed to the doge the grand metropolitan and the holy roman emperor the captain one bernardo selvi pleaded for his life saying he could give you valuable information he has agreed to cooperate fully with us i have promised him his life in return sire he told me he was part of a charter for prince manfred of brittany and some two hundred knights of the holy trinity going to jerusalem they were on board their four vessels when they were attacked by a combined fleet of dalmatian pirates and carracks bearing your banner he said the others plan a night landing perhaps at the very citadel itself your news comes a little too late captain emeric said grimly nonetheless i will see the prisoner and the letters he was transporting have them sent up to me the byzantine saluted crisply again at once sire and where and when shall i have my men land the food supplies emeric smiled his thinlipped crooked and utterly humorless smile vessels are discharging about a league away at a village called patara see the goods get handed over to my quartermaster there see you dont get in the way of my cannon being offloaded and see i get the prisoner and his letters very very fast sire the byzantine saluted and left at a halfrun emeric for the first time since the galleys had arrived that morning felt something akin to pleasure he enjoyed seeing byzantines run and the fact that the holy roman empires best troops were here purely by accident caught up in this because they were on their way to jerusalem was excellent news he must tell his spymasters to stop searching for the leak in his security four menatarms from the byzantine vessels and a prisoner shackled neckandlegs arrived shortly thereafter the prisoner was an elderly slightly stooped man with a wattled chin he fell on his knees before emeric spare me your majesty spare me i beg you he wept emeric stood up put his hands on either side of the mans head and forced him to look him in the eyes he hardly needed to do anything the venetian was already crying with fear still there was more to exerting his power than simply the need to cow but of course my dear chap provided you tell me what i need to know he blinked and released a spell a bolt of searing pain shook the captive his back arched and he fell over backwards the venetian captain lay there on the ground gibbering whimpering and crying emeric ignored him and held out his hand to the escorts the letters hastily one of the men fumbled open a leather message pouch and handed the king the three letters two were sealed with the imperial seal of the holy roman empire and addressed to emperor charles fredrik and doge petro dorma respectively the other was addressed to the grand metropolitan in rome emeric walked to his desk a particularly fine ivoryinlaid escritoire pulled a stiletto out of a drawer and carefully cut the seal away he walked closer to a multiwicked lamp and read the letter his smile growing more feral all the while a prince of the empire no lessnow within hungarys fist the king turned back to the venetian captain still kneeling on the floor you will explain the purpose of this voyage you will also tell me about this prince or i will give you more pain if you do well i will reward you with my mercy when selvi had done emeric called to his guards take him out there and crucify him next to that fool who brought me news of the lost troop you promised me mercy screamed the captain emeric shrugged i lied sophia tomaselli looked nervously about despite the hooded cloak and the lateness of the hour she really didnt want to be found here the address given to her in the strictest confidence by bianca casarini was not a part of the citadel shed ever visited before the poorer houses down inside the outer curtain wall were not in a place she would have admitted knowing even existed but shed try anything now especially with her husband nicos status likely to rise because of the siege anything shed already tried at least twenty potions all that they had done was to make her sick shed tried everything from saints bones to amulets that made her clothing smell faintly of dead rat shed even on biancas advice tried a different man she snorted at the thought the young cavalry commander querini thought he was the worlds greatest lover his breath smelled of onions then thered been the long nervous wait to find her courses ran as normally as ever and now she had to put up with a stream of lewd suggestions from the fool querini she knocked on the dingy door glancing hastily around to see if there was anyone in sight the street was deserted as far as she could see anyway she knocked again slightly harder the door swung open at first glance the man standing there was not very impressive shed expected robes not ordinary clothes he was tall and stooped and framed against the light his hair was sleeked and perfectly ordered the most occult thing about him was a rather neat beard s signor morando he nodded cocked his head inquiringly and said in a voice which was just faintly sibilant you have the advantage of me who are you and why have you come here s signorina casarini said you might be able to help bianca casarinis name acted like a magical talisman the man beamed come in signora he ushered her forward respectfully closed the door behind her and how may i help you signora potions to draw a lover to inflame passions perhaps to deal with some unfortunate consequences he rubbed his long hands i want something to assist fertility not quack potions he looked at her thoughtfully but didnt say anything please she said im desperate i can pay well there are certain rituals you understand they are frowned on by the church she laughed bitterly the church hasnt exactly helped me so far and theyre a lot richer for not helping he nodded slowly very well wait here there are certain preparations i must make by the time he returned he looked far more like her idea of a practitioner of the black arts right down to the robe his eyebrows flared satanically and his beard and mustachios were now waxed to sharp points come he said the sacrificial chamber is prepared you must now be prepared i must blindfold you part of sophia filled with fear at the idea of sacrifice but there was a guilty fascination too stepping out into the cold street sophia wasnt too sure what time it was her head was still mazed from the liquid in that chaliceor perhaps from the smoke in that room she would have to wash her hair to get rid of the smell of it next time and she felt the compulsion to admit there would be a next timeshe must make sure she was dressed in something easier to remove she would have to undress herself until the symbols hed painted on her washed off she could feel them they seemed to have a heat of their own she stumbled it was very dark and a fine rain had begun to fall she put out a hand to keep in contact with the wall she heard the sound of footsteps a number of people she shrank back against the buildings until they passed at least six men one even in the darkness loomed huge they were carrying something between them and they didnt notice her after they were well gone sophia continued hastily on her way home whatever those men were up to it was bound to be no good but there was no way she could report it without implicating herself thank heavens for biancas wild ways she had told sophia which guards were susceptible to bribes sitting back in a comfortable chair the black robes thankfully tossed off and a glass of ouzo in hand aldo morando grinned sharkishly hed hooked a big one tonight a very big one did the wife of the captaingeneral think honestly think he wouldnt recognize her even if his accomplice bianca casarini hadnt told him shed be coming hed have recognized sophia tomaselli morando had been many things in a long and varied career pimp spy procurer seller of saints relics seller of shares in colleganzas that were remarkably lacking in substance and latterly magician he would never have believed the number of wealthy idiots just dying to pay over good money for some wicked thrills particularly women with too much money and too much time on their hands with husbands who had long sought mistresses or were much away of course things could get a bit hot with the church and with injured husbands from time to time which was why he had been obliged to leave the italian mainland corfu he had been sure would be far enough away hed been dismayed at first seeing bianca casarini here but she was proving to be a remarkably good accomplice for him he put down his glass and gazed cheerfully at the stack of ducats on the table besides that sophia tomaselli would be a mine of information very valuable information in the right hands and he knew where to find those hands to think hed been angry about the siege well he was now sure that he wouldnt go hungry and the opportunity for pleasure as well as profitshe wanted to get pregnant after all and she wasnt badlookingwas considerable a tall graveyard poplar grew flush against the cliff that was topped by the old byzantine fortress the cliff beside it was too high and too steep to make the tree any threat to the integrity of the fortress the tree itself was in the fashion of the plant densely packed with small branches attempting to climb it would have been folly anyway the thin branches would cascade the climber down again about twentyfive cubits up the branches masked a narrow gash of an opening into the cliffs if you ascended the ladder and then walked back along it the cave widened considerably into a labyrinth of passages once many years ago these would have acted as one of the defenses of this place now you just had to follow the most worn path in the stone it had taken the passage of many feet over many long years to wear away the stone to round and smooth the steps the sacred chamber was lit by a small oil lamp right now all was silent except for the steady slow trickle and splash of the fountain that fed the holy pool between the two altars the great goddesss altar and the smaller darker one the white halfalmond lay on the black stone waiting for someone to come and take it up and all that it represented behind the larger altar halfhidden in the shadows was the image of the goddess herself it towered over the altar and it was old oldolder some said than the island itself it did not look anything like the graceful statues of the great grecian sculptors from the islands glory days it was not even anything like those earlier images stiff and rigid with fixed staring eyes and jutting breasts like twin mountain peaks no this was more like a pile of boulders roundheaded and faceless with the merest suggestion of hair and of arms and legs and enormous sagging breasts and belly the hallmark of fertility and plenty and there was if you looked at her long enough the suggestion of a faint haze of gold about her and the feeling that she was looking back at you out of her eyeless face the two women came in one sweeping the old dried leaves before her the other strewing the new leaves when the chamber was prepared the two acolytes went to lower the ladder few would come tonight for it was raining so hard that it would be difficult to come and go undetected here in the middle of the venetians there were few devotees anyway but this was the second oldest temple on the island a place where the lifeflame had been kindled many thousands of years ago the temple had always had at least a holy mother and three or four devotees the priestess had not expected a group larger than three or four but as she stepped out of the shadows she saw that tonight despite the rain there was an unfamiliar face a comfortably middleaged woman the priestess saw with a twinge of disappointment that the newcomer was beyond childbearing age unfortunately months had passed and there was still no one willing to take up the almond the rains had come the cropsif the invaders left anything of themwould be no worse than usual but this could not last forever not for the first time the priestess wondered how much of this was because of the christians and their priests for centuries she and they had lived if not in harmony at least not in conflict but just after the death of the last bride the priestess had sensed that there was something inimical to the goddess that was searching for the source of her power shortly after that the attacks began and shortly after that the four strangerpriests had arrived and the two hawks that were the eyes for the hostile power was it coincidence it hardly seemed possible and that was especially so once the priestess had learned that these four priests and their leader in particular were closely linked with the grand metropolitan of rome true they had close ties to the hypatian order which unlike the servants of the trinity were not known for the persecution of those who were pagan in fact it had been the hypatian siblings that had dwelled here quietly for so very long but this particular priest had a reputation for militancy that was not typical of the order and directly after arriving here he had attempted to work magic she had put a stop to that needless to say no one worked magic upon this island without her approval but how long could that hold great and evil powers were being bent against her to usurp her power and without a bride the cold god could not defend her the priestess drew her thoughts back to the ceremony and the new woman who had come after purification and the rituals she must speak with her but now the withered bay leaves swept up from the floor must be fed to the lifeflame the women repeated the old old words out of death there is new life it was as the priestess suspected someone from outside the walls she had known this would come to an extent she was only surprised that it had taken this long the captaingeneral was not by nature a cruel man but he was a foolish one to think that he could demand the labor and allegiance of the populace and not assume the responsibility for them and attempting to close the gates against those who deserved shelter here was nothing but an exercise in futility as the presence of this woman showed my brother is with the boatyard the sea took my yani three years ago my daughters are married my sons are at sea the woman said simply my brother is here the captaingeneral refused to allow the men to bring their families but the men brought us in anyway by the boatyard gate there are several of the timbersheds that are not in use and now that the hungarians are outside the walls there is nothing happening in the little arsenal anyway it is crowded but it is safer than outside she sighed why does the goddess allow these xenos to trample our soil mens business my daughter we do not make war and they do not make children invaders come and go but the goddess remains she did not speak aloud the question that was in her own mind for how long caesare aldanto walked past the man who had been crucified upsidedown outside king emerics tent as if he wasnt there emeric was sprawled in his gilded and gemstoneencrusted throne aldanto bowed mechanically you wished to see me emeric stared at the blond man he stood up and put his hands on aldantos throat you interfered with the admiral of my carracks and sent them north in pursuit of four vessels you interfered and used my name to direct the dalmatians in an attack on the same vessels we lost a number of the galliots according to my admiral you have only captured one of the venetian vessels why should i allow you to live emeric allowed the pain to flow from his hands into his intended victim but caesare aldanto didnt scream and writhe he didnt even blink he answered in the same calm voice that hed used earlier because i had credible information that they were coming to the relief of corfu the ships had knights of the holy trinity on board including according to our captives prince manfred of brittany i considered that you would wish them sunk rather than at large on corfu there were also a number of powerful and dangerous magicians on board we were not aware of that that is why three of the ships escaped emeric was somewhat shaken by the lack of response from the blond milanese man it took him aback and left him thinking madly down directions he had rather not have gone there could be little doubt nowaldanto was indeed a puppetman he stepped back always before hed known his power stood between him and any threat of a knifewielding assassin with this man he was potentially in his enemys grasp he had no doubt at all that grand duke jagiellon was indeed his enemy even if their purposes ran in the same direction for now or could this be a trap then logic reasserted itself jagiellons man would hardly have risked his position and emerics displeasure if jagiellon did not desperately wish the knights to be sunk at sea i was not told about the prisoners said emeric moderating his tone by a degree or two why have they not been brought to me aldanto shrugged ask your admiral but in truth only a handful of seamen were captured the captain elected to remain with his vessel and blow her magazine up when she was boarded the captives were taken from one of her small boats the charges failed to sink her but there were considerable losses among our boarders part vi may ad chapter it strikes me very much as a conspiracy said eberhard i agree with your assessment francesca but of course it is still likely to place us in very bad favor with the governorthe podesta as they call himand the captaingeneral if and when the messages get through manfred shrugged what they dont know their hearts wont grieve over besides francesca has already cleared it with the governor francesca looked innocent too innocent benito thought hes an old dear but quite ineffectual the conduct of war or siege is officially the militarys business however i did ask him if the prince might be allowed to send messages to the emperor he said it was hardly something he could refuse permission for but that it was of course impossible at the moment i smiled and thanked him well i suppose if the messenger happened to go via venice you could hardly blame him for telling the authorities about the situation here said eberhard with a perfectly straight face how are your preparations going by the way manfred grimaced a little well the early morning detail guarding the outer wall was easy enough to organize our men are tired but still wish to do their part in the defense of the citadel the boat well thats the reason i suggested to francesca we might have to go to the captaingeneral ive tried to find one to buy without making a great todo about it but this isnt venice you know most of the boats in the citadel belong to the shipyard of course there were lots of fishing boats out in the town but theyre rather far out of reach francesca tilted her head to the side and i said you and benito should perhaps go and talk to maria and her husband benito shook his head maria would give us a shipyard vessel in the blink of an eye but umbertowell hes a good fellow but hes a rules and regulations sort of man he might still know someone with a boat to sell she looked consideringly at erik and benito i think we need to think about your appearances also you cant go like that benito caught on immediately i look as if i could possibly be a local but erik wouldnt pass in the dark well need hair dye and old clothes something to stain eriks skin too said francesca looking pointedly at both hair and skin im not planning to go passing as a local said erik a little stiffly ill stick to the hills and forest patches these hungarians wont even see me i might blacken my face for the nightwork francesca smiled shell still love you even if youre darkhaired erik and never mind the hungarians its the locals who will run from a blondhaired man and you will need them if you are to find her i suspect weve got a map of how to get to count denticos villa but they might easily have moved out youll have to get directions from the locals it wont help that you cant speak greek and will frighten every local silly erik shook his head how do you cope with her always being right manfred i have a little classical greek but the language has changed get used to it said manfred with a grin its usually easier to say they are right even if theyre patently wrong he ducked hastily francesca just raised an eyebrow that is a real danger signal said manfred it means its being saved up im just trying to further his education francesca ill just save that up too she said with a thin smile now lets go down and talk to umberto and maria there will be people selling things here in the citadel and maria will know where von gherens looked speculatively at benito the other thing youll need to get him is a knife he cant carry a ferrara main gauche that would cost a fisherman five years earnings and a rapiers right out benito gritted his teeth changing out of case vecchie clothes was something he was actually looking forward to although he knew his feet would find being shoeless a painful experience going without his rapier and his beautifully balanced dagger would be a lot harder he didnt feel dressed without at least the main gauche but von gherens was right he knew that from his time as a bridgebrat one look at his main gauche and even an idiot would know he wasnt what he was supposed to be erik grinned and i suppose youd like me to leave my new hatchet behind too its not a patch on my vinland one but the swordsmith at mainz didnt seem to understand me clearly enough the scarfaced old prussian ritter sniffed i think he probably thought you wanted it for chopping firewood not having seen you use that barbaric thing the hungarians probably wont recognize it either until its too late erik nodded i can relieve them of anything else i need and i think ive got a knife for you benito in with my gear its better than any cheap local blade anyway ill dig it out for you its a shetland islanders knife its very plain could pass for a fishermans tool but its good steel and well balanced id have to get permission before selling you a boat said umberto worriedly do you know of anyone who has one to sell asked erik delicately umberto shook his head then put up a finger its not strictly a boat but one of the corfiotes who does some work for the little arsenal has his coracle stored down at the shipyard hed probably sell right now i dont see him using it for a while maria however seemed enthusiastic about the project and clothes and dye for eriks hair well there is fianelli he sells secondhand goods i wouldnt look too hard at where they came from nito but that wont be any shock to you hes got some quack medicines and stuff too i wouldnt be surprised to find some dye there ill go along if you like and green walnuts will do for skin color she looked at benito you came to wish me farewell and godspeed youre doing the kind of mad thing you like doing best ill wish you the same at least youre doing it for a good cause and not your usual damnfool reasons benito grinned and you and umberto take care too especially of my godniece maria scowled fiercely at him fianelli had what benito was looking for after he left benito muttered to himself good thing erik didnt come along with me that man practically stinks of foulness if he knew an obvious nonislander was trying to leave the citadel hed try to sell the information me he just thinks im seeking a disguise for an assignation that was in fact exactly what fianelli thought it never occurred to him to warn his master emeric that an escape was being planned from the citadel within a day hed forgotten all about the sale fianelli sold a lot of stuff unfortunately it didnt occur to benito to warn anyone about fianelli either benito had run into a lot of foul men in his short life after all and while hed learned a lot about sieges from falkenberg he really hadnt fully absorbed yet one of francescas lessons more fortresses fall by treachery than by strength of arms by midnight it had started to rain a scruffy touslehaired barefoot young man and a tall darkhaired plainclad and very darkfaced man were standing in front of francesca for inspection your hairs too clean benito remember youve got manfreds seal there manfred grinned hes the scruffiest personal letter i ever sent benito grinned in reply you had to drop the sealingwax on my ear didnt you black wax is hotter than red francesca had a close look at the tangle of black curls around benitos ear it certainly isnt easy to find wont count von stemitz be a trifle surprised give him my best regards by the way when you see him hiding coin had been a bigger problem benito had some ten ducats in smallish change too much would attract suspicion too little and he wouldnt be able to afford to live never mind travel he had a battered pin in his scarf which might possibly once have been silver and looked like plated brass from which the plating was rubbing off no one would look too hard at such a tawdry thing except the cheap stones that had been in it had been replaced with two good rubies mounted in so hard you would have to break the thing to get them out and had a liberal coating of dirt reapplied it looked like rubbish benito wouldnt have bothered to steal it himself when hed been a bridgebrat the stones cleaned up would fetch a good thirty ducats each even from a fence benito was barefoot in a ragged waistsash he carried a plain knife with a small brass guard and a cordbound handle in all benito looked the part erik didnt his face shape was just wrong too angular his hair was too straight and too fine and his eye color was a sure giveaway francesca shook her head i think this is a lost cause maybe we could curl his hair i could break his nose for him offered von gherens feeling his own skew organ set in his burnscarred face always makes a man look different that thank you said erik putting his hand protectively over his threatened nose you are well suited to bodyguarding manfred i think you should just wear this woolen hat said francesca decisively and keep away from people if you can claim a passing sailor got you on your mother that could account for the looks erik smiled now that he was actually going to look for svanhild he seemed imperturbable strangely at peace and at ease why thank you too francesca manfred grunted its barely a cockleshell erik if the wind comes up youll be swamped in moments benito agreed with manfred but theyd had some trouble finding a boat quietly erik didnt seem perturbed however at the moment nothing seemed to perturb erik the corfiote seaman had refused even for a considerable bribe to guide them out his first experience of being under fire and the new troops arriving in the carracks had frightened the bravado out of him when hed refused erik had just shrugged asked a few questions and proceeded as planned the arrival of several more ships from the south at sundown hadnt worried him even the skin and withy coracle normally used to hold a caulker working around a larger vessel was fine by him its light enough to lower down the wall manfred and the sea out there is not the atlantic still looks like a cockleshell and i wish you had your armor on erik chuckled von gherens this is what youll have to deal with one minute im going to capsize the next i should wear armor so i can drown when i do capsize stop worrying manfred next thing youll want me to take a horse in the cockleshell and wood for the signal fires hes just jealous because he doesnt want to sit inside a fortress under siege while youre out there said the older ritter and dont worry hakkonsen well keep him here youre not savvy enough to be let out on your own grumbled manfred erik smiled a flash of teeth in the darkness im not dealing with the political infighting in mainz or tavern or brothel brawls manfred ill be fine out there theres a lot of wild country i cut my teeth in wilderness like this you worry about benito he doesnt know how to move in it now let us go i want to get moving while we still have a chance to get out without detection the rock wall was wet with the rain feeling greasy underfoot manfred along with several knights who were on guard on the outer wall lowered benito down first from their daytime scouting benito knew there was a little sill down there just before the water he felt for it on the rainslick rock with his feet once he was down benito whistled up and freed the rope the ledge was less than a cubit wide it sloped toward the sea and it was rounded benito was used to the pantiles of venice but this was even slipperier it was like being on icy rooftiles erik nearly landed in the water as a result his feet scrabbled for a purchase and benito put a steadying hand on his arm youre supposed to be looking after me he hissed as erik cursed softly anyway the rain should make it easy enough to paddle out of here the coracle came down next and it nearly had both of them off the ledge and of course it was farther to the water than theyd realized from above you couldnt just jump into a hideandwicker boat either still with care and patience they managed to board each of them took a paddle and they set off onto the dark water maria stood back in the shadows rain dripping from an eave above her she didnt really know why shed slipped out so late at night she couldnt absolutely guarantee that alessia would stay asleepalthough shed timed her feeds very carefully for this umberto wouldnt wake for anything short of the last trump shed wanted to say goodbye good luck and dont be an idiot to benito but there wasnt an opportunity all she could do was watch him and the dark shape that was erik go over the wall he hadnt even known she was there she turned and walked back into the dark feeling a little frightened and very depressed this might be the last time she ever saw him and she hadnt really seen him at all she wanted to let him know what maybe it was better this way she had umberto who was good for her and good to her and she hoped she was being good to him benito could never be other than what he was and it would do no good for him to know what she still felt she must have gotten a bit lost in the streets as she was lost in her own thoughts for when she looked up she realized that she was not where she thought she was she took her bearings by the bulk of nearby buildings there was st agatha the hypatian chapel and she knew then that she had gone a little too far just as she was about to turn back she caught sight of a flicker of light someone was coming she leaned back against the wall feeling a shock of apprehension the kind of thing she used to feel back in venice when she prowled the canals at night waiting to be caught in her smuggling by the schioppies but it was only two women talking quietly in greek marias greek was still limited the only word she could catch sounded like goddess it was an odd time to be out and an odd coincidence to see people well less of a coincidence than all that if anyone was going to go down to the houses inside the outer curtain wall this was the only road they could follow perhaps these were the wives of arsenal workers or militia or even guards back from bringing them something to eat after the women had gone by maria proceeded back on her way crept into the house and bolted the door quietly she slipped out of her wet things rubbed her hair dry and left the wet clothes in the kitchen then crept quietly up the stairs she stopped and checked on alessia and slid into bed next to umberto but sleep was a long time coming chapter out on the sea in the darkness benito was getting a firsthand lesson in the difference between paying a gondolier to transport you or telling sailors where you wanted to go and rowing yourself the first pointed difference was that you actually had to paddle he was a lot less experienced than erik and the coracle was round which meant they were spending a lot of time spinning slowly the second difference was that in his previous experience benito had simply told those in control of the boat his destination and made finding it their problem now it was his and eriks problem the rain obscured them from enemy watchers which was a good thing the trouble was it obscured everything including possible landmarks at this rate thought benito we might just end up in albania after all and they hadnt guessed about the wind or the current or even the chop on the water either they might just end up swimming to albania if they didnt end up swimming round and round in circles i think were going south whispered erik i thought we planning on going north erik grunted in this thing we just go where the sea takes us bail for a bit so benito bailed it made more sense than having him try to paddle it seemed the sea outside the coracle was keen to get into it as fast as possible it came aboard in enthusiastic splashes that soon had benito wet to the skin here he was cheekbyjowl in a giant bowl with erik hakkonsen and he might as well have been alone on the water erik was as silent as a dead man he couldnt see anything and benito was so cold he couldnt feel anything either the whisper came out of the dark again at his ear and he jumped theres a headland i think help me paddle gradually the headland loomed up out of the rain benitos feet were now ankledeep in the water in the bottom of the coracle it proved to be an islet they hauled up on it anyway but they could vaguely make out a white building off across the water i think this must be mouse islet said benito quietly we could see it from the wall there are some buildings on it dawn cant be that far off benito is that building we can see over there another island no its a monastery i think just off the mainland jutting into the sea we could go there but theres a big inlet ahead if we go ashore here well be forced to go virtually back into kerkira erik sighed well be forced back into this bedamned tub instead then come on lets get on with it they did but it became rapidly obvious that the coracle had suffered during the landing on mouse islet the water was calm here but benito had to keep bailing by the time they got within sight of the further shore it was a race between water coming in and the bailing and paddling of course the more water there was in the vessel the heavier it was to row and the slower they went too benito started preparing himself to swim it proved unnecessary just mind you benito thought my clothes are so wet by now that i cant really get any wetter despite the exercise benito was shivering almost uncontrollably at least the rain had stopped but there was still a cold wind blowing i dont think it is worth hiding that bathtub said erik we wont be using it to get back so we might as well just get away from here the darkness was still thick as they blundered off into it even benito used to seeing his way around by feel in the darkness of venices nighttime rooftops found the going difficult manmade structures had the decency to be at predictable angles then his nose picked up something a hint of woodsmoke theres a fire ahead whispered benito erik snorted i know ive been trying to stalk it with something stumbling along just behind me that makes more noise than a pair of bullseals having a territory fight in the middle of a venetian glassshop if its local peasants we need to ask them some directions and if its hungarian soldiers we need to avoid them if we can benito shivered right now id be happy to go and ask them if i could borrow their fire for a bit well come along but try to keep it quiet if it is soldiery we are staying out of a fight youre too keen on fighting but when they got closer and erik worked out just what the two croats were doing it was he not benito who rushed in to the kill the two croats werent well positioned to resist by the time benito got there with his shetlander dagger in hand erik was already kneeling next to the woman untying her and a moment later he was undoing the gag her first response was to scream hush hissed erik he might as well have tried to stop a storm with his hands she had a proper breath now for the next hysterical scream it was understandable besides being raped she was covered in her erstwhile rapists blood when someones head is more or less summarily removed by a hatchet they bleed a lot but understandable as it might be she was probably telling everyone within a mile that there was a woman here even the croats horses were shifting nervously benito shoved erik aside hauled her up by what was left of her blouse and slapped her shut up he hissed were rescuing you you want others to come she shut up erik cut her hands free now wed better run someone must have heard that scream what about taking their horses asked benito theyre tied over there he pointed with his chin erik looked good thats the first bit of luck weve had the horses still had their tack on it was plain that the two soldiers had slipped off from somewhere else for a little private pleasure youre lighter than i am you take her said erik pushing the staggering woman toward benito uh i dont ride so well erik oh hell shed better come with me then help her up behind me benito did she clung to erik like ivy it was just light enough now for benito to see her huge terrified eyes he was then left with the difficulty of getting onto the horse himself it kept moving every time he put a foot in the stirrup finally in desperation he jumped he nearly went clear over the other side but did manage to cling to the saddle he pulled himself upright into it he managed to find one stirrup it was too long this was a whole continent away from the haute ecole equestrienne petro dorma had sent him to there hed been surrounded by respectful grooms docile mounts and mounting blocks but he had to try erik was already out of sight the horse plainly knew it had a total amateur in the saddle it was being as balky as only a horse can be when it knows it has mastery of the rider there was a clatter of hooves behind him benito prepared to jump only his foot was now stuck in this damned stirrup if he jumped hed drag he hunched in the saddle and struggled with his foot get a move on benito snapped erik the clatter had come from him returning to see what had happened to benito he slapped the rump of benitos horse and the vile animal took off as if someone had shoved something redhot in an unmentionable spot with benito swearing and clinging to the saddle they headed upward into the rougher terrain at least his horse was following eriks now by the time they reached the ridgeline the sun was just burning its way through the clouds benito had long since abandoned any pretense of riding he was just trying to stay on the godforsaken animal it took all his finely honed burglars acrobatic skills to do so and all his strength too hed managed to get his foot free of the stirrup at last that meant when he fell offnot if but whenhe could try to fall clear when they got up to some pines on the ridge erik called a halt more precisely he pulled his horse to a halt and benitos horse stopped also very abruptly benito continued for a few yards without it he got to his feet to find the icelander looking at him his shoulders shaking with laughter why didnt you sayyou couldnt ride at all you crazy kid uh i have been to classes case vecchie can all ride but well i was a bridgebrat erik defensively ive only ridden a horse about five or six times before this you know erik snorted well you cant count this as another time ive seen a sack of meal do a better job of it and those things hanging down are stirrups you are supposed to put your feet in them i couldnt reach them erik shook his head well shorten them now help this poor woman down benito benito did she almost fell off the horseand then pushed away from him who are you she asked warily her eyes darting looking for a place to run there was naked fear in that voice benito waved his hands at her trying to look helpful and harmless at the same time were venetians it was easier than trying to explain youre safe now the young woman crumpled and began to cry then she started speaking greek at speed whoa benito squatted down beside her it seemed it was up to him to try to calm her down well he was smaller than erik maybe that made him look less threatening we dont speak greek he said gently i cant help you if i dont understand they killed georgio she wailedbut softly hardly more than a whisper theythey she dissolved into tears and benito patted her shoulder thinking that trying to hold her would probably be a bad idea at this point she got herself under control a lot faster than he would have thought what happened he asked why did you come down out of the hills she gulped for air see some of the goats were missing he thought theyd gone home so he went down to the house and when he didnt come back i went down to look for him he was her eyes were round with the memory of things benito didnt want to think about they were torturing him burning him to get him to tell them where hed hidden the money she shuddered then said plaintively we dont have any money just a few pennies weve only been married for two months she began to cry again great heaving sobs wringing her hands together so hard that her knuckles were bonewhite then she caught her breath she seemed determined to tell them to get the vileness out i ran in to try and help him the one the one who he said heres the bitch well get it out of her instead they cut georgios throat they cut my mans throat like you would butcher a hog here erik had produced a small squat bottle manfred gave me some of his armor polish give her a drink benito benito did she choked but then drank some more the woman looked at erik at least you killed them erik looked decidedly uncomfortable look is there anyone we can take you to somewhere safe where theyll look after you she laughed bitterly it was a horrible tragic sound safe safe like you venetians sitting in your fortress there is nowhere safe for the poor peasants we must hide in the hills so there is no one we can take you to erik persisted but without much hope she shrugged i have a brother on a galley at sea georgios parents are somewhere in the hills she looked at both of them with resignation as if she was perfectly prepared for them to abandon her erik cleared his throat and looked worriedly back down the hill look we have to get on ive got to get to count denticos villa my my a lady i must go and see if shes all right but we cant just leave you here i have nowhere to go she repeated tonelessly erik cocked a wary ear toward the slope then youd better come with us until we find a place for you benito lets shorten those stirrups and try holding on with your knees benito shook his head erik the only thing i wasnt holding on with were my teeth and that was only because the mane kept bouncing around when i tried to bite it the greek peasant woman managed a tremulous laugh i can ride my uncle was a groom for count di valva the count wasnt there very often where is this place you wish to find i can probably get you in the right direction at least underneath her shock and her grief she was recovering some hope and only because they had not offered to abandon her erik nodded you ride then benito can cling on like a tick behind you the estate is somewhere near a place called giannades do you have any idea where that is she nodded i havent been there but it is to the west of kerkira she went over to the horse and shortened the stirrups quickly and efficiently clearly she knew what she was doing then she hitched up her skirts in a most unladylike but very practical way and mounted with an ease that benito envied its best that she does something erik said quietly shes ready to go to pieces benito shes like a glass thats cracked to bits one touch and shell shatter im not surprised erik sighed worriedly that could be what happened to my svanhild come on lets go if you look over at kerkira youll see emeric has troops coming in by the column thats a good few thousand men down there we should move before they get too organized never mind before they notice a couple of missing croats caesare aldantos body slept long long ago chernobog had learned this was a necessity they died quickly if you did not allow them to rest caesare lay on a cot in the tent that had been allocated to him and twitched occasionally as a dog might when dreaming chernobogs other dog yellow and feral prowled the hills the shaman had been told to look for holy places to sniff them out so they could be rededicated it should have been easy it was proving impossible the smell of magic was easy enough to find the trouble was everywhere reeked of it up in the windtumbled sky his two aerial eyes flew hither and yon looking for groves or temples or even standing stones so far all hed seen through their infinite detailseeing eyes were churches the shamandog shivered thinking about those his master could and no doubt would rededicate some of those to his purpose but it was a dangerous process and there was that about them which struck at him he could of course strike back but that could easily draw the attention of the masters adversary and the shaman was not ready for that the shamandog stumbled and sneezed pollen it seemed as if every plant on this accursed island was flowering like the magic of this place the pollen was in the air everywhere he left the roadway in haste horses and a doublespan of donkeys struggling to drag a heavy cannon were coming along it horses took a great aversion to this bodyform they would smell him out and chase and kick him if they could this road was busy with troops and cannons coming along it by evening at least a third of the guns would be in place already the pounding thunder was beginning the shaman wrinkled his nose in distaste he didnt like the smell of gunpowder either it was a new thing the shaman hated new things chapter its not that serious hildi bjarnis voice was gruff but underneath the impatience was affection she could tell just a few fragments of rock knocked off by a bullet head wounds always bleed like mad dont fuss about it just bandage it up so that when kari or gulta come back with a way out of here for us we can go we might have to leave the horses but they are such beautiful horses svanhild protested wrapping a torn section of her petticoat around her brothers head and ear now she was glad she had some of those travesties of venetian gowns that her brothers had insisted she have made up the masses of petticoats made excellent bandages if we leave them behindthose magyars they wont be hurt its us theyre after not the horses bjarni managed a strained chuckle actually those brutes treat their horses better than they treat their wives the horses will probably be better off with them gulta and kari scrambled down into the cave mouth theres only one other way out like i said bjarni and theyve got people up there rolled a rock down on us but there are a good few caves up there said gulta looks like one of them is used we could hide svanhild up there svanhild raised herself up i can shoot better than most of the men and i will stand with my clan not hide up in some other cave we cannot get out of this valley well so what they cannot get in either we have food and water let them sit out there she did not add that if her brothers and hearthmen died and she were hiding in a cave her best option would be to fling herself off the side of the mountain and tonight well slip out and cut a few throats said kari evilly bjarni regarded him with a jaundiced eye well if they can get to shoot into the cave mouth the ricochets will kill us without being able to shoot around corners theyll hard pressed to do that pointed out hrolf from the lip over there we can target anyone who comes into the valley they cant even roll rocks onto us and there is not enough growing here to burn properly bjarni sniffed they dont have to theyll smoke us out the villa was still standing as erik and benito rode toward it not torched as most of the others theyd seen so far the presence of thalia the peasant girl theyd rescued had a very beneficial effect theyd been forced to the back paths and side roads by patrols she had actually managed to draw the hastily hiding or fleeing peasants back to them to get some directions they would have struggled to find their way otherwise erik kicked his horse into a gallop when the villa dentico came in sight and rode straight up to it as hard and as fast as he could make the horse gallop benito clinging to thalia as she followed erik knew from eriks own lectures that this was plain foolishness he also knew stopping erik would be beyond his ability besides thalia was the one in control of this fourhoofed bollockcruncher not him he was just trying to stay on erik dismounted in a leap and ran into the house calling svanhild svanhild at the top of his lungs alerting every single enemy within hearing distance or lying in wait in the villa that there was someone up here benito winced he had expected nothing less erik did at least have that tomahawk in his hand benito dismounted with as much skill as he could muster and pelted after erik catch his horse and stay out here he shouted to thalia what he expected to find in there would be no sight for her he raced into the villa with the shetlander knife in his hand wishing desperately for his rapier however what benito found was merely erik examining some bloodstains in the hallway the blood had long since dried and gone a reddish brown but a fair amount of it was splattered onto the whitewashed walls in various spots there had been a lot of killing done here benito swallowed erik im sorry but to his astonishment erik smiled at him it wasnt their blood or at least not all their blood he ventured closer and peered at the bloodstains as erik was doing he couldnt see how erik could tell anything from them vinlander blood is a different color ventured benito erik swatted his ear from past comparative experience benito knew he was doing it gently no you young idiot there are no bodies somebody took the bodies away i dont see that being the hungarians not if the bodies were svanhild and her people and with that many men and this much blood splashed about i dont see that theyd have just captured everyone well it made sense when erik pointed it out if you accepted the idea that the hungarians wouldnt take away the bodies of their victims so what happened erik shrugged how would i know but at least they made a fight of it they werent caught unawares because there are no bloodstains anywhere except here presumably erik had already been everywhere but there so where do we go now we try to track them said erik heading for the front door ask anyone we can find i suppose it isnt going to be easy actually i should say i try to track them you should get up to the north coast and see if you can find a fisherman willing to transport you the siege isnt going anywhere he pointed out i can help you find them erik shook his head with the numbers of men and guns that emeric is moving in this is going to be no light siege and no besieged castle is that secure anyway days can count benito days mean lives lives of people like thalia i am a knight sworn to defend them that doesnt mean i can let you waste time duty is not a narrow thing you have yours and i have mine mine is to find svanhild if i can then get back to manfred with all possible speed yours is to make all possible speed to venice or at least to someone who can get help from venice i suppose so erik but he began just make all possible speed to venice do it benito they were outside in the courtyard by now and benito realized that thalia wasnt he tensed heart suddenly racing but there were the horses tied up carefully thalia was outside the wall talking to a very nervous boy of twelve or thirteen he says the people who were staying here went north on the horses of the raiders he says they killed those who attacked all of them he says the soldiers came two days ago and took the bodies theyve been looking for people to question there are some of the soldiers in the next valley ask him if there was a woman with the people who got away a woman with long blond hair the boy nodded he made an unmistakable gesture with his hands benito had to stifle a laugh manfred had said she was topheavy it looks like we go north together after all erik erik nodded and benito had the satisfaction of seeing that it was not with reluctance as long as our paths run together yes let us go now before those soldiers come back they rode out heading for the mountainous north of the island do you have any idea where were going benito asked thalia as they headed up toward the ridge through the olive grove north up there i have never been up there they say it is very different thalia spoke as if she was referring to a different continent instead of a few miles off she pointed to mount pantocrator there is a very holy place up there there is another one near paleokastritsa where my aunt eleni went when she was young she shivered suddenly for no apparent reason but that is not mens business more to distract her from whatever thought this had been benito asked but havent you been up to the north i need to find a fishing harbor to find a boat that will take me over to italy she shook her head i have been to kerkira twice that made her a welltraveled woman in her opinion after all corfutown was at least a league away corfiote men traveled women didnt well war had the effect of changing things by now corfiote women were doing all manner of things theyd never done before benito was exhausted it hadnt been possible to ride all day as the heroes in the stories had for starters it looked like emerics commanders were finally starting to get themselves organized there were patrols to dodge and theyd spotted several guard posts being set up on hilltops fortunately it appeared that eriks combat experience against the vinland tribes and with clan feuds on iceland had involved a great deal of just this sort of warfare they were moving steadily north at least benitos clothes were dry which was something he was grateful for his belly button was meeting his backbone his stomach was that empty but he kept reminding himself that hed been this hungry and more before and hadnt died of it and thalia was drooping in the saddle maybe she hadnt paddled a leaky coracle out of a besieged fortress but shed had the worst day of her life and it wasnt showing any signs of being over erik was driving them relentlessly according to several peasants hed found and questioned with thalias assistance the northern villages had closed their gates and were holding off the marauding bands not that this would do them any good when the hungarians stopped being marauding bands and started being segments of an army but for now they were holding their own none of the peasants had seen the vinlanders but that was hardly surprising the sound of horses hooves was enough to send the peasantry diving for cover at the last guard post erik had left the two of them and gone on a lone sortie hed returned cleaning his tomahawk fastidiously and smiling they havent found them yet anyway the guard told me about what happened at dentico villa the magyars are furious but they think theyre after a bunch of venetians they have been trying to track them for days theyve gone to the northwest there are several villages up there that are walled and resisting there is one near the coast at paleokastritsa where many of the women go to the shrine volunteered thalia benito sighed do you think this shrineplace is serving dinner erik reached into his slingbag the guard up there had some bread that he wont be needing any more he pulled out a flat country loaf he had some wine too but i knew you wouldnt want that benito glared at him erik ill kill you erik hauled out a clay flask miraculously unbroken it killed him he said grimly fortunately there isnt enough left to kill you i hope erik had also helped himself to the guards pike and his arquebus the latter was filthy enough to give erik the mutters still with wine and bread in them pressing on seemed easier at last they saw a patch of lights a town that isnt deserted it must be one of the ones that is holding out erik peered through the dusk at them they cant last long could be a hungarian camp benito observed wearily true erik sounded positively cheerful but well have to sneak a closer look to tell probably have more fleas than people in it though benito groaned if it is a town and so long as it dont fall tonight and theyve got a place for us to sleep ill be pleased to meet the fleas our chances of getting in tonight are nonexistent said erik urging his tired horse forward unless it is a hungarian camp of course in which case we wont get out its far more likely to be a hungarian camp he was wrong about the hungarian camp he was also wrong about the town letting them in refugees had been coming up the steep narrow track for a week now most of them by night benito thalia and erik found themselves with several others requesting entry to paleokastritsa benito found no trouble in understanding just why it hadnt been sacked it didnt look large enough to be worth the huge effort it would take stand against the wall now take all your weapons off once that is done you can come forward one at a time remember any false moves and youll be shot from up here paleokastritsa was crowded a place to sleep well eventually they joined some thirty others sleeping on the church floor erik was right about the fleas though chapter benito woke to the certain knowledge that he was getting soft sleeping on a cold stone floor might once have been luxury after all he was dry and the other sleepers kept the place relatively warm but the stone was a lot harder than what he had become used to erik and thalia were already up so he assumed at any rate because they werent lying on the stone next to him benito got himself up rubbed the sleep from his eyes bowed to the altar and walked off to find either the others or the town fountain he hadnt slept that deeply for many years and he knew that if he was going to keep alive out here he was going to have to go back to the habits of his days as an unwanted and uninvited secret tenant in peoples attics hed have to learn to sleep with his senses keyed again where the slightest sound would wake him only he had been so tired when they first arrived he knew he couldnt have slept lightly now he was just so hungry he couldnt have slept at all the first familiar face he saw also at the towns fountain belonged to neither erik nor thalia the corfiote sailor no longer had his black eye the sailor looked at benito blinked looked again benito hoped that this wouldnt get unpleasant he was fairly sure he could deal with the mans inept knifeskills what he didnt want was the trouble that would inevitably follow he also didnt want his identity nosed about it might not cause troublebut there could be ears out here in the street that it shouldnt come to benito glanced about there was no one in earshot at least the sailor shook his head ill be damned just what are you doing here case vecchie he didnt say it too loudly or with any malice benito decided to chance friendliness if he remembered rightly the sailor from bari had called him spiro trying not to give away that i am a case vecchie spiro do me a favor dont shout or call any attention to it or i might have to remind you how we last met and i dont want to do that ive got plenty of trouble as it is the man didnt really seem to have heard instead he was studying benito intently you are him he said unbelievingly you really are him i really dont want everyone to know spiro benito repeated fixing him with a stare the sailor grinned widely safe enough with me milord i owe you benito noticed that a couple of people were staring at them he clapped spiro on the shoulder and turned the gesture into an arm around the sailors shoulders as if they were old friends which at the moment benito really hoped was the case lets go and find some wine i was going to drink some of the water but ive decided that im really not that thirsty spiro looked skeptical right now wine in paleokastritsa is damn near as expensive as wine in venice and im afraid im broke again milord even if i owe you a drink or two for heavens sake call me benito forget the milord and the wine is on me and something to eat if you can forget that fact venetian case vecchie are not popular right now out there the hungarians want to kill us for protecting the island from what i can work out the corfiotes in here want to kill us for not protecting the island spiro shrugged as youre buying the wine i wouldnt dream of killing you m benito afterwards is a different story said benito wryly spiro chuckled after a few glasses of wine even the stupidest idea can sound like a good one but i did learn that that was a really really insanely stupid one so what are you doing here m benito ill tell you about it over that cup of wine where do we find one spiro pointed across the square at dark doorway papavanakis his taverna is dirty it smells his wifes face would curdle milk and i think he waters his wine benito grinned so why are we drinking there spiro shrugged and grinned back at least what hes putting in the wine is water and he is less of a thief than most of them they strolled over and went into the dim coolness out of the already bright day benito blinked adjusting his eyes to the lack of direct sunlight the taverna was clean and smelled of food and wine fresh bread and meaty smells and the wine wasnt slightly used by prior customers the pretty young woman behind the counter scowled at them not you again spiro go away not another cup will i give you until you pay spiro nodded to benito see what i mean he said mournfully curdle milk that face would she snorted and pretended to throw a wine cup at him it was obviously an old joke go away spiro papas will kill me if i give you any more credit spiro gestured expansively its all right anna beni here is paying the woman raised her eyebrows with the same coin as you pay or real money benito produced a silver penny you shouldnt show her that much said spiro shell faint and well never see any wine or that food you promised me its been a while since i ate the tavernas keeper clicked her tongue hes impossible how did he talk you into wasting good money on him she said it with perfect amiability while filling two wine cups benito realized that spiro had addressed her in italian frankish and that shed replied in the same way plainly by her accent and rapidity of speech it was her mothertongue hed been keeping his own mouth shut to play down his origins but it now seemed safe enough he borrowed money from me hes had it for a year so now he says i owe him interest said benito earnestly the young woman snorted with laughter and handed them the wine and youll keep owing him interest until the day he dies she pointed to the tables sit ill go and find you some food they sat spiro took a pull at his wine cup more water than wine it tasted pretty good to benito so what are you doing here spiro is this home the corfiote gestured expansively this dump ha liapadhes is a great metropolis broad streets wonderful tavernas wine like a young lion as far from this place as the sun is from the earth benito was beginning to get the hang of spiro by now so it is just like this is it spiro gave him a conspiratorial wink and took another pull of his wine two peas in a pod really except this has got a good defensive position its about a mile and half south how did you get home from venice spiro raised his cup a dorma ship thanks to you i was with her all the way to constantinople id have stayed with her too but when i got back to corfu on the return trip there was a bit of family business i had to settle a fellow had taken some liberties with my sister he swallowed half the contents of his cup at a go so after i had thanked him very politely i went back to kerkira but the ship had left i couldnt come back to liapadhes for a while so i took a job with a fisherman taki drinks too much but hes a good skipper then this lot blew up so i thought id come home only home seemed to be full of hungarians and you benito benitos ears had pricked up with the mention of the fisherman got sent out here to be a factor for dorma and then this war blew up look this fisherman friend of yours he wouldnt like to earn a bit of money i really want out of here back to the italian mainland at this point anna the taverna keeper arrived with two earthenware platters fragrant steam curling up from them i had some of last nights stifado still ive just made it hot that one she pointed an elbow at spiro didnt eat last night so i thought he might as well eat this morning and you looked hungry spiro looked suspiciously at the plate of pearl onionlaced stew that she put in front of him it hasnt got quinces in it again has it you know i hate quinces she shook her head as she wiped her hands on her apron then she held out a hand to benito and thats why he ate three helpings benito handed over the silver she looked at it very carefully she was polite enough not to bite it in front of him it seems real enough you want more wine with that spiro drained his cup seems like a good idea im not likely to get this lucky again in a hurry and i dont see us fishing for a while yet which answers your question benito the dalmatian pirates sink any boat they can find even fishing boats benito waited for the taverna keeper to walk off even for a good bit of coin working at night spiro shrugged ill ask around my old skipper taki would be your best bet hes up in the hills with his cousin georgio hes probably so sick of the old man and his goats that hed be ready to try anything by now i could get word to him some of the boys who go out with the goats would do anything for a few coppers wordlessly benito dug out a few copper coins and a silver penny he held back the silver penny that one is for finding somebody else a whole bunch of them big guys with blond hair and a blond woman with them spiro stuck his hand out ill have the silver too thanks easiest money ive ever earned theyre in a cave in a gorge about a mile and a half east of here what benito started are you sure spiro grinned well i was fairly sober when i heard about them thats the trouble with being broke you know do you want them alive or dead he asked around a mouthful of stew still holding his hand out alive definitely alive then youd better get a move on they stole some of cheretiss goats and hes got all the men going out this morning theyre planning to burn them out benito knocked over the chair in his haste to get up come on we must find erik he hauled spiro out of his seat but i havent finished eating and the wine is still coming you want gold not silver youll come and show us the way to this place as fast as possible benito hustled him along trying to think where hed be most likely to find erik the stables perhaps where are you going yelled the taverna keeper here is your wine and your change you havent eaten your food well be back emergency yelled benito sure enough erik and thalia were in the stable erik looked up as he and spiro panted in so nice of you to bother to come and help finished in the taverna i saw you going into get the tack on those horses weve got to move now erik didnt waste time asking questions before starting to do that neither did the suddenly wideeyed thalia but as he worked erik asked what was up your precious svanhild is about to get roasted for goatstealing said benito spiro here knows where they are erik didnt waste time on talk but he worked at a pace that made lightning look as if it moved at a comparatively glacial speed up he hauled the onetime sailor onto the horse behind him thalia was up and benito struggled and scrambled behind her as they clattered for the gate erik nearly rode the stableman down benito almost fell off as the man used a pitchfork to make the horse decide to stop abruptly you owe benito frantically dug out some money and flung it at him well be back and then thalia set off after erik benito just hoped theyd catch up they did the town gate was closed let us out yelled erik not likely lets see who youre running from first foreigner said the guard clutching his spear spiro saved the mans life open up adoni theyre not running from anyone theyre trying to get to someone in hurry the guard peered oh its you spiro volagatis well i guess if it gets you out of the town its a good thing he unbarred the gate and they rode off down the steep winding trail where now benito heard erik yell as they reached the foot of the trail benito missed the reply but they did manage to follow erik off to the west then he spotted the trickle of smoke by the way erik was urging the horse into a gallop hed seen it too the corfiote men and boys armed with a motley array of old arquebuses pitchforks spears and slings were piling brushwood right across the mouth of the narrow gorge already someone had lit one edge benito arrived into what certainly sounded like a fullscale riot by the three men on the ground some of the locals had been foolish enough to try and stop erik kicking the fire apart but now he was under the noses of a dozen arquebuses and there was a fullscale shouting match going on thalia quelled it with a shriek and a stream of what could only be greek vituperation hastily the locals began to pull the burning branches away and beat at the fire with branches of green leaves what did you say to them asked benito this is a sacred place the holy mother is in the temple cave up there this valley ends in some cliffs there is no other way out but theyve stolen our goats bellowed one of the men at erik theyre bandits theyve been shooting goatboys and who the hell are you foreigner you knocked down my brother ive a good mind to knock you down when i come back said erik grimly hauling brushwood out of the way youre welcome to try but the fire already had its teeth into the dry brush benito beating at flames got the feeling that he should somehow have gotten erik there sooner already the heat was pushing at their faces and a river of smoke was funneling up the gorge and then there was a rumble even the wet rag wrapped around her mouth couldnt stop svanhild coughing as she tried desperately to calm the horses their eyes were wild and rolling and the animals were whickering and stamping there was little likelihood that anyone could ride them now the horses were already on the edge of panic well have to leave them hildi said bjarni well have to get to the cliff and try and climb out we cant theyll die if we stay much longer well die there was a rumble and it grew darker almost by the moment look at the stream from atop the high rock benito reached down and hauled erik back by the collar as the icelander struggled to turn and throw benitos hand off the water flumed through hitting erik at about kneeheight it knocked his feet out from under him anyway benito clung to erik as if he were a roofbeam four stories from the ground if he hadnt hauled erik back the waterwall would have stuck the icelander at least bellybutton height another strong pair of hands came and grabbed eriks arms between spiro and benito they hauled him up the sudden rain hissed down like arrows a glance showed the local heroes running for shelter bedraggled figures pelting away from the scene thanks said erik as they hastened to a rock lip that offered some vague shelter looking at the torrent and the already decreasing rain erik shook his head what caused that thalia shrugged i told you it was a holy place the priestesses command the magic here erik shook his head again whatever it was it certainly wasnt natural it was a clear morning a few minutes ago anyway let me see if i can get up there thalia took him by the arm i tied the horses just back there you can probably ride up the valley now erik smiled at her youre the practical one thalia seeing to the horses doing all the things we forget the peasant woman looked serious somebody has to but erik had already left at a run benito looked out the rain was slacking off it would be gone in a minute or two the stream was already dropping and on the blackened burned brush a green creeper was already twining growing as he watched the intervention had been magical of that benito was certain he was less certain that he liked it chapter svanhild peered over her brothers shoulders as they watched by the little protruding ridge of limestone arquebuses at the ready the stream which had been no more than a bare trickle so recently was now making so much noise that they were forced to shout but at least the smoke was gone the rain too was nearly over give it a little while longer and ill go and scout that was the luckiest rainstorm in history said kari bjarni raised an eyebrow maybe so but why did the stream flood before the rain fell it must have rained higher up in the catchment bjarni the oldest thordarson brother shook his head this damned trickle hasnt got a catchment worth talking about kari there is something funny going on here i hope things havent just got worse there is someone coming up the gorge shouted the hearthman on guard up on the slope they all took cover including svanhild pick your marks commanded bjarni dont open fire until i say so svanhild peered anxiously toward the mouth of the gorge bright sunlight was shivering into scatterings of brief rainbows through the last veils of rain the rider came in sight around the corner his dark hair was wet and plastered about his face but svanhild knew those facial planes instantly her heart hammered and she found herself abruptly breathless svanhild he called his voice echoing off the cliffs a shot boomed the bullet kicked a white spurt of dust from the limestone next to the riders head erik hakkonsen whirled his horse in the direction of the firing and shook an empty fist you stupid vinlander bastard ive come to rescue you svanhild stopped only long enough to lay down her bow and then was out and running down the slope erik erik a huge smile nearly split eriks face in half as she skidded to a halt on the slippery rock beside his stirrup his face went from angry and anxious towell foolish er good morning svanhild thordardottar she stood there smiling up at him feeling equally foolish and desperately wishing she could think of something to say he vaulted down from the dun he was riding she could see though it was no help that he too was fumbling for words all the long and carefully thoughtout speeches had gone from her head as if she had never even considered making them but she had to help get something started or they would both stand there looking not touching not saying anything why is your hair dark now was all she could think of to say he ran his fingers through his hair as if he had not known it was dark i was trying to pass as one of the locals svanhild looked at him branding his appearance into her memory in casewell in case he was tall lean and athletic she had known that of course but now she was aware of it his face had a hewn masculinity to it planar and strong and nothing detracted from the way he looked in her eyes not even the soot on his face and the water dripping from his hair then a thin sliver of reality intruded with the high cheekbones and the straight hair even with his skin and hair darkened erik looked as much like a local as a wolf looks like a bison she had to laugh and erik began laughing with her by the time that her brothers and their hearthmen joined them they were virtually leaning on each other helpless with laughter benito heard the shot and decided hed come running he was wise enough about his own horsemanship to approach on foot he also kept his head down still by the time he got to where he could see them the vinlanders erik and his sweetheart were all standing around beaming at each other well they look really miserable benito turned to see both spiro and thalia had followed him spiro was being his usual quirky self good said benito lets go and make them more miserable and tell them they have got to get out of here before the villagers come back and roast them again or roll rocks on them thalia shook her head not likely the men will be hiding under their beds and hoping their wives dont find out where they decided to make a fire i wouldnt tell these foreigners that in case they decide to have a roast goat to celebrate said spiro people are very touchy about their goats around paleokastritsa more touchy about their goats than their wives which if you look at the wives makes sense not like the women in liapadhes of course thalia looked at him with her mouth open as if she wasnt entirely certain whether or not spiro was mad spiro winked at her of course the goats around liapadhes are prettier than those in paleokastritsa too they have to be benito walked out to the vinlanders rather than find out any more about the local goats and goatherds ah benito erik greeted him friends this young gentleman is the reason im here and will be the reason were getting out of here erik benito was getting increasingly anxious to break up the happy reunion the locals might come back and besides that fire will have told every hungarian trooper in the area that something is going on here but where will we go asked svanhild her face passing from joyful to desperate in a single moment everyone is trying to kill us well go back to paleokastritsa benito said firmly as spiro and thalia picked their way toward the group youll have to do some explaining about their goats and pay for them the biggest of vinlanders snorted of course we will pay for their goats we would have paid in the first place if anyone had been willing not to run away from us what were we supposed to do starve youd better pay up generously and say you are very sorry said spiro ill handle it for you for a fee of course one of the huge vinlandersthey all looked alike to benitolooked nearly apoplectic apologize but they nearly killed us they nearly killed my sister and you did kill their goats no nearly about it benito retorted then couldnt resist adding and according to spiro goats are a lot more appreciated around here than sisters come on lets go and see if theyll let us back into paleokastritsa i left my breakfast and a glass of wine behind to come and rescue you from the goatavengers erik is not so badtempered because he was only currying horses and he was looking for you anyway he was svanhild gazed upon erik with blue eyes so bright they seemed to have stars in them benito smiled slyly at erik oh yes when he heard from maria verrier that you were out here he did not even let an entire besieging army stand in his way he left the citadel by night over the walls with a leaking boat braving enemy patrols and the wild sea in the torrential rain staying neither to sleep nor rest riding vent a terre until he reached the villa dentico all that was in his mind was the safety of his goldenhaired svanhild shut up benito growled erik glowing dully under the dye that pale skin produced a truly vibrant red color benito decided that the next time they were cold hed embarrass the icelander you could warm a family of five by the heat he gave off but it is true insisted thalia he saved me from the raping croats kyria he killed two of them just like that and the sentry on the hill he is a great fighter he pulled at the burning wood with his bare hands and he beat back the men of paleokastritsa and and lets get out of here please begged erik either the hungarians will arrive or the locals are bound to come back or both agreed one of the vinlanders dont want to be in the middle of that soon the entire party was riding to paleokastritsa the yellow dog almost howled in triumph at last the shaman had a trace of magic that rose above the general reeking miasma of this place he ran through the olive groves pine forests and the macchia he ran on past sentries and past hiding peasants he had many miles to go but it had been a piece of intense and powerful sorcery not finely crafted and precise as the names of power he used not demonbludgeon strong as jagiellon used precisely he thought what jagiellon was looking for this magic was raw and primal elementalbig in the way an earthquake or a thunderstorm was big dangerous too but that was not his problem his problem was to find it jagiellons to tame it he sent his hawks winging north a part of him seeing through their eyes eyes that could see a field mouse twitch the grass at five hundred feet it took him quite some time to realize that the hawks were being subtly pushed away the thermals slid them off to the west the winds seeming to buffet against them whenever they tried to fly to one corner of the island the hawks were becoming exhausted worse they were becoming recalcitrant ever since he had tried to use them above venice the shaman had noticed that his control over the two hawks was not as it should be he was both angry and astonished it was not possible he had their true names which made them his his absolutely yet he could not ignore the fact that they were rebelling not in great things but in small ways in a slow and steady erosion of his control it must be this vile places magic well where they could not go was as good an indication of where he had to go as them actually seeing something the yellow dog ran on allowing the hawks to go to roost it was midafternoon before he reached the place he looked at the few burned branches and the evidence of the recently flooded stream and smelled raw magic he tried to take a step forward and stumbled grass had grown around his feet the thin strands intertwining and binding he kicked his way loose then moved forward sniffing a dogs nose is a wondrous instrument he could smell the horses as individuals he could smell the people the peasants and the others and know who had wandered where he could smell the women among them two of them he could smell achoo he erupted in a volley of sneezes all the flowers suddenly seemed intent on smothering him in their scents he flicked his ears a horsefly buzzed about them then another one bit him just below the tail on the exposed flesh the shaman turned and snapped angrily at it cracking it in his yellow teeth another bit his ear as he did so several more came buzzing up one affixed itself to his nose the shaman pawed furiously at it the shaman was one of the greatest and most powerful of magicians he was proofed against many great magics horseflies made him flee horseflies in those numbers could make anything flee they seemed immune to his protective spells still he knew the area in which the magics were being worked now the master could send aldanto it would do the blond puppet good to be bitten by few horseflies go away or well shoot you said one of the pair of guards on the wall he brandished his arquebus in a manner that was more awkward than fierce youre not wanted here one of the vinlanders the one who seemed to do all of the talking contrived to look sheepish and apologetic it was a misunderstanding truly we were running from the invaders and we were starving we have money we want to pay for the animals there was a hasty consultation between the sentries well get someone to call old cheretis it was his goats the other guard peered at them more closely oh its you again spiro i thought wed gotten rid of you i see youre in bad company as usual but i havent been anywhere near your sister adoni said spiro with a grin the guard glared at him the other guard nearly fell over the crenellations laughing the goat owner when he arrived reminded benito more of a sullen badtempered porker than a goat like the ones a few people over on guidecca had kept on the scraps in those big marketgardens over there he had the same sparse bristly beard and pronounced jowls but he was as obstinate as a goat even if he didnt look like one they must be punished even if they pay for the goats they must be punished he pleaded with the guards in a squeaky voice after all if you shoot them i get paid for my beasts from the money they have with them and you get the rest spiro shook his head dont be dafter than you have to be you old malakas they were strangers visiting our beautiful island when the hungarians attacked where is our famous corfiote hospitality why are you fussing over a few miserable scrawny goats scrawny goats they killed my best milker she was the most beautiful goat on the island hair like silk an udder as soft as a babys face and milk so much milk youd have thought she was a cow and as for hospitality what sort of guests kill your livestock spiro turned to the vinlanders benito erik and thalia see i told you how they felt about their goats in paleokastritsa the laughter might have infuriated the goatowner but it decided the two guards that they were obviously no threat have you got the money to pay the old bastard asked one guard in gold said bjarni curtly not much gold came to paleokastritsa even the goatowner looked less sour such fine goats as mine are worth a great amount of gold let us in and we can argue about it grumbled benito before some hungarian troopers come along because of all that smoke and they take all the gold instead benito reached into his own small pouch and hauled out a silver penny here spiro i owe you this for information i promised him a ducat from you erik erik dug in his pouch here are two he handed them over with a flourish carefully visible to the gate im in your debt for finding and helping my friends guards and goatowner had developed eyes like saucers the goatowners were full of greed spiro looked at the coins beaming im rich he walked over to the gate and pounded on it let me in i need a drink youll have to leave your swords and guns in the gatehouse said one of the guards and you owe me a cup of wine spiro spiro grinned im buying so you might as well get yours before the moneys all drunk up after you send some goatboys to look for that friend of yours said benito the fisherman spiro nodded sure but i intend to be already hung over and broke before taki temperades gets here then he elbowed benito in the ribs trying to rob you was the smartest dumb thing i ever did eh at the moment benito was inclined to agree chapter in the darkness up on the landward wall of the inner curtain manfred paced von gherens as a bodyguard should paced alongside him it was a mistake i should never have let him go manfred stared over the cannonflash in the darkness emerics heavy guns were being maneuvered into place and the first of the fortyeightpound bombards were already in action its early days yet said von gherens erik wont be easily caught and even if the boat sank he swims like a fish he looked pensive you know theres something very wrong about that a good knight should have the decency to avoid learning how to swim after all if youre in the water with armor on what is the point manfred ignored him he gnawed on a knuckle and welcomed the pain when he bit a little too deep he and benito were too valuable to risk like that what the hell was i thinking of von gherens didnt reply perhaps he realized that manfred didnt really want an answer presently francesca came up to the battlement and took him by the elbow as he stared off into the hills reluctantly he turned to face her its time to come down manfred perhaps tomorrow night look look manfred von gherens pointed manfred whirled and followed the direction of his finger on the far hills a bonfire had blossomed a tiny pinpoint of yellow and red now another then a third youre hurting me manfred said francesca quietly hastily manfred let go of her shoulder sorry dear he took a deep breath then let out a long sigh of relief he should have known and he should have trusted that those damned vinlanders were as hard to kill as his icelander and hes even found the girl come on francesca now i really will sleep not even emerics damned guns will keep me awake about time too grumbled von gherens keep him under lock and key francesca im going across to the hospital to see how falkenberg does manfred smiled im too tired and to be honest too relieved to gallivant tonight fritz how is falkenberg by the way he had some fever and infection but father francis one of eneko lopezs companions has been treating him it looks like he might mend manfred he swore at me this morning at least that was a relief after all the iamabouttodie piety when i visited him the time before he must think he has more time to make his peace with the lord well we can use another knightproctor i must go over and see him tomorrow morning and get him used to the idea oh no von gherens shook his head when hes up hes coming to run alternate bodyguard shifts with me erik ordered it and now that we know the mad icelander is alive out there do you really think any of us are going to take a chance on him coming back and finding out we didnt do exactly what he said taki looked at the boy looked at the silver on the battered table looked back at the boy he could easily be one of takis usual crew curly black hair olive skin old clothes bare feet short but broad of shoulder taki looked at the silver again there was quite a lot of it but taki could count a tablefull of coins with a single glance finally deciding he nodded and reached for it the youngster put his hand over the coins not so fast captain one quarter when i get to your boat one quarter when i get over there and one half when you give erik a note i write for you when im safe taki eyed the man called erik a scary one that nothing would get past himand nothing would stop him if he felt the need to do something except maybe death and taki wouldnt bet on that how do i know he will give me the money spiro chuckled taki take it from me the case vecchie isnt trying to cheat you he just doesnt trust your ugly face taki did his best to look affronted me you can trust me ask anyone he bellowed gesturing theatrically except about the freshness of his fish said one of men in the tavern with a gaptoothed grin the taverns occupants laughed taki scowled and waved a fist vaguely you want to lose some more teeth adoni spiro shook his head hes all right benito one of the best skippers on the island even if his fish he ducked benito grinned im not that fond of fish anyway ah but do you like cheap wine grinned the gaptoothed one i only know one person who is fonder of it snorted erik he shook his head dubiously studying taki and his crew i think i should ration all of you between the lot of you youll end up sailing off to vinland instead of across the strait of otranto i sail best when im drunk insisted taki belligerently at least he thinks he does said kosti has he ever tried it any other way asked benito this fishingboats crew were beginning to give him a pleasant feeling of nostalgia for his days as a rooftop thief they were as crazy as valentina and claudia had been in the early days kosti shook his head not so as anyone has ever noticed but to be fair he hasnt sunk us yet lets hope he can keep that up benito put the silver back in his pouch when and where do i see you captain tomorrow night well have to go and fetch the old boat and get her round here but theres a cove a couple of miles beyond paleokastritsa we can lie up in if you dont know the coast it doesnt look like its there at all we should be there sometime before tomorrow and well sail on the windrise after dark spiro can get one of the local kids to guide you over there weve got a fishing boat to get off an island and weve got to get over to the islet said kosti suddenly glum yanis boat is still underwater i suppose the captain grinned evilly and slapped him on the back and guess who is going to be swimming out there trudging up the hill carrying alessia maria felt ill at ease about her destination in the background she could hear emeric of hungarys cannon pounding away at the outer wall reminding her that things werent normal but that wasnt what was making her nervous she was going to the governors palace in the castel a mar the castel a mar was not nearly as grandiose as the doges palace in venice but it was somehow more intimidating as imposing as it was the doges palace in venice had been the property of the people of venice by sheer familiarity the guards at the gates also thought she didnt belong here they barred her way with their pikes you cant go in here woman his excellency only has public audiences on wednesdays come back then the guard who spoke looked at her without much interest his tone of voice more bored than anything else i dont want to see his excellency i want to speak to prince manfred he will see me the guard snorted and no doubt youve brought his baby with you go on with you get lost maybe shes a teutonic knight in disguise said the other chuckling at his own wit she reined in her temper and remained polite cant you send a message to him tell him maria verrier would like to see him please she hated her own voice so subservientbut angering them wouldnt get her anywhere hark at her one of the guards jerked a disdainful thumb at maria please listen dearie we dont run a messenger service for scuolo women to have chats with princes hell send for you if he wants you maria flushed with anger and was just considering whether it would be worth the consequences of pushing her dagger through his ear when the guards suddenly jerked themselves out of the slouch and came to attention the frail whitehaired podestas wife was coming down for all the attention that contessa renate de belmondo paid the guards they might as well have been statues except one does not nod to statues she did however greet maria with every sign of pleasure maria verrier is it not have you come for our little chat i am so sorry i have to go across to the garrison in the castel a terra right now would you mind coming in and waiting for me maria realized that marcos efforts on her behalf had borne fruit after all she did her best to curtsey which as shed never been taught and she had a baby in her arms was not a success but lady renate was real quality certainly as far as maria was concerned and ignored the awkwardness such things were only important to case vecchie curti new money that still had to try to establish how important they were for the lady renates of the world it wasnt important how you lookedmoney could buy looksit was what you were lady renate smiled i see youve brought your baby up too i wish i could see my own grandchildren or lodovico montescue trying to be a good greatgrandfather ha mind you hooligans usually turn out to be very strict with their offspring but it is impossible to think that he might be a greatgrandfather soon she touched alessias cheek gently so soft i love them when theyre this age she smiled again what i love most of course is that you can give them back when they cry actually milady i came up to see prince manfred about a friend to be honest i hadnt come to see you at all lady renate pulled a severe face with just trace of a betraying dimple in her lined cheek and why not me hmm young men have as a rule no liking for babies they dont know how to hold them maria blushed i was embarrassed to come and see you milady im just a scuolo wife lady renate shook a finger at her and a friend of my old flames granddaughter close enough a friend to have stood as her maid of honor at her wedding that is an honor for anyone for it means the casa montescue holds you in very high esteem as ancient a house as there is in venice and if lodovico thought i was good enough for him then you must be good enough to keep me company come up and see meand soon what about wednesday just after terce maria settled for a halfbow rather than trying to curtsey again thank you milady i will come lady renate laughed youd better i look forward to it and now i must run the women from kerkira have come in a delegation to see the captaingeneral i shall go and prevent bloodshed she waved and walked out no escort said the one guard disapprovingly and not riding the other shrugged there isnt a person in corfu who would dare hurt her and riding makes her sore these days he nodded to maria i made a mistake come on ill take you up to the princes quarters myself you wont report us will you maria tempered the sharpness of her retort with just enough amusement to let them know that she wasnt really joking not this time but next time ill pull your bottom lip over your ears and dont tempt me to show you how it is done you came that close she showed a gnatsized gap with her fingers the guard chuckled if they had women in the army youd make a good sergeant major sorry signora verrier ill pass the word around so you dont end up stretching too many lips around here you tell them to watch cheeking the scoulo people she warned him weve got short tempers and long memories the guard led her up through the castle around enough passages and up and down enough staircases that she was thoroughly lost before finally knocking on an ornate door who is it asked a womans voice maria knew that voice well enough to answer before the guard could its me francesca maria the door opened immediately and the guard ushered maria and alessia into a sybaritically appointed chamber vanishing prudently and closing the door behind them as soon as they were well inside manfred was sprawled on a heavy oaken settle grinning cheerfully we dont know a whole lot he said without waiting for the question i was going to come and tell you later that erik signaled that he was ashore and he had found his svanhild i imagine benito is all right he was born to be hanged said maria trying to hide her relief maria must have squeezed alessia the baby woke and objected to being treated like a bundle maria had the interesting experience of seeing the normally imperturbable aquitainian woman look decidedly alarmed as an indignant squall arose from the wrappings is something wrong with her francesca asked uneasily maria rocked and bounced alessia made a few more pointed remarks about her cavalier treatment shes fine good francesca shook her head im not really maternal i dont like babies much im afraid manfred grinned theyre not infectious francesca he pointed at maria come on maria advance on her lets see if francesca will retreat into the bedroom to escape ive been trying to tempt her back there all morning i never thought of herding her francesca was recovering her composure possibly because alessia hiccupped and decided that she had registered enough complaints for the moment manfred babies hold no interest for me for excellent reasons she began counting off on elegant fingers you cannot have an intelligent conversation with them they are utterly and selfishly demanding of all of your time and energy regardless of war peace or any other considerations youah never mind she shrugged not all women love babies legends notwithstanding im one of the ones who doesnt manfred stood up i wont hold it against you i must admit im not too keen on them myself maybe one day but certainly not yet francesca chucked him under the chin i cant tell you how relieved this makes me maria said nothing she knew that talking to people who didnt have children about the subject was a waste of their time and her effort besides it was hardly her business to go around urging parenthood on people she certainly couldnt see francesca with children and truth to tell at one time shed thought she would not like to have any herself instead she decided to bring up something else that had been nagging away under the worry about benito shed heard about it from umberto and now had it refreshed by lady de belmondo the food rations even though they were barely into the siege were already causing unrest i met the podestas wife at the gate a delegation of women from the town is going to see the captaingeneral she said she was going to keep the peace maria looked sidelong at francesca from what kat told me you collect information maybe you already know all about this but there is a problem about food francesca smiled i trade in gossip yes i did know about the food i didnt know about the podestas wife there is something of distance between me and respectable women they dont like to be seen talking to me but tell me more id like a female handle on what is happening out there lady de belmondo is different she talks to anyone and everyone talks to her the guards at the gate said she can go anywhere without fear and lodovico montescue was one of her suitors when she was young the old dog probably made up to half the women in venice said manfred lazily if the stories ive heard are anything to judge by he was worse than i was he raised an eyebrow at maria worse even than benito anyway ill leave you women to chatter im going across to see falkenberg and then ill go and look at what emeric is doing in the way of siege preparations i need to keep an eye on that not without von gherens said francesca sternly i promised him i wouldnt let you go out without him and i wont let you break my promises manfred grunted all right ill collect my babysitter hell be pacing the hallway anyway he went out blowing a kiss to francesca when the door latch had clicked closed behind him francesca turned again to maria im glad you brought this up i had wanted to come and talk to you about it anyway she paused for a moment as if gathering her thoughts i need to set up a network of contacts manfred and the knights worry about what emerics army is doing out there i worry about what is going on in here in the few days since the siege began ive established that the citadel is overripe for internal troubles which i think are more dangerous than the external army this food story is just one aspect i wanted to ask for your help this place has limits as far as access is concerned maria laughed a little bitterly you have no idea you might not be considered respectable by the ranking women but there isnt a man in this place who would dare to stop you from going anywhere you wanted to getting in here for me was quite difficult i scarcely dare think how the ordinary corfiote would be treated yes and the problems in the citadel i think will mostly come from the corfiote citizens who are excluded francesca frowned then focused intently on maria i need people out there who can tell me what is going on i need a place for them to meet me that wont attract attention ive some gold and some favors to offer to them maria looked at her thoughtfully can you get out of here without drawing attention because if you can i must introduce you to my friend stella mavroukis maria smiled she can talk the hind legs off two donkeys but she knows everyone shes been here for years and she speaks greek francescas eyes brightened with interest she sounds ideal when can you organize this tomorrow afternoon alessia stirred in marias arms but now i must go or you will get an experience of babies you wont enjoy francesca was quick about showing her to the door chapter the rocks in the paling predawn were just visible by the lacing of foam around them the wind was blowing spray off the water leaving the descent greasy the stony surface compared well to mossy pantiles in the rain but it was steeper than any selfrespecting roof would be benito decided the young shepherd guiding him had a great future in housebreaking if he should need it coming closer benito could now see that the rocks were twisted shattered and sharpedged even in this poor light that anyone would bring even a dingy in here let alone a thirtyfivefoot lateenrigged fishing boat seemed like insanity yet there she was snugged up beside a huge boulder someone was busy attaching a bush to her mast the only bit that stuck out above the rock benito whistled kosti nearly ended up in the cove he dropped the bush now see what you made me do he said grumpily how do i get across theres a ledge of rocks over there time it right and you wont get too wet benito paid off the guide rolled his trousers up and walked into the surge the water was cold and the mussels underfoot were sharp he walked forward cautiously his cityborn imagination putting sharks and giant octopi in the dark water encountering seaweed nearly had him into the deeper water with a shriek however he reached the fishing smacks mooring without any ncidents he pulled up onto the rock and stepped into her the smell nearly knocked him back ashore where is the skipper where ill be in a minute said kosti finishing tying the bush to the masthead just as the first rays of sunlight hit the mountain above them under the sail asleep the sail had been made into a crude tent and through the long hot spring day the crew slept after an hour or so benito grew tired of the heat and the flies and waded back onto the shore and slept under a pine tree he could see the open sea from here and waking during the day he saw several patrolling dalmatian galliots but they didnt come close enough to the dangerouslooking rocks to spot the fishing boat even a land patrol would have to come very close to the edge of the nearvertical vegetation and crumbling limestone cliff to see her the tough part was going to be avoiding being seen that night once they were at sea the two men were overly well dressed for paleokastritsa they approached the table in the taverna diffidently milord weve heard a rumor that you came out of the citadel erik looked them over cautiously the clothes on closer inspection had once been fine but showed signs of very hard wearing erik doubted that the hungarians would have gotten around to using spies or informers yet why do you ask the older of the two the one with the neatly trimmed beard with hints of salt and pepper in the blackness said grimly milord were both venetians who have estates here or i should say used to have our families have been killed and our homes burned we want to know what is happening we want the republics armies to sweep these hungarian bastards into the sea weve scouted along the ridgelines all we can see is that the citadel is under siege there arent that many men attacking i just want to kill the bastards said the younger one morosely his pudgy neat hands forming themselves into fists erik pushed his chair back what i can tell you is that emeric has landed many more men as for when the venetian republics relief forces will be here he shrugged that is anyones guess i believe word has been sent but whether it got through or not i cant tell you of course emerics dalmatian pirates will try to stop the messages so it may take a long time months at the very least the younger man said i told you so ambrosino im going back out to kill a few of the bastards in eriks assessment the young man would probably die the first time he encountered a real soldier the older man patted him on the shoulder forgive him milord he lost his wife and their newborn son pardon us for intruding on you erik took a deep breath if he was going to organize resistance to hungarians he had to start somewhere this unlikely looking material was as good as any the younger man was going to get himself killed anyway in his fury and grief let him at least put them to some use sit down it was a command not a request both men looked at him in some surprise so did the vinlanders but the two sat if you go out there you may kill a croat or a hungarian or two however if you really wish to hurt emeric and his troops youre going to have to be more methodical about it emeric has plenty more croat troopers but if you destroy his cannons or burn his supply dumps then not only will you hurt him far more badly you will save the lives of others the young man shook his head stubbornly i just want to kill the bastards youll only die quickly without achieving anything erik gave him a measuring look and allowed a touch of scorn to come into it the young man detected that scorn and reddened you arent a fighter you arent a soldier you certainly arent a mercenary who by nature is the toughest and cruelest sort of soldier your fancy duelingmaster wont have taught you a single thing that will work in a fight against these bastards and what you dont know will get you killed the first time you run up against one is that what you want or would you rather make emeric pay fiftyfold for what hes done the young man was scarlet by now but he raised his chin defiantly i want him to pay a hundredfold never mind fiftyfold but im not scared of dying then either learn to be said erik grimly or go somewhere else i have no space in my troop for foolhardy men your troop erik nodded i came out here for three purposes he saw no reason to blather in public about his feelings for svanhild and certainly not benitos secret mission never mind the first two the third acting on prince manfreds behalf was to recruit men and engage emeric of hungarys forces in call it irregular warfare the kind of fighting we do in vinland i want to bleed emeric whitedraw off some of his forces from their attack on the citadel and make keeping the citadel under siege a battle on two fronts i want to make it as expensive as possible for him to be here but i cant do that without men who are as interested in keeping their own skins intact as they are in killing emerics men i dont need heroes i need men who can be as cunning as foxes and hard to catch as weasels are you with me i am said a firm voice from an unexpected quarter thalia spoke quietly but clearly i am if i can save one other life thats enough if hurting this king will avenge my georgio then even if i am a woman i will fight what kind of men will not the plumper young man nodded looking at thalia in some surprise suddenly with no warning he began to cry deep bitter sobs hes upset said the older man but hell be an asset milord giulianos father was a masteratarms when he retired here he married a local girl and they had one chick flavio lozza gave his son oneonone training from the day he could hold a sword he smiled i think flavio was secretly disappointed that the boy only wanted to grow olives and play the lute lozzas son erik reflected that appearances could deceive flavio lozza had been giuliano dellartas instructor giuliano had taught both manfred and him when theyd been in venice with the knights of the holy trinitys illfated tour with the wodencasket he had regarded lozza as the father of rapierwork flavio it would seem had named his son for his old protegeand this was certainly the last place erik would have expected to see the son of flavio lozza almost he regretted what hed said about fancy swordmasters but not quite it was one thing to be a master of rapierwork it was quite another to face mercenaries and magyar horsebarbarians whose interest was in killing you quickly not stylishly perhaps the plump boy wouldnt be killed that quickly but there was a large difference between even the besttrained amateur and a battlehardened professional soldier and you signor have you got surprises for me too the older man shrugged not really i hunt i can ride i know the island well and you speak greek the older man shrugged not as well as giuliano he got it from his mother and then his wife was a local and of course we will help too said bjarni slapping him on the back to be direct you are going to watch over svanhild said erik feeling uncomfortable not go running around the corfu hills in the dark if possible id like to get you all a passage across to italy or even greece this is not your war we stand by our kin said bjarni stiffly erik grinned im not exactly that yet the big vinlander grinned back you havent a chance erik hildis made up her mind even if she has to chase you with a baby shell get you bjarni said svanhild blushing its a good thing mama cant hear you but she didnt deny it in fact she gave him a sidelong glance that had speculation in it maybe you can just lend erik three or four of us like me said kari looking eager maybe i can just pay him to take you away growled gulta they hugged the coast with great care creeping southwards no one who didnt know these waters intimately was going to come this close in the darkness it was an alarming place to be sailing at some speed its coming up for a blow said taki ominously so what do we do benito saw a flash of teeth in the darkness we set our nets then we haul them and then we run with the wind were fishermen from levkas whove been blown off course fishermen have fish in their boats so were going to get ourselves some so for the next two hours benito learned to set nets taki is making an extra profit out of your labor said spiro demand wages or a share in the catch youd better hope it is a bad one said kosti or well be here all night when the nets came in twitching with silver and benito saw how taki beamed in the moonlight benito began to realize kosti might not have been joking with wooden crates full of fish they headed away from corfu on a following wind by that time they all looked and smelled like fishermen even benito he was no stranger to hard work not after the way that erik had been drilling him but this required a whole new set of muscles and calluses his hands were raw and cut up and his arms and shoulders ached by the time it was over taki rubbed his hands and produced the wine passing it around to the rest of the crew never let it be said nothing good comes out of a war ive wanted to fish old scathos bank for years but never dared i kept wondering whether the old bastard would still come out and shoot at us said kosti spiro took a pull at the wine what shoot at your handsome face scathos daughters would kill him kosti pulled the jug away from him and handed it to benito i hear thats the reason he wants to kill you me im shocked well you or any other passing fellow those are wild girls of his time to shift those sails taki yelled the boat went about and they sailed on but the direction troubled benito it felt wrong just where are we going he asked taki eventually youre supposed to be running me across to the italian shore taki belched contentedly and i am but wed not get across the straits of otranto in the dark not with this wind so were taking a longer cut at it have some more wine he frowned i dont want to be drunk if we have trouble the captain chuckled what are you going to do if we do have trouble fight a galleys worth of men try and outrun them this is a fishing boat not a galley there is nothing much you can do except try and look like a drunken bum of a fisherman so have some more wine the more like us you look and sound the safer you are the day was still very young and antipaxos some miles to the north of them but still in sight when they were intercepted it was a byzantine galley benito realized as it raced closer just how futile trying to run would have been briefly he thought the galley was simply going to run them down but it drew up beside them the officer on the bow bellowed something in rapid greek benito had the unpleasant realization that his life was in the hands of a bunch of poor people he didnt know very well who would be well rewarded for selling him out and who would be killed if they were caught harboring him worst of all he didnt understand what they were saying he resolved to learn greek if he got out of here alive with his heart pounding his mouth dry spiro heard the greek officer yell what are you doing out here were fishermen said taki what do you think were on our way back home to levkas we got caught up in the blow last night and came too far north stand by to be boarded a dozen or so marines boarded the boat the case vecchie did his best iamapoorscaredfisherman look it wasnt hard to do the scared bit spiro realized but he rapidly realized what a genius taki had been to insist on catching fish last night the fish under damped sacks were still cool and freshthe most convincing evidence possible that this was indeed nothing more than a fishing boat the officer with the marines looked aboutobviously searching for refugees or maybe arms supplies valuables there were few places anyone could hide so it was a very cursory look the nets the boxes of fish the small crew all said fishing boat why did you come so far north he demanded orders went to all the villages that no one was to fish within sight of antipaxos taki cringed my lord in the dark we drifted too far we didnt mean to the byzantine officer hit him sending him sprawling across the fish fool by the smell of you i think you drank too much to celebrate the catch it wasnt the wind that got you here it was the wine if we find you this far north again well sink you do you understand taki on his knees now nodded furiously yes milord it wont happen again his voice quavered it had better not the officer pointed to two of the marines here you two take one of these boxes we could use some fresh fish milord my fish protested taki consider it a fine for breaking the law said the officer and think how lucky you are not to have your filthy little vessel sunk taki did the grovel magnificently thank you milord but can i at least have my box back im a poor fisherman milord the officer laughed no the galley receded the apparently hardworking crew of the fishing boat started to laugh and laugh prissyassed malakas taki blew a raspberry at the departing ship and then grinned at benito youre my witness case vecchie they boarded my ship in the venetian republics waters stole my fish andworst of allstole venetian property benito looked suitably mystified venetian property the fish box it belongs to the fish market in kerkira it is the property of the republic of venicewhich is what that prim little official at the fish market tells me every time i come in property of venice and he took it the crew started to laugh again piracy thats what it was said spiro trying to keep a straight face passing over a jug of wine benito took a swig and nodded sagely well swear out a charge against them in front of the podesta and let him have the ambassador summoned for a severe reprimand and a demand for reparations especially for the valuable catch said kosti the idiots chose a box of trash fish so when do we turn and run across the straits to bari or brindisi asked benito taki raised an eyebrow were not going to run across the strait there they have twentyfive lousy little leagues to patrol but they cant patrol the whole ionian sea youre in for a haul boy i hope you dont get seasick easily emeric looked with satisfaction at the bluish haze of gunpowder smoke blowing gently across the channel the fortyeightpound bombards took a huge amount of powder and a long time to load but they were his second choice for reducing and penetrating the walls of a besieged fortress evening was drawing in but the bombardment would not stop for that his first choice was treachery months before the assault on corfu he had begun to prepare the ground for it far better than the captaingeneral he already knew the number of corfiote refugees within the walls of the citadel he knew how much food there was in their garrisons storehouse and he was already getting daily reports from fianelli he knew a great deal about the likes and weaknesses of the various officers too one of the things that had made emeric so sure corfu would be an easy conquest was the past history of the captaingeneral true enough the man was not corrupt but he was a vain and incompetent fool his handling of the insurrection in the venetian enclave in trebizond had been so bad that it had gotten him sent to a station where there would never again be a need for military action he was a bungler but a bungler with political connections in the venetian republic a bungler whose godfather is the doge could go far unfortunately for captaingeneral tomaselli there was a new doge the garrison commander on the other hand was a disaster from emerics point of view commander leopoldo would have to die emeric had bought several of the soldiers within the forces at the commanders disposal most of the troops serving the venetian republic were mercenaries for sale to the highest bidder it was just unfortunate that they did not have a mercenary commanding officer so commander leopoldo would have to be assassinated when he was engaged in some firefightbest to do it unobtrusively emeric went back into his tent and drew the circle scratched the pentacle and began the ritual that would allow him to speak to the chief of his spies within the citadel at this time of day fianelli would be in his cellar waiting part vii june ad chapter francesca shook her head to be honest with you eberhard this place is positively venetian with intrigue there is a strong probyzantine faction of long standing among the libri doro not surprising of course since corfus local aristocracy are greeks themselves fortunately they distrust emeric of hungary but they long for venice to lose power and for their own stars to be ascendant under alexius eberhard snorted that wastrel would be more likely to sell their precious island to pay off some of his debts or just to have more money to spend on his vices precisely francesca agreed nodding but not having the knowledge that you do ritter the probyzantines here entertain some very unrealistic ideas so far as they know alexius is cut from the same cloth as his father which would make them byzantine allies rather than vassals and most importantly would put corfiotesor at least greeksback in the seats of power here they resent the way the venetian overlords here on the island often treat them its the sneering really not anything material but noblemenespecially sorry idle ones like most of these wretched libri dorotake offense easily and how well placed are they to act on those unrealistic ideas asked manfred looking concerned ive known people to be prepared to die for some really stupid things i am still compiling a list manfred but so far they have some bodyguards and some interesting working positions manfred nodded frowning one thing in our favor is that the hungarians are present in such force nobody not even the most selfdeceiving probyzantine libri doro can believe that emeric is going to give up this prize so easily eberhard shook his head selfdeception is the greatest strength of such people manfred petty noblemen with neither work nor war to keep them occupied will often spend all their time wallowing in perceived insults and fantasies of retribution true said francesca but emerics vicious reputation does work against him so long as it does not appear that alexius is allied with him in this venture we may be able to keep the faction quiet quieter anyway manfred poured another cup of wine i never thought id be pleased to hear that emeric was such a murderous treacherous son of a bitch so who else do we have stacked against us a prohungarian faction fortunately emerics reputation works for him there tooor rather works for us there is however a montagnard faction that believes you have come to take over the island under the pretext of this war and are very much in favor of the notion francesca dimpled of course there are a few who also think it is true but are opposed to the idea and i have found evidence that someone is buying information that suggests emeric has some spies here in the citadel eberhard had been staring at her with more and more astonishment as she spoke and now his mouth was actually agape how do you find all this out francesca he asked in disbelief among other things maria introduced me to the main artery of gossip in the citadel sooner or later everything gets told to stella francescas smile faded and turned to a frown she also told me another thing i must discuss with eneko lopez she says there is a cabal of true magicians here and they are not christian manfred chuckled sleepy little seaside town eh in the living quarters which sibling eleni had provided for them adjoining the chapel eneko lopez was scowling there francisagain did you sense it and you diego both men nodded someone is using satanic magic in this citadel muttered diego that was fairly close although i couldnt sense the direction and that one a sending ritual requires blood most satanic rituals do francis eneko shook his head at least that one doesnt require human blood thats not my point eneko were under siege soon enough finding a goat or chicken to slaughter isnt going to be so easy lopez thought about it for a moment true we should speak to francesca unless i miss my guess shell be running the counterespionage work here before much longer the podesta is an old man and the captaingeneral is well not competent so charitable eneko chuckled francis i would have used a stronger expression lopez smiled thinly well charity is a christian virtue diego didnt seem to share in the humor finding a stray goat or a chicken will be getting hard but with thousands of people packed into this place finding a human to slaughter wont eneko and francis stared at him diego shrugged i would remind you that charity is not a satanic virtue wed best talk to francesca about that as well murmured francis although gloomily lopez finished the thought how do you keep track of people to see if any are disappearingwhen half the people in this citadel are here illegally to begin with thanks to that jackass tomaselli charity eneko charity cautioned francis i am being charitable grumbled lopez not to jackasses through the open door of the taverna in paleokastritsa erik could see that the sky across the straits of otranto was traced with clouds the color of salmonflesh the closer view was even more distracting to him neither svanhilds profile nor the memory of salmon in the icefed rivers of home were helping erik with the matter in hand planning an irregular campaign against emerics forces essentially we need two things we need information and we need safe bases whats wrong with paleokastritsa erik shook his head its defenses are good but not that good itll fall eventually either to a determined assault or more likely to siege there is no second way out of the town and we think like foxes now foxes always need a second or third exit to their lairs well rely on friendly towns and peasants for food and informationbut never from the same one twice in a row and well never stay in any of the settlements if we bring the wrath of the hungarians down on any corfiote town not only will we have betrayed them we will have betrayed ourselves well get no more help from the peasants he looked at the faces around the table no one disagreed you all know what the hungarians are going to do every time we strike theyll destroy the nearest village if it shows any signs of our presence the peasants are in hiding now but theyll have to return to their holdings soon farms and crops dont wait we need the countryside sympathetic to us and hostile to the hungarians ambrosino nodded it makes sense well there is a spot i used to use when i was hunting not a village for three miles youve got an excellent view of the surrounding countryside there is water in the cave and there are two ravines leading away therell be a bit of grazing down in the ravines too i thought of building a huntingbox up there but it was just too expensive to get the materials up there are wild boar and bears up there good hunting and ive eaten worse than bear well check it out tomorrow said erik we also need to organize proper scouting of emerics forces well put you in at that fishing village said taki pointing to the italian shore the locals are at sea by the looks of it so we wont have to try and explain that were not stealing their fish as if we would said spiro virtuously unless we got half the chance snorted kosti i thought we might visit a decentsize harbor and taste the local girls and meet the local wine you mean meet the girls and taste the wine corrected taki kosti shook his head grinning i prefer it my way around benito realized he was going to miss these fishermen he was going to miss being at sea where all the responsibility devolved on taki now hed have to manage for himself and it was a long way home to venice he had written up the prearranged message for erik it would pass as a bill of fishmarket landings the bonito on the listing would tell erik to hand over the money benito now felt guilty hed done his dangerous bit but taki spiro and kosti would have to get back through the cordon before they saw the paltry bit of silver the only trouble was short of the jewelsall he had was paltry bits of silver himself likely if we go to one of the big ports therell be questions asked wed end up having to pay port fees taki sounded as if hed rather have his teeth drawn the idea seemed to horrify the others too spiro shook his head besides kosti we need to get home there is a war over there and weve got people to look out for your mother my sisterand you watch your mouth about my sister wouldnt say a word not while youre listening anyway spiro took a swing at him on general principles so benito climbed off the boat and onto the italian shore with no more than his clothes and the three fishermens good wishes in his ears after several days at sea the ground seemed to be moving up and down he turned and waved takis ratty old boat was already moving out to sea at a fair clip benito turned his face to the shore and his more immediate problems he was now faced with the problem of where exactly to go it was midmorning and he was outside a tiny little whitewashed fishing village near the toe of the boot that is italy originally someone maybe erik had said he should ride up the coast to venice that was before erik had seen him ride also well it seemed very easy when discussing it with people like erik who knew how to do this sort of thing get to italy and ride to venice the first question in a spot like this would be ride on what by the looks of the fishing settlement even a donkey would be wildly optimistic maybe he should follow the course of the cowardly capitano selvi and head for the tyrrhenian sea then travel up the west coat of italy the immediate question was should he cut across the calabrian apenninesor remain along the coastline the mountains looked threatening unfamiliar in the distance up there he could see a hilltop villageother than that the area was forested with the forest only being interrupted by patches of what could be vines and white rock a lot of white rock it all looked very big and daunting he saw an urchin from the fishing hamletcalling five tiny houses a village was gross flatteryapproaching cautiously ready to run curiosity overwhelming obvious fear he looked at benito as if he expected him to sprout wings and horns or at very least large teeth maybe thirty yards back were three others of still younger age all peering bigeyed nervous but fascinated by this strange apparition it didnt look like the village saw a lot of strangers benito waved at the kid who was at the outside six years old the older boys would be at sea he supposed ciao he said the kid backed off two steps then realized benito wasnt following and that ciao was not really a threat he said ciao back and was rewarded with a smile from benito and then the kid let go with such a rapid fire of local patois that benito managed to understand one word in ten some of the words sounded like greek spiro had said there were a fair number of greek settlers here whoa benito spoke slowly and pronounced his words with care i want to buy food i want to ask directions he still had to say it twice the fishwife in her peasant blacks was a little more intelligible slightly she was just as curious benito didnt see the point in too much secrecy there is a blockade on the straits of otranto im from up north and i want to go home so i scrounged a voyage over here where is the nearest big town and can you spare some food for me i can pay he pulled out a copper penny guessing that even these didnt arrive too often in a place like this the smile and the haste with which she produced some rosso wine cipudazzilittle red onions pickled in olive oil and vinegarand tiny spiky artichokes told him he was dead right she bustled off to bring him some fresh bread and some maccu a broad bean and fennel puree also some fresh figs it was a repast he was sure would have been the familys main meal benito hoped the husband would bring home a good catch the peasant woman with the children peering around her skirts was less useful about the nearest town catanzaro it is great city it has more than this many streets she held up a hand of workcalloused fingers but it is far perhaps thirty miles away up a ravine we go there with the dried fish every autumn for the festival of saint gamina or there is reggio di calabria in the straits of messina but that is a huge place and so far i have never been there my man once went there to sell fish but he was cheated and never went back a town that had a reputation for cheating rural fisherman sounded good to benito he might at least be able to find a ship and also be able to sell a jewel in such a placeneither of which he knew hed be able to do in a small rural hamlet how far is this place oh it must be seventy miles your honor a vast distance almost unthinkable once confined to venice it would have seemed so to benito himself after his meal benito set off walking it was slower than riding but it seemed to be the only real option by midafternoon he was very aware of just how soft his feet had become he cut himself a sturdy stick which didnt seem to help a great deal leaving the fishing hamlet hed struck a trail it seemed unpopulated and determined to take him away from the coastline eventually another track joined it but it was equally lacking in traffic he was beginning to wonder where he could sleep that night when he caught sight of the hind end of a donkey disappearing around the next bend circumstances thought benito wryly as he hurried to catch up with the donkey change your perspective hed never ever have thought hed be glad to see the tail end of a donkey the donkey was part of a string of seven laden with gurgling oilsheengleaming ticklike skinbottles it was being led by a fellow who looked more than a little like a donkey himself the oilman produced a thing that was somewhere between a knife and a sword and wellsupplied with rust what do you want he demanded suspiciously benito repeated his story it didnt seem to convince the oilman at all you stay behind me im not having you tell bandits im coming saints look any selfrespecting bandit would kill you in about ten seconds all i want is some information and im not moving at less than donkey speed just to oblige you stay back or ill make you into sliced salami the oil seller waved his knife about at benitos nose look i can pay benito pulled out what hed thought was a copper im happy to pay the oilmans eyes lit up give it to me he waved the knife at benito benito looked at his hand and realized he had silver and not copper there ill give you a copper penny for your help i need this the oilman lunged benito used the stout stick hed cut to hit the mans elbow hard the clumsy knife went flying benito grabbed him a nasty short scuffle ensued ending with the oilman pinioned under benito and shrieking help bandits murder benito swatted the oilmans ear reflecting as he did so that erik had taught him very well even in such a short timespan shut up you tried to rob me you idiot now get up and stop yowling i dropped my silver penny because of you if you dont find it for me ill kick your ass through your teeth now get up i cant youre sitting on me benito stood up the oilman on his knees looked for the silver fortunately it was easy to find nervously the oilman handed it over pick up that cheesecutter of yours the oilman gaped at benito but picked up his knife nowi need know where i can sleep tonight and does this track lead back to the coast i want to get to reggio di calabria the oilman bowed your honor no one goes down to the coast well only a few very poor fishermen the barbary coast pirates raid it and it is full of malaria but this track joins another track which leads to cantonia maybe a mile away there is road from there you can follow on to reggio di calabria right well i think we go on together otherwise youll come to this cantonia place claiming ive robbed you the oilman did his best not to look as oily as his wares your honor i would never do that im an honest man the sight of my only piece of silver seemed to change that said benito grimly they walked on at donkey pace at length they came to the walled town the oilman held out his hand give me the copper you owe me for guiding you where are the two coppers you promised me for helping you with the donkeys demanded benito very loudly for the benefit of at least a dozen local residents give it to me or i will swear out a charge against you with the podesta i never promised you yes you did cheat thief the oilman gaped but you benito turned to the interested locals this man promised me money i have worked and now he wants to cheat me one of the women sniggered the podesta is in montaforte and if you can get money out of that old skinflint without a knife against his throat you will have managed something no one else can do she eyed benito speculatively though there is no knowing what a handsome man could do especially with you bella said one of the onlookers she snorted and flounced her hips for benitos benefit benito threw up his hands im a peaceful man and i was coming this way anyway is there a taverna where i could buy a glass of wine to get the smell of donkeys out of my nostrils i can show you the taverna said bella archly benito shook his head ruefully looking at her swaying walk certain kinds of trouble you can get rid of others follow you around hed be leaving very very early the next morning predawn found him heading very quietly off down the trail for reggio di calabria evening found him there as cities went it was a small one after the backcountry benito found it busy bustling and comfortingly familiar and so we came to corfu maria took a sip of some of the finest wine shed ever tasted the whitehaired contessa renate de belmondo wife of the podesta of corfu smiled she was one of those people who smiled to their eyes and the fine creases in her skin bore testimony to the fact that she smiled often on the lace cloth between them on a silver salver lay some delicate almond biscotti maria marveled at them marveled at where she was marveled at the fact that she had just finished telling a case vecchie ladya case vecchielongi lady born bred and raisedmore about her life than shed ever told anyone there was something motherly about this woman marias mother hadnt been motherly shed been a working woman whod done her best to look after her daughter but she hadnt had any time to spare for cuddling and comforting their lives had been hard marias as well as her mothers maria suspected that her mother had made the decision to ensure that her daughter learned early that life was hard and would always be francesca had helped and advised maria but she wouldnt choose the word motherly to describe her either maria smiled to herself francesca ferreted out information she manipulated charmed sometimes lied through her teeth but she showed no signs of being motherly but the contessa got you to volunteer it if francesca could get her as well as stella to provide information there would be very little in the entire confined world that was corfu great and small that she couldnt find out but somehow maria knew that renate de belmondo was the perfect listener because she wouldnt ever tell anyone what shed heard most people used conversation to talk about themselves renate de belmondo volunteered little she just listened the conversation shifted to babies and here the contessa did offer something about herself my children were all born here on corfu i tried earlier in venice oh i tried and i tried but it was only here that i finally got pregnant she smiled mysteriously its a very fertile place corfu chapter from the shelter of the pines high up on the slope eriks small force watched and waited erik now had seventeen men some venetian settlers some locals with grudges and kari and his two brothers they were about a mile and half south of the citadel above the oilstore that emerics men had taken over as their storage depot the huge fortyeightpound bombards took a lot of powder and it had to be stored somewhere a safe distance from the battlefront there were some forty serb pikemen doing guardshifts and ten croat light cavalry riding patrols the worst of emerics forces erik suspected probably a punishment duty for the croats as most of their comrades were still looting among properties that had not yet been picked over the cavalry patrols consisted of going to a nearby village and sifting through the ruins for anything that even looked like loot or sleeping the guards at the gunpowder magazine looked unseasoned and already looked bored they were certainly lackadaisical about the patrols around their new palisade erik and kari had crept within twenty yards from here erik could see facial expressions and if hed been able to speak serbian could have eavesdropped erik studied the guards their positions and their camp then they leopardcrawled back to the pines giuliano had a surprise for them there a shepherd boy who had come upon the group had been hastily seized and persuaded they werent going to kill him in fact he could profit by telling them about the hungarian magazine he says there is a place at the back where the stones prevented them from digging the logs in there are some small gaps he has crawled in and stolen some things erik sighed now kari will have to moan about how this crawling is ruining his breeches again wed better go and have a looksee kari snorted and examined his knees rubbing the material i wouldnt say no to a decent set of buckskins these werent meant for this work this is almost too easy erik we go in this hole cut a few throats and set fire to it erik shook his head when that lot blows well i want to be at least a halfmile away and traveling we might go in that way but were going to have to get out fast that means by the gate and onto a horse as quickly as possible king emeric had been modeling things again he pointed now to the model of the citadel of corfu to the channel between it and the mainland how is the progress with the moles going count dragorvich the stocky count emerics chief siegemaster rubbed his chin reflectively if we worked on one at a time i could have one done in three weeks but the twopronged approach means progress is slower maybe five weeks the channel is quite deep and were under heavy bombardment the mine is not going to work for now your majesty water comes in as fast as we can take it out with a bucketchain and the diggers are not even at sea level yet the ground is still saturated from the winter rains summers only begun ill get the guns to focus on the south and north towers said emeric thats where their guns are firing onto the moles from well leave off pounding the gate and the rest of the walls for a while an officer came hastily out of the dark and into the kings pavilion once there he stood rigidly before the king emeric acknowledged the magyar cavalry commander with a curt nod ah colonel how go things with sacking of the venetian estates any resistance the colonel sneered these venetians are soft sire there have been a few minor bits of fighting but weve barely lost men a couple of croats who were where they werent supposed to be a checkpoint guard but other than that nothing much youve taken appropriate retribution for these incidents i trust sire the problem is on whom the peasants have hidden out in the hills weve caught some of course but most of them just arent there and the men havent left those theyve caught in one piece as for the venetians most of them have been killed anyway so sire the problem is there is no one to extract retribution from there are few walled towns we havent bothered with but anything we can get to has been dealt with hard already emeric pursed his lips looking thoughtful i think it is time to stop using the sword on peasants colonel its time for the knout instead we need someone to work the land here pass the instruction to your men hunt the maquis round them up put them to work there is no need to be gentle however and any resistance still gets the sword or make an example of one of them on a sharpened stake yes sire in the darkness erik sucked in his breath and squeezed his body forward through the gap a tenyearold shepherd might fit through it easily enough a hundredandninetypound icelander was a different matter altogether he pushed forward someone grabbed him by the hair got you you thieving bastard said the grabber hey boys ive got him erik was in an awkward situation one arm was still trapped in the gap between the two logs his tomahawk and knife were on the wrong side of the barrier clawing upwards with one hand he managed to grab his assailant by the shirt front and hauled let go something smashed against eriks ear suddenly the hand grasping his hair went slack the man erik was holding by the shirtfront flopped toward him pulling himself forward and rolling over erik saw kari jump off the palisade land in front of him and retrieve his knife from the mans back and a guard came running up the guard saw kari his fallen companion but not erik erik snagged the newcomers ankle as he rushed at kari with a spear thrust that would have spitted the young vinlander like a pigeon the result of eriks intervention was that he polevaulted on the spear to land in a crumpled heap at karis feet the vinlander leaned over and hit the guard with calculated force on the back of the head erik had by this stage struggled free wait he whispered to the others just through the hole grabbing a victim each kari and he hastily dragged them into the deep shadows no more guards came so after waiting perhaps a hundred heartbeats erik called the rest through thalia came first you were supposed to stay with the horses there is work to be done she said with a grim intensity hands on her hips but still holding a knife on corfu women work i am here to do it ive cut a pigs throat and i dont see the difference between this filth and a pig except that pigs are better erik saw no point in a standup argument besides as hed learned on the vinland frontier a determined woman can be a lot more deadly than a reluctant male warrior what happened whispered the plump giuliano after theyd popped him out of the hole like a cork from a bottle of petillant wine that young shepherd wasnt as undetected as he thought erik whispered grimly the guards had set a trap for him fortunately they were expecting a small young thief and not for kari to pop over the top of the palisade anyway move out they still outnumber us shortly they no longer did it was brutal murderous work but as erik reflected their enemies choices were stark die quickly at the hands of the corfiote guerillas die when this magazine blew or die slowly at emerics hands for failing him the corfiote guerillas couldnt keep prisoners and the alternative to killing the enemy was to fail in their objective erik didnt plan to fail after this emerics forces would be wary and successes would be much more hardwon they had to start big because if theyd started with raids on outposts theyd never have gotten to a big target like this but he didnt like killing sleeping guards either it was too much like butchery the trickiest phase was the last one the magazine was not a place anyone would want to strike a lucifer in and they had no access to wicks before erik set the long powdertrail they took sixteen small casks of powder one per horse and loaded them up then all but erik left quietly there was the barrack encampment not two hundred yards off with sleeping croats and the rest of the guard detachment one galloping horse could not be avoided but at least there didnt have to be seventeen of them the gate was arranged with a spike holding the bar up and a stout cord that could be tossed over the top of the gate erik could pull it when he was outside and drop the bar even if someone heard the horse gallop past and came to investigate the palisade they would have to climb it to get in hopefully by that time the powder trail would have burned to the open cask erik laid the trail of black gunpowder carefully wishing he had a better sense of how fast the stuff burned he was experienced enough with firearms but this kind of work really needed a bombardier who knew exactly what he was doing he laid it right to the gate lit it it fizzed briefly and went out he took a deep breath forcing himself to be calm then went back and laid a second more generous trail lit it again it burned burned fastfizzing and racing toward the dark buildings after an instants horrified pause a voice within him shrieked gogogo the icelander stepped out closed the gate his fingers shaking a little as he tugged the bar into place and pulled his horses halter loose erik flung himself into the saddle and urged the horse to a gallop he might break the horses knees doing such a reckless thinghe might break his own neckbut this was still a lesser risk than staying around he heard a shout and a shot in the darkness he just kept his head down and applied the spurs and then he didnt have to anymore he just had to stay on the horse he certainly couldnt have heard any commands to stop manfred and von gherens were up on the battlements of the inner curtain wall looking out at the muzzleflashes and campfires on the kerkira side of the citadel so for the first time since his injury was falkenberg two moles falkenberg shook his head disapprovingly this is emeric interfering with his commanders again he has the notion that he is a military genius thank god for a small mercy said von gherens we could have someone who didnt sit on his brains out there and then wed be between the hammer and the anvil manfred snorted instead we have a commander in here who sits on his brains the commander of the garrison is not too bad said falkenberg a likeable young fellow if not very experienced the captaingeneral thats who i was referring to interrupted manfred sourly do you know what he wanted to do this morning hush said von gherens nudging manfred captaingeneral tomaselli had just come up onto the battlements he bowed to manfred prince manfred the guard told me you were up here the tone was suspicious manfred waved a hand in greeting we were having a look at the disposition of the enemys cannon and their camps he said pacifically pointing out at the muzzle flashes in the darkness the captaingeneral didnt even give it a glance there is not much we can do about the position of the enemys cannon or their camps it seems a poor reason to be out in the night air so late would you like to come and take a glass of wine with my wife and me instead manfred stood on von gherenss foot he wished erik were here to stand on falkenbergs besides missing eriks company manfred had come to realize that the bluntspoken icelander was a marvel of tact compared to either of the two prussians who guarded him now he was spared falkenbergs comments by an interruption off to the south of the citadel the sky was suddenly lit up moments later the flash was followed by a thunderous boom that seemed to keep rolling over them holy mother of god what was that the captaingenerals eyes were wide i think that used to be their magazine said von gherens hakkonsens work or im a castrato sicilian said falkenberg grinning in the moonlight thats no accident that is that mad icelander of yours prince manfred manfred slapped his two bodyguards on the back i hope youre right typical erik hes got his girl and now hes done more to hurt emerics siege cannon than ten cavalry charges could achieve i just hope he didnt blow himself to glory saints that was a huge explosion you know what is happening out there tomaselli looked totally nonplussed weve got a knight out there raising native resistance to emeric said falkenberg with obvious satisfaction thatll be his work tomaselli shook his head but but you did not ask my permission to do so i am in charge of military operations on this possession of the republic of venice you cannot take these steps without advising me prince manfred under his breath manfred swore at himself for easing his vigilance over his tongue in front of this insecure ass his happiness at seeing signs of eriks handiwork had made him forget himself he stood on von gherenss foot again unfortunately the knight was landed before we were able to consult with you captaingeneral actually it would have been impossible to keep him herehe has a woman out thereso we just ensured he got out as safely as he could to tell you the truth i thought hed probably be still hunting herbut evidently she was somewhere safe and now he has nothing else to occupy him manfred shook his head as if he regretted what he had to say in reality he was doing it to hide the shaking of his shoulders with repressed laughter hes a headstrong fellow with a very powerful idea of his duty which includes doing all in his power to oppose emeric im afraid hes taken the bit in his teethindependent action which i certainly didnt orderand since there is no way to get beyond the walls now im unfortunately not able to communicate with him what was this about a woman trust the fool to concentrate on the single irrelevant piece of information he had an attachment to a vinlander lass that was here on corfu we landed him early to see if he could find her i think we should go back to our quarters now grumbled von gherens i dont think you should go and drink the captaingenerals wine youve had enough already you keep standing on my toes from up here they could see all the way to the gulf and even beyond to epirus the thin bronzed scytheblade of moon rose from somewhere over mainland greece as erik sat with svanhild looking out into the starsalted heavens their fingers barely touched but erik was intensely conscious of the warmth of those fingers the tintinnabulation in his ears could still be from the explosion he supposed then svanhild turned her head and smiled at him the stars overhead reflected in her eyes and he knew that it wasnt it was the sound of his own heart francesca cocked her head sideways so why are two moles not better than one it would seem logical to me does one never use more than one mole i seem to recall that more than one mole was used in the siege of acre yes falkenberg assumed an oratorical stance it does depend heavily on the position the number of forces at your disposal and the ability of the defenders and the attackers to provide sufficient artillery cover for instance if the defenders cannot split their resources and you have plenty of munitions and manpower the more moles the better but a mole is no small task under fire emeric no doubt thinks he will pincer any attempt to sally from the main gate and attack or destroy his moles here howeverwell there are sally ports on the northern and southern sides and emeric has relatively few men for such a siege making concerted use of both moles would be difficult once his forces are on this side of the channel theyre directly below the walls either they must get inside those walls fast or theyre going to be killed easily from the wall tops emeric will need to provide his troops with heavy covering fire just to get them across the mole and for that he needs more cannon than hes gotand lighter cannon those fortyeightpound bombards are so inaccurate theyre as likely to kill his own men if he tries to use them for that purpose falkenberg was now pacing back and forth slowly like a lecturer weve been counting his lighter field pieces he hasnt got what i would judge was enough for a worthwhile twopronged assault which means hes going to have to rely on arquebus fire which in turn means hell have to build forward revetments or trenches on the spianadathat open area in front of the fortressand those will be under the citadels guns that in turn will take a substantial number of his men out of the attack force which in turn stop stop said francesca laughingly enough ill never dare question falkenbergs military assessment again even if hes wrong said von gherens sitting and rubbing his foot it is easier to go ahead do it his way and die if need be rather than listen to him explain it all to you he swiveled his head transferring the sour gaze onto manfred prince ive met lighter carthorses than you i understand since you explained it me that you want me to keep my mouth shut when you stand on my toes but my toes would certainly prefer it if you just said shut up von gherens ill cough said manfred or can i stand on falkenbergs toes for you my love he seems to have stopped anyway falkenberg rubbed the scars above the empty eye socket i was just getting into my stride he grumbled i wish young benito was back here that boy had a positive talent for understanding siegecraft reminds me of me i started younger than he was you know i think you were born in armor which must have made it damned uncomfortable on your mother manfred replied hes riding for venice by now to make this siege a thing of the past i hope so said francesca grimly i think this fortress is far more likely to fall from within than from the effects of one two or even three moles chapter sophia started when she saw the back of nicos head above the chair usually her husband was in bed by now not sitting in the salon they slept in wellseparated rooms and he was seldom in hers these days fortunately shed already removed her cloak so she quietly dropped it on the floor behind a settleit would be difficult to explain why shed been outside at this hourthen gave herself a quick inspection the dress she wore was unremarkable enough what was under it wasnt but then she had no intent of letting him or anyone else see that her maids had been dismissed already she was getting quite good at undressing without them good evening my dear she said casually the captaingeneral swiveled his head looking equally surprised to see her he had obviously been so deep in thought he had not even heard her entering the room probably been thinking of something really complicated like what hed had for supper sophia had no high opinion of nicos brainpower but then what woman wants an intelligent husband anyway a husband with money power prestige and prospects was more important lately shed begun to realize that he had less of all of them than shed thought he smiled rather abstractedly at her what are you doing up at this time of night sophia i might just ask you the same question husband she said archly gliding toward him he yawned ive given orders that the guard are to call me when this prince goes wandering about i dont trust him hes undermining my authority among the men that wont be hard sophia thought sarcastically her trafficking with the guards who let her in and out of the fortress unofficially and for small bribes had given her an insight into his real prestige but all she said was and with an enquiring tilt of the head i was called to say he was up on the inner battlements he looked furious in the petty way of a child the fellow just happened to be there when a huge explosion went off behind enemy lines and he says he knew nothing about what his man there was planning ha he rose came over and put his arm around her so what are you doing up sophia dangerous moment the truth i sneaked out of the fortress to see a satanist with whom i sacrificed a black cockerel and then he painted fertility sigils around my nipples and vagina before i performed certain acts on him with my mouth and then later on myself with a polished piece of vineroot in a pentacle pointed with black candles was not going to be well received i heard the explosion she hadnt noticed it but he plainly had i was worried so i dressed and came looking for you its fine dear he said patting her reassuringly just some saboteurs attacking the hungarians best to distract him its so comforting that youre in control she murmured leaning into him youre so manly she felt his chest swell under her hands yes theres nothing for you to worry about his own hands were starting to wander sophia stroked his chest calculating for a moment her cloak was dropped just in front of the cabinet in which the brandy decanter stood she certainly didnt want him going that way for a nightcap no help for it then she successfully managed to lead him to her bedroom she blew out the candles in the fancy girandole making everything dark since there was no way to remove the insignia now the painted sigils felt hot and so did she for the first time in at least two years she actually enjoyed sex with her husband not the sex itselfnico was as clumsy and oafish in bed as the cavalry captain querinibut what surrounded it the knowledge of her duplicity her sin inflamed her afterwards as they lay in the warm darkness she realized she could take further advantage of the nowrare moment so why are you so suspicious of this prince he could further your career her husband snorted he seeks to ruin it more likely he is close friends with petro dorma you know my father was a close friend of the late doge and also with ricardo brunelli who was seen as the dogeinwaiting casa dormas ascension has been a severe blow to us the prince controls a sizable cavalry force but the knights will not take orders from anyone but him hes refused to hand them over to me refused in the politest way but refused nonetheless and hes meddling in the defense of the citadel he patted her derriere anyway why am i boring you with all this politics eh some things it is best a woman doesnt know you dont trust me she pouted tracing patterns on his chest the sigil ogerda which master morando had told her was the sign for control hed also asked her for inside news on the siege she was determined to find out something for him of course i trust you dear but it is quite confidential youre teasing me she started teasing him quite a bit more physically dont stop his voice sounded somewhat breathless only if you stop keeping all these secrets from me very well if you go on well you remember the princes bodyguard erik hakkonsen handsome blond worriedlooking as handsome as me of course not go on to encourage him she began applying some of the new skills morando was teaching her her husband gasped a little then the prince lied to me about the icelander being landed before they came here i remember him and now he has somehow left the citadel and started a campaign in the countryside trying to rally some of the peasants silly business war should be left to regular soldiers not mules pretending to be men but whats even worse is thattomasellis voice grew heavy with indignation as well as passion he sneaked out of here without my permission didnt even consult me hes out there with that snotty vinlander woman who tried to come and stay here in the citadel really this erik broke out after the siege started a likely story he must be in league with the hungarians i wouldnt be in the least surprised to find this prince in league with them too the way he openly consorts with that woman of his rumor has it she was a cortegiana no morals at all by now her husbands mind was addled enough by what sophia was doing not to find anything amiss in the utterly illogical conclusions his wife was advancing sophia filled her mouth again just to keep from laughing addling nico tomasellis mind was not much of a challenge yes mistress i think all is going well the image of countess bartholdy floating over the bloodbowl frowned a little make sure it doesnt go too well bianca i want this siege to drag on and on itll take months of frustration before emeric will finally be willing to come to me for help i understand mistress casarini hesitated then decided that risking bartholdys immediate displeasure was less dangerous than risking eventual failure but it would help meconsiderablyif i had some better idea of what you are specifically seeking the frown on the countesss face deepened bianca grew tense elizabeth bartholdy was less concerned than bianca herself with the way in which grimaces could over centuries and millennia permanently distort her face but she was not oblivious to the problem to see such a frown on her face was frightening to anyone who really knew her thankfully the frown eased replaced by that silvery little laugh very well i suppose i have kept you a bit too much in the dark you neednt concern yourself with my final goal bianca but lets just say that i need to inveigle my greatgreatnephew to release some magics on the island which will advance my purposes in order for that to happen however he will need to leave the siege and come visit me in my castle near the carpathians immediately bianca understood the point emeric of hungary was one of those kings who insisted on meddling with the military details of his campaignsmuch to his officers despair and often enough grisly punishment it would not be easy to get him to leave the siege in order to make the long journey from corfu to the carpathians a long siege then stretching through the summer and autumn and well into the winter bianca had no control of course over the military side of the matter although at a certain point mistress it may be necessary to have captaingeneral tomaselli removed hes such an incompetent commander that with him in chargeconstantly interfering ratherit may be impossible to prevent emeric from simply taking the citadel by force before winter comes the defense would be far stronger if it was fully in the hands of the garrison commander leopoldoespecially with prince manfred and his knights here they seem to get along well with commander leopoldo elizabeth pondered her words for a moment true but keep in mind the opposite risk i do also want corfu to fall to my greatgreatnephew eventually she cocked her head slightly you understand that if the military defense is capable enough everything will eventually depend on treachery well treachery combined with what i will unleash on corfu i will provide the magicsbut will you be able when the time comes to provide the treason this was no time for hesitation bianca nodded firmly yes mistress i will see to it then the image of the countess began to fade within seconds it was gone for the next hour or so after cleaning up all signs of the ritual bianca sat in her room simply thinking shed gambled making her claim to the countess and now she had to make good on it by the end shed reached two conclusions one pleasant one not shed already reached the tentative conclusion anyway once the siege began that shed have to have her uncle and aunt killed sooner or later it was already cumbersome the way she had to sneak around and keep her activities a secret from them over time the needs of her work would be impossible to hide from people living in the same houseespecially the assignations shed have to begin with one of fianellis men that was the pleasant conclusion betraying those who had given you their trust was always enjoyable to biancanot to mention spiritually profitable casarini like her mistress hoped to cheat satan out of her soul but doing so required emulating the great one in all respects she was already doing quite well in that regard she thought killing her relatives would enhance her progress further she began considering the ways to accomplish that but then guided by years of rigorous selfdiscipline put the matter aside in order to ponder the other conclusion not pleasant that one for some years now sex had stopped being anything for bianca casarini other than a means to an end still eventually she was going to have to betray fianelli also and the surest way to do that was to form a liaison with one of fianellis three chief goons between the pleasures of her body and the lure of taking his bosss place bianca was confident she could manage it paulo saluzzo she decided that wont be so bad at least hes florentine and takes a bath more than once a week the next day bianca began both projects at midday by wearing a rather provocative gown when she went to meet paulo saluzzo in order to pass on further information to his boss fianelli bianca was normally careful to wear nothing but modest attire whenever she met fianelli or any of his goons saluzzo noticedimmediatelybut was suave enough to do nothing more than give her a fairly subtle ogle and a leer that could charitably be called a friendly smile bianca did not return the smile moving too quickly would make saluzzo suspicious he was florentine after all this needed some finesse in any event bianca was in no hurry and make sure you stress to fianelli that we need to start setting up a sacrificial lamb she said sternly that whore of the princesthe one who calls herself de chevreuseshes a canny one my informants tell me shes already more or less running the citadels countertreason work theres no way she wont spot something sooner or later when that time comes we need to have made sure that someone elses head goes on the block saluzzo grunted the sound was mildly sarcastic dont teach doubledealing to doubledealers signorina casarini fianellis already got the man picked out and zanaris starting to work on him nachellis his name hes a smalltime loan shark and rent collector too greedy for his own good well cut him in on just enough to make him visible without letting him know enough to lead anyone to us bianca had her doubts how could you cut someone in without the man knowing your own identity but fianelli was direct after all and not squeamish in the least presumably when the time came he would see to it that the venetian authorities would be trying to interrogate a corpse shed leave that to fianelli and his thugs bianca had her own plans for getting rid of them when the time came theyd be her sacrificial lambs just as this nachelli would be theirs she left the hidden alley where her meetings with saluzzo took place they couldnt afford to be spotted so the meetings were always very brief on her way past him she felt saluzzos fingers brushing her hip but it was a tentative thing more in the way of an automatic reflex to the gown and what it suggested than anything serious saluzzo was not actually stupid and he would understand as well as she did that there was no safe place for them to pursue any affair they might be able to find a place hidden from public eyes to be sure but theyd also have to keep it hidden from fianelliand that would be a lot more difficult the knowledge would frustrate saluzzo and for weeks to come good after she arranged the killing of her relatives saluzzo would be that much more eager to pursue bianca now that she had a house of her own in which to meet him when shed arrived on corfu the year before bianca had brought several large pieces of luggage with her there were secret compartments in two of those valises where she kept her grimoires hidden along with her magical tools and ingredients after pleading a headache to her aunt and uncle she spent the afternoon in her room studying the texts by nightfall shed decided on the method she would use it required the blood of innocents of courseand no mere animal blood not for that ritual bianca rose and put away the grimoires then moved to the window in her room looking down she could see the narrow street of the citadel which her room overlooked as always these dayseven in this relatively prosperous area of the fortress set aside for venetiansthe street swarmed with people children many of them and most of those beggars a little boy perhaps five years old looked up at her window and gave her a big smile it was a beggars smile seeking aid from the fine lady not all that innocent to be sure not with that trace of calculation which had no business on the face of a fiveyearold but hed do bianca smiled back very sweetly tomorrow shed start giving him food quite a bit in fact that ritual required fat as well as blood chapter first things first benito decided when he arrived in reggio di calabria he still had two silver pennieshed told that rogue of an oil trader he only had one to avoid trouble hed need money but right now immediately if not sooner he needed food he found a very respectablelooking taverna next to the quay plainly not a seamans place but aimed at the clerks and minor merchants who worked down there it was a bit above his present guise but the bouquet drifting out of the doorway was pure temptation benito had never been very good at resisting that kind of temptation or most any other for that matter he went in looked around the crowded room for a seat and finally took his place at the end of one of the benches the clerkly type next to him gave him an opaque glance but at least he didnt pull in the skirts of his coat the waiter looked rather doubtfully at benito you have money he asked the tone was carefully neutral as likely as not given the proximity to the quay occasional sailors fresh off a ship and with their pockets full came this way benito nodded the waiter took a quick glance toward the kitchens and then whispered to benito i shouldnt say this but my brothers a seafaring man the prices here are skyhigh the foods good so long as you dont touch the pork but there is a cheaper place down the quay the food is lousy but its cheap benito grinned at the fellow and winked well this time ill go with the good food with skyhigh prices will two silver cover it and a jug of wine it was foolishness to spend down to the reserves but benito felt in need of a bit of foolishness finding a fence in a strange seaport was going to be a challenge the waiter nodded si ill see you get the best and he was scurrying off to the kitchen benito had timed his arrival well he hadnt been sitting for more than a few minutes when the locals came in mostly benito noted middleaged or elderly men who took the needs of the stomach seriously by the looks of them the waiter appeared from the smoky kitchen sooner than benito had expected not that his empty stomach was going to complain the man seemed bent on proving that besides being a waiter in a skyhighpriced taverna he had all the skills of a juggler he carried a carafe of wine a bowl of breadrings a platter of chargrilled baby octopus redolent of thyme and garlic with just a hint of bay leaf a jug of extra sauce and some olive oil and vinegar he brought a plate of melanzane alla finitese next the crumbed aubergine slices bursting with hot melted cheese eat up the cook gets upset if you arent ready for the swordfish the minute it arrives and do you need more wine the fish when it came was worth suffering a fussy cook for the succulent flesh scented with bergamot capers and oregano was the kind of dish whereby gastronomes set their standards somehow outside of this meal the thoughts of finding a fence seemed far less threatening maybe it was the carafe of wine from the local greco di bianco grapes they were a great improvement on the stuff he had drunk with taki spiro and kosti feeling full and almost somnolent benito parted with his silver and as a welldeserved tip for the waiter the rest of his coppers he then went out looking for an alley in which to get mugged it seemed like a good idea at the time it had occurred to him if he wanted to find a fence ask a thief finding a thief just took some bait benito hoped he would get a solitary operator and that he was able to avoid getting hurt first and robbed after not that the mugger was going to be very pleased with the state of benitos pouch well that made two of them benito wasnt very comfortable about its flatness himself a little later someone did oblige him very professionally the thief stepped out of the shadows put an arm around benitos neck and a knife against his kidneys dont try and turn around just give us the pouch and youll stay alive with a calm that belied his racing heart benito untied the pouch and held it out drop it you might want to look in it before i do that why asked the mugger suspiciously whats in it absolutely nothing not even a copper penny damn liar the mugger swung him around youre loaded you ate at old fornos give the money belt benito lifted his shirt to show skin there isnt one i spent it all every last penny the mugger gaped wha he never got any further than that he found hed been neatly disarmed and now faced his own knife and benitos shetland blade benito shook his head never let yourself get distracted my friend the mugger showed both courage and a sense of humor well i havent got any money either his eyes darted looking for escape benito flipped the muggers knife over and held it out hilt first to the man you can have it back im not interested in your money all i want is some information if you wanted to sell something ah with ownership claims other than yours where would you go who is buying the mugger took the knife warily not sheathing it di scala hes the only bigtime buyer in town follow the quay to the end theres an alley there its up the stairs in the third last house thanks the mugger shook his head watch him laddie hes bent which was about the worst thing a thief could ever say about a fence di scala looked like an underfed vulture the fence shaded his hooded eyes with a skeletally thin hand its a fake he pronounced shaking his head a good fake but a fake ill give you a florin for it he took a golden coin from his desk and pushed it toward benito its no sale said benito grimly the ruby was worth at the very least thirty ducats a coin whose greater purity made it more valuable than the florin the fence tapped his long fingers the sale is not up for negotiation the faintest of sounds made benito realize that they were no longer alone that fingertapping on the desk had been more than just a mannerism he glanced back the two men who had come in behind him had that heavyset look of brutality common to all enforcers between the two of them there was enough flesh to make three of benito with a fourth not being that far off one of them cracked his knuckles you called boss the fence nodded this fellow will be leaving now with or without his money but without this he held up the ruby benito considered his options which werent good the sleazy little room offered him no space to maneuver and the rentathugs coming to grab his elbows were distinctly better than average right now he reminded himself his primary task was to get to venice as fast as he possibly could ill take my money he whined cringing out of the corner of his eye he saw the bully boys relaxing not unready to hurt and possibly maim but not expecting any resistance he could take them resolutely he put the thought aside and reached gingerly for the florin its not fair he complained hangdog looking at the coin di scala laughed sardonically and how you came by the loot was of course benito hunched his shoulders still more it was my grandmothers yes very likely now get lost i wont bring you any more stuff i will sob myself to sleep tonight sniffed di scala you arent from round here anyway thats enough money for you to waste on wine and whores youre lucky i dont let the boys just drop you over the wharf with a couple of weights on your feetand if you dont get out of here thats just what i will do get benito got theres no need to push he snarled at the thugs on the rickety stair he was rewarded by a buffet and them grabbing his pouch they took the florin reposed there kicked him out to sprawl in an alley and threw his empty pouch after him the alley was narrow slippery and reeking with ordure he got up and staggered away theatrically waving a fist at the laughing pair theyd have laughed less if theyd seen him round the corner and then grease up a drainage pipe before they were back inside benito was lying in the shelter of a chimney pot just behind the shady lip of an eave of a house beyond watching without money he wasnt going anywhere anyway hed allowed himself to get careless rusty overconfident he still had one jewel but if he sold it anywhere in this town news was bound to get out and theyd be looking for him besides hed discovered that he had an extreme dislike of being robbed it occurred to him with somewhat wry amusement that some of his own victims over the years might have felt just as angry there was a kind of justice in it he supposed but he needed money to get to venice corfu needed help maria needed that help so did that kid of hers he waited and watched a fences busiest hours would be toward early morningthis rogue wasnt going anywhere as the night wore on hed just get more careful benito had no money and nothing else to do after all he steeled himselfas hed done often enough above the canals of venice in years pastto ignore hunger cold and tiredness at least this time hunger wasnt part of the equation that excellent meal was still enough with him that his stomach was happy but not so much as to slow him down eventually di scala and his two thugs appeared on the street moving surely and silently across the roofs benito trailed the fence back to di scalas own house that was where the fence would keep his stash he was sure the two thugs followed di scala into the house then a few minutes later they emerged and headed off to wherever they slept themselves as soon as they were gone benito came out of hiding and swung into position hanging like a bat from the eaves he watched the fence through a shuttercrack in his bedroom the man unlocked his cassone opened up a cunningly disguised compartment in its lid and secreted some coin into it and an item of what was probably jewelry smiling to himself benito found a rooftop corner rolled himself into a ball and slept by midday he was back at his post he watched the fence leave as soon as darkness provided cover benito began slipping tiles from the roof as quietly as possible then he eased planks from the ceiling with the shetland knife it was proving a good strong tool not exactly a ferrara main gauche but a workingmans ideal knife lightly benito dropped into the fences bedroom he made no attempt to force the lock on the cassoneit would be a good one besides the hidden compartment probably had a booby trap instead he set to work with the knife on the board making up the back edge being careful not to move the cassone itself that might have unpleasant consequences thered been a case like that back in venice the thief had lost his hands his sight and because he was caught in the screaming aftermath his life benito was not planning to chance imitating him he cut a neat slot through the solid wood and then tipped the cassone it wasnt the most effective way of getting money out but benito was rewarded by a succession of coins and bits and pieces he put them all hastily into his pouch before leaving the way hed come as neat a job as hed ever done and as welldeserved a one as hed ever pulled thought benito quietly slipping out onto the roof but as valentina had taught himin what seemed a lifetime awaythe job wasnt done until you were clean away benito had done his homework two boats carrying fresh produce for the market in messina left long before first light from reggio di calabria to have the crisp wares unloaded and in the market by dawn this morning they took an uninvited fresh thief as well as their fresh vegetables he had the grace to get off quietly on the messina quayside carry a load of carrots to the waiting wagon and even to steal only one carrot it was fairly woody but munching at the purple root as he went in search of a taverna benito found it remarkably pleasant sweet and tasty even his nose led him to a panetteria where stevedores were already buying hot ciabatta before going on to a stall where a butcher was selling liver and tripe ragout from a steaming pot at a copper a dip of the loaf benito felt in his pouch he hadnt really investigated what his loot was yet what his fingers encountered was roundbut not money he stepped into a noisome alley to check it out he had to laugh what hed assumed was money was valuable all right it just wasnt currency or saleable except by priests he had acquired some fifteen golden hypatian medals four pilgrim medals also golden struck in jerusalem engraved with the pilgrims name some twentythree pieces of silver of some foreign origina coin hed never seen beforeand a ruby his ruby well there was some justice in the world chapter despite his hunger and tiredness benito set off in search of a hypatian chapel he would just drop the medals in the poor box or leave them in the font or something he found the chapel all right this time luck wasnt with him he slipped in quietly only to have a sibling emerge from the counseling booth as he approached the font can i help you my son she asked gently are you in need of counseling benito took in the small round serious face of the woman in the pale hypatian robe liked the quiet calm in her eyes and decided to chance honesty ive brought something that was stolen from the church back to it he pulled out the golden hypatian medals the sibling looked looked again her eyes widening then took a deep breath god be thanked we have prayed for their return may god forgive you for stealing them i am so glad your conscience has made you bring them back to us a reasonable conclusion for her to have come to but he decided he wasnt going to let it go actually i came upon them by accident the little sibling looked sternly at him we are not going to prosecute you young man there is no need to lie to us god knows the truth anyway he snorted well then he knows i am telling he truth i have just come over from reggio di calabria on the vegetable boats ive never been here in my life before she looked doubtful but there was a crack in the doubt after all he didnt have the local accent he laughed which put another crack in her doubt ill swear to it my hand on the bible or believe what you please he shrugged i suppose i did steal them but not from the church i took them from a fence in reggio di calabria after hed robbed me of my own property i got my own back and i got these as well then it occurred to him that he had yet another card to play and i got some other things id like to see go to their rightful owners they were headed for being melted down i guess he produced the jerusalem pilgrim medals theyre worth he felt the weight oh maybe four ducats in raw gold but they were really important to some people theyre named but the names dont mean much to me except for this one of course it was engraved carlo sforza benitos father benito had been astonished when he found it among the others at a guess after his defeat at the hands of duke enrico delleste the wolf of the north must have undertaken a pilgrimage to jerusalem someone had robbed his baggage for the thiefs sake benito hoped sforza had never caught up with him the little sibling gaped at the medals at the name at the scruffy young man holding them out to her hell have traveled incognito id like his medal and the others to get back to their owners i can offer some silver to see that it does benito emptied out his pouch again only keeping back the ruby all of this is stolen all of it is too hot to handle i suspect because it was hidden with the medals ive no idea who it belonged to but i get the feeling it would be best used for the support of those wholl carry these to their owners all i ever wanted was to get my own property back from that he killed the obscenity before it got to his tongue worm who cheated me the sibling shook her head in amazement god moves in mysterious ways she said faintly benito sighed good lady youve no idea just how mysteriously and this time i can only assume he intervened directly and now i am broke hungry and tired youll excuse me but i need to go and do something about all of these things the sibling smiled whatever doubts shed had theyd disappeared the moment that he turned out his pockets well it seems only right that seeing as you have brought our property back to us we provide breakfast and a place to sleep she raised an eyebrow with faint amusement the order has also offered a reward for the return of our property benitos spirits lifted i dont suppose its cash well no the small round face dimpled you must know our order is sworn to poverty but a medal blessed by the holy michael our bishop is worth having in its own right he will be very pleased at the return of the medals we use the sale of them to fund our charitable work and we are sending a delegation to rome in five months time there is to be a convocation of the order to discuss the new chapter houses and cloisters in germany we can use that opportunity to deliver the pilgrim medals to others of the order who will convey them onward to the owners she looked shyly at benito could i know who gods instrument was benito grinned tell sforza it comes back to him with the compliments of benito i think hell know which benito if he thinks hard about it a thought occurred to him sibling i ended up retrieving your stolen property because when i wanted to change a jewel into cash i was assumed to be a professional thief benito hoped he looked suitably horrified at the very idea he stared very pointedly at her actually i have had the same reaction from other people the sibling had the grace to look embarrassed you can speak like a nobleman born but at first you sounded and you look scruffy i have my reasons sister theyre honest enough for father eneko lopez you have heard of him who has not he is already famous in the order a stern man she added a bit doubtfully hes that all right but he is also a good man a pious man certainly my journey has his blessing it was best not to say too much he decided the hypatian sibling might be closedmouthed and as good as one of the choir of angelsbut she might say something inadvertently to the wrong person venice was not popular with the kingdom of naples benito didnt need to spend time in a dungeon because hed had too loose a tongue but to get a passage on a ship i need money she looked faintly alarmed for safety and security i have carried my funds in the shape of jewels theyre easily hidden and theyre easily turned into money he smiled disarmingly except when you look like a thief the sibling looked rather nonplussed by all of this i suppose you are a messenger of some sort a carrier of secrets she also didnt look as if she entirely approved i am something of the sort yes but just because something is secret doesnt mean it has to be evil sister this isnt ill swear that on your hypatian medal if need be it is just politics and i need to sell a ruby is it possible that the siblings could sell it for me after all your order must get gifts you need to dispose of sometimes she looked sternly at him i know this seems ungrateful but i must ask is this jewel truly yours to dispose of benito nodded yes i swear it as god is my witness she held out a hand give it to me i will give it to brother marteno he was once a jeweler before he renounced worldly things and devoted himself to serve christ against his nature but trusting his instincts benito handed over the ruby he still had one more after all the food in the hypatian refectory was not exactly hot murseddu and steaming ciabattabut bread olive oil and sharp goatsmilk cheese at least filled the hole where benito had once kept his stomach and the cell in the monastery was dry and cool letting him sleep deep into the afternoon it was also not exactly where an irate fence would be sending his hirelings looking for a thief but benito found the bells no aid to sleep he was awakened by someone coming into the monks cell theyd assigned him for most of his life benito had slept lightlya thief living on his wits in other peoples property couldnt afford to do otherwise it was better to sleep lightly and uneasily than to snore like a hog and be slaughtered like one since hed left the citadel benitos senses seemed to have honed themselves even more but this time theyd woken him for something harmless it was a small largenosed monk bearing a chinking bag that was an exceptionally good stone young man i have some seventythree ducats for you benito reflected there were some advantages in not selling to a fence the one disadvantage was the embarrassment of riches the little man cleared his throat sister genina has explained to me that you obviously dont want publicity but we have this medal for you it was offered as a reward and it seems fair that you should get it he produced a small silver medallion it is supposed to have a strand of saint arseniuss hair in it and it is blessed by the bishop we cannot claim there is any miraculous great virtue attached to it though it may be of help to a seafarer and will protect and glow if you are exposed to evil magic the little man looked more than a little uncomfortable she um sister genina led me to understand youd recovered our medals in the course of getting your own property back i realize you may not be able to do this but well there are certain church vessels missing too and another four of those medals you couldnt perhaps tell us where to look benitos youthful experience said betray someone to the law not likely on the other hand the fence had already played foul by the thieves code besides any piece of excrement that was low enough to take holy medals deserved whatever he got a fence in reggio di calabria his name is di scala his home is up on the hill big place walls with coppo tiles on top of them he trades from upstairs on the third last house in the alley at the end of the quay his smallah dubious stuff is kept in a secret compartment in the cassone in his room i suggest you have whomever you send take an axe to open it those things have booby traps nine times out of ten and i suggest the order send someone very large and wellarmed actually i suggest you send several someones like that the fence has a couple of big bullies working for him and i doubt all things considered that theyd respect the cloth the slight monk smiled i think not for long down here in the south the order is held in high esteem the people will not allow us to be hurt benito shrugged make sure there are a lot of witnesses around then i got the feeling that this man has no respect for the church either benito left without fanfare that afternoon and went to a respectable dealer in secondhand clothing by the time he walked down to the messina quayside to hunt a dockside tavern for a passage north hed changed from a shagrag sailor into a minor but respectable trader with a plain but serviceable rapier and the shetland knife riding where a main gauche would the weight of the rapier was comfortingly familiar the boots were not comforting or comfortable on feet that had gotten used to being bare againand before that to having boots cut by the finest cobblers in venicebut benito had little choice but to wear them no scruffy seaman would pay for a passage and right now if it meant paying for the whole vessel hed do it he felt time pressing on him he wanted to get through to venice and back to corfu chapter it only took three cups of wine to find a caique heading up the coast in the morning as far as livorno and another cup and five ducats had him installed in a cabin on her it wasnt a big cabin but it had a hammock and a small window benito was resting in the hammock enjoying having his new boots off with the spicy warm evening breeze blowing off the straits and in through the window he was sleptout so he passed the time sharpening the shetland knife and despairing of getting a good edge on the rapier it wasnt a bad weapon really it just wasnt ferrara steel he examined the edge in the candlelight suddenly the door to the cabin was opened so violently it was nearly thrown off its hinges in came the cadaverous di scala and his two thugs there was very little doubt theyd come with murder in mind benito rolled out of the hammock landing on his feet catlike with the rapier in his right and the shetland knife in his left the cabin was narrow and quite full of hammock this did mean that the three were in each others way you thought youd got away with it didnt you you little pizza da merde hissed the fence closing the door behind him nobody does that to me im going to make an example of you cut your cazzo off and shove it down your throat spill your guts and leave you to die slowly take him boys benito grabbed the hammock with a forefinger and slashed the hanging rope with the shetland knife the rope raveled parted as di scalas two pieces of muscle pushed their way forward slightly cautious theyd plainly expected him to have a knife at best and to be the cringing little thief theyd bullied the rapier was unexpected but they werent going to let it stop them they were professionals after all benito flung the hammock at them it was spread by two hardwood batons and therefore the net stayed open the two thugs both had the same handandahalf guardless knives that the rascally oil merchant had had perhaps they were popular here in the south the hammock tangled one of them so benito neatly dealt with the other terminally there was no space for a swing here but a rapier lunge was quite as effective the extra reach made the thugs knife an ineffectual defense the other freed himself of the hammock and pulled the spreaderbaton from it it still wasnt rapierlong but it gave him something to fend off rapier cuts and thrusts with benito balanced on the balls of his feet aware that di scala was fumblingly trying to prime a wheellock pistol lunge twist a slash of the main gauche the remaining thugs handandahalf blade skittered across the floor blood pulsed from the mans wrist benito kicked the knife into the corner behind him nicking his toes the thug his eyes huge in the candlelight dodged back crashing into his master testa di cazzo snarled the fence nearly dropping the gun he pushed the man roughly away back toward benito the wolf was at the surface now both of them were going to die and then benito paused the medallion hed been given was hot against his flesh he settled for neatly flicking the baton out of the hand of the surviving tough and kicking his legs out from under him di scala was trying to aim the pistol his hands now shaking so badly he could barely hold the weapon benito looked scornfully at him here was one who hired his dirty work done even the dead thug was worth two of him he jumped forward planting both feet in the fallen thugs solar plexus the man struggled weakly for breath the fence pressed against the door hed closed pointing the quivering pistol at benito i can put this knife through your eye said benito coldly you on the other hand havent primed that thing properly youll be lucky if it goes off at all its rusty too so its as likely to kill you as me besides you couldnt hit a barn door from inside shaking like that now the boot was truly on the other foot and the fence knew it just let me go please ill give you money ive every intention of letting you go you and your carrion youre taking both the living and the dead one with you but first i need to tell you something with a bare foot he prodded the thug who was struggling to sit up this idiot too you may decide that being dead is easier first i returned those stolen hypatian medals you had to the church and i told them exactly where and from whom i got them they want your guts for garters the thug looked accusingly at his master his face was an unhealthy white and he was still struggling for breath but he managed to gasp you bought ose his tone was one of unadulterated shock theyre just gold you superstitious fool snarled the fence the moment the fence looked at the thug benito stepped forward and knocked the pistol out of his hand he used the flat of the rapier but a couple of di scalas fingers were probably broken di scala shrieked benito held the rapier ready for the thrust i imagine you made sure we wouldnt be interrupted youd better hope we arent because if we are ill kill you now the other reason i wanted to speak to you was to advise a pilgrimage because the only place you might be safe is kneeling in the church of the holy sepulcher praying for forgiveness ive already sent word and his pilgrims medal to carlo sforza i should imagine that he is going to send agents looking for you you really dont want them to find you anywhere else because compared to sforza im a gentle and kindly man sforza the fence stared at him as if he was mad one of those medals that you bought for their gold value was stolen from the wolf of the north benito grinned mirthlessly at the way all of the blood drained from the fences face the scum might not be afraid of the church but he was properly terrified now i think ill leave you with the thought that gold is really worth far less than other things now youll take this dead man between you and precede me onto the deck ive foregone killing you but im going to enjoy kicking you off this boat i hope you can swim he marched them up on deck dragging the corpse between them drop that over the side they did benitos keen eyes noticed movement among the boxes and barrels on the quayside it could be helpers or more likely it could be those whod been told to get out or get hurt hed give them a show whoever it was he remembered what the sibling had said and decided maliciously to make life as difficult as possible for the fence from this moment on hed studied drama enough with valentina to know how to declaim at volume he filled his lungs and began an oration for the benefit of the hidden audience di scala you cur you came here to kill me but i have defeated you with gods help and you and i know that you also bought golden medallions stolen from the churchstolen from the hypatian siblings who would have used the money raised to care for the poor to do christs work see what sort of illfortune follows such wickedness not bad he though benito flicked his rapier forward cutting the fences pouch free he stabbed it as it fell and then using thumb and forefinger from his rapier hand he held it ripped it open and showered coin into the dark water my money squalled the fence benito clucked his tongue sinner some things are worth much more than money with that he applied his foot to the skinny fences little potbelly sending him over the sternrail the thug didnt wait he jumped benito watched them flounder to the shore no one came out of the darkness to help them scramble dripping up the rocks of the quay no one followed them as they left benito looked out at the quay for a while then he sheathed his sword and the shetland knife all right he said you can come out now shamefacedly the sevenman crew came out from behind the stacked cargo where theyd been hiding led by their captain benito noticed another couple of people sneaking away it would be all over the tavernas by morning thought benito knowing how these things worked so much for keeping his passage quiet still with any luck he hadnt betrayed who he was or where he was fromor even where he was headed well how much did he pay you benito said grimly to the captain i should have smelled a rat it was too easy you werent planning on going to livorno were you the captain shook his head we only go to naples signor never been further but word was out to agree to take you wherever you wanted to go benito smiled wryly im getting old and getting soft well captain just how soon do we sail because these parts are going to be very unhealthy for a while you might be wanted for questioning about why you allowed a man with the churchs blessing on him to be attacked on your ship the captain looked about nervously were not supposed to sail at night benito just looked at him then looked at the water you couldnt actually see a corpse there however theres a good breeze said the captain hastily stilo cast us off boy but captain dont argue stilo the seaman did as he was told when he jumped back on board he asked benito is it true about the medals benito nodded the siblings were going over this afternoon to fetch home the rest the seaman took a deep breath di scala is a big man and hes got connections but this time hes gone too far you dont mess around with the hypatians here the people especially the women wont stand for it hed know that if he could get a woman without paying double for her then he snickered actually after this he couldnt get the worst puttana in town for the price of a princes courtesan benito pulled a face besides no matter how big a man you are someone else is always bigger there were some jerusalem pilgrim medals too one of them belonged to a fellow with a reputation big enough to make even princes nervous and when he finds out he sighed having carlo sforza for a father had been the kind of thing that had made a boy wonder about himself sometimes he was finding that to be just as true now that he was a young man i think captain youd be very wise to stay away a long time at least as long as the trip to livorno is going to take you chapter aldo morando approached the secondhand merchant fianelli with a smile i believe ive got some information that might be of interest to you i deal in old clothing and cheap medicines said fianelli disinterestedly not information morando wasnt fooled fianelli didnt want it known that he was the kingpin his underlings did the legwork bought and brought in the information delivered it to the drop point and collected their money from the same but fianelli was less professional than he thought he was morando had been a spy for phillipo maria once in milan now there was a son of a bitch who really understood underhand dealing fianelli was a provincial amateur by comparison aldo morando knew how the money worked too a lake at the top a stream to the next tier and drops to the actual sources well that wasnt how it was going to work here he was going straight to the lake the details of who blew up the magazine out there might just be worth buying but theyd be expensive i dont know what youre talking about morando raised his eyebrows i have a source to the captaingenerals innermost secrets for a price i can let you into them its as simple as that fianelli shrugged and why would i want to know his secrets now do you want to buy or just talk rubbish im not buying im selling morando turned and walked out the next move would be fianellis it wasnt long in coming petros nachelli wasnt a man whom aldo morando would have chosen for a gobetween a short fat glib little man who oozed greasiness and dishonesty in equal proportions the greek was a rent collector for the landed gentry of corfus libri doro cockroaches came higher on the social scale of things spying was a big step up for petros he knocked on aldos door with a smile of false bonhomie on his podgy face ah my friend morando i received a message that you had some merchandise you wished to sell you can entrust me with it ill see you get the best possible price i deal directly or not all nachelli you can tell him that the smile fell away from the pudgy face i was informed that you were either to sell or i was to take it he twitched his head over his shoulder in what he apparently intended for a menacing gesture across the road two of nachellis men were loitering rent collection sometimes required a beating or two morando gave them no more than a glance fianellis three goons were in their own way fairly impressive fellows genuine professional thugs nachellis enforcers on the other hand were about what youd expect from such a lowlife from the looks of the two scrawny fellows they were just some relatives of the rent collector pressed into service here reluctant service from the expressions on their faces theyd be accustomed to bullying longsuffering peasants not someone like morando who had a somewhat scary reputation of his own aldo suspected that a loud boo would send them both packing i think not morando sneered i have taken precautions nachelli his namefianellisand the names of his three errand boys due to go to the podesta the captaingeneral the garrison commander and this newly arrived imperial prince if i disappear so go away and tell the boss i dont deal with intermediaries morando smiled nastily before closing the door and remember that your name is on the list now also aldo morando was in fact delighted by one aspect of fianellis choice the use of nachelli fingered several of the libri dorofamilies whod been enriched by the feudal system the venetians had imposed on the islandand were now conspiring against the republic a potential source of much income for a blackmailer fianelli came to see him after sundown when he left morando went to the flagstone that served as a trapdoor to the satanic cellar and lifted it up bianca casarini emerged from the stairs i still dont understand why you didnt pass the information on to him yourself he grumbled this is a bit dangerous for me bianca nachellis just a toad but fianellicrude as he may beis something else again bianca gave morando her most seductive smile and chucked him under the chin surely youre not afraid of him aldo morando a veteran of milanese skullduggery quaking at the thought of a criminalah not exactly mastermindon a dinky little island in the middle of nowhere irritably though not forcefully he brushed her hand aside and stumped over to the table in the kitchen save the silly manly stuff for someone stupid enough to fall for it bianca he lowered himself into one of the chairs i survived milan by not being foolhardy so please answer the question bianca came over and slid into a chair next to him she took her time about it to consider her answer morando was a charlatan true but it wouldnt pay to forget that he was also considerably brighter than any of the other men she was dealing with on corfu she decided the truthmost of it at leastwould serve best i cant afford to become too closely associated with fianelli myself even more important i cant afford to let him start getting the notion that ive become indispensable to him morando arched a quizzical eyebrow from long habit he did so in a vaguely satanic manner satanic at least as hea charlatan and a fakerthought of the term bianca as it happened had once gotten a glimpse of the great one in her dealings with countess bartholdy so she knew morandos affectation was silly the real satan had no eyebrows nor could he they would have been instantly burnt to a crisp so close to those not eyes whatever they were they were not eyes she shuddered a little remembering morando misinterpreted the shiver fianellis not as bad as all that bianca he chuckled i would have thought youd want to be indispensable to him she shook her head youre misreading him no hes not that badbut he is that sullen fianelli is the kind of man who hates anyone having a hold on him especially a woman if he gets sullen enough hell cut off his nose to spite his face the nose in this instance being me morando looked away thinking for a moment probably true he mused he does remind me a bit of those crazy montagnards in milan even if he hasnt got a speck of political loyalties but yes hes got that somewhat maniacal feel about him i dont think hes entirely sane confident now that she had morando diverted down a safe track bianca pushed ahead he murdered that woman of his you knowhad her murdered anywayand for what she was docile as you could ask for and so dumb she posed no threat to him whatsoever didnt matter at a certain point she irked him a bit why who knows probably asked him to wipe the mud off his feet before entering the kitchen shed just cleaned morando grunted all right what you intend then is to make sure that the information we feed him comes from both of us you feed him stuff from the libri doro i feed him stuff from the venetians and stuff which jibes with each other that way hell think he can play one of us off against the other thatll please his fancyenough you think that he wont start thinking of either of us as a threat to him exactly again he gave her that falsesatanic eyebrow it wasnt all fakery though bianca reminded herself sharply that morando hadnt survived milan without being willing to shed blood himself on occasion just make sure it isnt true bianca the menace in morandos voice was barely under the surface if i start thinking that youre playing me dont be silly why would i do that she didnt try for offended innocencemorando wouldnt believe that for an instantbut simple cold calculation this partnership is proving profitable for both of us besides sooner or laterwere doing our best to make sure it happens after allthe hungarians are going to pour into this place when that happens i have every intention of being on the best possible terms with you she glanced at the flagstone morando following her eyes smiled it will make a nice hideout wont it until the hungarians have sated their bloodlust his eyes moved back to her lingering for an instant on her body simple lust too for such as you mind you bianca i will expect to be entertained while were waiting in the cellar she laughed huskily and have i ever given you grounds for complaint on that score her hand reached out and began stroking his arm now that you bring it up in fact regretfully he shook his head cant sorry not tonight the tomaselli slut is coming over later and shes supposed to bring a friend of hers with her he rolled his eyes i need to save my energy and other stuff bianca laughed again what are you complaining about two women naked squirming all over youmost men would think theyd died and gone to heaven morandos face was sour most men have never copulated with sophia tomaselli in a rut with paint and ointments smeared all over her body and with her groaning what she thinks are words of passion im coming to detest the woman the face grew more sour still god only knows what her friend is like discreetly bianca said nothing she knew what the friend was like as it happened having been the one who steered her to sophia in the first place like sophia ursula monteleone had all the vices and the unpleasant personality of a case vecchie woman moldering in a provincial backwater unlike sophia who was at least physically rather attractive ursula was almost obese and had bad breath some other time then she murmured seductively that was a waste of time with morando but bianca liked to stay in practice at midnight bianca communicated with countess bartholdy unbeknownst to her not five minutes later fianelli used almost exactly the same magical methods to communicate with emeric both mistress and master were pleased at the reports others were not eneko lopez glared out the window of the lodgings he shared with his fellow priests there was nothing to see in the middle of the night except the occasional flashes of cannon fire hearing footsteps enter the room he glanced over his shoulder it was diego and pierre not to his surprise of the four of them francis was the least sensitive to evil auras yes diego and pierre i felt it also it woke me up twiceand with a different flavor to each theyre using the same rituals but following slightly different procedures weve got two satanists or packs of them working in this place yes but why two i wonder one of them will be emerics agent for a certainty who is the other working for it wouldnt be chernobog for his own reasons the demon avoids satanic rituals as carefully as we do lopez shrugged hard to say the dark one penetrates everywhere in this wicked world he slapped the windowsill with exasperation this cursed island it does not really smell like an evil place to me eneko and i amyou may recalla rather accomplished witchsmeller eneko sighed yes i know but whether its evil or not theres something on corfu that impedes all of our own magic he clenched his fist slowly as a man might crush a lemon were that not true we could deal with these satanists easily i could sense that they are skilled enoughone especiallybut not powerful diego cleared his throat two things then the first is that we should let francesca know what we know enekos lips quirked a bit he could guess what the second thing was i agree to the first not that i think shell have any more success than were having i will not agree to the second not yet at any rate he could hear pierres sigh so stubborn eneko this islandwhatever lurks on it ratheris not evil not friendly to us either no but not evil so why not try to form an alliance with with what eneko demanded a formless faceless something about which we know nothing really except that it seems able to absorb all our magic like a sponge absorbs spilled water pierre cleared his throat again for the first time since he and diego had entered the chamber they all used as a common room eneko turned to face both of them squarely the basque priests eyes were perhaps a little wider ah youre right actually we do know something about it it impedes earth magic in particular in particular perhapsexclusively pierre stepped forward to join eneko at the window looking out into the darkness he frowned thoughtfully i admit its hard to prove one way or the other none of us can fly and cannon fire illuminated the night going out on a boat is probably not a practical idea these days the next evening the prevailing northwest windthe maestro it was calledwas blowing hard enough to make the poles of emerics great pavilion tent creak despite their heavy burden the assembled officers carefully did not look at the two corpses swinging from them one of those corpses was that of a purported rebel but the other was that of a former officer in emerics army the man whod been in charge of the magazine that had been sabotagedand there were still vacancies on the other four poles his name is hakkonsen erik hakkonsen said emeric coolly his men had been running around like chickens with their heads cut off since the destruction of the magazine trying to find out who had blown it up it gave him great satisfaction to show them that he could do what they could not hes an icelander a knight of the holy trinity hes prince manfred of brittanys personal bodyguard so you can assume hes an excellent swordsman he stands about six foot two he is lean and athletic broadshouldered he had fine blond straight hair but it is now probably dyed black hes wearing a short dark mungo cotte a gray homespun shirt and tawny woolen breeches one of my agents actually sold him the clothes he is possibly in the company of a blond woman i want either of them the woman will do for bait him i want his head a guard came running in sire sire the camp at patara is on fire i can see it burning emeric and his officers rushed out in the darkness the arc of leaping winddriven flames stood out clearly some of the flames were easily thirty feet high in their ruddy light even from here emeric could see the tents and the tiny stick figures of soldiers fighting the fire get down there shouted the king thats the new shipment that is the horses hay cavalry commanders particularly left at a sprint chapter the remount guards had their attention on the blaze across the inlet stalking them was ludicrously easy thought erik even in the bright moonlight would have been at least except for the horses horses are a lot more wary than men still if the herd guards had noticed then they put those whickers and ear flattening down to the firesmoke eriks five arquebusiers their fire all directed on the guard tower cut loose a moment too early the rest had to rush the last few yards but surprise was still on their side erik didnt waste time on finesse he ran one of the sentries through as the man was attempting to bring his pike to bear a second blow felled another man he halfturned to see how the rest were getting on in horror he saw it was not going so well one of the men was down thalia thrusting wildly at another sentry was nearly skewered the guard had knocked her legs out from under her even if hed missed his pike stroke erik knew hed never get there in time panting giuliano didbut there were three sentries all with pikes facing a single pudgy swordsman and erik was treated to a virtuoso display of bladesmanship erik had been worried about giuliano kari told him that hed hesitated to cut throats in the magazineguard barracks raid now however giuliano had suddenly become transformed from a plump youth into a whiplashfast razor the three prepared ready and with a far greater reach proved no match at all guiliano administered his last coup de grace and gently offered thalia a hand up as if he was at some court function meanwhile the guard tower had fallen eriks men were hastily opening the sheep pens that emerics forces had been using for their spare horses come on yelled kari already mounted cracking a stockmans whip hed found somewhere lets move out let the hungarians chase their own horses through the maquis instead of chasing us it had been one thing to talk and to hate but giuliano had stuck to farming olives wine and no livestock at all because he hated the thought of killing so much as a mouse the magazine raid had been a moment of truth for him when the fellow opened his eyes so terrified it was perhaps fortunate that kari had been there giuliano found himself replaying the blood and the horror on top of the blood and the horror of finding his gentle doeeyed eleni raped and murdered he hadnt slept much since then without a lot of wine before this evening hed been seriously considering taking a pistol and ending it all in fact it had only been their unthinking assumption that he would go along on this expedition that had had him here at all he didnt know how to tell them he didnt want any more of this this killing and then shed fallen hed been close enough to hear her scream hed heard what shed been through from hakkonsen obviously it was still raw in her too her voice was remarkably like elenis something inside him had snapped he hadnt even thought about what he was doing years of papas training reasserted themselves when he helped her to her feet she staggered he caught her and she leaned on him briefly he could feel her trembling and her heartbeat against him racing then she pushed away im sorry master she said peasanttolandowner relationships reasserting themselves i was just so scared so was i he said quietly wed better ride most of the others had already mounted other guards would be coming there was indeed no time to be feeling sorry for himself she must have seen the helpless look on his face follow me i used to live near here giuliano riding just behind her wondered how a peasant girl learned to master a horse like that there were few cavalrymen in the same league up in the dark maquis near a stubby windtwisted aleppo pine she stopped and dismounted what is it i just wanted to collect something this is where georgio and i were hiding her voice cracked slightly giuliano decided hed better dismount too there was a narrow crack at the foot of the pine that shed slipped into giuliano tied his horse and with some difficulty squeezed in after her she lit a rush dip and giuliano could see that her eyes were brimming with tears but she walked resolutely past the bed made up so neatly on the cave floor past the ashes of the tiny fire past the two cook pots and the oil crock she took down a bundle of spidery net that hung from a crossbar that someone had rigged giuliano saw she was holding her lip between her teeth and determinedly not looking left or right her chin quivered slightly she came back to the crack that was the door turned briefly looked at the bed and let out a single strangled sob then she put the rush dip out and without waiting or even seeming to see giuliano scrambled out he was left alone in the darkness he swallowed and pushed into the crack and out into the night she was struggling to mount with the bundle can i hold that for you he asked quietly the peasant girl seemed to see him again for the first time please master hold it here in the middle it was a fibrous bundle and surprisingly heavy what is it he asked as he handed it up to her my birdnet she replied as he mounted hed seen the peasant women casting their nets into the air to catch wild birds before a fowlingpiece of any sort was simply beyond the means of the peasantry but with nimble fingers and a few weights they could catch feathered bounty what for we have money for food she shrugged i cant fight men i could cut their throats like animals when they were asleep but i nearly died tonight because i dont know how to fight but i think a man in a net will not fight well then i can deal with him he took a deep breath ill teach you i should have taught eleni who my wife my beautiful gentle wife they killed her it seemed very necessary to tell all of it they raped her first they killed my son my baby boy i was away at my uncle ambrosinos estate eleni doesnt he swallowed didnt like him so she and little flavio stayed home one of the family retainers brought me word we rode as quickly as we could but georgio and i never had a child she paused you libri doro joke about the peasants always trying to save money with the priest being able to do the wedding and the christening at the same time giuliano felt himself redden hed made the comment himself pregnant brides were almost the norm among the peasantry on his ropa valley estate yes but im not one of the libri doro my uncle is in the golden book though they rode in silence heading for the rendezvous but you are a landowner yes but my father did not approve of the golden book and you lived on the estate and not in town very strange she sounded slightly more at ease but you libri doro dont understand a bride must be pregnant to prove that she can be fertile georgio loved me enough to marry me even though i didnt fall pregnant i had very little dowry because my father died at sea he married me anyway i wanted a child i wanted one so badly for my man but now i am glad i didnt ever have one this is no world for a child there seemed to be no reply to that peasant marriages indeed even most noble marriages had at least an element of commerce about them it had been one of the things that had made him acceptable to elenis family thalias must have been a rare marriage he decided firmly that by the next time this young woman went out seeking repayment for what their enemy had done shed be very capable of getting it hakkonsen had said he wanted two quick immediate successes to draw recruitsand then theyd go to ground for a few weeks and train properly the hungarians would be expecting them after this the cavalry would recapture many of the horsesthose that didnt come home by themselves anywaybut they would be hunting horses for a while besides more horsetracks would muddle tracking operations there would be time to train her maybe time enough and recruits enough that he would be valuable again as a trainer even if he couldnt slit throats chapter emeric tinkled a little crystal bell an officer appeared hastily i want to talk to the blondhaired one aldanto have him sent to me the officer of the royal guard bowed and left at a brisk run he was back very quickly alone sire he has gone out the guards saw him walk out just after dawn he went northwards hmm alone or with one of these byzantine rats he is supposed to be with the young officer hesitated sire he had no man with him no woman either but the guards tell me he was accompanied by a yellow dog the guard said it looked more like an overgrown jackal than a dog an ugly yellowtoothed mangy thing his horse tried to kill it and aldanto stopped him a yellow dog the puppetman would not have a pet his master wouldnt allow it have the guards told about this creature if it is seen again have them shoot it after the officer left emerics eyes narrowed thoughtfully he was slowlyreluctantlycoming to the conclusion that before too long he would need to go back to hungary and talk to his greatgreataunt the countess bartoldy his plans for corfu were not working out as well as they should have due to the incompetence of too many of his officers and what was worse due to the delay it was becoming clear that magic would be playing more of a role in the campaign than hed foreseen or wanted even though he was a skilled sorcerer in his own right the problem with sorcery was that it was ultimately something that had no greater respect for monarchs than anyone else that made it a risky business for someone with the name of emeric king of hungary he hated to be beholden to his greatgreataunt any more than he needed to be but it was just a fact that this sort of thing was elizabeth bartholdys field of expertise far more than his traveling with the shaman aldanto was obliged to walk no horse would tolerate the shaman within sight and even the scent of him seemed to make them uneasy being forced to walk was hard on aldanto it meant that muscles that had been torn by torture and forced to heal laced with scarring were forced into more work than they really should have had to do he had not walked much in years before jagiellon captured him either in venice he had traveled almost exclusively by the canals and he had relied on someone elses muscles to propel him his legs screamed with agony that he was not permitted to show nobody was listening to his internal suffering the puppeteer did not really understand lifes prerequisites nor did he care he worked his tools ruthlessly and sometimes they broke so driven by his master caesare walked on the yellow dog walked on beside him the shaman knew enough not to wish to go back to the place the horseflies had driven him from and it would be caesare who faced whatever guarded it this time they walked beneath the tall lianolia olives starred with tiny white flowers past beebusy masses of yellow broom by the dusty roadsides caesare trod on delicate orchid blossoms thrust through myrtle bushes the place stinks said the shamandog sneezing we should be there by now surely i would have thought so it didnt take me that long to get back to the camp master the shaman looked at his paws we have been heading northwest for much time caesare turned and looked up at the sun he did not shield his eyes the way a normal man would the sun was plainly heading toward rest in the heavy hazy golden afternoon if this place is to the northwest then why is the sun now on my back the shaman blinked but we have walked as straight as it is possible i will look through the eyes of my hawks he bent his will using true names names of power his eyes did indeed see through theirs the ground hurtled toward him at terrific speed the yellow dog lost its footing and sprawledand the hawk struck the hare cleanly aldanto having stopped for the first time in many hours fell over like a poleaxed steer the yellow dog staggered to its feet calling desperately for the master to take him away away from the magic barely five hundred yards away erik and svanhild were lost in the magic their fingers entwined they walked in the dell where anemones bloomed the cicada song rose to its summer crescendo and then as they walked closer to the holmoaks was stilled an enormous orangeyellow butterfly suddenly skittered into hasty flight from the flowers in front of them instinctively erik tensed a tortoise stuck its head around the flower clump regarding these invaders to its realm with a suspicious unblinking yellow eye then having correctly labeled them as moonstruck it put its beaky face down and mumbled up a wild strawberry erik found laughter and happiness pure easy and as sweet as the warm breeze bubbling up within him he picked up svanhild in his arms and spun her round her long golden hair flying round and around laughing like children together until they fell together dizzy and still laughing into the flowers frightening the tortoise off his late afternoon snack the tortoise lumbered away erik held her gently now touched her cheek i love you svan will you marry me for an answer she pulled him closer the shaman shook himself spat he behaved for all count mindaug could see just like a dog who had too closely encountered a skunk and was now trying at all costs to rid himself of even the memory by any means it too strong master too strong and too spread out it has killed the slave the shaman trickled his fingers across his drum bringing a whisper of sound from it it was almost as if the tattooed drumskin sighed jagiellon shook his head the slave just lost consciousness i have been forgetful about feeding it but master that place the shaman shuddered it eats me i hate it it has a dangerous magic there jagiellon paused and mindaug hardly dared breathe if the grand duke started really thinking about the shamans experience instead of being consumed by his lust for possessing corfus power but the dangerous moment passed the grand duke shrugged heavily and said yes it is stronger than i had anticipated still it seems purely defensive and a crude sort of magic too big sweeps of clumsy enchantment not bladestrokes of true power we will find its cores find them and break them to our use he turned to the count well mindaug the magic of the west is your study what do you know of the magic of this place mindaug bowed relatively little grand duke there is a mention in angenous pothericus of the rough magic of seagirt corcyra he says the place is a poor place for spellcraft but i will search further do that erik had drilled them all since early morning hed worked on simple basic things fitness strength how to fall thalia rubbed her arm reflexively shed always thought falling was something you could do without any lessons but erik believed fall was just the first part of get up fast and unhurt the icelander was odd like all peasant women thalia had worked since she could walk shed been privately disappointed when erik had said he was going to get them fit first before he taught them to fight getting fit was what the young master from the ropa valley estate needed the recruits called him loukoumiaslightly more warily though now that some of them had seen him use a sword he needed this fitness she only needed to know which end of a sword cut how to hold it how to use it well giuliano had struggled in this fitness regime he was redfaced and panting but so to her surprise was she peasants work but they dont do so at the run they dont waste strength they conserve it so that they can work all day thalia found out that according to the icelanders standards she and giuliano were equally unfit when he finally let them rest thalia sought out a patch of shade and flopped down in it too tired to think to her surprise the plump young man came over to where she lay in the shade of the myrtle bushes he had two daggers in his hand i promised to teach you bladecraft he said he was still redfaced and sweating his fine linen shirt was so wet it stuck to him and here he was wanting to teach her how to use a knife a knife not a sword a knife was a tool you cut up food with she didnt need to be taught how to use that she shook her head you need to rest and i need to rest you can show me later he took her arm and pulled her up now while you are tired what you learn to do now you will do best with least wasted effort trust me my father used to do it this way and he was the best swordmaster in venice she felt the knife edge it was razor keen but these are sharp dangerous right and those who are going to try to kill you are not going to use blunt knives now try to stab me not like that hold it like this now try again he was a very good and patient teacher and she had to acknowledge a knife did not just have to be a tool you cut up food with this loukoumia was plump but he wasnt just sweet erik walked across to the stream where hed arranged to meet svanhild it ran through a glade quite unlike the rocky harshness where he was training the recruits of his guerrilla unit this small oasis of fertility was green and soft and cool under the relentless sun and limitless blue skies of the ionian islands svan was as usual when she was waiting for him plaiting things her long fingers moved steadily gracefully almost magically often as not when they were in camp or almost anywhere else she plaited practical thingsbowstrings the kind of twine that thalia would knot into birdnets even rope here she always plaited flowers at the moment she was making a chaplet of daisies not the mere simple twist that had satisfied lovers for time immemorial but a complex thing when she saw him she dropped it and ran to him his arms were full of the softness and roundness of her he led her back to where shed been sitting and picked up the daisy confection come darling svan finish it for me id rather hold your hand he smiled for some reason whenever he was here all the urgency to get things done ran out of him well for an hour or twowhy not thats a persuasive argument but i dont want to see something less than perfect on your golden hair she dimpled at him finished it off with a few deft twists and presented it to him there he set it gently on her head and leaned in close to kiss her cheek she pulled him closer and changed what had been planned as a chaste kiss into something far more volcanic i ah think wed better stop one of the recruits might come up this way she giggled im sure theyre all too tired to move isnt that what you intended erik blushed tactics he mumbled from the shadows of a judas tree a satyr watched approvingly this was what this place was intended for after all part viii july ad chapter benito entered the city gates of ferrara unobtrusively fourteen days of riding had improved his skill at staying in the saddle if not his liking for horses the mare hed bought in livorno had been guaranteed as quiet the horseseller had omitted words like old and destined for gluemaking very soon benito being fairly ignorant of horses realized hed probably been gulled the horseseller said the mare was very evenpaced that sounded good to benito hed discovered it meant moves at one speeda slow walk still it did carry him without his ending in a ditch but he was very glad to abandon the beast at a hostelry near the gate and proceed on foot he made his way toward the castle thinking how best to get access to his grandfather he could simply go and ask announcing his name that should be enough to get him an audience at least but for some reason he was reluctant to spread his identity around he was deep in thought when someone took him gently by the arm and began leading him into a shop benito was by nature and background wary he hadnt even seen this fellow approach the man was the definition of nondescript middleaged mousy and plainly dressed good day milord benito valdosta step this way will you come and admire the knives on display here benito tensed this man knew him an enemy the milanese and montagnard cause had been severely dented when the assault on venice last year failed but they were still a power they could be resurging and heaven knew they wanted benito valdostas head who are you benito asked forcing himself to remain calm one of your grandfathers emissaries hes away right now by the way in verona a matter of a treaty with the scaligers but theyre our enemies the man shrugged benito recognized the gesture he had indeed seen this man before but until hed seen that shrug hed been less than certain about it in the politics of princes expediency is the key at the moment verona leans away from milanand in uncertain times like these we need allies even unsavory ones like the scaligers benito made a show of examining a blade whats uncertain i thought things had stabilized nicely after the holy roman emperor let it be known that venice was his friend in the region if not formally an ally or isnt this true any more signor bartelozzi he said it in a tone that would suggest the merits of a soso blade being discussed antimo bartelozzi allowed him a flicker of a smile not since the holy roman emperor fell suddenly and very seriously ill a problem with his heart they say now i think we will part ways and you will go to a nearby inn just up the road a ways the mandoril its called the foods good and your follower can be dealt with ill be there to talk to you later walking to the inn near the gate benito looked for followers now that he was aware of it he spotted the fellow fairly easily he was good to a caesarefit sort of level it took him some time to spot the second one bartelozzis man who was even better at it knowing bartelozzis reputation benito made no attempt to shake them off that problem would soon be solved he went to the mandoril asked for a room and some dinner after washing up he went down to the taverns main room and enjoyed a solitary supper of risotto con finocchi and a bottle of venegazzu from treviso he reveled in the pleasure of familiar simple northern food again when he returned to his room antimo bartelozzi was sitting there waiting the fellow marking you is following someone out on the road to venice he wont be returning said the spymaster with grim certitude now what brings you to ferrara milord benito valdosta your grandfather believes you to be in corfu antimo bartelozzi was benito knew the operative his grandfather used for family business the best and most trusted an exemplary assassin too im here because of corfu the island has been invaded ive just come from therevia sicily and the west coast of italybecause the byzantines and dalmatian pirates are blockading the adriatic although bartelozzi was not likely to let fall any expressions that might betray his feelings or his thoughts his eyes did narrow just a trifle byzantium has attacked venetian possessions alexius must be further gone into debauchery than we had thought but he has been having dealing with emissaries out of odessa hes allied himself with emeric of hungary bartelozzi showed no surprise we have had reports of emissaries going to and fro but we assumed that it was for mutual cooperation against iskander beg the mountain chief controls quite some part of epirus that alexius lays nominal claim to bartelozzis voice grew very dry the duke said that if alexius was fool enough to prefer emeric for a neighbor to iskander beg he deserved what he would undoubtedly get giving emeric a foothold on corfu is sheer insanity but we have suspected for some time that alexius is unwell in the head well emeric is there all right you can see his pavilion from the citadel all gold and crimson his magyar are pretty recognizable too benito sucked his teeth ive been instructed to relay this to the imperial embassy in venice but if there is someone i could speak to here it might save days unfortunately ritter von augsberg has gone with the duke to verona all of italy north of naples has been in something of a turmoil since word came that the emperor has fallen gravely ill for all that many people disliked himhis policies if not the man himselfthe truth is that charles fredrik has been a pillar of stability in europe for decades if he dies bartelozzi shook his head i will of course prepare a full report for your grandfather but i think the best would be for you to proceed with all speed to venice in the last two weeks doge dorma and the imperial embassy appear to have had a cooling of their former warm relations the news of charles fredriks failing health has allowed all sorts of rumors to spread we are in for some turbulent times and the montagnards of milan are sensing the change that was one of their men who followed you i think you should travel onward to venice somewhat more circumspectly benito swallowed a sense of urgency i dont care how i travel so long as it is not by horse i was thinking of a passage on one of the po barges would that be circumspect enough passengers will be watched but as one of the crew of a cargo vessel excellent you may leave it to me milor antimo took a long bundle out from under the bed the duke wanted to give this to you himself but i think he will forgive me for doing so he has always said that expediency is more important than sentiment in politics he handed benito the bundle it is your fathers sword your grandfather had marco de viacastan repair it of course being de viacastan he did a bit more than that of all the swordsmiths in ferrara the spaniard was rated the best by far his blades were for generals princes and kingsand wealthy ones at that im honored antimo smiled in his wintry fashion it was one of his weapons in the first place i know your grandfather wanted to reforge it himself but he did not let sentiment stand in the way of practicality he gave it to the man who could do the best job of it but he took a hand in the work so that any virtue in the delleste tradition might pass to this blade you may need it the wolf of the north has been south lately to the kingdom of naples benito savored a moment of knowing more than a man who was plainly a master of his trade actually hes been further he went to jerusalem i crossed his path in a manner of speaking and he related the story of the pilgrim medal an unholy glint lit up in the spymasters eyes not for a moment will he believe you were not stalking his footsteps interesting this may prove useful to us benito unwrapped the hilt first it had been refurbished with tassels of ferrara crimson antimo saw benito fondle them at your grandfathers express order when you carry this blade openly he wants everyone to know you are under his hand the tassels were worth a great deal more than mere silk to benito the foxs colors on the wolfs sword he mused ive had my birth thrown at me here antimo the spymasters smile grew more wintry still this sword will throw it at your enemies instead reputation is a weapon and wars are won and lost on reputations let them see that let them know fear benito nodded and continued to peel away the swaddling to reveal the sheathed blade he drew it out the steel trapped and shivered the candlelight into the myriad oystershell folds in the steel saints its beautiful bartelozzi nodded his eyes glinting with appreciation and deadly there is more than just fine craftsmanship in that blade however it has been ajourneying on its own you see your grandfather took it to rome he said it was time the sword of the wolf was rededicated to more wholesome purposes i know only that it was thrice blessed benito looked at the sword so graceful so deadly almost hypnotized by it it was no dresssword with gilt and filigree from the sharkskin hilt to the tip it was a weapon benito picked it up the balance was perfect it felt like an extension of his arm a killers weapon antimo shrugged a tool a spade can be a killers weapon too a sword used for ill is an evil thing a thing of oppression but always remember there are also evil things that need killing benito grinned you know eneko lopez said something of the sort why is it that people are always preaching to me is it something about my face antimo bartelozzi looked long and hard at him as unblinkingly as a cat eventually he nodded yes by morning benito was a deckhand on a downstreamheading barge piled full of hides the smell was quite enough to discourage anyone examining its crew too closely it could have been worse though they passed downwind of one laden with onions benito valdosta returned to venice without pomp or ceremony but with a great deal of bouquet some of the hides were definitely not well cured normally one got used to a smell and stopped noticing it but it had been hot and the bright italian sun had ripened this one past ignoring even the familiar canal reek seemed positively perfumelike after that and the sight of venice stirred him how grand how small that came as a shock he stared calculated examined trying to work out what had happened the buildings were no smaller nor the canals benito realized abruptly that what had changed was himself he felt a pang for the old venice the venice that had been his whole world hopping off the barge at the fondamenta zattere ponto lungo benito looked about for a familiar face especially among the gondoliers he didnt want to waste time he spotted someone carlo zenetti was not a man benito knew that well but at least he knew him he climbed down into the gondola zenetti nearly dropped his oar valdosta benito valdosta saints what are you doing here we all thought youd been sent to corfu it was plain that however well his disguise might have worked elsewhere here among the popula minuti of venice they knew the face of their prodigal benito put down the small hide roll hed used to camouflage the sword doing so gave him a moment to think the last thing he wanted to do was start a panic on the canals of venice and he knew the speed at which gossip ran on those canals it wouldnt do to have the news of corfus invasion arrive with a clamor of people in the piazza san marco before hed even gotten to see petro im traveling on the quiet carlo lets get out of here before someone else recognizes me please sure the gondolier cast loose but i reckon youre chasing a lost cause he said with a grin im sure before vespers tonight good men will already be locking their daughters up where can i take you to the doges palace i suppose afterwards benito came to regret that decision but at the time it seemed like a sensible one after all he had urgent matters to attend to there best discharge his duty as soon as possible before he went looking for marco so how are things in venice he asked idly might as well pick up on the news before he was having his news demanded of him perhaps his war tidings had already gotten here it appeared not by the gondoliers reply trades a bit slow plenty still coming in from the north but nothing much recently from the adriatic side well that was hardly surprising he fished further no wars to speak of is the philippo maria of milan finally getting to accept that the venetian republic is here to stay i reckon the milanese might start one soon said carlo grimly theyre used to being dominant theyll try again said benito with a grin and get the same again benito climbed ashore at the piazza san marco the great winged lion of venice gazed sternly down from its pedestal benito gave the statue a fond wave and turned to the palace with its swiss mercenary guards benitos chest swelled a bit it had been a tough task but hed done it and here he was alive and undetected emeric would pay for his sneak attack on venice he walked up the shallow steps to the guard commander i need to see doge dorma on a matter of extreme urgency the guard commander was not one of the populi minuta of venice he was from a small village in the alps he plainly did not know this scruffy barefoot youth with a dirty face and an impudent grin and then you want to see the grand metropolitan i suppose go on get off the stairs before i have my men throw you off the doge doesnt see common sailors not even on matters of extreme urgency benito sighed im in disguise you ass im benito valdosta the doges ward never call an officer an ass in front of his men even if he is one the man swung the butt of his pike in an arc designed to bring it into contact with benitos crotch benito jumped back unfortunately the hideroll under his arm slipped in the process the contents fell to the steps a concealed weapon seize him boys benito found himself again in a position he was alltoofamiliar with being sat on by a number of large representatives of the forces of law and order knowing that resistancenormally the only enjoyable part of the exercisewould only make things worse benito did his best not to very shortly he was being led down to the cells his shetland knife and the reforged sword of the wolf of the north seized for evidence according to the charge list hed been clumsily attempting to assassinate the doge before being arrested by alert guards look can i just get a message either to marco valdosta or petro dorma pleaded benito this is a misunderstanding corfu has been invaded snorts of laughter came from the guards and jailors its not a dungeon that this one will end up in hes for the madhouse the jailors were new both of them no one recognized him benito realized it was hopeless well hed be hauled up in front of the justices shortly then theyd laugh on the other side of their faces by late that afternoon he realized that shortly was a word that applied to the cases of the case vecchie for a commonand madfelon the period before being charged and sentenced could be a long one it was at the changing of the guard at nightfall that benito thought his luck had finally changed the new guard coming on duty took one look at him and swore lord and saint mark what are you doing here valdosta benito recognized the man as one of those whod overseen his previous stay in the dungeons thank goodness somebody recognizes me please tell them who i am and get me the hell out of here ive rushed to get news hereonly to find myself put in jail by these people the daywarder looked at his relief and at the prisoner and then back at the relief you know this young man he asked his coworker warily the nightwarder nodded hes benito valdosta we had him in here just after the big valdostamontescue wedding the daywarder took a deep breath you mean the one who on the rialto bridge the nightwarder chuckled thats him whats he up for this time attempted assassination of the doge assaulting members of the swiss guard saints the warder shook his head in amazement couldnt you just have stuck to public indecency young valdosta benito sighed its a complete misunderstanding i asked to be taken to see the doge as i have important news for him ive been traveling in disguise from corfu the matter is urgent so i came straight here still dressed as a seaman and then that testa di cazzo of a guard commander decided i was an assassin as if im going to march up to the swiss guards on the steps and demand to be taken to the guy i want to kill the concealed weapon theyre going on about is a rapier as you might see on the hip of any casa vecchie gentleman walking into the doges palace its my fathers sword sent by the doge to be repaired in ferrara i picked it up there but signor you claimed to have come from corfu i did i came around italy and across the apennines because the adriatic is blockaded i came through ferrara as a result and tried to see my grandfather i didnt because he is in verona but i got my sword i couldnt put it on my hip as i would normally because a sailor wandering around with a sword would be picked up by the schiopettieri so instead i got thrown in jail by some officious idiots who wont even believe who i am now can you get me out of here the warders looked at each other and then at benito at last the daywarder said no signor but we can take you to one of the justices he can order you freed benito sighed at the bureaucratic pettiness of it all well lets do that but milord valdosta they have all gone home benito closed his eyes begging for patience then get one of them back here please or at the very least send for my brother marco we need to start preparing to break the siege on corfu and every day more people will die the citadel is secure but the hungarians are raping the country the nightwarder pulled a face but signor your brother marco has gone to verona benito felt like pulling his hair out and i suppose his wife has gone too the jailor nodded well can you get me one of the justices please i know theyve gone home but this is urgent the nightwarder nodded i will go and ask the chief nightwarder he returned a little while later i am very sorry signor the chief says no it is not in the rules testa di cazzo rules ill have his guts for a skippingrope when i get out of here said benito savagely he shook the bars in frustration and had an inspiration listen can i at least see a priest the warder nodded brother umbriel comes to see the prisoners every evening anyway i need to see someone specific either brother mascoli of st raphaella or sister evangelina of st hypatia di hagia sophia the nightwarder looked thoughtful you could ask brother umbriel he is hypatian and benito had to content himself with that brother umbriel when he came proved to be willing to help benito valdosta needing to see evangelina or mascoli on a matter of some urgency concerning eneko lopez he smiled you certainly know how to inflame a poor siblings curiosity dont you very well my son i will interrupt my work and go to old mascoli now brother mascoli came a few minutes later ah benito valdosta you are very unlike your brother you wish to see me in connection with eneko lopez im afraid eneko has gone to holy jerusalem hes on corfu im afraid brother umbriel got the wrong end of the stick i have messages from eneko lopez too for the grand metropolitanand you mascoli raised his eyebrows which are what eneko wanted me to tell you is that they have hit magical problems on corfu where they are besieged he says that the archangel uriel the guardian of the creatures of the earth cannot be raised they are unable to raise wards there appears to be some malign force preventing them from contact by scrying with other sacred magicians he wants help from the church he wants help from rome mascoli gnawed his knuckle thoughtfully well these things can be confirmed i will go now to sister evangelina the siblings will attempt to contact eneko magically and should we fail we will try rome there are magical ways of establishing authenticity great at least i will have succeeded in part of my mission said benito mascoli looked at the bars im afraid i dont know if i can get you out of here my son ill talk to evangelina and perhaps we can approach the patriarch michael benito yawned dont worry about it the justices can spring me in the morning i suppose there is not much that could be done tonight anyway chapter odd unsettled that was how katerina would have described this meeting in verona petro had insisted that marco come with him along with part of the venetian council of ten marco had not wanted to go but had been persuaded against his better judgment because of all of the strange and contradictory rumors that were now spreading about the likely intentions of the holy roman emperor should charles fredrik die more of these were coming out now that the meeting was in full sessionand it occurred to her that if their great enemy wanted to eliminate most of the thorns in his side in one swoop he would have had only to arrange for a human agent to pack the cellar of the palace in which they were meeting with gunpowder which might explain who was spreading all these rumors and why fortunately that seemed to have occurred to more than one of their allies as well you couldnt move without bumping into a very alertlooking guard she couldnt make heads or tails of it some rumors had it that prince manfred had open designs on corfu and after that outpost presumably venice as well others claimed that he had quarreled with his uncle the emperor over the emperors designs on venice some said manfred had quarreled with his cousin conrad the heir presumptive over the same thingwith half the rumors ascribing evil designs on venice to manfred the other half to conrad still others swore that nothing of the sort had happened that in fact manfred had never left corfu and that so far as intelligence out of corfu was concerned there wasnt any certainly ships were not coming from that direction which was odd tension was not even close to describing what the atmosphere in this room was like and marco was in knots hed told kat yesterday that he knew there was something terribly horribly wrong but he was too far from the lion to tell what it was and too far from the lions protection to dare try to scry for it either finally hed gone out last night in search of the largest hypatian establishment in verona to ask them to find out what they could for him but if anything this morning he was in worse case even the old fox had been forced to take notice whats wrong you look like youve been drinking the water out of your own canals the tension underlying his words made the attempted jest fall flat marco shook his head theres something wrong about all thisthese rumors arent spreading accidentallyand theres still more wrong back home at just that moment there was a commotion at the door a burly man who looked more warrior than hypatian sibling shoved his way inside brother ancetti marco called recognition and welcome in his voice forestalling the guards who were going to shove the sibling back outside again the sibling bowed in a curt manner marco valdosta i have that word from venice that you asked me for and your instincts were correct he said grimly only this morning i have news from sibling mascoli and from the grand metropolitan as well and i believe it is something that everyone at this council needs to hear the sibling proceeded to relate a tale that had it not been vouched for by the most powerful christian magician in verona and by his word verified by the grand metropolitans own magicians in rome would have sounded more incredible than any of the tales of manfred of brittanys supposed treachery stunned silence greeted most of it until the priest came to the endand the fact that benito valdosta was at that very moment on trial for treason and possibly worse three men rose from the table at an instant all three roaring the same incredulous word what it was marco who recovered first horses he said decisively looking at petro fast ones cant you marco shook his head the lions powers only hold within the boundaries of venice once i reach the boundariesthen i can call on him but not before petro nodded though it was clear to kat that the old fox was utterly baffled right then you and that hideous bodyguard of yours on my bay and giovannis roan well come behind you as fast as our horses can manage marco didnt waste a word and spared not more than a glance at katnot that she was going to complain not when benito might find himself facing execution before the sun set he ran out the door calling to his scarred shadow bespi that strange silent man with the haunted eyes and it was left to petro and her to explain as well as they could what that abbreviated conversation had been about but they did it on the trot because it was altogether possible that even marco and the lion would not be enough to do more than delay things until the doge himself arrived having his identity known did move benitos case up the slate to head the morning list which was something positive benito thought for the first moment until he saw the facial expression of the justice assigned to the case it would have curdled vinegar never mind milk what are the charges its a misunderstanding said benito the justice turned grimly to look at him speak when youre permitted to the clerk will now read the charges the clerk did so benito had in the meantime been struggling to place the sour face in front of him when he did he realized that his troubles almost certainly werent over the man was a capuletti a cousin of the man he was supposed to have murdered a house that had fallen from grace along with ricardo brunelli a man by the looks of him who held grudges the justice turned to stare at benito are you benito valdosta benito nodded yes the justice looked at his clerk you may prefix that list with the breaking of exile it is a charge which carries the maximum penalty but i came to bring warning silence thundered the justice he beckoned to the two schiopettieri if the prisoner speaks without my express orders again you will silence him and valdosta if you speak out of turn again ill have you gagged is that clear benito said nothing he knew if he did hed explode fury was building up in him and because the jailors had been convinced by now that this was all a mistake they hadnt shackled him when theyd sent him up i said is that clear benito said nothing the prisoner will answer or be held in contempt of the court is this clear benito leaned forward gauging the distance to the door if i say something youll gag me if i dont say anything youll hold me in contempt this is a farce add contempt of court to the charge list now we have the prisoners own admission that he is benito valdosta a person proscribed from the city and environs of venice the second charge relates to an attempt to carry a concealed weapon into the doges palace is that the weapon in question it is your honor said the reedyvoiced clerk he drew the rapier from the scabbard and placed it on the desk it was hidden inside a roll of cowhide your honor doubtless he wanted to avenge himself for being banished and now to the assault charges call the first witne benito jumped up onto the rails of the dock that held him and then feinted as if to leap for the doorway instead he sprang out into the room knocked aside the little clerk and seized the rapier and justice capuletti the man gave a terrified squeak as the blade touched his throat back off or ill kill him said benito to the two schiopettieri assigned to the court they looked doubtfully at each other the swiss mercenary guard commander who had been about to be first witness intervened do what he says that man is a professional boys hell kill the justice and chop you into dogmeat if you try and rush him and if you try to shoot him youll as likely kill the justice listen to the man this swordyou all see it its the sword of my father the wolf of the north do you want me to prove i can use it just as well as he could if you do just push me ive come a few hundred leagues by sea foot and bedamned horse and nearly been drowned caught or killed a couple of times to bring word about the attack on corfu im not going to be stopped by some smallminded petty bureaucrat now if you do things my way we can clear up this little misunderstanding and no one needs to get hurt isnt that so justice the man squirmed yes just do what he says you can go free valdosta i i meant no harm just let me go and i mean no harm either ill let you go just as soon as ive had my say now someone can go and fetch petro dorma then if its all the same to you ill go back into exile ive discovered just how much i hate the pettifogging bureaucracy of this place one of the schiopettieri cleared his throat nervously signor valdosta the doge has gone to verona benito sighed and raised his eyes briefly to heaven very briefly why dont we just move the whole town there very well is lodovico montescue in venice the two schiopettieri hastily consulted we think so signor we have not heard anything about him going benito grinned lodovico montescue might be old but hed do just fine he was influential enough to get things moving and he and benito saw eye to eye have him fetched you he pointed to one of the schiopettieri go and dont even think of bringing anyone but montescue back here if you let me talk to lodovico no one gets hurt if you bring a bunch of schioppies charging in here ill cut this capulettis throat first and then see how many more of you the sword can bring down before i die wideeyed the schiopettieri nodded and went with a degree of speed benito was sure his plump body hadnt managed for many a year now said benito looking at the tableaux of waxworklike people in the chamber the swiss gentleman with common sense if you wouldnt mind bolting that door ive come a long way to bring this story to venice and id hate to be interrupted while im telling it also if something goes wrong and i get killed id hate to have failed to bring this warning after all this clerk you will write all of this down the small clerk nodded hastily right i wont bother with things you already know about such as when we left venice as our ships were approaching corfu we were attacked by two fleets of vessels narenta galliots and byzantine carracks he led them through a brief synopsis of the landing in besieged corfu and his escape from the citadel and his adventures on the way here at the end he prodded justice capuletti in the ribs i have done my best to serve the interest of the republic yes i have broken my banishment to do this once my warning has been heard i am willing for the chief justice of the republic to pass appropriate sentence i just wonder whether this mans actions were prompted by malice and a desire for revenge against the casa valdosta or whether he is an agent of king emerics attempting to silence me ill leave that for the court to decide too the swiss mercenary cleared his throat its something of my fault youre here milord i made an error of judgment apologies benito grinned wryly we all make mistakes soldier some of us have the balls to admit it no hard feelings i was fairly stupid in my approach the mercenary looked at the door and scratched his chin in my professional opinion signor valdosta we ought to put a few of these benches across the door and you should move across to that corner away from the direct line of fire if you dont mind ill ask these lads to give me a hand he jerked a thumb at the schiopettieri and the clerk the schiopettieri nodded good idea signor the clerk stood up nervously signor valdosta couldnt we just end all of this now now that justice capuletti has heard the reasons he understands what you were doing and why i certainly think we could end this unpleasantness now benito turned the justices head by his forelock well capuletti ah yes of course just let me go benito shrugged very well he let go of the justices pinioned arm the justice staggered forward and ran for the door the clerk attempted to stop him and was floored by a flailing fist but the schiopettieri stepped in front of the door his weapon in hand shoot him im free now shoot him shrieked the justice the schiopettieri raised his piece and knocked the justice to the floor with it you better come and grab him signor valdosta said the schiopettieri hauling the bloodyfaced justice to his feet here hold him in front of you theyre battering at the door benito held the halflimp justice in front of him at this point the upper half of the door broke back back off or he gets it yelled benito just what in the name of heaven is going on here the voice was old cracking slightly on the upper registers but lodovico montescues voice was still strong enough to stop everyone in their tracks lodovico stumped forward reached over the gap and opened the latch well benito valdosta what is going on around here what are you doing in those clothes did you pawn your boots for drink it was like olive oil on windriffled water ive just brought news that corfu is under siege its blockaded so i had to travel in disguise and id kill for a bottle of good veneto soave never mind pawn my boots siege eh who emeric of hungary together with the byzantines the bastards he turned to the schiopettieri officer accompanying him the marangona must be rung so must the campanile of san marcos bells were at war have some of your men summon all of the council of ten that have not accompanied the doge to verona and call in the senate the old man took a look at the justice well no ones allowed to even give you a cup of soave for killing venetian justices much though some of them might like to so you might as well let him go with pleasure all i wanted to do was tell the republic that we are at war this onewho is either a traitor or a foolwanted to stop me i havent harmed him lodovico looked at the clerk on the floor and that one the clerk sat up looking embarrassed i just thought id stay on the floor for a while milord lodovico snorted probably a good idea with all these guns lets uncock those weapons gentlemen and benito are you going to let him go certainly benito pushed him away justice capuletti staggered free shoot him he shouted have you lost your mind justice snapped lodovico interspersing his powerful old body between benito and the schiopettieri go and get that cut cleaned up and have a glass of wine youre overwrought youd better hope youre overwrought if youre not what you keep trying to do is treasonous he turned around calmly to face benito presenting his back to several halfraised firearms in a show of the bravura that had once made him the talk of venice do you mind sheathing your sword young benito it causes unease the bells of the campanile of san marco began to peal calling the people to the piazza benito knew that whatever happened to him nowand despite lodovicos calm benito knew he was still in deep troublehe had succeeded venice would go to the rescue of corfu and prince manfred he took a deep breath allowing some of the tension to ease from his shoulders and maria and baby alessia would not have to face the danger and privations of a siege he calmly nicked his forearmthe blade must be blooded before it was put upand put the blade back into its sheath then hung that on the sash he had for a belt chapter only seven of the doges council of ten were in venice and only five were in the doges palace on their way to the great chamber where the senate met they were accosted by a functionary who quietly escorted them into a small salon council membership was secret and anonymous it rotated every three years with different members of the case vecchie selected through a complex process to serve benito was not surprised to see that the five assembled were wearing carnival masks after all their anonymity had to be guarded the military questions were terse pointed and incisive tell us what force attacks the citadel we estimate at between ten and fifteen thousand croat light cavalry magyar heavy cavalry slav pikemen mostly from what we could see what cannon did they have benito scratched his chin well most of the enemy cannon were not ashore and deployed when i escaped that was how we were able to effect a landing the previous day how do you assess the citadels state of readiness for siege sir it is both good and bad provisions seemed adequate by what the captaingeneral said but the fortresses were undermanned the citadel has nine hundred and fifty and the fortress on vidos a further hundred and ninety there were very few cavalry in the region of fifty perhaps of course we added to that a bit well that tallies with the known facts anyway said one of the men a portly one that benito was almost sure was lodovicos friend admiral dourso under that mask this will still have to be thoroughly investigated said another sourly and now thanks to the furor youve stirred up montescue investigated in the full senate and not in private theyre clamoring for news in the piazza and in the great hall lodovico smiled wryly ive never really approved of the secrecy of the council of tens doings anyway best to have this out in the open i think there is less room for deception there come boy let us go and face them the huge hall was crowded benito found himself looking at a number of expectant worried faces the venice rumor mill was already working why are the bells being rung demanded one elegant case vecchie gentleman in the foreground are we at war the hubbub of questions coming from the hundred and twenty members of the senatewho with all the other functionaries of state had multiplied amazinglywas overwhelming this many despite the short time it was frightening there must have been at least three hundred people there benito took a deep breath it would probably be the great council of a thousand five hundred members next a very badly played trumpet blast stilled the crowd quiet lodovico returned the trumpet to an indignant young herald valdosta cant be heard above this racket first he will speak then i will allow questions at my discretion benito cleared his throat in the hush first i am here to bring news a venetian possession the island of corfu has been invaded the straits of otranto have been blockaded by byzantine and dalmatian vessels that explains the paucity of trade muttered one of the senators we havent had a vessel in for weeks theres normally a trickle of coasters at least invading our territory lodovico snatched the trumpet again and blew it discordantly it was a sound to make brave men quail even being quiet was easier than listening to it again benito went on the citadel of corfu is under siege emeric of hungary is conducting the siege in person a senator at the front of the press of people raised a long arm lodovico i need to ask a question ask away enrico thats the gist of benito valdostas news isnt it benito have byzantines also attacked other venetian territory and what is the proportion of emerics forces as opposed to troops of the holy roman empire benito was almost sure that this had been one of those questioning him a few minutes before i dont know about other venetian possessions milord i was sent from corfu to bring word i traveled disguised as a fishermanwhich is why i am dressed as i am now we were intercepted by a byzantine galley but were lucky enough to talk our way out of it we had attempted to send two great galleys following different routes with the news but i think we may assume that the blockade vessels captured them as you had not heard the news from corfu as for troops of the holy roman empire as opposed to emerics forces well we think emeric has between ten and fifteen thousand menand he may be bringing more we managed to land some two hundred knights of the holy trinity under prince manfred of brittany to add to the citadels garrison are you trying to tell us that manfred of brittany is inside the corfu citadel benito nodded puzzled yes i traveled south with his convoy of galleys we managed to effect a landing the day before emerics carracks arrived with his cannon the tall man raised himself up to his full height valdosta i cannot think what you thought youd achieve with thisthis he fumbled for words this complete farrago of lies he turned to the other senators my fellow venetians i must tell you that wellsubstantiated reports theyre nothing but rumors you fool shouted another but the speaker plowed on have manfred of brittanyhaving left corfu for caneastating how much he would like to make it a possession of the holy roman empire it was benitos opportunity to fumble for words but thats impossible there is no way he could have gotten out of the siege the tall man looked at benito with cold hauteur it has been carefully verified what nonsense that came from the same senator who had tried to interrupt earlier he began pushing his way to the front of the crowd rumors thats all and there are hundreds of them flying all over italy ever since word came of the emperors illness the crowd in the huge hall started buzzing with jabber then at the back of the hall someone cleared his throat if i may speak it was an elderly voice but carried well the assembled crowd turned to look at the elderly patriarch of venice he came forward through the crowd slowly he plainly had no intention of speaking from where he was all the time he was slowly walking down to the front of the hall benitos mind was in ferment this tall lord he thought his name might be enrico licosaa case vecchie who had served in spain and also in napleswas he a traitor had the attempt by justice capuletti to sentence him to death really been nothing more than bureaucratic maliciousness benito started looking for ways out the elderly patriarch reached the front of the hall where benito and lodovico stood he was old stooped whitehaired and whitebearded no danger surely he advanced on benito determinedly benito began to wonder if he was right about the danger did you kick the head of the church in venice in the crotch if he tried to seize you the old man reached out both skinny arms for benito and then embraced him and placed a blessing hand on his head this is a specific instruction from the grand metropolitan in rome himself he said loudly for the benefit of the audience well thought benito this reduces my chances of being lynched im not sure what its all about but its welcome the patriarch continued know all of you that as far as we have been able to determine the island of corfu is under siege with great magical forces concentrated on it the practitioners of sacred magic in rome have detected demonism at work here he turned to the nowgaping enrico licosa i suggest this entire story of prince manfred reeks of the snares and deceits of the evil one the senate was in a hubblebubble of frightened whispers now benito heard shreds of the devil himself then another man stood up this one benito recognized andrea recchia his son and benito had had a small affray consisting largely of benito giving the handsome scion of the house a black eye and a broken nose and ending in considerable trouble with the law for the recchia boy by the look on his face benito could tell he thought this was payback time if you ask me fellow senators you need look no further for the devils helpers than the casa valdosta that manpointing at benitohas only this very morning assaulted the core of our republic he viciously attacked and held hostage one of our justices he was banished from our fair city to the relief of all respectable citizens he has broken his exilea clear breach of our ancient laws he is using this tissue of lies to benefit himself he hasnt come from corfu he has just come from the deceivers in ferrara i have witnesses to prove this no doubt now he will come up with some plan to have the imperials liberate corfu recchia said lodovico montescue is your son out of jail yet for the bearing of false testimony under oath against the casa valdosta if i recall correctly my fellow senators it is normally said like father like son this time it appears to be like son like father eh the casa valdosta is one of the case vecchie longi one of the oldest houses and loyal and true to the republic the casa montescue once was entrapped into doubting them to our cost let us trust to those who have stood by us in our hour of need benito here fought on the barricades during the badoero and milanese attacks his brother was prepared to even offer his life for our great republic their names are both entered on the lists of volunteers who enlisted for our defense the old man glared at his opponent even shook his fist and where were you recchia where is your name to the rest of the crowd lodovico perorated young valdosta here was banished for the sort of wild foolishness of youth that most of you and myself engaged in i could tell stories about half of you that youd rather have forgotten so dont tempt me benito went too far and it was decided that he needed tempering that would enable him to learn the deportment and responsibilities of a man it was for that reason he was banished not because he is a threat to the state but when danger threatened our republic the casa valdosta was again the first to answer the call like ferrara let us not forget who our true friends are recchia ignored the cheers thats as may be but i have witnessesreliable witnesseswho saw valdosta disembark from a ferrarese barge yesterday ferrara i remind you allyou especially montescue as senility is obviously catching up on youis to the north and what took him from yesterday morning till now to bring this urgent news benito put a hand on lodovicos shoulder it looked like the old man was likely to go and run recchia through may i answer this the adriatic is blockaded blockaded think now those of you engaged in trade have any ships come up from as far as the straits of otranto in the last three weeks no i was smuggled out of corfu by fishing boat to italy southern italy a nasty little fishing village on the coast of southern italy and i was dead glad to get there at all from southern italy i came up the west coast across the ligurian sea i then crossed the apennines by the best route which leaves me approaching the city from the north but short of growing wings how else was i to travel and as for not bringing the news yesterdaythat is if you please what i was attempting to do when i was arrested and i would have been still effectively silenced if i had not resorted to extreme means benito drew his rapier and if necessary to get the republic stirred to action ill do it again and youve offered insult to my friend lodovico the valdosta stand by venice and by our friends do you want to name your seconds sir well that put the bull in the glassshop the hall erupted into a bedlam orstarted to the room was suddenly hushed by the slamming open of the great doors at the far end of the hall except that slamming was far too mild a description for what happened the doors exploded inward with the sound of a thousand bombards benito looked up to see a familiar figure standing there his heart leapt to see marco but his soft kindly and gentle brother could scarcely quell this lot but this was not his soft gentle kindly brother in fact it wasnt entirely his brother at all oh marco was there all right but he was completely overshadowed by a great hazy golden figure with widespread wings that overfilled the doorway and it spoke in a roar a roar that was also words that reverberated in the chest and actually caused some of the case vecchie to drop to their knees what fools are you who threaten my city the windows and walls trembled from the force of those words marco strode to the front of the senate and with each step he took the shape of the lion shrank in around him until he wore the golden aura like a garment and in nowise was that lessening of apparent size a lessening of the very real power marco turned when he reached benitos side placed one hand on benitos shoulder and faced the gathering the windows still shivered slightly with the force of his words i have come in haste from verona sent by doge dorma as soon as we received word from our ally duke enrico delleste of the invasion of corfu we are at war and have work to do gentlemen you are the leaders of our republic get out there and lead the people need you only recchia stood his ground benito could not imagine how he could he wanted to drop to his knees in front of his brother was the man too utterly blind and stupid to see nothing but what he wanted to see the charges against benito silence marco roared and recchia at last seemed to realize that he was in the presence of something that really did not give a damn about petty bureaucrats and petty feuds marcoor the lionmoderated his tone slightly these charges will be answered in a court of law and not in an open assembly and your part in this will be questioned too recchia be sure of it now go it was an order given with such force that even benito felt compelled to obey marco put an arm over his shoulder holding him in place as the casevecchie fled from the room the gold aura began to fade until it was only marco again not you benito and do you think you could put that sword away chapter marco handed lodovico and benito each a goblet of wine bespi and my horses will be along from the border shortly petro kat and grandfather are coming as soon as they can get to horseand i expect that the treaty negotiations will be completed if not within hours of my leaving possibly in the saddle we couldnt all leave without breaking the whole thing up and wed come a long way toward concluding a treaty but when the word came about youthe siegei knew i had to get here before someone managed to silence benito or worse make him disappear maybe the moment i crossed the border and i could invoke the lion i did so and i left my horses in bespis hands im afraidor perhaps i should say i am gladflying as the lion in broad daylight is something that no one can silence everyone in venice knows that when the lion flies venice is in danger so besides getting here faster it let everyone in the city know that something horrible has happened um benito said he felt odd humbled to be the center of that marco smiled to be honest all of this uncertainty since the emperors illness and all of the conflicting rumors and reports could have served us a backhanded good turn ferrara and venice would have been a lot less obliging and conciliatory if they hadnt been spooked as it is it looks to me as if well get a good deal which will improve security benefit trade and sideline milan a bit further sounds good brother benito replied trying to regain a bit of his composure but when ive finished drinking this i need to get along to the imperial embassy and show the ambassador my head marco blinked your head benito chuckled come along and see count von stemitz at the embassy was a very urbane and unflappable man as a rule but he looked a little taken aback at being told to feel in the hair behind the grubby scruffylooking young mans left ear there should be a lump there said benito er yes said the count rather gingerly hed met benito before briefly now vouched for by marco whom he knew well and lodovico montescue who was a longtime friend von stemitz was prepared to accept that this tousleheaded sailor was in fact the case vecchie tearaway and normally attired somewhat differently he was even prepared to grant that this bizarre ritual might have some deeper purpose might benitos reputation preceded him cut it out please asked benito unable to refrain from grinning i hope you have a sharp knife the grin plainly worried the count this is not one of your practical jokes is it signor valdosta its not my joke if its anyones its prince manfreds now that he was near to the end of this benito was beginning to feel all of it catching up to him he was going to eat his way down the banquet table and then sleep for a week and being funny is not its purpose believe me im going to be glad not to have that lump there a girl in calabria tried to run her fingers through my hair and nearly pulled it out by the ow you should sharpen that thing count von stemitz stood examining the imperial seal of the hohenstauffen dynasty i presume you are going to explain this it is not used in jests he said dryly oh its purpose is earnest enough manfred just said i was the scruffiest personal letter hed ever sent we were in a situation where actually carrying a letter would be dangerous given the possibility of a search so this seal is to authenticate that i have come from the prince i must tell you that he and his men are under siege in the citadel on corfu both king emeric of hungary and the byzantines are laying siege to the fortress the prince conveys his respects to his uncle and asks for whatever assistance might be brought to their rescue lodovico chuckled a talking letter these modern advances what will they think of next eh hendrik the count had to smile too its a very serious matter but maybe cleaner envelopes well if you will excuse me gentlemen a letter slightly more conventional in form perhaps must be dispatched to mainz with the fastest messengers i have a fit young ritter here i am going to dispatch him with a covering letter to see the emperoror if the emperor is too ill at least the privy council and the states general good said lodovico because i think the biggest problem with a relief force will be ships to transport them venices fleets are away well need ships from further afield few of the other mediterranean powers are likely to wish to help us perhaps they will oblige the emperor benito hadnt thought of that and ten to one neither had manfred the count nodded sighing we will surely find that emeric has tried to prevent others coming to your rescue i imagine part of the hungarians strategy is to get alexius vi to trap the eastern fleet in the black sea the western fleet is another question do you think the barbary pirates may be involved benito bit his lip i dont know milord but this i will tell you eneko lopez believes grand duke jagiellon is also involved in all this and that means lithuania and its allies and now if youll excuse us count you have letters to write and we have the arsenal to visit theyll be working night and day until another fleet is ready the situation at the arsenal benito had to admit was worse than he had hoped doge giorgio foscari had let the old policy of keeping a number of spare vessels in readiness just needing to be rigged lapse the senate had recently passed a new appropriation to restart the program but it was still in its infancy only two extra new keels had been laid the work had of course been proceeding on seven new great galleys to replace existing but elderly vessels but the arsenal simply didnt have a new fleet ready to sail at least twenty great galleys would be needed and three times that number of smaller galleys how long asked benito the representative of the admiral of the arsenal shrugged six to eight months milord well start launching the smaller vessels within two but it all takes time we cant just throw money and resources at the problem the limit is skilled manpower you cant make shipwrights overnight and theyve got to sleep sometimes it was not what benito had wanted to hear after two days benito was rested his saddle sores almost entirely recovered and his appearance returned to that of a case vecchie gentleman by then apparently shortly after benito had fallen into a bed kat had returned from verona as part of the retinue of petro dorma the duke delleste was expected the following day marco was watching benito devour his second breakfast of the day when kat appeared she melted into her husbands arms with a sigh of deep contentment holding him as if she never wanted to part from him even though benito knew she couldnt have been away from him more than an hour or two marco always just looked somehow more complete and at ease with kat at his side benito decided she was never waspish with him either as she used to be with benito still she even kissed the prodigal fondly before taking a seat next to marco i supposed its to be expected that you would find a unique reason to break your exile she said with a wink how is maria she and baby alessia were fine when i last saw them mind you that was more than a month ago and theyre in a fortress under siege but umberto is looking after them he paused thats a good man she married kat now katerina scowled at him looking far more like the kat that benito remembered than the joyous madonnalike person who was married to his brother you were a fool benito he grinned though to be fair his heart wasnt in it i still am kat but at least shes happy be honest he gives her the kind of stability i cant she sniffed stability is all very well but you could have settled down a bit if youd tried anyway there is nothing you can do about it now im supposed to tell you the doge and your grandfather want to see you as soon as possible theyre in council with the patriarch sister evangelina brother mascoli and several other clerics that i dont know they wanted to talk to marco too im coming along she added militantly just to see that they dont talk you into doing something dangerous marco flying with the lion isnt really dangerous katerina and we had to get someone down to venice quickly when we heard about benitos predicament from the hypatians perhaps flying with the lion is not entirely dangerous she said sharply but you know very well what happened to bespi once you left him and if it hadnt been that you moved so fast it might have been you who encountered that ambush off venetian soil where the lion couldnt help you marco winced benito gaped at him then demanded what ambush what happened oh marco replied bespi ran into sometrouble trouble kats voice dripped sarcasm he was ambushed benito and the only reason hes alive now is because marco wasnt with him she glared at him and the fact i suppose that they couldnt actually set up a good ambush since they were expecting to catch you before you got on venetian territory bit by bit benito pulled it out of them it happened right after marco left bespi on the road with their two horses when he broke through a group of mercenaries who had set up an ambush on the road that showed every evidence of having been hastily set up wisely rather than try to fight he spurred his horse through them but he hadnt gotten away without adding more scars to his considerable collection and it was bespis opinion that the only reason the ambushers had broken off was that they had been confused seeing only one man and that man looking nothing like marco valdosta he was recovering but since the mercenaries were aided by something that bespi had refused to describe except as black magic there was no doubt that jagiellon was involved and if you had been outside the border of venice what then kat repeated benito shared kats distrust of these magical doings perhaps marco understood and was in control of these forces but they left benito feeling like a weak swimmer in an undertow they walked across to the doges palace together where the swiss guards saluted very respectfully it was amazing what a difference the clothes one wore made no one even glanced at the scabbarded sword at benitos side now ha so much for the fuss about concealed weapons the same weapon could be carried openly without any comment by the case vecchie a footman led them up to a large airy salon where petro dorma was in animated discussion with a number of other parts of the state machinery and several clerics the doge broke off his argument to greet them well benito i thought i told you to stay away from trouble as it was said with a broad smile and general laughter benito knew that at least he wasnt still in petros bad books nonetheless you have given us something of a legal conundrum said the one hawknosed secretary benito recognized the voice from the council of ten interview you are still legally banished and there are a small group saying no matter who you are and what you have done or whatever the reason holding a venetian justice hostage at swords point is unacceptable ill face my trial and accept my sentence said benito stiffly feeling irritated i did what had to be done and i was the right person to do it and venice and the church are conscious of their debt to you said petro but the form of the law must be observed its a pity you couldnt have put off arriving until tomorrow said the secretary with a wry smile your pardon was on the agenda for the senate meeting benito found this more than a little odd hed hardly been gone from venice a couple of months and they wanted him back not very likely you were going to pardon me petro waved a hand dismissively for reasons of state that no longer apply since the rumors about prince manfreds schemes to seize corfu proved to be untrue the hawknosed secretary cleared his throat still the item is on the agenda and must be debated i think it would sit very ill with the commons if benito were not pardoned now dorma shrugged very well leave it scheduled it may help our case just try to stay out of trouble this time benito we have scheduled the case for nine tomorrow morning with a full bench of justices im afraid that will include capuletti i cant influence or be perceived to have influenced the case at all benito snorted i did what i thought had to be done petro if they want to be petty about the matterwell so be it the patriarch shook his head the church will certainly appeal strongly for clemency magical contacts have been madeconsidering the gravity of the situation and the involvement of the ancient enemy the expenditure of magical power was reckoned worthwhile the hypatians in messina give you a glowing character reference and you have alerted the mother church to a terrible evil our sacred magicians are gathering to take the war to the enemy anyway said petro that is for tomorrow today we just want to extract as much information from you as possible wring you out so that a courtcase will seem a minor thing he sighed it will take time to relieve the citadel i wish we had a fleet at hand but this attack was carefully planned to catch us when our ships were away i have a feeling theyve made plans to keep our fleets away said benito this wasnt a spurofthemoment attack petro no the doge agreed grimly it wasnt chapter the court hearing was somewhat different from benitos previous appearances for starters there were many more people there for a second benitos sword was not even in the same building petro had insisted on that hed also insisted that benito swear out a charge against justice capuletti for treason im sure it was just pettiness demurred benito uncomfortable at the idea revenge on the valdosta petro dorma shook his head youre probably right we probably wont make the charges themselves stick butand this is the point of it benito youre still a political innocentthe mud will stick petro dormas own legal counsel stood for benito he started by reading the synopsis of benitos travels as told to the clerk your honors it was necessary to have someone who could travel disguised as a commoner yet whose testimony would be accepted at the highest level someone who was also skilled with weapons and subterfuge with respect your honors there wasnt much of a choice i think you will grant that he plays the part of a scruffy common sailor to perfection and his skills with weapons andahsubterfuge cannot be gainsaid the justices laughed so did the audience benito tried not to squirm in his seat hes a troublesome young blade confessed the counsel and yet to those of us who know him he is utterly reliable so reliable that prince manfred of brittany chose to make him his personal messengerand that eneko lopez a churchman whose moral integrity is a byword also trusted him to bring further vital information to the hypatians and thus the grand metropolitan the chief justice nodded you have made your point continue signor counsel turned to benito we have now read the synopsis of your journey as transcribed by the clerk michael di coulo benito valdosta you have had an opportunity to hear it is this a faithful and accurate account of your travels and your efforts to bring word to venice benito nodded pretty much you do not mention your dealings with the hypatian church in messina other than to say you overnighted there benito shrugged i accidentally recovered their property and returned it to them it didnt seem to have much bearing on either corfu or venice rather dramatically the counsel brandished a sheet of paper nonetheless i have here a letter from the patriarch thanking you for your efforts for the church and stating that the church would be glad to provide witnesses proving you were of great service to them he paused your honors we have here a young man who has served the republic well and the church also his banishment was for acts not of treason but simply youthful folly the banishment was due to be considered by the senate on this very day it seems likely that it will be rescinded in any event this case with respect must be considered on its merits i appeal to you to consider any transgression in the light of the service performed the chief justice steepled his fingers does the prisoner have anything to add to this benito shook his head except to say that if there had been anyone available who could have done what i did or have done it better theyd have been sent we didnt have much time to make up our minds before the cannon were emplaced and it is my intention to return to corfu as soon as i can i may not be able to get back into the citadel but i can join the irregular forces who are harrying king emerics rear ive only stayed on here to show my respect for the law of the republic and for the doge i came to give warning ill leave as soon as i am permitted to go unless there is need to warn or need to stand by the republic i wont be back he allowed a trace of hurt to enter his voice i know when my presence is unwelcome but the valdosta honor their responsibilities their promises and their debts we owe a great deal to doge dorma and to venice the chief justice scratched his chin benito valdosta it is not that this court is unaware that the republic owes the casa valdosta and you in particular a debt of honor or that we do not understand why you undertook this mission it is not even that venice does not want you back despite the fact that as your eloquent defender put it youre a troublesome young blade the problem that this court faces is that despite the best of intentions your actions breached the law and venetian law is not arbitrary it applies to everyone regardless what we wish to see is how we can combine venetian law with venetian justice the court can grant clemency for your breaking of your banishment under the circumstances what is difficult is your conduct within the court we cannot allow anyone to assault a justice within his own court and get away with it admiral dourso rose to his feet your honor may i offer the court a piece of information the justice to whom you refer is not on the bench today the reason for his absence is that he is in fact in custody of the signori di notte charged with treason and conspiring to aid an enemy of the republic the schiopettieri had to sound their rattles to restore order nevertheless yes what is it signor di coulo the little clerk who had written out benitos story had advanced to address the justices your honors to prosecute benito valdosta for threatening justice capuletti you will need witnesses i have to tell your honors there are none i will however testify that justice capuletti gave me this black eye when he assaulted me on that day schiopettieri de felts will also testify that he inflicted an injury on the justice who appeared to be in a violent and disturbed state the justice was plainly not in his right mind that day your honors the chief justice looked severely at the little clerk as a clerk of this court you must be aware that you and these others are thwarting the law the little man didnt quaver we are aiding justice your honors at this point a messenger entered the courtroom with a note which he took to the chief justice the latter peered at it ah it appears that the first charge of breaking your banishment no longer stands the senate has decided to lift your banishment and override the court for what is described as reasons of state there was disapproval written on every line of the chief justices face and they have made this retroactive from the sixth of june of this year so this charge is thereby struck from the roll and as it appears we have no witnesses for benito stood up your honor i appreciate the gesture of senate i also appreciate the fact that the people of venice have shown their love for the casa valdosta in their testimony or lack thereof but i cannot accept it the truth isi did return when i was banished i must admit that i didnt even give it a thought my period of exile is both fair and right i came to give warning because that was more important ill leave as soon as i can i transgressed the letter of the law if you like you can put me in prison or as is common in times of war put me into the military im volunteering anyway my name is already on the list on the pillar of the winged lion of saint mark why not put me into a military encampmentlike the arsenaluntil i leave for corfu and my banishment can continue as for justice capuletti i admit i did threaten him with a naked blade in his own courtroom if need be id have cut his throat for the people of corfus sake you need no witnesses i admit guilt now the court can decide what it is going to do about it in the silence that followed only one person spoke lodovico montescue valdosta honor he said almost shouting then with satisfaction and pride now justices of venice the valdosta have challenged your honor what is more important the spirit of justice and the honor of the republic for a loyal sonor the dry letter of the law the justices looked to the chief justice he sat with his fingers steepled looking at benito one of the younger justices suddenly spoke i would like to recuse myself i cannot give impartial judgment the other young oneyoung being a relative term thought benito the fellow must be about sixtycleared his throat i too am going to recuse myself the chief justice looked more than a little taken aback spinosa you cannot just abandon the law when it suits you we who administer the law tend to begin to think it sacred justice spinosa said stoutly it isnt justice is and we forget that the law we administer is by grace of the republic and the republic stands by the vox populi anyone who believes the law can stand without the people and without justice is deceiving themselves thank you for reminding me of our status quamdiu se bene gesserit said the chief justice dourly it is something that few have the courage to do nonetheless i will continue to act as both the law and my conscience dictate the younger justice shrugged that is what i am doing the law must find him guilty and sentence him i think you should not stand down until we have decided what verdict we reach and what sentence we will impose spinosa shook his head i cannot do so afterwards thus i will do so before the chief justice shrugged very well can the rest of us withdraw the remaining three judges did and they returned very rapidly benito valdosta said the chief justice we find you guilty by your own admission of the charge of threatened assault with a deadly weapon on an officer of this court however as circumstances must alter cases we feel that under the circumstances your actions were justified you are free to go benito looked uncharacteristically grim especially for someone who had essentially beaten the legal system to its knees im still going to confine myself to the arsenal get myself involved in getting vessels ready the arsenalotti have already agreed to work double shifts we rather thought you would come and stay with us said kat benito shook his head to be honest it suits me to be busy what would i do in venice waiting around for an expedition to corfu get drunk chase women and get into more trouble best to follow eriks regimen go to sleep so tired i cant stand well grandfather wants to see you said marco hes with lodovico so i have no doubt youll do some of that drinking well visit you brother right now though the hypatians seem to need us to make another attempt to contact father lopez he didnt look very happy about it lodovico can call it valdosta honor but youre a delleste by blood said the old fox benito grinned wryly at both of the old men im a product of place companions and blood im a valdosta by rearing grandfather its a fine house even if that brother of yours is sometimes too good for this world said lodovico the old fox said nothing for a while and then sighed youve come out very well considering the likes of aldanto and the part he had in your rearing benito shrugged the bad i learned there got canceled out by my saintly brother and maria not to mention that granddaughter of lodovicos what happened to this maria asked the old fox casually that casualness would have fooled most people shes in the citadel on corfu now said benito quickly married and with a fine daughter lodovico chuckled shes quite a young termagant that woman between my granddaughter and her they were a pair to frighten any young man into the paths of righteousness not that it seems to have worked on you he added frowning fiercely at benito well ive still got some time in exile to go and to learn it benito was determined to get maria out of the conversation and quickly i want to lean on petro to let me go back to corfu as soon as possible if i can let the defenders know somehow that venice is coming itll do a lot for morale true but this blockade of theirs the old fox said eyeing him with speculation it seems too good to be natural boy benito pulled a face well maybe we also need some unnatural help i know marco has had some traffic with undines and tritons ill talk to him but i wanted to ask your advice grandfather on strategies erik hakkonsen is conducting the campaign using the locals im going to join him if i can talk to me tell me what works chapter the water trickled steadily into the rock bowl not in all the thousands of years that the faithful had tended the shrine here in the caves in the cliff had that spring run dry the holy pool remained full and still and drifted with the offering of flower petals tonight there were more devotees than ever the priestess looked around the women from the little arsenal smuggled in and hidden were here in numbers she was not surprised the cult was mainly greek these days althoughas she proved herselfit did not make objection to foreign worshipers the great mother considered them to be women first nationality was a secondary and unimportant thing in troubled times the goddess knew that women came back to the old religion the priestess noticed that the devotees were looking thin and pinchednot starving yet but starvation was not going to be far away she sighed the women and children were always the first to suffer in sieges and the women hiding away would be if anything worse victims than those who were legitimately within the walls after the rite she would move to speak to them to see if anything could be done the rite soothed her and even seemed to give some comfort and courage to the other women enough so that when the priestess drew one aside as the rest left she did not even get a token resistance to her questions there are two of the guards the woman said wearily they found where we women were hidden and now they demand some of the mens rations and money to keep their silence they are selling food to those who have money they were demanding sex too but some of the men said they would kill them even if it meant discovery the priestess frowned we will see what can be done do you know the names of these two the women nodded on the small black altar the half almond lay unwithered still waiting the priestess looked at it and sighed again there was power there but it was not hers it was not anyones without a price stella had come over principally to gossip but officially to see if maria would sell her a few eggs they were sitting in the kitchen because it seemed the place where stellas smaller two could do the least damage maria looked on stellas younger childrenwho were now engaged in an exercise in seeing how far they could try everybodys patienceas an experience that would put most women off motherhood they were both little boys and stella let them get away with the kind of mayhem she plainly didnt tolerate in her older daughters there was a furious bleating from the goat followed by a polite knock at the door maria went to it stella peered curiously around her shoulderand gasped to see who the visitor was contessa renate de belmondo did turn up on her charitable missions at any place she chose still she was the first lady of the island and this was a tiny scuolo housenot where you would expect to find her she smiled as brightly as if this was a case vecchie mansion while stella made big eyes and backed up maria my dear may i come in maria was more than a little flustered too but she had her pride with stella watching she had little option but to behave as coolly as she could as if she entertained the governors wife in her kitchen every day she made her best attempt at a curtsey certainly milady i am very glad to see you again renate de belmondo smiled and came in my dear what a gorgeous rug where did you find it maria felt herself glow the woolen rug was one of the few luxuries she had bought for umberto and herself during their stay in the forestry region of istria it glowed with bright peasant colors but was also beautifully woven i bought it at a fair in istria it comes from dalmatia somewhere the illyrian women make them its a beautiful piece we get some southern illyrian goods here but nothing nearly so fine the contessa allowed herself to become aware of stella and the two children peering around her skirts good morning signora mavroukis is it not stella did her best to curtsey with two clinging children milady do you know everybody on corfu the contessa shrugged and laughed no but i try signora i hate to interrupt but i need to talk to maria can you spare her to me for a little while stella was plainly dying of curiosity but could hardly say ill stay and eavesdrop so she made as polite an exit as possible while the moment that renate de belmondo turned her head away miming to maria ill talk to you later i want to hear all about it when the door was firmly shut and marias curiosity also fully aflame she still felt she had to go through the niceties i have some of the local spoonsweets milady thank you that would be delicious and perhaps a glass of water lady de belmondo fanned herself with her hand somehow it was not an affected gesture im not getting any younger and it is so hot already for walking by august the full heat will be with us and im really not looking forward to that at all the first rains of autumn are always such a blessing so maria fetched out the spoonsweets and cool water from the earthenware ewer in the shade around the back of the house they talked polite nothings while the contessa sampled the sultanina glyko ah i love the flavor the arbarorizathe rose geraniumgives to the grapes delicate yet definite you speak greek milady fluently she nodded her head gravely you really have to learn it if you are going to live here its one of the greatest mistakes so many of the venetians make if you cant talk to people you cant get along with them or really understand them i am determined to learn maria said decisively the contessa smiled you will find the local people happy to teach finally maria could restrain herself no longer milady why have you come to see me the contessa half hid a small smile behind her hand because i need your help your husband is fairly senior in the little arsenal and i hope less set in his ways than old grisini i want through you to enlist his aid i can try said maria doubtfully but the truth is milady umberto is not the most flexible man in the world either hes a good man but hes a senior guildsman and you dont get to be a senior guildsman without being very set in their traditions and ways the contessa nodded with understanding i have something of a problem with the wives and children of the greek workers maria made a face theyre out there she said waving her hand vaguely in the direction of the rest of the island their husbands must be distraught why did the men come in to the fortress when the siege threatened they could have run away like the peasants did they would have at least been together and a little safer renate de belmondo looked speculatively at maria and then said calmly they did one better they brought the women in here theyre hiding in the sheds at the back of the little arsenal there are more than sixty women and an uncertain number of children there at least double that number theyre living on the mens rations and a couple of the guards have found them and are exploiting the situation according to my informant the men think the illyrians must have informed on them theyre ready to kill the guards which would be trouble and the illyrian workers too which would be more trouble said maria grimly those illyrians are keen on using their knives according to umberto she sighed the trouble between the illyrians and the corfiotes goes way back he says and both sides hold a grudge the corfiotes complain the illyrians are stealing their work the illyrians say the corfiotes are stealing their places oh it goes back a lot further than that chuckled the contessa dryly further than you may think corfu has had waves of settlers for many thousands of years but the original people of the region came here when there was no channel between here and the mainland just a broad marshy valley and big bay then the invaders came they were not the illyrians or even the illyrians forefathers but they came from the same general direction thrace the illyrians are merely the inheritors of that hatred anyway the point is that the hatred goes back so far that there is no counting the years so far that there is a peasant belief among the women that a desperate priestess of the earth mother gave herself to be the bride of the lord of the underearth to save her child its one of those things about the magic of corfu i was telling you about he moved the earth to drown the armies and forever put the sea between the invaders and this place maria stared in puzzlement at the contessa one minute she was telling maria about a mess that could end in riotingthe next telling her about some ancient myth how do you know all this milady the contessa shrugged its a very old story or do you mean about the greek workers wives people tell me things i dont betray confidences but i do sometimes act this time i think i shall have to act they cant remain a secret but if the guild supports us in this well it will be very difficult for the captaingeneral to make a fuss i know nico tomaselli he is likely to try to expel them and certainly wont feed them now the guild is in control of those sheds and the arsenalotti are not an inconsiderable force any attempt to throw the women out could cause a riot or even a breaching of the walls if the arsenalotti get involved besides theyre our own said maria resolutely you leave this with me milady ill talk to umberto the contessa smiled she took a small crystal bottle out of the pouch hanging from her chatelaine you may find this helps with your talk she laughed sometimes men need to be distracted before theyll listen i find a dab of this behind my ears even these days has the power to obtain my husbands full attention maria blushed milady it is not necessary the contessa stood up i know but i think you will enjoy it another thought occurred to maria milady i am friends with francesca de chevreuse maria expected disapproval instead she got another little laugh she has all the respectable matrons of this town in a terrible state mostly selfrighteousness tinted with envy i think do tell her that her attempts at information gathering have been reported to my husband that was more than a little alarming but maria persisted i could get her to ask the knights to help the contessa shook her head this really is our own affair maria we should handle it the contessa was scarcely around the corner when stella reappeared all right she said with a terrier look on face tell all what has she got you to do maria hadnt thought of a good story yet ah well she wanted to ah ask me to get umberto to organize something down at the little arsenal nothing important but she did ask me to keep it a secret and stella i cant tell you and keep anything a secret itll be a nice surprise for her husband maria thought that was a good touch the podesta was a renowned naturalist collecting everything from butterflies to eggs surely stella would assume it was a special cabinet or something stella snorted it must be those corfiote women hidden down in the arsenal maria gaped at her how stella shrugged the contessa is forever helping women so it had to be a womens problem and if it involves umberto and the little arsenal then that must be it but how did you know about it i have my sources maria scowled at her i need to know stella looked mischievous if you must know alberto found them he went up to the top sheds to look for some missing tools a few days ago theyve got lookouts and they hide if someone goes to the timberstores but alberto took a shortcut up the wall hes lazy and it saved him a walk so he came up to the upper gate very suddenly a couple of the big porters tried to head him off but you know alberto hes like pig after truffles when he gets onto something and he speaks greek so he gets on with the boys so because he was a friend of theirs they put off hitting him over the head until it was too late there was a bit of a scuffle but my alberto is quite solid he was indeed a very large amiable man and what happened then well you know what albertos like soft as goose grease with children of course he promised he wouldnt tell a soul stella smirked i had it out of him in two shakes hes like you maria a terrible liar and so does the whole town know not from me its all very well saying they shouldnt be there but what kind of person would leave them outside the walls the croats and hungarians she shuddered theyre like wolves with two legs maria but somebody else has found out about them ive heard two juicy rumors about it already as i said to francesca well then i think you should take me down there to meet them the contessas right this is going to blow wide open soon and ill need to work on umberto about this the scuolo need to stand by them most of the guildsmen dont like the corfiotes much said stella doubtfully but they like the case vecchie trespassing on their areas even less maria pointed out the scuolo are touchy about their rights and privileges the porters and laborers at the little arsenal are ours and if i can convince umberto of this and you get alberto to back him up well be able to sway the rest of them stella pulled a wry face especially if that idiot tomaselli puts all their backs up like he usually manages to do her eyes lit up the latest malicious gossip is about sophia believe it or not shes been slipping out of the fortress to come and see a lover down in the old town maria snorted i didnt think anyone was that desperate stella giggled in a worldlywise fashion honey there are some men that would make love to a hole in the wall and others like alberto who would just fall asleep im going to ration his wine soon if you take me down to meet the women hiding out in the woodstore ill give you a drop of this perfume to put behind your ears maria showed her the bottle it was given to me by the contessa she guaranteed it would even wake her old man up stella chuckled throatily if it can wake that old man up it should be called resurrection juice not perfume youre on sister when maria went down to the woodstore with stella she was shocked by the thinness of the women and by their obvious desperation we cant go on like this kyria said one young girlbarely sixteen and trying to nurse a pair of twins i just dont have milk for them any more maria took a deep breath were going to sort this out by tomorrow nobody should have to starve like this we expected the siege to be over in a few weeks at most when will help come from venice asked an older woman bitterly are we only worth keeping as expendable serfs and not worth protecting maria looked her straight in the eye venice had to be told before they could mount a rescue and the island is blockaded you know that i can tell you this mucha messenger has gone over to italy taking word to venice a clever messenger who can get past anything she wondered just where benito was and uttered a silent prayer for his wellbeing the republic wont fail you and the scuolo wont fail you either your men work for us its up to us to care for you she was surprised by the hastily hushed cheers that evening umberto arrived home a little late and looking worried he didnt even notice marias belladonnawidened eyes at first he was just looking gray and stooped he took the cup of wine gratefully from her hand then swallowed a long appreciative draft and then blinked at his wife youre looking beautiful tonight dear and your hair is done up in that way i like so his nose twitched he smiled tiredly im a lucky man and i dont appreciate you enough and how is our little girl tonight maria felt truly guilty like a complete slut shes fine asleep now she said gruffly she decided that directness and honesty suited her better than feminine wiles she was better at those than seduction anyway umberto i need to talk to you about the wives of the corfiote laborers theyre hiding in the back sheds at the little arsenal he replied conversationally she didnt need the belladonna to widen her eyes had everyone known except her im sorry dear he said apologetically thats what kept me there was a fight between one of the illyrians and a corfiotesomething to do with the women im afraid both of them are with the hospitalers i had to see to it oh hell she said in dismay will this mean fighting between the illyrians and corfiotes he actually laughed not unless they both dont recover from being hit by me with a cladding plank she stared seeing a man she hadnt known hiding in umbertos very ordinary frame i had to do something he said uncomfortably the corfiote accused the illyrian of betraying the women to the guards but guildmaster grisini asked the guard to organize more food quietly two guards called oliviolo and nona it was umbertos turn to gape at her how did you know because far from organizing more food the pair of bastards have been extorting money and food from the corfiotes she told him with savage satisfaction the corfiotes blame the illyrians which is where your knifefight came from umberto shook his head i dont understand them theyre our people why didnt they come to us the scuolo looks after its own looking at him with a mixture of pride and love maria realized that the perfume probably wasnt wasted after all and she realized thatjust as old women always saidyou didnt have to be in love with the man you married to learn to love him can i get you some supper she asked rubbing his shoulders he looked at her speculatively with a shy smile maybe later chapter the end came faster and more abruptly than any of the conspirators had anticipated and it came at a damned awkward moment for maria shed gone up to the governors palace the day before and missed seeing the contessa not wishing to make herself too obvious shed waited until this morning umberto had told her last night that the two guards had been transferred on to another duty so something must be happening renate de belmondo had been organizing among the things shed organized maria found when she got up to the palace was a huge basket of foodstuffs maria had the muscle in her back and shoulders from years of working heavy loads in a small boatthis basket she could hardly carry its too heavy milady renate de belmondo smiled youll manage there is considerable stagemanagement to be done before we can bring them out of there those women and children need food and there are a lot of them so maria had staggered down to the sheds they were a good place to hide actually their men had chosen well although the sheds were within the compound they were well away from the rest of the yardup a steep bank where there was a winch for loading materials from the street and a chute for sending timbers down to the workshops or the shipgate they were used when ships were in port and kept securely locked when they werent at the moment there just wasnt the call for cladding or masts getting up there unnoticed was considerably more difficult but as umbertos wife she could at least get into the shipyard she was distributing the contents of the contessas basket when a hoarse whisper came up the bank hide maria found herself dragged hastily into a long cavity roofed with masts and stacks of timber it was dark hot and airless and also a vain effort captaingeneral tomasellis men knew exactly where to look somebody had plainly told them where to go the women maria included were hauled blinking into the bright july sunlight maria knew that the one thing she must not do was to reveal who she was at the moment the scuolo could still claim injured innocence if they found her here the cat would be out of the bag alessia was safely with stella but any baby would do for camouflage almost all of them were awakened by the rough handling and almost all of them were crying the poor mites were mostly hungry she borrowed one hastily if there was one thing shed learned since alessias birth it was that very few men will look directly at a breastfeeding woman that is not their own it was as near as she could come to disappearing she also realized that the moment was more serious even than shed thought there were some seventy of the captaingenerals soldiersquite enough to deal with frightened women and a gaggle of children what the captaingeneral hadnt taken into account was that there were some hundred or so corfiote porters and laborers in the arsenal and they werent about to watch their wives and children being herded away without a fight even if they werent soldiers they were men in a shipyard full of edged tools and more than just tools within less than a minute a dozen angrily shouting laborers were standing on the walls around the compound holding one between each two of them pots of boiling pitch there was something very persuasive about that boiling pitch a few of the troopers had been behaving with a fair amount of roughness to the captives they suddenly became positively respectful what do you men think youre doing demanded the captaingeneral you tell them to leave our women and children alone and no one will get hurt it was a very nasty situation on one hand the troops were armed and armored they had the women and children as virtual hostages on the other hand armor is no defense against hot pitch and the corfiotes were between them and the way out of the shipyard something else ominous was happening beyond the corfiotes too the scuolo being venetian guildsmen were all part of the militia so they were in the habit of bringing their weapons and breastplates to work for duties afterwardand now they were arriving armed in dribs and drabs they were positioned behind the corfiotes with their pitch and crowbars their felling axes and knives one of the guildsmen pushed forward dont try to stop this master grisini said the big corfiote were desperate men the elderly guildmaster sniffed irritably weve no intention of stopping you but i warn you dopappas you get one drop of that pitch on my deckplanking and ill shove that cauldron up your ass maria risked a quick peep to see that her umberto was backing old grisini up coming up the ramp to where the soldiers stood with their prisoners the master wasnt a big man the corfiote laborer he was threatening was enormous but the corfiote nodded respectfully yes master grisini but they want to take our women grisini sighed gustily im old im tired but im also aware of the scuolos rights and responsibilities the corfiote blinked the old man walked on through the corfiotes umberto following behind him maria saw that some more entrants had arrived for the affair the contessa de belmondo and her husband the governor and peering nervously through the gate stella with alessia and several of her own children shed plainly gotten a message to the contessa good morning and what is happening here de belmondo enquired with gentle curiosity weve found these illegal entrants hiding here your excellency said the captaingeneral these men seem set on daring to rebel against legally constituted military authority in a war zone the penalty for that is death as you might like to remind them old grisini bowed respectfully to the governor morning your excellency we seem to have a problem here about authority would you please explain to the captaingeneral that the little arsenal is part of the arsenal of venicenot part of the military of corfu he has no authority here we explained that to him when he tried to draft us but he doesnt seem to understand it the captaingeneral looked frigidly at him in this case food and shelter intended for the islands people are being wasted on these women de belmondo blinked are these women and children from some other island then no but theyre not venetian theyre locals tomasellis tone added the unsaid words and thus beneath contempt i do not recallas governor of this venetian possessionanything which abrogates our responsibility for locals as you put it the governors voice was decidedly frosty in fact i wasnt even aware of any such official category of people but theyre here illegally sputtered the captaingeneral old grisini snorted not to make too fine a point of itso are you tomaselli they are in our building theyre the wives and children of our employees well see to them well see to their appropriate treatment the captaingeneral played his trump card not with the food from the citadels stores they must be put out de belmondo shook his head i cannot allow you to do that and i dont think your men would be prepared to do something that would have them forever labeled as murderers of women and children the senate of the republic would have my head and yours this plainly hadnt struck nico tomaselli but we cant just allow them to freeload on the citadels stores umberto cleared his throat excuse me milords i have an idea if we put these women to work for the republic they would be entitled to a place as these men are the captaingeneral sneered you havent even got work for yourselves besides what can they do umberto answered instantly weave sailcloth we have flax but the stores of sailcloth are very low and what do we do with sailcloth in a siege grumbled tomaselli but you could see he was weakening there is life after siege we hope said de belmondo and if there isnt well we shall have no use for anythingnever mind sailcloth there was no help for it maria came and had her nameelena commena she decidedscribed in the book with the other workers wives umberto nearly dropped his quill but why sailcloth the flax is intended for ropes umberto its too coarse for good sailcloth said old grisini hed virtually collapsed when the tension and need wenthe was in his late seventies and it was hard on him umberto paused bit his lip trying to think how best to put this to the old man because master the captaingeneral is right we dont have work for ourselves thats really the main reason theres fighting and dissatisfaction so i have been thinking ever since the teutonic knights arrived here under fire that we need to be able to strike at the enemy ships we have everything we need except brass nails and sailcloth to build ships ourselves the old man blinked at him confused we cant launch ships and without nails we cant even build them umberto shrugged weve got iron nails by the bushel master and we can lower smallish craft directly over the walls but what good will that do asked master grisini tiredly the enemy has some huge carracks out there and iron nails will just rust if the boats are on fire they can burn craft thirty times their size and they wont have time for the nails to rust its a good idea conceded the old master shipbuilder after thinking about it for a few moments but how are we to convince the military of that the captaingeneral would not exactly thank us for military help umberto shrugged we will deal with that like we did with this when the time comes in the meanwhile we can give the men work to do itll cut down on the fights sophia tomaselli lay wakeful trapped in her husbands bed by the sleeping mans leg she wanted out of here out of this boring mans bed and away from his clumsy and drunken rutting and rutting was the right word too she knew perfectly well he was only taking out his frustration with the world by mounting her as soon as she could get out of here sophia would make her way through the dark streets to her new interest now there was a man who could teach this husband of hers a thing or two about lovemaking she felt herself aroused by the very thought of the shameful exciting lust the thrill of forbidden pleasuring and she had some information about the plans for repulsing any attack on the inner wall he always rewarded her well for these little snippets bianca closed the lid of the chest in her room after finishing the needed rituals to prevent decay fortunately she didnt need a large chest nor had the rituals taken much timein both cases because the body of the beggar boy was so small the corpse would keep for the moment under the linens thered be no telltale traces of putrefaction coming from the chest for at least a month by then bianca would have saluzzo under her control and would have him dispose of the body in some more permanent manner she put that problem out of her mind right now she needed to concentrate on finishing the materials needed for the ritual shed use to have her relatives removed the beggar boys blood needed to be mixed properly with the fat she had carved from his internal organs the very little fat unfortunatelythe beggar boy hadnt been emaciated exactly but hed been scrawny there had been a little around the liver the intestines not as much as she had hoped she might have to extend it with some of her other unguents and hope that the principles of contact and similarity would make good the deficiencies gingerly she fingered her forearm where the boy had punched her at the end she thought thered be a bruise there by the morning little bastard hed put up more of a fight than shed expected once he realized the arm shed wrapped around his throat was intended to kill him rather than to hug him true it hadnt been much of contest bianca had not yet dared begin the rituals that would eventually provide her with the superhuman strength of her mistress countess bartholdy but she was still a fullgrown woman wellfed and in good health against her murderous resolve a malnourished fiveyearold boy had had no chance at all she just wished that he had been a little fatter she lit the brazier under the bowl containing the blood and fat and picked up the special instruments carved from human bones with her right hand she began stirring slowly while with her left sprinkling into the mix the other ingredients required all the while softly chanting the needed phrases and intonations some of the words had never been meant to be formed by a human mouth as the mixture cooked down she saw that there was no help for it she would have to add precious defiled and deconsecrated oils to the recipe or there would not be enough of it for her purpose she reached for the vials and added them carefully drop by drop watching for some change that would warn her that this addition had soured the mix but it didnt in fact as she added the precious fluids so difficult to come by and so very expensive she felt the sullen power in the bowl increasing and her lips stretched in a little smile of surprise well well well last of all she added the ingredients that had been the most difficult of all to obtain the powdered hair of her aunt and uncle and allowed the fire to die away beneath the bowl finally the mixture ceased to bubble and she now had for all of her effort a little puddle of a thick black tarry substance in the bottom of the bowlblack as tar but not sticky no this stuff would be smooth and creamy to the touch and would swiftly vanish into whatever it was combined with or rubbed on leaving no outward trace and the power contained within it made her laugh aloud we must find this monster hissed eneko his hand came up and stroked a brow gone suddenly pale i have not sensed such a shriek of pure evil since diego if anything looked even more shaken at least we finally know the creatures sex its got to be a woman that ritualdone that way with a child francis and pierre were frowning neither of them had the depth of knowledge regarding the black arts that eneko and diego possessed francis was a healer essentially and while pierres talents as a witchsmeller were superb that was by its nature an applied rather than theoretical skill theyd sensed the sudden blast of evil magic that had seemed for a moment to shake the entire island but theyd been unable to discern the details a woman queried pierre are you sure eneko shook his head say a female rather that thing is no longer human in any sense of the term that matters chapter commander leopoldo had chosen to come and see manfred while the knights were at morning drill because he could do so while remaining unobtrusive a party of menand an officerwould come to do a stockcount at the magazine every wednesday anyway leopoldo did this duty himself sometimes so his presence while they were drilling in the courtyard was unremarkable when the knights broke for a rest it was simplicity itself to walk the few hundred feet under the arcade to the shade where manfred sat with his watchdogs and squat down so that he was virtually invisible he was not a man given to peacocky clothes like captaingeneral tomaselli milords im looking for some quiet advice ive little siege experience and some things are worrying me falkenberg grunted not half as much as they worry me and i have plenty of siege experience manfred grinned at the young venetian what can we help you with commander be warned you give falkenberg here the opening for a word on sieges and hell give you ten thousand and redesign your fortress hes done so at least five times since we got here gino leopoldo smiled back a little nervously the captaingeneral has expressly forbidden me to fraternize with you milord prince so if you dont mind keeping this quiet i want to ask about those moles manfred nodded theyre creeping closer erik destroying the magazine out there stopped the covering fire for nearly twelve days but ten or twelve more days should see the south one complete another day the north and emerics siegemaster has men on a bucket chain on the south side of the spianada you can bet he has a tunnel project going what are the plans to deal with this lot the captaingeneral has decided to keep us in the dark the stocky young man grabbed a hank of his hair and tugged at it he sighed were planning on a sortie from the main gate with footmen i see said manfred putting a restraining hand on falkenberg tell me more are these pikemen or arquebusiers or both arquebusiers in a tercio only the shingle is very narrow no room for a tercio manfred put another hand on von gherenss shoulder i see but there are two moles how are they to face both the first tercio will go south the second north the captaingeneral is certainly rewriting the science of war said manfred so calmly that he thought francesca would have been proud of him falkenberg could take it no more no preemptive strike to destroy the moles the young venetian shook his head no flanking from the posterns leopoldo shook his head again von gherens exploded foot soldiers is the man insane the minute those clumsy tercios try and get out of the gate the magyar are going to charge from both sides without pikemen to allow the arquebusiers to reload theyll annihilate them and the front gatell be so packed with fleeing men theyll never close it er yes i know manfreds eyes narrowed so where are the cavalry supposed to be in all this where are we supposed to be leopoldo looked if possible even more uncomfortable the captaingeneral wants to prove youre unnecessary and my cavalryand i dont have much to begin withis going to be kept in reserve for any streetfighting he shook his head ruefully at the gaping knights i am in charge of the citadel garrison but he is in charge of me there is not a lot i can do falkenberg took a deep breath then i guess it is up to us manfred shook his head lets just remember what erik and you two have drummed into my head the minute the first shot is fired the best battle plan in the world comes apart and then of course commanders must act on their own initiative what can you do the commander shrugged all id thought of was the cannon the captaingeneral has said theyre irrelevant because the fighting will be below the walls ive got about two hundred pikemen he seems to have forgotten in his plans aldo morando sat sipping his wine waiting for fianelli to come he had a few interesting snippets for which emerics agent would pay well these rich spoiled womenespecially sophia tomaselliwere proving very effective spies and now that hed convinced sophia that she should try to seduce prince manfred true aldo would be surprised if she actually managed the feat sophia was attractive enough but nothing compared to the princes leman francesca de chevreuse still who knew some menmorando was one of them himselfenjoyed variety it was worth a try if she succeeded aldo would possibly gain access to information hitherto locked away to this point hed been able to discover nothing about the inner workings of the imperial contingent in the citadel there was hardly any risk after all to morando at least if sophia was publicly rebuffed or got caught in the course of success the whole thing would just be ascribed to her sexual appetiteswhich were already fairly notorious in the citadel even if her dimwitted husband knew nothing about it morando yawned and success would have the added advantage of distracting sophia from him ye gods the woman was demanding she came to him so often that hed finally been forced to show her the secret entrance or else she would have surely been spotted truth be told morando preferred his sexual liaisons to be with someone like bianca casarini casual relaxed basically distant despite the physical intimacy speaking of whom he should start considering with bianca the best ways to get out of here when the place fell they couldnt hide in the cellar forever after all and there was no point in being rich and dead he knew she was no more trustful than he was of king emerics final intentions toward his spies and agents on corfu shed proven to be an excellent partner and he thought she might be willing to continue the partnership somewhere else the aquitaine perhaps bianca would like the aquitaine sophia watched until francesca went out into the town behind the second wall shed gone beyond being nervous about it after all men were just creatures of lust easy to manipulate and the thought of copulating with royalty once morando got her to think about it seriously was exciting she made her way across from her suitable vantage point where she had been apparently painting a picture of the battle scene down to the princes chambers she was about to knock when the door opened sophia took one horrified look at the profile of the woman turning to speak to the prince and fled maria verrier was not whom shed expected to find there beating her to her quarry she should be back soon you must literally have missed her at the gate said manfred anything important no well its just odd you know umbertos been doing nightwatches all of the men from the little arsenal have well he told me that theyve all been taken off duties on the north wall and at the tower that guards the postern at the little arsenal hmm so whos taken over maria shrugged and how would i know prince manfred she opened the door to leave as she did so manfred said if you hearfrom your sidejust who is on that shift let me know as soon as possible she turned back and nodded i will who was that who had turned and ran when she saw her sophias face was contorted with fury i want her womb to shrivel and her breasts to turn to wrinkled driedout dugs i want her marriage blighted i want her baby to scream i want her dead shes a thorn in my flesh you promised me the curses give them to me aldo morando didnt entirely follow the logic of the woman but then if shed been logical shed have been useless to him it seemed such a slight thing but sophia tomaselli was unused to even the slightest check on her he lifted an eyebrow as he had practiced so long in the mirror it made him look he thought particularly satanic it had the desired effect on her anyway please master she petted and fawned now remember that power has a price he meant it in money she didnt oh yes whatever you like master morando considered the problem for a moment before deciding to accede to sophias wishes she was an attractive enough woman after all and if she was now willing to do anything morando told her to that could give better returnsas good at leastas her spying leaving aside her own charms such as they were there were plenty of men in the citadel who would pay handsomely for spreading this ones legsjust to cuckold her husband to think shed originally come to him to help with fertility shed lost interest in that now hed certainly entrapped her well this was what real satanists were supposed to do typically those who were crazy enough to deal with the devil were not as good at it as he was who did what he did for a sensible god money he nodded very well come tonight at midnight some things like this cannot be achieved under the sun bring gloves when shed left morando reflectively scratched his beard the belief in curses and cantrips was a strain on his imagination a good curse token had to have one dominant feature it had to convince the user so morando used some of the popularly recognized symbols deadly nightshade henbane pigweed a rat skull some blood and to ensure it smelled rightly vilea sprig of parsley dipped in the privy all tied together with entrails and a strip of parchment with a lot of garbage scrawled on it in red ink the thing should cause a disease just by being in the house thought morando inspecting the concoction with satisfaction if the recipient found itwell belike they would think themselves bewitched that was usually enough to make a spell seem to work at midnight with the inner room suitably lit with seven green candles he handed it to her from under his cloak you must hold it with a glove only and you must burn the glove afterwards saying the words rotas astor sotar sator araso seven times he repeated the words twice carefully as if they really meant something it should be placed under the victims bed or within the hearth ashes she reached a gloved hand eagerly for the bunch what is in it some things which you are not ready to learn the powers of but dont shake it it has gravemold from the tomb of an unbaptized infant mixed with the blood from the menses of a virgin sacrifice he managed to say the last sentence with a completely solemn expression on his face a bit difficult that was she took it eagerly but carefully holding it as one might fragile porcelain her face a candlelightshadowed study in nastiness morando knew a brief inward shudder from what he could work out the victims main crime was a lack of respect for sophia morando knew that he was dealing with a sick mind here but business was business after all besides morando had the psychological shrewdness of any successful swindler and procurer bianca casarini was by nature an independent sort of creature she might very well decide to go her separate way after the citadel fell and they made their escape to the mainland if so it would be wise to make sure that sophia was still with him she knew the secret entrance and would come to the cellar herself when it looked like the fortress was finally falling hed already somewhat reluctantly made the arrangements with her now thinking back he was glad hed done so sophia would have no choice but to abandon her past life and place herself under aldos wing she was an attractive woman and still young enough the one thing about the future that was sure and certain was that a pimp could always get by chapter maria habitually took umberto something to eat and a small jug of watered wine at about vespers bell now that the little arsenal was working so late it was amazing how purpose had transformed that place everyone but a few of the illyrians seemed to be getting on fairly well she walked out carrying alessia and a basket closing the door behind her few people owned locks here maria and umberto werent among them there was little enough to steal and besides the goat was turning into a terror all she wanted was food but then would a thief be aware of this the thief might of course want to steal her with each passing day the taste of meat became more of a memory there was of course food even meat to be bought some of it legitimately and on the open market the produce of a few gardens or hoarded by the wise before the event a few fish caught over the walls that went down into the sea someundoubtedly stolen from the citadels storeson the black market that flourished for those who had real money maria and umberto didnt number among them she was deep in these thoughts when the bleating of goatshed never acquired a name despite umberto wanting to call her satanpenetrated her brown study she turned back to the house the door was closed but it sounded as if the goat was inside there was no telling what the creature would do if shed got into the house maria turned and ran back as fast as a baby and a basket would allow she unlatched the door and burst into the small living room goat had someone cornered by the hearth a cloaked woman who was thrashing away at her with a bunch of something maria had a moments delay to put the baby down and then she sprang forward she didnt think the intruder dangeroushalf her mind was on restraining goat she abruptly changed her mind the intruder was all manic scratching strength only the fact that the woman wore gloves saved marias eyes maria swung the basket it and the strange bunch of stuff in the womans hands landed just short of the grate the woman grabbed desperately for the bunch maria lunged for her the womans gloved hand and forearm ended up in the hot ash as they wrestled the intruder might be manic but maria had both the weight and upperbody strength advantage on her opponent maria pressed her opponents arm down against the fire grate was rewarded by a terrible scream and a savage bite on her shoulder then as the woman broke free grabbing a poker someone called maria maria are you all right maria used the moments distraction to grab the pokerwielding left hand as well as the other arm there was a frantic moments struggle as old mrs grisiniwhom to maria seemed halfabsent from her own mind most of the timepeered at them then the strange hooded and masked woman wriggled her hand from the glove and tore free bolting for the open back door maria ran after but she slipped on the spilled wine from her basket and fell winding herself by the time she got up gasping mrs grisini had picked up and was comforting alessia she reminds me of my own babes i lost all of them you know said the old woman in a dreamy voice as if she had not just witnessed a savage fight the old ladys minder a young corfiote girl hurried in kyria kyria where are you she saw the old lady with considerable relief oh thank heavens then she took in the rest of the scene what happened she looked at the bunch of strange stuff on the hearth that goat was sniffing screamed and pointed maria nearly had her breath back now she weakly shooed goat off then took a closer look at what had made the young corfiote girl scream it was pretty unappetizing whatever it was there was a rat skull and some hair and some plants maria had grown up in venice she wouldnt have recognized many food plants before theyd gone to stay in istria but there old issie had at least showed her some of those that were dangerousincluding the deadly nightshade which she recognized in the bundle a curse the girl crossed herself hastily so did maria old mrs grisini just looked dreamily at alessia maria reached for the revolting bunch of nastiness to toss it into the hot ashes dont touch squeaked the girl dont touch kyria maria looked at the glove she was still clutching makes sense so what do i do with the damned thing then you must take it to the papas the priests kyria said the girl fearfully maria shook herself i suppose so but how she didnt have so many pots that she wanted to sully any of them with the horrid bundle then she had an inspiration the pot beneath the bed it was only clay and could use replacing anyway the curse bunch fitted into the pot the pot fitted into the basket she tossed the glove in too poor umberto would just have to wait for his dinner most of it was in the ashes anyway and maria didnt know what shed find to give him instead there wasnt too much to spare in the cupboard she went to old mrs grisini who reluctantly parted with alessia and allowed the young corfiote girl to lead her home maria set out once again she was heading for the church at first but then she changed her mind and headed for the small hypatian chapel if there was one person who knew all about magic and witchcraft it was that terrifying eneko lopez who was now staying in the monks cells behind the chapel with his companions if they were there of course they seemed very busy these days trying to wander around the citadel looking innocent and failing completely they were up to something maria was sure fortune favored her this time they werent in their rooms but they were at prayer in the chapel along with the nun whose gardens were a byword in the town not knowing how to disturb them she waited one the tall dark one noticed her can we help you signorina eneko lopezs heavy line of dark brow drew together as he looked at her he nodded maria verrier the friend and maid of honor to katerina montescue are you looking for us maria nodded father uh yes you are an expert on witchcraft i think lopez smiled wryly the others chuckled i have had to deal with various forms of pagan magic whether that qualifies me as an expert i dont know but how may i help you she opened her basket and to everyones surprise took out the very recognizable pot and pointed into it i interrupted someone leaving this in my house looking up and seeing the bemusement on the faces of the monks she realized the possible confusion uh i just used this pot to carry it in i didnt want to touch it i think it is a curse the priests came up and peered into the pot come put it in front of the altar let us exorcize it anyway said eneko lopez taking it from her and this other thing in here its a glove the woman who was putting it in my house lost it in the struggle she was using gloves to carry the thing enekos line of eyebrow raised he went and placed the pot in front of the altar he and the others arranged four candles very precisely around it and then began to sprinkle salt and then water and burn incense as they chanted a psalm while walking around the pot maria tried very earnestly to pray not for herself so much but for alessia children were very vulnerable to disease she wasnt sure but she thought they might be especially vulnerable to black magic also when theyd finished one of the priests went and fetched a pair of fine tongssimple black iron things but surprisingly delicate they blessed the tongs and asked for protection on them and then they began examining the bunch of plants and other fragments carefully after a few minutes eneko came over to where maria still knelt maria he spoke gently and in a way shed not expected from such a man with understanding i know this is very frightening but i have some good news for you that revolting thing is as magical as a brick it was someone playing a very unpleasant and particularly nasty trick its a complete fraud one of the other priests had come up too a fraud by a person who knew more than is good for them about black magic and its symbols but a fraud nonetheless the words on the strip that bind the bunch together are indeed some demon names but two of them are misspelled and there are no words of summoning and one of those is the demon associated with senile dementia and the others are of little relevance either but the smell the other monks had come up by this time i think you put it in the right place said one of them it has been dipped in night soil unpleasant and smelly certainly but quite unmagical of that we are certain a pity said the other i really thought diego that at last we had a lead on these devilworshipers the short dark saturnine one shook his head im afraid not eneko patted maria reassuringly although youre disappointed i dont think maria is maria shuddered no not at all but are you sure it is harmless absolutely certain there is not even a trace of magic about this thing the woman i interrupted didnt think so she fought me like a mad thing she obviously believed in it eneko walked back to the pot you say this was her glove a wealthy enemy this one of yours maria had come over to it too she looked at the glove it was made of the finest blemishfree kid with small pearl studs yes someone wealthy beyond marias dreams of avarice someone who could afford to spend on a pair of gloves the kind of money that maria didnt spend on clothes in a year she shook her head but who i dont really have any enemiesnot that hate me that much surely and i know hardly any wealthy people here on corfu at least hmm do you want this pot back right away we might try divining on it if we fail in this project were currently busy with said eneko it may not lead us any closer to the devilworshipers we seek but it may be a good idea to root out whatever fraud is preying on people and letting their worst natures lead them into this maria looked at the pot and shuddered again i certainly dont want it back ever chapter emeric smiled rapaciously looking at the assembled cavalry when the details of the planned sorties had reached him hed been unable to believe the naivete of them but fianelli assured him that the information was absolutely rock solid it came from the best of sources emeric had told count dragorvich his siegemaster the count had simply stared at him and then begun laughing why not just give us the keys to the gate your majesty were finishing the south first so theyll face the south well sire you wanted to use the heavy cavalry if this is really their battle plan here is the opportunity emeric nodded light skirmishers and a testudocovered ram on foot as the sacrificial troops not too many use some of those slovenes and when the gates are full of arquebusiersa twoprong charge and tell the gunners not to aim for the gate any more we want it to be able to open nicely and easily the moles had been basically complete since the previous day emeric made no effort to push troops across them yet but kept the men working on them widening and improving them even clearing the sheltering mole walls making the moles into causeways under heavy venetian fire then in the morning the first skirmishers began pushing across using leather shields to protect them as best as possible with them came the testudo and ram on its clumsy wooden wheels watching from the southern postern falkenberg scowled somethings wrong prince even the captaingeneral cant believe that in an age of black powder and cannon someone is going to sit and pound the gate down with a ram theyre waiting for a sortie thats why there are so few of them they are supposed to be able to get out of the way of the heavy cavalry when it comes we just happen to be wandering around with a hundred knights in full armor near the gate we know nothing about this said manfred and neither does that ass hark there they go the trumpet sounded the sortie give it three hundred heartbeats before the first volley and ten before the charge said falkenberg professionally he might have been off by two heartbeats when a horn blew on the spianada here come the magyars even from half a mile across the water they could hear the thunder all right said manfred out lances ritters commander leopoldo on foot among his arquebusiers watched as it began going wrong theyd burst out of the gate the press of men behind him the captaingeneral perched on a showy gray rapier in hand attempted to organize them the few slovenes had fled abandoning the testudo and diving into the water reloa the yells and thunder of heavy cavalry massed and waiting between emerics earth cannonramparts drowned the rest coming in a thick mass ten abreast hungarys finest streamed onto the mole causeways leopoldo gritted his teeth waiting emerics cannon were not firingtoo much chance of hitting his own troops or possibly preventing the sortie so until that moment had leopoldos gunners been holding their fire also now all the citadels guns that it was possible to bring to bear on the causeways fired in unison leopoldo had had help from the bluescarred knot bombardier in ranging and even in the choice of ball in those cannon the chainshotintended to bring down masts sails and rigginghit the two hungarian charges like sudden brick walls one minute the hungarians had been unstoppable the next stopped but the knights had been right about their foe leopoldo saw not even that would stop them and now the cannon would have to reload the pikemen on the walls poured the pitch and even managed to fling a few barrels to burst and shatter on the shingle just short of the north and south bastions what are they doing screamed the captaingeneral furiously he waved his sword wildly at them wait until they get to you you idiots but they were obviously too far off to hear that panicking too some had even thrown a few faggots into the sticky mess and in their panic obviously everything else on handincluding caltrops and a number of burning brands leopoldo knew a moments heartstop when the naphtha and faggots on the south didnt catch pitch always was the devil to light then some brave soul tossed a grenade into it between two fires but still with half his men inside the gate the captaingeneral yelled charge his horse reared and he waved his sworda heroic figure and then he fell off his horse its one of those things that will happen even to the finest horsemanif a trusted sergeant has undone the belly cinch but leopold had no time to watch he had a battle to deal with he began bellowing orders which did not include charge the knights of the holy trinity charged instead sortieing from the northern and southern posterns hitting the flanks of the magyars they trapped some between the wall the fire and themselves others they flung back onto the causeway the magyars had lost most of their impetus the sheer weight of their charge that made them so unstoppable in the cannon barrage and then theyd had to gallop onto the thin strip of pebbles in front of the walls and then the burning beach horseseven welltrained warhorsesdo not like fire and the arquebusiers on the other side of the flames were making a very orderly retreat fire a rank step back within the gates the officers had pushed the tercio apart and sent the men up onto the walls above the knights of the holy trinity had the full two hundred and fifty yards to build their impetus and on the narrow strip of land superior numbers were no advantage the knights didnt like challengers to their position as the foremost heavy cavalry in europe and they inflicted a sharp lesson and once the causeway was packed with men dying men fleeing horses leaping into the water they retreated at a sharp trumpet call the nearrout was just being turning into a rally and second assault when the reloaded cannon fired a second time this time the targets were packed as tightly as possible the carnage was terrible the second charge of the knights of the holy trinity was not so fast or fierce but the resistance of the foe was gone the pride of hungary were streaming from the causeways and now the rout was unstoppable even with emerics savage discipline the hastily following venetian sappers running up with kegs of black powder whirling slowmatches and a prayer had a good while in which to work before one of emerics generals had the sense to push foot soldiers and croats forward emeric himself had been too preoccupied shrieking threats at his cavalrymen the southern mole was blown apart and only a narrow ridge remained of the northern one and someone had been kind enough to drag the captaingeneral inside emeric seethed with rage once he realized hed stumbled into a trap i will crush them i will crack them like lice every man woman and child in that citadel will die despite his fury a calm and calculating part of him was finally accepting the truth the citadel would not fallnot quickly enough anywaysimply through military means and while it might fall to treachery treason was in the nature of things a slippery weapon ill have to go back to hungary and ask for help damn her eyes ah your majesty count dragorvich a clever man who always made sure that the king made all the crucial decisionsand took the credit for them naturallywas without words this time he just pointed the ricks of hay for the cavalry were on fire someone had obviously made the best of the distraction offered by the assault to attack their rear again get me the blond emeric hissed now youre supposed to be an advisor to the emperor alexius vi of constantinople why are you still here asked emeric looking at the blond man there was a pause i am here to see to my masters interests an interesting reply thought emeric which master however all he said was it is very much in your masters interests to see us win here and win decisively and soon so i have a task for you there is one of these venetiansor rather an imperialon the loose he and his men are attacking our rear our supplies our materiel even our men king emeric leaned forward in his throne ive checked on your background aldanto i know who you are my milanese traitor and sellsword this is the right sort of task for you i think find erik hakkonsenor his woman find them and bring them in hakkonsen i will have dead happily if you only get the woman see that she survives if not quite as she was but in a good enough state to be bait in the meantime im returning to hungary to fetch more troops and enlist some very powerful support when i come back i want to see hakkonsens head the blond man paused and then nodded jerkily hakkonsen yes good said emeric nastily thatll keep you and that yellow dog of yours busy chernobog did understand longstanding hatreds for such things were meat and drink to itand it indulged in such things itself from time to time it also understood the elimination of threats hakkonsen was the one who had put that throbbing scar on his forehead the puppet himself hated the icelander for that matter insofar as the puppet was still able to feel anything as for emeric well emeric did not merely nurse his grudges he nurtured and watered them with blood something else that chernobog understood so the demon would cooperate it did not do this for emeric or in fear of emeric it did this for itself compared to hunting for this places seats of power hunting peasants around the maquis was as easy as breathing to the shaman he sent the hawks up spotted a peasant and his son and hunted them down with caesare and his croat escort you will find these hillfighters said the scarylooking blond in charge of the soldiers you will ask other peasants until you find them and then you will give the leader this note you will tell him i am a greek with the imperial fleetbut that i am from corfu i am shocked by the devastation and wish to strike back at the hungarians your family has worked for mine for many years if he comes your son is free do you understand the boy was perhaps four years old the greek peasant nodded yes he paused quavered do you promise you will do nothing to hurt him the blond blinked of course the yellow dog made no promises it seems worth looking into said erik it would hit emeric where it hurts money and weapons we certainly need but can we trust this xerxes my family have worked for them for many years sir said the peasant nervously wringing his hands eriks heart went out to the man to be loyal enough to go looking for people the hungarians would kill still it could be a trap ill meet him go back to him and tell him there is a small mountain just north of giannades theres a shepherds hut on the ridge ill meet him there at moonset alone anyone else and hell die youd better come back as a hostage too where will i find you master asked the man im from down south i dont know my way around these foreign parts the corfiotes always managed to make their island sound six hundred miles long not about forty just come up this valley someone will see you and bring you to me the man nodded resignedly you must let me see my little one before i will go back you must there was an edge of hysteria and distrust in that voice the one named aldanto shrugged see but not touch or speak to hes in the hut guarded by the dog the peasant walked fearfully to the entrance of the hut that yellow dog made him very nervous then peeking inside his face relaxed he stared a while then turned and reset his face into a grim determination very well but you hurt him and i will kill you the blond smiled at him just do your part you will let him go unhurt i will not touch a hair on the boys head if you do as youre told i swear it and ill reward you with ten gold ducats i dont want money just my child he turned and left high up in the clear blue sky two hawks turned too in the shepherds hut the shaman studied what was left of the boy only a scrap of chewed bone on the bloody but once lovingly embroidered childs waistcoat just enough to conjure a good seeming from the magical principals of contagion and sympathy the dogs long red tongue licked the yellow teeth even the marrow in those dainty bones had been sweet this is a bad place hawks keep chasing rabbits your control over them is weak i have their names they cannot do this grumbled the shaman muttering a string of words in finnourgic the caesare puppet shrugged well we have the general locality we have a rendezvous we need to plan everything carefully its not going to be easy ive tried to ambush this one before once it went badly bianca was finally able to get rid of her relatives the day after the failed hungarian assault at her suggestion her supposed uncle and aunt ventured outside with her the next morning sharing in the general glee of the citadels inhabitants that another of emerics ploys had failed they headed toward the walls wanting to see the nowruined moles their path as bianca ushered them along took them by an old stonewalled building that had suffered a fair amount of damage from cannon fire since the siege began some of the stones were now loose held in place by wooden bracing the night before under cover of darkness bianca had smeared the stones and the wood supports with the special ointment shed made up then softly spoken the necessary incantations over them she accompanied her uncle and aunt on their promenade chatting with them cheerfully as they neared the wall of the old building she stopped suddenly and went down on one knee my shoes got something in it ill catch up with you they continued on when the moment was right bianca murmured the final words of the incantation it all worked very nicely following the principles of contagion and similarity the wooden supports gave way and almost sailed toward her victims heads the loose stones followed completing the work by the time biancas screams brought passersby to help her in her frantic attempts to remove the debris her relatives were quite dead the face and skull of her aunt were so badly crushed as to be unrecognizable four priests standing already at the fortress walls and inspecting the ruined moles seemed to flinch as one man two of them raised hands to their heads as if in sudden pain and again hissed eneko who is she wondered diego lowering his hands slowly and a bit shakily and where is she hiding i dont know but we must start searching for her in earnest this creature must be stopped chapter something about the whole situation made erik nervous it just didnt feel right the rest of you stay back here deploy scouts on the ridge kari basil dimitris lets go forward the hut appeared deserted a low stone structure a mere single room it didnt appear to have many possible hiding places and except for the long moonlit shadows of the ridgeline they were advancing down no close hiding places erik sniffed it was a balmy night and warm air was full of the scents of wild thyme so why could he now suddenly smell something totally out of place in the ionian air ice sea ice and something hed last smelled with abbot sachs and chernobogs vessel like too sweet an incense it made him want to sneeze it also made him very tense the hilt of the tomahawk slid into his hand and he walked forward alertly a shot rang out from the hut ahead of them erik dove to the left basil screamed and fell karis pistol boomed the glamour used to hide the ambush wavered and was gone erik yelling like a banshee and running for cover threw the tomahawk it hit the target dead center splitting his skull the arquebus hed been aiming at erik went off a flurry of other shots followed there was more fire from the ridge where the rest had waited but kari dimitris and erik saved by a premature shot were back in the rocks basil he was shot in the stomach the corfiote pointed look down there erik the last of the moonlight shone on at least fifty steel helmets coming up the valley well go over the top past the hut theyre coming down to look for us now just stay put fan out shouted an enemy officer now so close erik could have almost cut his throat theyll be running down the hill erik whispered they might try to come back up when they see the squad down there a few hundred tense heartbeats later and the pursuit was heading off down the hill at a loping dogtrot the three went upward erik had a chance to see young basil someone had cut his throat in passing erik could only be glad hed have had to give the youth battlemercy himself otherwise present for you said kari handing him his hatchet now lets get out of here dimitris is bleeding they ran on finding it hard going in the dark fortunately thought erik it must be as hard for the enemy but it didnt seem to be theres a dog or something with them panted dimitris its following us i heard it pausing erik listened he heard a baying howl quite close very clear no other barks answered and by crashing through the maquis the dog was way ahead of its human support kari you go ahead with dimitris he needs help ill deal with this dog we wont shake them while theyve got the dog you be all right its only one dog ill see who follows it might be worth leading them astray a bit soon erik realized that the dog was definitely after him and just as he was turning to look for a good spot to deal with the beast he ran into a neat ambush he nearly got three bullets in himand would have if thalia hadnt yelled hold erik it was some five of his own men and thalia rearguard said giuliano the others are already ahead we were just setting some booby traps to slow them down watch it there is a cliff over there dog behind me panted erik and then it was onto them gaunt pale in the starlight yelping with hunting bloodlust erik saw the bullet hit it but it did not stop it sprang straight for his throat erik barely had time to grab the creatures paws and stop it it was incredibly strong and almost slimy hot carrionscented breath washed over him as it snapped furiously another shot rang out with no obvious effect the creature turned to bite at his hands erik dropped and putting both his feet into its gut gave the pale hound the full benefit of a flying mare the dog hit a limestone boulder on the edge of cliff with a sickening crack and it got up in a single bound thalia threw her birdnet the creature tumbled in a tangle of meshes snapping and yowling as if in pain quick over the edge yelled giuliano grabbing one side of the net he and erik heaved and the net bag flew over the edge erik heard it bouncing and yowling on its way downward he hoped it was a long long way lets get out of here we can set booby traps further on they hadnt gone more than a hundred yards when kari hailed them deal with the dog all right he asked cheerfully theyd taken every precaution to lose the scent even if that demondog survived the fall down to the coast theyd gone and walked in the water then come out into a stream which theyd eventually left by way of an overhanging tree and then up onto some rocks eriks feet were still very wet and he was grim hed lost two men basil who had been with him and luco who had fallen in the skirmish with the rest of the group and dimitriss wound would keep him out of combat for weeks what was more he knew very well that theyd gotten clear by luck the enemy were becoming more cunning back in the forward camp erik found their peasant hostagewith a bump on his head and tied very securely he tried to make a bolt for it explained theo not surprising that said kari taking out his knife hes not going to have another chance the peasants eyes widened with horror not at the sight of the knife he didnt even seem to notice that at the sight of erik erik looked back at him dispassionately well have to move but first well have to deal with this traitor show that no kind of money is worth this i did not do it for money i would not touch their filthy money but they have my son lord they said they would kill him if i didnt bring you eriks eyes narrowed where do they have your son please lord he is only a little boy four years old dont blame or hurt him we do not make war on children snapped thalia traitor his eyes blazed at her what could i do they held my boy they still hold him he said bitterly theyll kill him theyll think i betrayed them erik saw a way to snatch a victory out this debacle where is this child being held well get him out the peasant prisoner gaped at him stammered but but i words deserted him where is their base kanakades while they hunt us well visit them said erik with a savage smile they wont be in a hurry to trust peasants again because theyll think you betrayed them and theyll be a lot more wary when you have to leave guards everywhere you have fewer men to fight with cut him loose theo but erik i can outrun him anyway if we go along the other side of the ropa we should manage to avoid them the peasant made no attempt to run when they cut him loose i can show you where their patrols are he paused if you save my son well i understand my life is yours but not my boys he is innocent youve cost us two good men and a good birdnet and youve put some demondog onto our trail as thalia said we dont make war on children or on peasants but well expect bloodprice from you for each of them it was a very good net said thalia quietly the priest blessed it it fed us well erik suspected it was not the knotted cords that had troubled the dog the thing had not been worried by the bullets after all it had been those blessings it was an excellent net erik told her and one of the best throws ive seen we must find you another one since thats what stopped that creature although next time well try prayer too having someone who knew where the patrols were made getting to the croat encampment very easy and very fast they could see their pursuit beating the bushes across the valley but there were only two men in this camp the cook and the remount escort they werent prepared for trouble the peasant sprinted for the ruined house on the corner calling spiro there was a moments silence and then a scream a terrible cry erik and several of the others ran toward him the peasant was on his knees clutching at a piece of torn embroidered cloth there were a few bone fragments scattered around him a partially gnawed femur lay in front of the man erik closed his eyes god have mercy on his soul he said hoarsely eventually the man stood up his face a deathly gray he gave my son to the dog he looked at the bones looked at the remains of the little waistcoat the bloodstains are dry already his voice began to rise my boy has been dead since i left i swear before god and all the saints that i will kill that blond man i will spill his life for the life of my son i will kill him he shrieked no thalia spoke her voice was flat you will pay back the blooddebt first she picked up the gnawed thighbone and pushed it into the hand still holding the scrap of the waistcoat go go find your kin your brothers your cousins your friends hunt them through the maquis find them and show them these two things show them the toothmarks on his bone tell them what you did and how the hungarians repaid you and then bury these remains of your son bury them in the churchyard with honor because he died with honor you have not lived with it he looked at her for a long silent moment then nodded and turned away you are just going to let him go asked ambrosino he betrayed us after all we cant have peasants thinking they can do that and get away with it erik looked at the venetian of all of the recruits this one had fitted in least well ambrosino kept himself to himself hes suffered enough under the circumstances i might have done the same said erik shortly and i reckon within two weeks the story will have spread to every peasant on corfu uncle said giuliano somberly you dont understand what it feels like but i do that man will suffer until he dies and most important of all thalia said grimly no corfiote peasant will aid them again not for fear or for money you venetians dont really understand us the hungarians can stay here a hundred years after that story gets told and it wont matter they will never crush us and in the end we will kill them all all right lets turn these horses loose and get out of here said kari im not enjoying this like i thought i would part ix august ad chapter youre a fool emeric even in such a gorgeous voice there was only one hungarian in the entire kingdom who would have dared to say that the speaker was petite curvaceous and almost edibly beautiful she was perfection itself from her musical laugh to her cascade of lightly curled fine dark hair her skin had that bloom to it that spoke of youth emeric of hungary would have found a nest of angry vipers more attractive his greatgreataunt habitually chastised him she also never failed to assist him in his schemes she had she had admitted once a fondness for him because he was the only one of her blood in which magical skill had manifested itself he waited there was no point in rising to her bait you should have come to me for assistance first i would have advised you to stay away from corfu jagiellon seemed to think it would be an easy conquest by the money and materiel he arranged he is not aware that far from being his catspaw i have had intentions to begin conquests to the south for some time elizabeth countess bartoldy laughed musically my dear boy the fertility rituals on corfu go back to prehuman times something that ancient which keeps its base of believers has a power reservoir the size of the ocean to draw on i havent seen any signs of great magic yet she dimpled corfus is a passive kind of magic tied to the earth of that place very difficult for invaders to deal with i do have something that will work howeverbecause it is not in contact with the earth wait she returned sometime later carrying a glass jar a large jar a cubit in height she carried it with a negligent ease that betrayed her great strength emeric peered into the cloudy fluid within and then wished he hadnt an experiment of mine said the countess i constrained a fire and an air elemental to mate it is not a natural occurrence this is their offspring somewhat prematurely removed i have placed certain magical constraints on the creature as well as enhancing its power emeric looked warily at it just what does it do the countess smiled it is a bringer of fires and of course winds sickness too is one of its aspects but the core of its ability lies in dryness an islandsurrounded by water to contain itshould be the ideal place to release the thing benito yawned crackingly sorry marco its not your company honest its just well i have been working like a dog and i havent had much sleep lately marco patted his shoulder he noticed it was rocklike stretching at the shirt youre working too hard everyone from the admiral to my fatherinlaw says so benito one man doing the work of a common laborer because he doesnt have the skills to build ships or clad them isnt what venice needs she has plenty of good men working hard but we need your brains benito yawned again why are we out of cannonballs he grinned and raised a hand pacifyingly to his brother seriously marco i have a problem here everyone expects me to lead like a case vecchie born giving orders seeing that things are done and i dont know how i might be a direct blood relation of men who are great leaders of men but i grew up among the canal people as a thief the only way i know to lead is by example so i want these ships built i dont shout at people i challenge them to keep up with me and when the carpenters say thats caulkers work and sit back and say we can do nothing until theyve done i pick up another balk of timber and ask do you think this is casa vecchie work marco grinned at him and the result is that you need new shirts youve put an inch on your shoulders since you started here benito pulled a rueful face and felt the tight seams on the shirt yeah im getting a bit heavy and bulky for the old upperstory work marco not so good for squirming in tight little holes so tell me whats the news from the outside world any news from mainz marco shook his head this kind of heart condition is not something that changes from day to day benito apparently the emperors physicians say he seems to be recovering a little of course he is struggling to breathe and his chest gives him a great deal of pain but this may ease and if there are no further recurrences he may yet leave his bed again one day but commonly im afraid when these problems start they do recur we can only pray for him benito knew there were millions of people throughout the empire doing just that and there were very few indeed who would be privy to the detail marco had just given him most of the citizens of the empire would only have heard rumors that the emperor was not well but the holy roman empire felt the tremors of an uncertain future run through itas did all of europe and much of the world beyond benito scowled and on other fronts how are your attempts to contact eneko lopez coming marco sighed not so well we cant raise him for reasons that arent clear at all anyway what i came to talk to you about was what youd said to me about the undines and the tritons get anywhere it was marcos turn to shrug theyre not like humans benito they well they only live partly in the same world as us and they dont see things the same way but juliette wants to meet you thats a step benito smiled sure ill sweep her off her tail with my charm when do we do this thing well full tide is a good time said marco thats in about an hour sure where at san raphaella marco nodded we can take a walk up together or take a gondola benito shook his head im supposed to be confined to this place only by your own decision yeah but ill pretend to abide by it said benito suddenly looking an impish five years younger the roofs of venice miss me and i might as well enjoy them while i still can benito found the undines gaze quite disconcerting hed been forewarned about the bare breasts and if he ignored the color they were quite attractive one might say pert and besides hed seen a few more than marco anyway but her unblinking stare he found scary those golden eyes actually seemed to be looking inside him at something just below the skin eventually she spoke mage marco you are sure this one is your brother his flames and the fire in this one are strange powerful there is an echo of you about him but you are water cool healing waters this one frightens me benito snorted well if its all the same to you greenhair you make me nervous too just by the way you look at me marco smiled and put an arm around benitos shoulders yes juliette he is my brother my halfbrother anyway but hes been as close to me as a twin and though at times hes as wild as fire you can trust him to the ends of the earth juliette didnt look entirely convinced spill a drop of your blood on the water then she said to benito benito shrugged took out the shetland dagger and tried to prick his thumb hard work had calloused it and besides sticking a knife into yourself was never that easy do it for me marco marco did with all of a chirurgeons practiced ease benito squeezed the thumb a red drop formed and splashed into the greenish chapel water juliette scooped some of it up in a longfingered hand sniffed it tasted it looked penetratingly at him again her next question startled benito do you know the child alessia benito nodded shes on corfu with her mother its where we wanted help to get back to juliette regarded him keenly corfu you mean corcyra aieee the golden eyes narrowed still unblinking do you care for this child do you love her benito blinked i i dont really know her i do care very deeply about her mother the look was now stern i ask you again do you love this child will you guard her and care for her if she needs it benito had found the gaze of the republics chief justice less disconcerting less searching alessia was a baby for heavens sake hed hardly even touched one before her he remembered suddenly and vividly the warmth of her the smell of her she was marias kid of course he would love her yes he said calmly juliette continued to stare at him but that flat golden stare seemed wary now benito noticed shed edged away a little the flame burns steady she said at last but it burns very very hot you must see to the childs welfare i charge you with this it is your responsibility and will you help us asked benito a little tired of the orders the inquisition the mysterious questions and references she nodded i must i will speak with the tritons and then she slipped away into the water with scarcely a ripple well said francesca with a small satisfied smile i have finally found the link between several of the trouble spots its so simple that i am disgusted with myself that i didnt think of it earlier its the local black market the factions all buy extra supplies out of the venetian storehouses from two men a nice little link of bribery and blackmail for spies manfred almost fell off the chair hed been endangering by rocking on what how much of this is going on im really not sure of the extent of it manfred said francesca but from what i can work out most of the corfiote libri doro families are involved von gherens looked grim hang the lot of them its treason francesca blinked at the knight its buying food on the black market hardly a capital crime falkenberg rubbed the scars above his eye what you dont seem to grasp francescahed finally gotten to calling her francescais that it undermines the military capability of the citadel to resist you see it as a chain of blackmail that spies and traitors can use we see it far more directly as shortening the period a fortress can withstand siege both apply said manfred grimly and it has to be stopped and it is no use just cutting off the supply von gherens is right we need to make it clear that the buying too is a crime francesca made a face i see what you mean but the biggest problem is finding someone in the libri doro who isnt buying and were going to have to find out what this corruption has done to the supplies you are going to have to do so quietly without causing panic pointed out eberhard itll also upset the libri doro make the fomenting of treachery easier for someone said francesca without food francesca there wont be any need for treachery to bring this place down weve got water until the winter rains at least i thought we had good rations for a year it depends now on how far this stupid greed has undermined the capacity of the citadel to resist weve got a lot of people here you know i know i pointed it out to you said francesca dryly emeric is on his way back to corfu the words coming from elizabeths image had as always a faintly echoing air about them my plans are starting to come together nicely so it is time for you to begin seriously undermining the citadel you have traitors in place by now i assume yes mistress ive managed to stall them so far although its been difficult theyre mostly local noblemen corfiotesthe libri doro they like to call themselves headstrong and amazingly stupid elizabeth laughed gaily my dear bianca all petty noblemen are headstrong and amazingly stupid if you think your corfiotes are bad wait until you meet the piglets who live in my part of europe bianca wondered if that was a promise shed visited the countess in her castle before twice but only for the brief periods of time needed to advance aspects of her training at some point though it would be necessary for bianca to take up residence with bartholdy for an extended period that would be a time that would be simultaneously exhilarating and extremely dangerous acolytes of elizabeth countess bartholdy did not typically enjoy a long lifespan but bianca was determinedand confidentthat she would be one of the few exceptions ultimately the only exception the laughter having faded away bartholdy looked thoughtful i would have thought youd be concentrating on the venetians though the libri doro when all is said and done are simply parasites on corfu the real power is with their venetian overlords i have infiltrated the venetians also mistress said bianca hurriedly in fact the wife of the captaingeneral is now my creature and through herif and when the time comesi can subvert him but that poses certain obvious risks which i dont think we need to take at the moment she hoped elizabeth would let pass the fact that the we in the last sentence really meant bianca casarini elizabeth was hundreds of miles away after all if biancas schemes and manipulations backfired shed be the one to pay the price not the countess but elizabeth seemed in a good mood oh yes i can understand that very well try your corfiotes first theres actually no great hurry bianca i simply wanted to alert you not have you start rushing about frantically if your corfiotes fail youll have time to develop your plots with the venetians after the image faded away and bianca finished cleaning up the signs of the ritual she examined the man lying naked on her bed paulo saluzzos face was locked in the same expression of stuporous satisfaction that shed placed him in before she began the ritual although his eyes had been open the entire time staring blissfully at the ceiling hed been oblivious to the satanic practices shed undertaken in the very same room he was completely under her control now bianca didnt usually bother to exercise that degree of magical control over her bedmates she certainly hadnt bothered to do so with aldo morando there was no need as a rule sex itself with most men was enough to disarm them but since saluzzo needed to spend considerable time in her own house unlike morando or any of the libri doro with whom shed copulated bianca had taken the time and effort to exercise the needed rituals on the man besides although those rituals were draining they saved effort on the other end she hadnt actually copulated with fianellis thug since the first few days after shed murdered her aunt and uncle and seduced him saluzzo just thought she had indeed he had the most vivid memories of wild and fantastic sexual activities none of which had actually happened she laughed softly deceiving saluzzo was a small thing of course once saluzzo disposed of fianelli for her when the time came shed dispose of saluzzo himself soon enough thereafter and before too long she knew bianca would have almost forgotten him entirely given the lifespan she intended to enjoyeternityshed eventually forget him altogether still she was discovering that she took increasing pleasure even in such small manipulations deceptions and betrayals murdering the beggar boy had been almost ecstatically thrilling such was the nature of her training and ambitions she was veryconfident that shed survive elizabeth bartholdys regimen indeed she intended to survive the countess herself now that would be a betrayal to cherish bianca even took the time for a moment to consider the ways she might use elizabeths corpse profitably there had to be something immensely valuable to be squeezed out of that flesh again she laughed no point bathing in the blood of course the one thing elizabeth bartholdy was not was a virgin not in any sense of the term chapter maria had taken to joining the corfiote women in the weaving after the incident in which shed been arrested and hidden among them she was accepted and she had to admit now that alessia was slightly older and sleeping through the night staying indoors and being the good scuolo wife shopping gossiping cleaning house caring for the child was far less active than she liked it wasnt as if the house took much cleaning yes alessia did take a lot of time and generate mountains of washing but with umberto working all hours and alessia being a relatively easy babyby comparison to stellas children who didnt sleep through the night until they were about fourmaria found herself wanting to be out doing something doing something to fight back weaving sailcloth would do besides she got on well with the corfiote women most of the colonial venetian women even the scuolo wives employed one or even several corfiote girls in their homes it was the largest difference in the way a venetian scuolo wife lived in venice and here it also kept a gap between them and the local people working with them maria found she was absorbing the language in equal proportion to their respect here she wasnt a canalgirl whod married a scuolo husband and gone up in the world here she was someone who they looked up to and who had earned their respect one of the women tickled alessia she gurgled she is a lovely child maria said the woman wistfully i lost my first baby the fever took him i go to the temple to hope for another but it may be better to only be blessed after this siege is over maria lifted an eyebrow i think keeping your spiro sober would be more worthwhile than the church the woman laughed church yes but not the temple maria was slightly puzzled shed seen them all at the chapel at the sunday communion but she said no more i accept that what you say is true signorina said commander leopoldo a wry smile plucking at his lips but while it is true that a single young man like myself would seek you out and flirt with you most people would assume that the prince would not take kindly to it francesca lowered her lashes smiling slightly which is why you are cautious about it meeting me only occasionally and then keeping a safe physical distance and well in sight of multiple witnesses believe me i know men well not one of those watching will think anything more of these meetings than that you are brave philanderer the commander raised his eyes heavenward a stupid philanderer more likely anyway just what does the prince want to tell me about the storekeeper and a small coterie of clerks and guards at first i thought it was just two of the guards but weve pinpointed six now theyre running a blackmarket ring selling extra rations to the libri doro families keep walking youre supposed to be flirting with me his face was pleasant but his voice was grim its a hanging offense i need names francesca you need to go into this like a bull at a gate as much as a tavern keeper needs to give a drunkard a spare key to his cellar she said sharply eberhard pointed this out to us if there is one thing we need even less than a shortage in the supplies its panic emeric has spies inside the citadel too we dont need him to know either we want this quietly and efficiently done the young commander blinked i see i am in the hands of true professionals here that sort of intrigue is not my forte to put it charitably all right what do you want done and can you walk a little slower this hill is playing hell with my knee very well she laugheda musical sound one that she had admittedly practiced this is my daily exercise too commander in my former line of work i could not afford to get fat and unfit i probably still cant for that matter but even if i could ive developed certain ingrained habits one of them is walking a lot and the other is walking fast i apologize again the commander blinked like many people she thought leopoldo found francescas bluntness about her former status as a courtesaneven a whoremore than a little disconcerting especially coming from a woman with such a close personal relationship with an imperial prince butalso like many peoplethat same straightforwardness produced a certain level of trust and confidence she smiled faintly watching the quick interplay of expressions on his face now today at about vespers a cart will be taking extra food to various buyers it will be going to count denticos lodgingamong others the count is the head of the probyzantine faction of the libri doro among other things his volunteers have been making their way onto the guard on the north postern by the little arsenal gates no we dont think it is a problem yet but it would be a good idea if they were unobtrusively split up anyway thats another matter for now i think you want to work on catching the counts staff and the troopers redhanded if you play things right you should be able to get the clerks too i doubt very much if that will net the real traitorsthese things usually have layers within layers like an onionbut at least itll put a stop to one immediate and major problem she paused falkenberg wants to know why you havent established a curfew and night patrols i agree with him about this one it makes dark doings much more difficult if not impossible the commander took a deep breath i tried the captaingeneral said they were unnecessary however while he is on the back foot with this well institute them thats a good boy let me have passwords and chits or whatever system you use please and i think youd better leave the knights as above challenge except for a password when theyre in full armor that is since it will be rather difficult to counterfeit or steal that armor i think falkenberg wants a patrol or two of them hes worried about mines and now farewell my admirer that same sergeant will bring you word when i need my exercise disturbed again theyre going to be cracking down soon on the blackmarketeering i hope you understand bianca said to saluzzo stroking his chin and theres never any guarantee that treason will work the florentine thug lying next to her in the bed smiled lazily the feline smile had a very selfsatisfied air about it saluzzo was firmly convinced that hed just enjoyed an hour of sweaty energetic and very enjoyable sex dont worry your pretty head about it bianca fianellis about as charming a guy to work for as a slug but theres a good brain under that ugly exterior hes had it set for quite a while that if the blackmarket business goes sour somebody else will take the blame nachelli and his two little cousins have been the gobetween with the greedy libri doro instead of us directly besides not even nachellis dumb enough to get caught in a blackmarket sweep hell still be around afterward to take the blame if the betrayal of the north postern doesnt work she frowned slightly still stroking his chin whats to keep them from fingering you if theyre caught us i should say saluzzos smile shifted from lazy to something equally feline but far more savage for a moment bianca felt the muscles in his arms and chest moving the florentine was quite a powerful man like i said dont worry about it ill take care of the problem might have papeti give me a hand wont take more than that not dealing with nachelli the rent collector and his two goonsinnameonly wont be talking to anyone trust me still her hand moved down beginning to stroke his chest theres fianelli himself i really dont trust him pauloand neither do you dont try to pretend the florentines eyes rolled sideways to examine her face the look in his eyes was not suspicious so much as simply cautious ambitions a dangerous beast woman if i learned nothing else in florence and naples i learned that much thats why im living here on this misbegotten little island in the middle of nowhere she chuckled throatily its not that misbegotten paulo lots of potential here actuallyespecially once the byzantines or hungarians are running the place their notions of accounting are a lot sloppier than venetian ones to put it mildly in the right hands run by somebody less narrowminded than fianelli it is a both a civil and a military matter your honors said commander leopoldo which is why i asked if both of you could come i am sorry to summon you so late and so urgently but it is i think of importance that this be dealt with quicklyand as quietly as possible you cant do this protested a stout floridfaced man i am one of the libri doro governor this mancount dentico pointed an accusing finger at commander leopoldocharged his troopers into my home and seized me all for some imaginary infringement about some goods my staffwithout my knowledgebought in good faith the commanders face was bleak we have a cartload of grain from the republics granaries in bags labeled property of the republic of venice we have seven ducats in gold seized in the act of changing hands between count denticos steward and the soldiers from the granary the steward confessed to doing this on the counts express ordersand besides such amounts of money can only have come from dentico himself pursuant to these findings my men took trooper dorte at gunpoint and drove the empty cart back to the granary storemaster capi tapani demanded the money we have arrested him too my men have seized the records and are examining the stores of grain and other foodstuffs as a preventative measure we have kept all the capis staff in custody he looked at the captaingeneral and the governor this is treason both buyer and seller endanger the fortress but we dont want to create panic captaingeneral tomaselli looked excessively uncomfortable count dentico was something of a friend of his these soldiers need to be dealt with harshly according to military law but the count well my dear commander hes a nobleman and a loyal friend of venice one of the libri doro as he says we simply cant hold him accountable for the actions of his servants nor can you trust their testimony he was feeding his horses and his hogs on it snapped the commander angrily food that was meant to keep us safe from starvation during this siege turned into pigshit the old governor sighed hes right tomaselli if we let him off if word gets out and word will how the captaingeneral said in disbelief the governor looked at him as if he had failed to be able to write his own name the commander has used men not waxwork dolls to arrest these criminals so when the word gets out the commoners who have been battling along on the siegeration will riot for certain as likely as not even the troops would join in then we have riots within and war without the citadels fall is certain he gave tomaselli a weary look besides as the count is a civilian i believe i have the final say i will examine the evidence and question the steward and the servants of the counts household he turned to the commander do you have them in custody good if the evidence is as compelling as it seems we have little option but to apply the ultimate sanction to all the guilty parties equally chapter emeric leaned back on the cushions of his traveling throne and so how goes the siege in my absence how is the situation in general dragorvich had not survived as emerics siegemaster without developing a fine understanding of his masters moods the king was in a suppressed good humor plainly he had got what he was looking for dragorvich knew hed been heading for the carpathiansa long journey with only one possible destination the countess elizabeth bartholdy the most beautifuland some said the most influentialwoman in hungary emeric had brought more cavalry and more men with him but dragorvich knew his master well enough to suspect that was not all hed brought back he also knew emeric well enough to know the king wanted triumph for himself not as well as when your majesty was here however pursuant to your instructions we have now started three more tunnels my engineers calculate that all four are now beneath the walls of the citadel he cleared his throat pursuant to your instructions weve halted repairing the moles but a few weeks should see them repaired we simply await your majestys orders on that as for the rest weve kept up cannon fire on the western outer curtain wall it shows some signs of damage but it is still far from being ready to fall nightfiring from the ships has been kept up more for the nuisance value than anything else the venetian gunners have range and elevation on the ships cannon so we cannot really use them for pounding the walls also with the fortress on vidos covering that flank we cannot bring guns to bear on the northern side that fortress must go the count nodded it would assist us to have it taken ill think about it now tell me aldanto have you caught hakkonsen and his saboteurs yet we caught and killed two of them said the blond man flatly the hunt will continue it had better he turned to the byzantine admiral and the blockade the byzantine snapped his fingers a lieutenant hurried forward with a pouch these letters were taken from a vessel we intercepted some days after your majesty took the fleet back to the narenta they indicate that doge dorma has no idea that the island has been invaded he is however taking steps for the reinforcement of it the admiral smiled or he was going to one of the steps he commands is recalling captaingeneral tomaselli and promoting the commander of the garrison leopoldo into his place no surprise there of course if tomaselli hadnt been well connected with the previous doge hed have been recalled long since emeric gave a little crow of laughter i want those letters we shall have to see to a way of getting them into the captaingenerals hands he may wish to change sides he rubbed his hands gleefully any news out of constantinople the golden horn enclave still holds out vessels are not expected back from trebizond yet your majesty the greek emperor is nonetheless pleased with some of the prizes he has taken from the ships sailing from acre the king muttered something about emperor alexius it could have been useless ass then he turned to the croats and magyar and the peasants are they getting back to the land i want yields as well as loot the croat nodded i had to hang a few men to get the message home but there are more of them working their fields the magyar captain cleared his throat there are some of the corfiote nobility weve caughtwhat the venetians call the libri doro most of them are inside the citadel but some were still loose in the countryside theyre not worth ransom but i thought we might make them into collaborators your majesty they can find and drive the peasants for us the king nodded an excellent idea see to it your majesty there are several towns too fortified ones in the north we have them under watch but theyre not besieged yet when the citadel falls of course they will be easy to take but in the meanwhile offer them terms once were inside the walls we can change our minds cant we all the officers standing about laughed heartily they knew emeric well enough to know the king admired his own sense of humorand frowned on those who didnt emeric had chosen a bare hilltop overlooking the citadel from the southeast for the ritual he had to enact in strict accordance to the instruction from countess elizabeth initially he had been pleased at extracting help from her now in retrospect he was no longer as pleased as he had been elizabeth bartholdy had a way of bringing the kings of hungary under her control emeric had watched the effect on his own father over the years by the time his father died he had been no more than a shadow of the man emeric remembered as a boy he wondered just how many strings were attached to this particular gift elizabeth never did anything that was not to her advantage and yes he made use of the darker powers himself but not to the extent that she did nor did he meddle with the powers that she dared to but he had the damned thing after all so he might as well make use of it he went out to his picked site in a grim state of mind he ensured that his men would cooperate by stationing guards around a perimeter that was far enough away that no one would be able to see what he was doing except for his special assistants those assistants had been provided for him by elizabeth also the ritual that needed to be enacted here could not be done by one person alone the weather had decided to cooperate at least storm clouds gathered and built around pantocrator the wind whipped angry flurries of dust from where the assistants had been assiduously clearing every scrap of living matter even lichen and tiny rock plants until there was nothing but sterile barren rock another was sharpening the bronze knife the patterns and sigils emeric would do himself he trusted such things to no assistant even ones trained by bartholdy the fact that he kept such iron control over important matters delegating them to no one else was one of the things he thought his greatgreataunt respected about him the brushes and pens for that work he kept in a special casean ancient thing shed given him many years before it was made of hide and bone the hide was curiously dark and iridescent the bone jet black neither part came from any earthly creature and neither did the fangs which served as a sort of semiliving lock and guardian they opened only on certain words treacherously closing on the hand if a mere intonation were wrong of course the king needed a suitable supply of ink that was what the knife was being sharpened for these rituals were designed to constrain the nonhuman and to protect him from it they had to affect the homunculus he was about to release elizabeth had supplied the nonhuman blood from her captive stock and emeric and his assistants would have to give of their own to protect themselves so when the knife had been honed to an edge that would wound the wind each of them carefully slashed his forearm in turn beginning with emeric each of them funneled the scarlet blood that ran from the slash into the bottle that elizabeth had prepared while emeric recited the guttural phrases elizabeth had provided him the sky darkened and the wind whirled around the hilltop shrilling in their ears there were two bottles now one of red ink and one of black taking the first brush emeric began to paint the body and face of his first assistant with an intricate interweaving of sigils and symbols the first went to build a fire in the center of the cleared placeonly the fuel was bone human and unhuman when he was done with the last of them and only then did his most trusted assistant take the brush and complete the job on his master emeric then emeric took up the knife and cut the first of thirteen protective circles into the bare earth at length when the summer storm had formed into a huge dark tumbling mass with pantocrator shrouded in rain and distant thunder growling and cracking closer they were ready stripped to the waist and paintedonly their eyes showing in the masks of lines of alternating black and redthe nine began their chanting the bonefire was lit the fungus that emeric had piled atop it burning with a greenish flame lightning lashed the earth as if it was trying to strike them but inside their protective circles it could not touch them the assistants were made of stern stuff though the very earth outside their hilltop smoked with the strikes and the thunder threatened to shatter their eardrums they did not even falter for a moment in their chanting then when the winds began to roar and the flames were near horizontal and the first heavy drops were splashing down onto the sundried earth emeric picked up the glass jar and threw the container into the flames by the time the jar left his hands the creature inside was fully aroused the king of hungary could sense the malevolent rage emanating from it the jar shattered the liquid ran out of the fire in little coruscating hissing rivulets the earth shook angrily if emeric and his assistants had not been warned of the effect and braced for it they would have been knocked to the ground and then the screaming began the scream seemed to go on and on it pierced the very brain it was full of rage and pain and for one terrible moment even emeric wondered if he had let something loose that should never have seen the light of day the mighty cloud above them was lit with sheet lightnings and the rain advancing moments before slacked off the scream thinned and faded receding into the distance leaving a strange taste in the back of the mouth and somehow in the mind well whatever had been turned loose was no longer his problem emeric stood triumphant smiling toothily in the flickering firelight the truth be told high magics were something he followed by rote he enjoyed the powers conferred on him the use of which required no effort on his part but he was always nervous about these tasks suddenly the earth itself trembled he was flung from his feet the rock beneath the fire burst explosively scattering flames and ash over them the ground shook beneath them again and again the ground shook like a dog fleabitten what was that svanhild clung to erik first the storm and now this she wished for cahokia erik patted her comfortingly its just an earthtremor dear we have had them up at bakkafloi especially when the volcano at surtsey has been active in my grandfathers time one knocked down half of reykjavik either it is not a very big one or we are far from its center are we safe we should probably get out of this cave but it is raining out there it seems to be stopping now manfred picked himself up from the battlements who in the hell needs cannons another one like that and the walls will just fall down does this part of the world often get earthquakes the captaingeneral nodded staying sitting down they have been heard of before yes manfred had been trying for tact especially when listening to the captaingenerals version of the destruction of the moles hed been struggling with a volcano of laughter instead he got an earthquake well it is a lot less welcome than that storm will be if it comes here off the mountain i thought i was going to boil in my armor today eneko lopez and his companions came breathlessly up the stairs did you hear it demanded eneko or see anything unusual no but i felt it said von gherens knocked me off my feet not the earth tremor just before that the scream the agony and the rage and hatred manfred shook his head it wasnt from out here we were watching the coming storm and then we had the quake the storm seems to be breaking up eneko took a deep breath something very magical and very very evil has come to this island something that should not ever have been created i fear for this place count dragorvich cursed then he swore then he kicked a rock his adjutant kept well back he had run to call the siegemaster only to find the man striding to the mines already all four tiepostich the adjutant nodded yes we got two men out of the northern one in the others we lost all of the sappers and we lost most of the bucket chain damn labor is scarce enough without this and the king is not going to be pleased that we have to dig the tunnels again we need to wait a few days before we restart too there are always aftershocks tiepostich knew that when the king was not pleased one of dragorvichs men was usually going to be heading for a slow death he wondered if this time it would be him in the cave beneath the citadel the rock moved though not so much as a stalactite fell but the priestess watched in horror as the sacred pool cracked across and the water drained away into the rock she looked at the small altar with the half almond without a bride he would not help the goddess would defend but this this called for him for the actual wielding of power but who would pay such a price chapter francesca manfred thought looked sour she sighed i thoughtas you wouldnt let me corrupt the black market for my own ends as i wanted tothat wed be better off getting rid of count dentico as the most dangerous of the lot it appears i misjudged the nasty piece of work he was such a pompous ass that he was thwarting rather than aiding the conspirators he eyed her uncertainly francesca was really in a rather foul mood which was unusual for her he needed to tread carefully here that blackmarket ring had to go francesca there were supposed to be siege rations for at least ten thousand souls for a year those stupid bastards were using the stuff like there was no tomorrow seven eight times the ration per person wastage you wouldnt believe feeding animals on it at a full ration now the supplies will all be gone by december even on the slow cutback in rations that not causing panic demands were going to be eating boiled boots by march francesca scowled damned soldiers and their straightahead view of things she gave him a look which was not entirely admiring manfred i still worry more about treachery tomorrow than starvation by next march its now blindingly obviousto me at least if not you and von gherens and falkenberg and she waved her hand irritably encompassing in the little gesture all of the worlds damned soldiers count dentico and that crowd of libri doro were just tools being manipulated by someone else or more likely several someone elses there will be manipulators manipulating the manipulators be sure of it each layer of them better hidden than the next and theyll have a more fertile ground than ever to do their work now since the libri doro families have gone from a diet not far removed from the presiege one to a siege ration nine tenths of a siege ration actually corrected falkenberg do their souls good to fast a bit it probably would said francesca unfortunately what it has done instead is to have made most of them angry and some of them desperate theyre blaming the venetian authorities for their hardship rather than themselves there is still some blackmarket stock out there but the price has gone up sevenfold and thats just making the people more bitter and revoltripe im beginning to think we should have followed through on falkenbergs ideas and hanged the lot the oneeyed knight grinned my old mentor had been through six sieges on the inside and five major ones on the outside you look at the bottom of all the usual suspects for why a fortress falls to siege supply is usually the driving factor behind it im worried that real trouble will break out now i know there have been a whole rash of secret meetings among the libri doro families francesca sighed for that matter the occasional exception like leopoldo asidethe podesta is all right too if it werent for his agethe venetian upper crust in the citadel doesnt fill me with great confidence either whenever you have someone like tomaselli in a position of power in a small and isolated region like this things get very rotten very quickly venice should never have given him the post of captaingeneral in the first place and having done it should have recalled him at least a year ago the soldiers in the room said nothing what was there to say on this subject they all agreed with her francesca never stayed in a bad mood for very long fortunately that wasnt so much because she had a naturally sunny disposition manfred thought as the product of her long and rigorous selfdiscipline the time hed spent in francescas companyalmost two years now most of it in very close companyhad made a number of things clear to manfred about the oncewhore oncecourtesan perhaps the clearest was that francesca was the most formidable and capable woman hed ever met in his life out of bed even more than in it well francesca said visibly forcing a little smile thank goodness young leopoldo altered the duty rosters or id say the north postern was very insecure but still manfred dear i think we ought to consider extra patrols of knights hefty patrols not just a pair here and there and im sure leopoldo will listen to you if you suggest a few extra checkpoints manfred nodded immediately so did von gherens and falkenberg whatever private opinion the two devout knights of the holy trinity might have regarding francescas past they had no more doubt than manfred of her present competence querini had a weakness for dice and the cavalry captains head was a lot less strong than he thought it was the grappa had thoroughly fuddled it when he looked at the total of his losses he sobered up fast ah youll give me time surely if the siege went badly he might just die that would be out from under this at least hed lost several months salary and was habitually in debt anyway the younger dentico now count in his fathers shoes shook his head regretfully cant do im afraid since the unfortunate happenings were having to watch things with the army you know my father was really killed because tomaselli had borrowed heavily from him it was a totally putup job we thought said the young man bitterly that tomaselli was a friend of fathers so no carried debts the cavalry captain was sweating now i of course if you could help us out on another matter thats been irritating us we could let it go by for a while wed know we could trust you of course only too pleased to help you know i organized those duty transfers you and the other fellows wanted so you could all be together querinis voice trickled off as it happens captain it was about that that i wanted the favor some idiots gone and shifted us around again querini winced commander leopoldo has taken all the duty posting under his control i cant do that again oh therell be no need to ive got the june roster here well just cross out june and put in september its all in your writing anyway and signed by the commander the sweat beaded on the cavalry officers face again if leopoldo finds out hed hed he doesnt like me anyway i cant do it the young dentico sighed and tapped the pile of chits look leopoldo doesnt check every day does he the boys and iwell ill tell you the truth its desarsos daughter shes available and she likes a bunch you know some women just cant get enough its adrianos birthday and we thought wed have a little party for him but several of the fellows fathers are real sticky about them being out especially with this damned curfew i mean we understand why its got to apply to the commoners but it is ridiculous for us so if you just slip this onto the duty board for the sergeants the day after tomorrow we could forget this he tapped the pile of chits again its done said saluzzo cheerfully as he slipped through the back door of bianca casarinis house within a fortnight id say maybe sooner hard to know dealing with those idiot greeks but fianelli tells me that nachellis cousin reported that the young dentico handled querini perfectly he was there watching the fool if it goes sour the greeks will finger him instead of us through him nachelliand me and zanari will make sure that nachelli cant finger anybody he laughed coarsely pulling her to him and lifting her onto the table by the door the florentines hands were already forcing up her skirt if it goes sour it might very well not best thing the venetians did executing the old count his sons smart enough to do the work right and dumb enough to do it in the first place she responded to his lustful embrace with feigned enthusiasm that was just a bit difficult since saluzzo was obviously in a rutting mood he wouldnt this night give her the time to prepare the rituals that usually allowed her to leave him to his own fantasies so be it it was a minor inconvenience after all and she could use the opportunity to advance another scheme that still leaves fianelli himself she gasped spreading her legs id feel a lot betteroh paulo the emperors hands shook as he held the parchment he screwed up his eyes in effort and then handed it to baron trolliger read it for me hans damn this ailment i want that boy safe and i am too weak to see to it properly myself trolliger read the agents report aloud the emperor pursed his lips they were slightly blue trolliger noted two things said the emperor tiredly but breathing slightly easier on the new medication one i want an attack on emerics borders with the empire give him a reason to come home second dispatch to spain if my commanders there can spare the venetian atlantic fleet as many extra men as the ships can carry rations too these generals so literal the emperor closed his eyes i hope francesca is all right sieges are hell on horses and worse for women and children sieges are hell for everyone said trolliger quietly hed lost his younger brother two sisters his mother and his dog in a siege that had spawned disease it had taken half his family that plague except for the dog theyd eaten that the baron still gagged every time he thought of it weve already got six light galleys ready for sea doge dorma said the admiral of the arsenal mostly he scowled at benito because of that menace you have put in our midst benito sipped his soave and smiled beatifically the admiral and i are the best of friends really petro he said innocently ive solved so many problems for him broken so many scuolo rules that the older masters want to murder him and the youngsters think it is a fine thing to do growled the admiral i will say that this building program has been the better for it though of course in the long term well regret it you cant put the wine back into a grape when you want to petro dorma smiled and waved a hand pacifyingly well admiral how about if i took him off your hands of course wed want you to keep up the same rate of building or well send him back the admiral scowled again well need an extra four laborers for the heavy lifting but think of the tranquility i dont think youd need to send him back your grace the arsenalotti are caught up in the patriotism of this young ward of yours now i dont think i could slow them down but what are you going to do with him i can recommend a flearidden village a few miles from eraclea i have a grudge against the place we want to send him back to corfu if we can with three of those light galleys some men money and weapons benito bounced to his feet spilling wine im out of here when do we sail petro within the next two days your brother wants you to come and see him about special guidance benito as soon as possible he said you could even walk ride or come by gondola the doge raised his eyebrows i was not aware that you could get to him any other way benito grinned you learn something new every day petro the blondbearded triton androcles was as far as benito was concerned far less alarming than the undine had been for starters the look in those aquamarine eyes told benito that the triton would probably delight in just the sort of practical joke that would appeal to benito and for a second thing if the nonhumans eyes looked into his inner being androcles wasnt as deeply interested in what he saw there whoever advised you advised you well there is indeed something out there something to be avoided a monster of slime and teeth a parasite that likes to eat its victims alive and it is working with the ships above sometimes can you help us avoid it the triton grinned i can but will i benito shook his head mournfully questions questions thats a hard one as the camerata singer said to the bishop androcles shoulders twitched he smiled and nodded hell do juliette the lion seems to think that your efforts might get rid of this menace and the truth be told we dont like the thing it stinks and befouls water even worse than humans do two days time the triton nodded well go and range the deeps in the meanwhile we can taste the creature from a good many miles off now that we have learned what it is chapter dragorvich had been prepared for emerics fury at the loss of his mines in the earthquake so hed been relieved to find his master taking it all in relatively good humor they may be unnecessary after all dragorvich my agent within the fortress has widened a good chink in the enemys armor in the meantime see if you can make the north causeway at least passable by footmen and light cavalry at a pinch dragorvich nodded too relieved to ask many questions ive had men on the dark nights sneaking as far as they can and then swimming across to clear caltrops a few have been shot but they paint themselves with mud first theyre difficult to see the shingle should be safe for cavalry from that point of view anyway the causeway give me a week sire two at the most itll be good enough we can make a covered way with green cowhides on top and some sandbags it wont stop all the fire but it should make it possible for us to push a number of men across that sounds excellent dragorvich dont make your preparations too obvious very well sire he hesitated a moment i have a request i know the policy is to get these peasants back onto the land but i am desperately short of labor if there is any trouble can i have some of the troublemakers well put them in leg irons and use them up at the front theyre likely to die but rather them than my sappers an excellent idea ill let ionlovich know dont spare them theyre not in that short a supply that had been ten days ago dragorvich had gotten his peasantprisoners and had achieved all hed promised in the darkness his men had been readying the causeway to take a push of several thousand footmen mostly slav pikemen and a number of croat light cavalry units who had been forming up since dusk dragorvich wished he knew exactly what the king had planned it was plainly treachery from within the citadel and plainly on the northern side presumably with someone on the postern there in the meantime the new mines had been started anyway he had reluctant corfiote slaves to do that work now and the cannons still kept up their volleys against the walls the wallsso farhadnt crumbled much the trouble with bombarding corfus citadel was that so much of the fortress was made of natural rock you could eventually pound a breach in it but it was harder than mortised stone sergeant boldo looked up at the duty rosters above him the current roster had been made out by that ass captain querini again he noticed lazy bastard just crossed out the month oh well my name is there sergeant said the young libri doro buck languidly see sergeant boldo shrugged and handed the young man a curfew pass password for tonight is nightingale this new system of commander leopoldos was a pain in the bollocks still orders were orders and the man was reasonable after the chaos of the first week the commander had given weekpasses instead of daily ones for those who worked nights whom heand some mysterious otherapproved the recipients had to learn the weeks worth of passwords and two of the arsenalotti masters had ended up in the brig for the rest of the night because theyd forgotten them the sergeant had expected them to kick up a stink the way the scuolo usually did when they thought their territory was being infringed but theyd been sour but reasonable about it umberto got up for the midnighttodawn guard shift when alberto mavroukis tapped gently on the window alberto was one of those rare individuals who could fall asleep at the blink of an eyeat any opportunityand yet had an internal clock that could wake him when he needed to alberto and umberto were two of the ten masters from the little arsenal who were recipients of weekpasses for this new curfew system though its purpose was to allow them to work late it also meant he could sleep at home if he was on guard with alberto sleeping next to a warm softskinned maria was infinitely preferable to sleeping in the north wall guard barracks the two walked down the dark cobbles as luck would have it they ran into a bored smallminded guard who refused to accept their weekpasses and insisted on taking them to his guard commander at gunpoint the guard commander was in the throes of waking the next shift and it took a great deal of umbertos patience to get them late heading for the guard barracks on the north curtainwall the bells were already chiming for midnight before they were halfway down there that bastard of a guard commander will probably make us sleep there next time panted alberto hell just chew us out said umberto and saved his breath for running the two arrived at the guard barracks both realized immediately that something was very very wrong the guard barracks was silent it should have been full of people getting their gear off and lying down to rest earlier watches griping about the noise umberto looked at alberto then he took the issue rapier out of its scabbard and walked forward into the lamplight the guard commander wasnt going to chew anyone out or make them sleep in the barracks he lay in a pool of his own blood merde said big alberto in a very small voice what the hell do we do now raise the alarm umberto took a deep breath keep quiet or ill shoot said a voice from the shadows umberto yelled alaru he felt rather than heard the shot as he fell he saw in a sort of strange slow way how the big caulker had grabbed someone with a pistol he saw alberto fling the willowy elegantly dressed young man at a second man and alberto was bellowing at the top of his vast lungs knightproctor von desdel and his patrol of ten knights were within a hundred yards of the guard barracks when they heard the shout the shot and the yelling thats inside the wall he was already urging his charger forward sound that trumpet over on the spianada the croats had heard the midnight bells without getting restive the plan allowed the guards on the western outer walls to be changed and settle down before the northern postern would be seized the biggest danger was the bastion on the northwestern corner the kings artillery and the arquebusiers in the trenches were due to start a barrage on that when the charge started the occasional cannon fire with its loading lulls allowed the sounds from the sleeping citadel to carry well in the silent times they heard the trumpet and the answer and the bells begin to ring into those saddles yelled their captain there was no time now to swing this whole thing into planned action now they must seize the momentif it was there to be seized at all the croats were some of the finest light cavalry in the world with only the ilkhan mongols in serious contention in their portion of eurasia in many ways the croats had the advantage over the magyarin speed as scouts and in tactical flexibility the croats had the first hundred and twenty men across the mole causeway before the venetian cannon and arquebus fire began to make crossing it without heavy losses impossible by the sounds above them there was fighting on the north wall but the traitors had at least prevented the barrage from above falling onto the galloping croats and the gate was open there were battle sounds from the watchtowers but theyd done it if the croats could get inside theyd hold those towers keep the gate open somehow until the huge mass of serb and slav infantry who were waiting got in past the venetian guns yelling the croats spurred desperately forward galloping horses spread out in a long race along the shingle then the first were in under the raised portcullis into the narrow roadway that led up into the citadel and hurtling down on them horses virtually shoulder to shoulder were the famous knights of the holy trinity the sound of the metal shoes of those heavy horses on the cobbles was like thunder in the confined space in the moonlight and houseshadowdarkness in the narrow lane the croats didnt know there were only ten there are places and times when light cavalry is superior to heavy cavalrywhen maneuverability and rough terrain are factors for instance but one advantage that heavy cavalry always has is momentum and armorwhich adds to the momentum in the narrow lane neither terrain nor maneuverability offered any advantage to the croats the knights of the holy trinity hit them like a tenpound hammer hitting a pin literally smashed the croats back through the gate riding down those that could not turn the knights wheeled and rode back in preparing for another charge a few of the later arrivals and some of the better horsemen whod turned their mounts followed in on their heels showing the advantages of the croats speed and maneuverability the portcullis crashed down behind them the great gates were still open but the heavy metal grid now had some thirty croats trapped inside men were running out of alleyways hacking at them hacking at their unprotected mounts as they tried to fight the knights and more knights had suddenly arrived at the fray some halfarmored but too many the croat captain knew the moment had slipped away he never even saw that the great gates were closing he did hear his lieutenant outside the gates yelling for a retreat inside the walls theyd die he knew but then very few would live through the retreat either umberto awoke to a blurry vision at first he thought maybe he was dead and that marias mother god hed loved her was there waiting for him but would heaven have so much pain then he realized it was in fact maria maria as he had never seen her maria with tears on her face holding his hand as if she never wanted to let it go with something so warm shining in her eyes that she looked like an angel shed looked at the baby like that never at him until now maria thank god he felt the pressure of her hand on his umberto dont you dare die on me try things slipped away again it was some hours later that he awoke enough to make sense of his surroundings he was in the hospital tended by the monks of saint john up on the hill did we beat them off he asked wishing his head would stop spinning alberto we did we lost nearly fifty people though alberto is fine other than a broken finger you two raised the alarmbecause you slept at home i am going to keep you there said maria fiercely the seven surviving libri doro plotters attempted to look defiant when they were hauled before the captaingeneral and the governor only flavio dentico really succeeded kill us then you will get nothing out of us the captaingeneral scowled we have torturers of sufficient skill to get the entire story out of you the old governor cleared his throat and turned to eberhard of brunswick perhaps you would like to explain to them the ritter nodded your families and the families of the dead we have identified have been taken into custody you may be fools and decide to wait for torture but if you wish to save your families further pain well we need to know just who the spy is who in here has contact outside this plot was orchestrated im afraid we need to know this and im afraid you will talk there was something really terrifying about the urbane calm way he said it what are you going to do with our families asked one of the younger men it was plain that this effect of their actions had not been considered theyre in the dungeons below the fortress they knew nothing of this eberhard raised his eyebrows then suppose you tell us who did know of your treason singly so we can check your stories against each other at the moment the real reason for holding your families is to keep them alive the people out there know who betrayed them theyre baying for libri doro blood right now piece by piece the details of the plot appeared a scant hour later troops were scouring the citadel for petros nachelli the glib greasy former rent collector they found him and the two cousins who served him as enforcers but they werent going to talk not even under torture not without necromancy captain querini was tied to the chair commander leopoldo was still half dressed his face bloody his tunicjacket torn hed led the assault that had retaken the tower that held the portcullis levers and he was furious about the loss of some of his finest men he held the roster up to the cavalry captains face and shook it furiously you testa di cazzo if it wasnt for a couple of scuolo sleepathomes who didnt come in to find they werent on duty wed have lost the citadel as it is i lost twentythree men because of this he shook the piece of paper again you the captain gave a low moan i never knew i was in my bed i wouldnt have been in my bed if i known i never meant any harm they tricked me they lied to me it was dentico youll still hang maria hadnt realized just how much the fireboat project had come to mean to umberto until shed sat with him the day after hed been shot umberto was not a great communicator his job and his home lifeexcept when things were really boiling over and he would tell herwere two separate worlds shed followed progress in the yard more by snippets than anything else now weak and slipping into fever he talked of little else but this maria passed an anxious day and an anxious sleepless night listening to it he was much the same the next day she still dared not leave stella had come up to take alessia for a few hours old mrs grisinis corfiote girl had come up with some food a group of the corfiote laborers wives came with a small pot of sour cherry spoonsweets they were quietas befitted a hospital with a sick manbut each came and embraced her maria sat there biting her lip she had never been hugged by this many people they plainly thought he was going to die the small pot of spoonsweets sat there on the table beside her she stared at it eyes blurred with tears she knew just how little they had what sort of a sacrifice this was shed married umberto to give alessia a father now she was going to lose him too for days he clung there growing paler growing weaker maria prayed she prayed as shed never ever prayed for herself it was late evening four days later with umberto tossing and mumbling when two of the corfiote women came in to the hospital you must come with us maria i cant i cant leave umberto if you dont you will leave him at the graveside said one of the women brutally we have heard from anastasiathe girl who works for mrs grisinithat your house has been cursed but what about alessia the priestess said to bring her it was only when she got outside and well down the hill that she came to realize that it was well after sundown she was she realized dazed with exhaustion what about the curfew the older of the two women shrugged we know where they patrol and there are ways to pass but it is difficult maria was too tired to try to make sense of it all she followed them to the cliff with the tall italian poplar beside it ascended the ladder walked the winding cave trail into the inner chamber with its two altars one white one black looked at the cracked dry rockcut pool where the water from the tiny waterfall now fell into a clay bowl drifted with flowerpetals at the huge eminently female statue terrible in its primitive beauty looked at the priestess in her simple white robe with her long white hair in great waves around her looked into the compassionate eyes of renate de belmondo the wife of the podesta welcome daughter the peace of the mother the great goddess be with you and the strange thing was that shed felt just that the hurt the anger the sadness had all receded just as in her distant childhood memories they had on those rare occasions when shed turned to her own mothers arms the rest of the ritual the soft refrains had not meant much to her except the priestesswho was also renate de belmondo in another lifehad done her best with curseexorcism it may be best if you could move house dear there is lingering evil around you someone hates you very much enough to spend a great deal of time cursing you she is no witch i thinkbut there is a great deal of magic here and magic she shrugged it is a tool it often comes to the hand of those who do not know how to use it yet succeed in doing something with it even in their ignorance maria sighed right now im living up at the hospital anyway if umberto lives well ill try i dont know how possible it will be for your sake your husbands sake and for the sake of that lovely daughter of yours you should when they returned to the small building on the north slope that was the monks hospital maria fearfully hastened to umbertos side he was still maria felt as if her heart would stop she put a trembling hand to his forehead when shed left it had been firehot it was cool not deathly cold just unfevered maria didnt know how to thank the mother but she did it with all her heart anyway umberto might have turned the corner but to start him climbing the steep stair required a sickbed visit from alberto with his index finger strapped how do you use a hammer with that asked umberto weakly um havent much lately what about the fireboats old grisini had another relapse and hes gone home and well balfo hes senior master after you he said he couldnt see the sense of it wed never use them what umberto was struggling to sit i need to get down there ill tear his ears off ill youll lie down said maria crossly ill tear any ears that need tearing maria ive got to get down there if we can deal with the enemys fleet while they overwinter here most of them will have to be here in the bay of corfu as soon as you are well enough to even sit on your own ill bring some of the lads up from the little arsenal to carry you down promised alberto then we can carry you home two days later they carried him down the hill it started off with three big journeymen and alberto simply picking up the bed and carrying it out of the door as they came out of the hospital maria realized that nearly every one of the arsenalotti were there from the masters to the corfiote labor and they werent content to just carry umberto he had to travel shoulder high across the channel across the spianada the hungarians must have wondered just what the besieged had to cheer about umberto didnt even have to tear ears the issue was simply never raised and the little arsenal went back to hammering sawing and working in theory umberto was in charge of it in practice he was still too weak and too tired maria was his eyes and ears relaying orders dealing with problems the scuolo as conservative as could be would never have just taken orders from a woman but umbertos orders relayed and made a lot more caustic by his wifea different matter the only trouble was that maria was not always inclined to just give umbertos orders nor after the first few times did she say master verrier says she just told anyone from master to laborer to do it and as they didnt know whether it came from umberto or not the arsenalotti did it before two weeks were up taking orders from maria was so normal no one even thought about it she was good at giving them for those first two weeks maria had had them knock up a space in one of the work sheds for umberto he was certainly not going to get homeor backwithout carrying and he was determined to be at the little arsenal maria did a trip to fetch goat and the hens one hen had disappeared but the goat found more to eat in the shipyard than she had in marias own yard or than maria had been able to scavenge for her part x september ad chapter the three light galleys venice was sending to the aid of corfu left without fanfare or fuss or any of the normal sendoff they left directly from the arsenal sometime after midnight with extremely select crews a large supply of weaponryand gold some fifteen thousand ducats worth which would have made the small vessels a tempting target in any pirates book led by the merfolk the three ships slipped along the dalmatian coast by night pulling up stepping masts and hiding on small islands by day they laid up for two days with the mosquitoes in a swampy river mouth just north of the bay of vlores waiting for the merfolk to return with news of a safe route the clouds rolled in along with the triton eventually the water is clear of ships on this course said androcles because its raining fit to raise the ocean level you could sail within thirty yards of one of the carracks without anyone being the wiser the galliots are all pulled up on the beaches you humans dont seem to like getting wet they rowed on through worsening seas and squalls of rain the light galleys had no real shelter for the rowers and benito found himself shivering well at least in this we should be able to land on the island during daylight said benito to the triton who was pacing the vessel in the rolling gray sea androcles shook his head no the rain stops short of corfu any lookout will see you youll have to wait for nightfall he looked up at benito and chuckled the seas are getting heavier looks as if you arent wet enough already you might just join us soon never was benito so glad to see landfall as in the lee of that unnamed cape the venetian relief force was cold wet and bedraggled and on corfuundetected the hundred and fifty men who had landed there were handpicked as good seamen with some knowledge of greekeasy enough as many venetians spent time in the greek possessions they were all reasonably skilled horsemen and were all combat veterans what they werent was too sure where they were where the enemy was and just where they should go benito blessed the fact that at least it wasnt raining here he went down to the waters edge to bid farewell to the merpeople only androcles had come inshore my thanks were in your debt androcles grinned his teeth pearly in the moonlight well keep it in mind he looked at the three galleys what do you do with the ships now benito scowled i busted my ass building them and now well scupper them rather than let the byzantines have them androcles shrugged why not put them in the sea caves there are some along the edge of the cape you can only get in dry at low tide if you take the masts down you should fit them you will have to swim out of the cave though benito sighed im just about dry most of the gear was offloaded and skeleton crews of strong swimmers set out for the caves they nudged their way forward into the darkness of the seahollowed limestone this is where we leave you said androcles corcyra is anothers territory and this is too close already it was dark they had to feel their way in inch by inch trouble with sea caves like this is that they cave in said one of benitos companions cheerfully i went into one near capri on my first voyage they said it used to be a bigger one but it caved in i needed to know that grumbled benito reckon we can strike a light now were well into this thing and weve curved away from the sea they shouldnt be able to see it from outside and we need to work out how to anchor safely its as black as pitch in here well need to chance it someone struck a lucifer a lamp wick caught benito looked at the five greek fishingboats that were in there already and at the people on them and on the shoreledges there were an awful lot of arquebuses pistols arrows and just plain rocks all ready to come their way benito was extremely glad to recognize at least one of the vessels captain taki spiro kosti its me benito it was as near to inevitable that the caveful of fishing boats should have its own taverna with a supply of the wine that benito recalled so well why is this stuff so vile he demanded eyeing the cup of russetcolored liquid and why do you all drink it spiro drew himself up in affront if you dont like our kakotrigi dont drink it ill relieve you of the burden he reached for benitos cup it is a wine of the corfiote character and like us it is hard to harvest the grape clings to the stalk like we cling to our soil benito held his cup out of reach im paying for this round you snatch my drink when youre paying which will probably mean the end of the world is at hand so you might as well drink it anyway said kosti youre paying id have had the mavrodaphne then said spiro with his wry grin kakotrigi is cheap crap but you get used to it even get to like it if you drink enough and for a few cups they could have shelter for their ships and advice on where the hungarian troops were it struck benito as a bargain how did you make it back did you have any problems taki laughed and waved his arms expansively i told you i was the finest seaman around we sailed rings around them we came back in a patch of bad weather we nearly missed the island said kosti i hate to ask this but just where the hell are we spiro rolled his eyes great sailors these venetians masters of the mediterranean youre about a league and a half away from paleokastritsa and your dangerous friend is about four leagues away together with his blonde with the spiro crooked his arms in front of him benito grinned this was going to be easier than hed thought he looked speculatively at the corfiote sailors how are things going with eriks private little war taki laughed shortly he doesnt have to do much anymore the peasants are killing and sabotaging whenever they get the chance those hungarians cant make up their minds what to do one day its reprisals and the next its being nice to peasants but the story is they ate a child from one of the villages down south the father cooperated with them because they had his son hostage and while he did that they ate the boy like those vinlanders did to old cheretis favorite goat and fed the bones to their dog theres this big yellow dog that goes about with em sometimes people say its no natural dog say it can be shot without being killed that was georgios story said kosti georgio once had a wild pig get drunk on fermented windfall apples in his masters orchard and he tried to shoot it when it was sleeping it off from about three feet away he still missed it well yes admitted taki but serakis says he saw the boys waistcoat and the thigh bone tooth marks right into it benito scratched his chin thoughtfully doesnt sound like theyre popular so how do you think you lads and the other fishermen would feel about helping the venetians do a bit of quiet raiding sink a few of those patrol vessels with our fishing boats are you crazy with the galleys you spot them from shore dark nights we run out and sink em they eyed him with interest kostis grin was feral should make nightfishing around here safer said taki with a nod even with a guide from the fishermen it was eriks men who spotted them first he plainly had scouts out and any hungarian patrol was going to have to deal with an ambush erik himself came out to greet them the icelander was benito thought looking as happy as hed ever seen him obviously things were going exceptionally well for him with his vinlander girl well benito he clapped benito on the shoulder and grinned as he looked at the hundred and fifty men in the valley is this all you bring me and i had to part with perfectly good silver for your trip over then he gave benito an unexpected bear hug benito had never seen any real signs of emotional display from erik perhaps this too was svanhild well done boy benito felt considerably taller i brought back the principal and interest on the silver in gold weve got arms for five hundred weve got a secure hidden port and three light galleys we can use to raid the blockade ships and there are more men coming as soon as we have the ships and now let me introduce you to captain di negri benito pointed to the broad curlyhaired swarthy man who was at the head of the column the man stepped forward knightproctor hakkonsen i am fabio di negri the two shook hands sizing each other up i have orders from the doge and the senate to put myself under your command erik raised his eyebrows thats good and surprising to be honest i had to talk long and hard to get them to agree to it said benito with a wry smile fortunately petro and indeed venice know you well captain you are going to be on your own anyway a lot of the time said erik comfortingly weve found the countryside wont really hide more than twenty in one group ive three separate units working now already with your men and the recruits we can bring in we should make the north virtually free of hungary well seriously affect them in the south too i think he turned back to benito and you benito have they very sensibly made you have to take my orders too benito shook his head actually the council of ten has given me another assignment petro was opposed to it but he shrugged i wanted to do it what trying to get the news back into the citadel erik winced benito things have tightened up a great deal since you and i came out largely i am afraid because of what weve been doing out here its nearly impossible to get within two miles of the citadel emeric must have as many men patrolling around there as he has in the siege trenches ill have to go and have a look to see what i can think of erik shook his head something crazy no doubt probably said benito with a yawn meanwhile can we get out of the sun and get a drink of water i drank too much kakotrogi last night erik laughed wryly havent you noticed how dry it is benito the stream in this little valley has dried up were maybe half a mile from the nearest spring thats still flowing the corfiotes say it should be raining now that were into september the rains started and then stopped we havent had a drop since the day we had the earthquake benito scouted with erik and then with thalia pretending to be a peasant with onions to sell he watched for hours trying to find the obvious chinks in emerics armor he had to admit that the organization was slick still what is that compound over there corfiotes slave labor they are taken from villages where they suspect we have sympathizers thalia grimaced mostly they get it wrong theyre not very well guarded and theyre marched up to the front lines every day they have leg chains the ones who are not working have a long chain threaded through all of the leg irons ah i see do we know of a good blacksmith thalia turned to giuliano who is best there are three making arrowheads and spearblades for us gigantes i think the onceplump young son of an armsman smiled he used to make my plows he was always coming up with new ideas that i didnt want do you think he could make me a set of manacles and while im about it provide me with some metalcutting files if you have the gold yes files are precious its a mad plan snapped erik benito shrugged of course it is do you think a sane plan would succeed no but thats not the point a breakout of those prisoners would certainly enhance our popularity even more its a good idea even if i dont like the way you want to do it but look at the rest of it it has one big flaw castles and fortifications are built not to be climbed trust me i know about fortification benito shook his head erik i dont try to tell you about handtohand combat please dont tell me what i can or cant climb i promise you that there are at least seven places where an upperstory man could get into the citadel with ease of course theyve got guards and ive got to get there thats why i am going as one of the prisoners it wont work look after moondown is the time theyll have their sappers sneaking over the guards on the walls will shoot at anything that movesor worse if youre climbing drop boiling pitch or oil on you i know falkenberg told me thats why im going in on the seaward side near where we came down i should be safe enough in the water i forbid it said erik youre throwing away your life benito im afraid erik you cant forbid me to do anything said benito firmly knowing for certain that relief is on its way will give the those inside the kind of fortitude that is worth an extra five hundred men those are my orders from the doge he didnt tell erik that what petro had actually said was if you can let them know without killing yourself he wasnt planning on killing himself if he died it would definitely be by someone elses hand what you can do for me is keep this sword i dont think i can manage to hide it erik looked at the rapier it was plain he recognized the hilt hed been there the day it had been broken and to someone like erik weapons were as distinct as snowflakes thats quite an honor what do you want me to do with it benito shrugged again marco wouldnt appreciate it much if i dont come back have it for a wedding present that you can give to your firstborn son he grinned at eriks look of embarrassment if i do get away with this you and svanll have to put up with a silver saltcellar or something instead erik squeezed his shoulder its a true viking gift he said thickly and our first but i thinkmuch as i envy this bladeid rather have the saltcellar ill do my best to see you get it chapter benito had stripped down to match the slaves the poor devils had nothing more than breeches which mean that the shetland knife the three files spare knives and the manacle key had to be strapped to his legs his body face and the breeches were suitably covered in mud his medal from the hypatians he attached to the beltline if youre due a saltcellar ill have manfred fly the knots banner from the inner wall north tower whispered benito in parting and then he was on his own in what he reluctantly admitted were still his two favorite elements darkness and danger moving along the backs of the tent lines once hed dodged the initial sentries was tricky there were guyropes and on one occasion a soldier relieving himself he moved silently manacles bundled in sackcloth and on his back closer and closer to his target at last he only had the palisade between him and the slaves he lay there trying not to shiver and watched and waited studying the movements of the guards when he was satisfied at last he took the moment and went up and over the eightfoot palisade like a chimneyrat under whom the fire has just been lit then he dropped gently from his full arms stretch this was the worrying part there might be stakes or anything there he landed on something bony that swore at him in greek it was the one thing hed learned reasonably well from taki spiro and kosti as spiro had explained it wasnt that fishermen were crudely spoken it was the fish fish dont understand otherwise shut up he hissed in his nowpassable greek ive come to help you get out of here which was true up to a point sometime later firmly manacled into the line benito lay among the huddledtogetherforwarmth prisoners and pondered what he now knew the prisoners had no idea which place theyd be working in next there were in toto seven strings of twenty the guards came and took chainfuls at a time there were several strings out now the prisonersnaturallyhad wanted to escape immediately another day or night working meant a very real chance of dying benito had his work cut out to persuade them to let him chance getting to the citadel wall his bait however was irresistible lookjust running youve got maybe one chance in a hundred but the resistance fighters out there the kleptheswhich meant bandits but to the greeks the two were remarkably closetheyll be waiting for my signal from inside the fort the night they get it theyll do two things first they want to raid one of the outposts to the south second therell be some with horses and donkeys near the ridge with the holmoaks you get up there yell kalimera and theyll try to get you away in the meanwhile they took turns filing their manacle chains the better part of the way through the newcut metal would be plastered with dust and urine if the opportunity arose theyd probably be able to force them morning came benito found himself sent to be part of a bucketchain passing earth out of one of the mines his one worry now was that he was just that much stronger better fed and less exhausted than his corfiote companions he hoped the bored brutal guards wouldnt notice during that long hot session one of the slaves died the guards took him out of the chain by the simple expedient of chopping his foot off at least he was dead whispered the man next to him zikos was alive when they did it and the mines were considered a lucky option that afternoon benito quietly swapped chains theyve been in all day theyre bound to go out tonight to work on the causeway they did the wrong one he had to wait until the next night benito no longer had to fake looking exhausted hauling rocks and broken masonry to make walls for the troops to advance behind they had hide shields to work behind but these were poor protection against even arquebus fire the guards stayed well back behind some sandbags it was simplicity itself to slip his manacle and lie down when cannon fire made the guards pull their heads down then it was merely a quick wriggle and squirm through a gap and a scraping slide into the water all too easy the water wasnt it wasnt that cold but it was still something of a shock benito began to ease his way swimming very quietly next to the edge of the mole so that his head if anyone saw it might be thought part of the stone fallen from it the siege engineers had been using broken masonry from the town and there were any number of oddshaped bits in the water then flipping onto his back he began swimming away from the mole down the channel toward the sea oh to be one of the merpeople that thought put another into his mind the creature that the merpeople said had been haunting the adriatic benito decided maybe it would be a good idea to swim with his knife in hand after all it was dark and still here in the water when benitos legs touched something moving in the water he very nearly screamed he would have if he hadnt swallowed water in his fright trying not to cough he touched it again it was a rope a moving rope moving slowly toward the citadel shore benito realized it sloped gently down someone was hauling something acrosssomething quite heavy it almost certainly meant no good benito swam in toward the citadel angling away from the rope the rope was actually dragging something around to the south side the shingle strip was very narrow here and the original rock made up part of the corner tower benito eased out of the water with that feeling in the middle of his back that he was in some arquebusiers sights the citadels builders had chopped and polished at the rock here so that the lower section was smooth it did overhang slightly though and this brought benito to where the load was being hauled it wasnt a cave so much as another small overhang also part of the original rock two men were straining to slowly pull something out of the shallows it was plainly heavy there was no way past and besides benito had a feeling it might be more important than the mere news that venice was on her way he waited knife in hand and watched the moon was down and there was little light to see it all by just enough to see that the men were taking strain pulling the heavy weight up the beach the wind was cold and biting on his wet skin and wet breeches starting to shiver benito knew it was now or never two to one and they might have swords or guns the first man was so intent on pulling he died without even knowing benito was there the second turned and managed to grab benitos hand and draw his own blade benito had to seize his arm with his left in the dark beneath the wall they wrestled desperately in absolute silence the fellow was as strong as an ox he was good eight inches taller and seventy pounds heavier than benito by sheer weight he was pushing benito over what was it that erik had said use their strength get them off balance benito tried to footsweep the man it was a dismal failure instead benito was thrown to the shingle and cobbles and lost the knife the hungarian came diving in for the kill benito rolled and hit the fellow just behind the ear with a cobblestonesized rock he hit him twice more and then put some of the rope to good use as well as the mans trousers as a gag then he felt around and found the shetland knife now to see what theyd been doing it was barrels there were already five in the back of the overhang and theyd plainly been surreptitiously drilling into the limestone benito was no engineer would the explosion have damaged the wall he had no idea but the barrels were a great deal easier to roll than to drag he rolled them out toward where the latest one lay all but one that he pried at with the hungarians knife he wasnt breaking his own he liked that knife the barrel was full of powder black gunpowder by the smell of it benito wished he had some way of striking a lightonce he was a bit further away he then had the bright idea of searching his captive and found a flint and steel now all he needed was a gunpowder trail and hed have fireworks to celebrate his return home taking double handfuls of the stuff he crept along the wall strewing it he made a line out to the barrels and put a pile of it against them the only trouble was of course that he couldnt see what hed done still he decided hed used enough then it was lug the semiconscious prisonerwell drag the prisonerclose to the postern benito looked longingly at it it would be so nice and so easy just to go and knock on it now but theyd probably shoot him first in the shadow of wall just short of the postern benito struck sparks into the powder trail hed laid it burned it burned damned fast benito threw caution to the wind dropped the striker and ran jinking farther away from the hungarian lines running eastward along the beach parallel to the wall running there was a good chance the sentries on the wall would see him if they saw him theyd shoot at him first and ask questions later on the other hand if he continued his slow progress hed either be blown up by his own sabotage or spotted and shot in the aftermath of the excitement the explosion would cause the shingle stopped if he recalled right and the cliff took over just beyond that there was a yell and a shot from above benito tried very hard to be small and dove into the water water wasnt a wall or a sandbag but it deflected bullets he was going to stay underwater as long as possible and swim as far and as deep as possible and not spend more time on the surface than he had to he came up in time to hear an explosion but not the huge one hed been expecting he risked a look he could see men with brands running down the length of the wall running back in the direction hed come from he trod water watching even from here he could see the barrels were still on the beach theyd failed to explode his powder trail hadnt worked the explosion must have been the barrel hed opened obviously thered been a powder trail to that too that accidental powder trail had worked well there was nothing for it now but to swim on theyd not expect someone to go on swimming away from the hungarian lines by the time benito got to the ledge swimming was just about too much of an effort once hed hauled himself out of the water and onto it his strength was gone he was exhausted too tired to contemplate a sixtyfoot climb on greasy limestone with anything but dread but it had to be done it seemed like an awfully long way benito hugged himself and danced up and down on the ledge trying to get warm he wasnt succeeding well but the sky was definitely palinghe wanted to be up this corner and over the wall before dawn or he was going to have a long wait on this ledge for nightfall and he might be visible in daylight from the tower windows he began bridging his way up one foot and one hand on either side of the corner balancing between them fortunately it was a very nonstrenuous technique a trick of balance merely benito edged his way upwards toward the faint dark edge of the walltop he paused just below it listening although all he wanted to do was to get over that edge and rest but there was no point in dying just yet not for the sake of a few dozen heartbeats never had the top of even the most difficult building felt quite this satisfying to reach benito didnt walk away he crawled to the stair down it to the deep shadows beside a building he lay there for some time trying to breathe quietly and gather himself up he was in and almost home less likely to be shot anyway but he didnt want to end up in jail again either so where did he go getting into the governors palace like this was not going to be easy tiredly his mind turned automatically to maria she wouldnt mind if he turned up half dead on her doorstep and then well maybe that husband of hersor a note to manfred or francesca or he was too tired to think coherently he stumbled through the narrow lanes the dawn bell competing with the hungarian cannon he passed a few soldiers coming off duty yawning one of them made a comment but benito simply wandered on he obviously looked mad or drunk but harmless because they didnt follow after him he got there the door was closeda drift of sand across the doorsill the shutters were still tight closed although the other houses were now coming to life he knocked there was no reply he peered down the narrow passage that led to the back yard that goat of hers had harassed passersby from here there was no goat today the place had that nobodyliveshere look benito sat down on the steps the doorknob was unpolished the steps were full of windblown debris maria would never have allowed them to look like that a grayhaired old woman peered at him who are you uh benito im looking for maria and and umberto here he was without even a shirt in saltstained breeches his body and face muddy he wished hed thought to wash when hed been in the sea some of it obviously had washed away but hed chosen that finegrained clay that needed hard rubbing shed think he was some kind of lunatic however looking at the old woman he could see she really didnt seem to be all there herself shed made up half her face the effect was a little odd especially when added to the unfocusedlooking eyes she sniffed looking about to cry theyve gone the young man was shot theyve gone with that gorgeous baby like my baby babies always go she wandered off seemingly having forgotten all about him benito took a deep breath and pulled himself together first things first he needed to get off the street hed been plain lucky so far but that couldnt last besides the old womans rambling had worried him upset him even more than finding the person hed always relied on known would be there as a last resort wasnt could maria and the baby alessia be dead he swallowed and vaulted the gate into the tiny yard definitely no one had been here for a while benito sat on the back step and formulated plans as best he could the worry had pushed back exhaustion if there was no maria hed have to turn to his other friend the roofs francesca got up early in a relative sense anyway when shed had the misfortune to have to survive life in the red cat shed thought she got up early then along had come manfred and with him erik and shed finally understood that all things are relative early to a hooker meant before noon to a knight in training it meant before dawn with erik away shed thought manfred might ease back on the predawn training but he seemed to treat it as an act of faith now with the sun peeping through the shutters in long golden streamers was a far better time she swung the shutters open and screamed it was a perfectly natural reaction to seeing someone dropping from the eaves and into her bedroom it took her a moment of hasty retreat to recognize the dirty halfnaked stocky man who simply sat down on the floor benito yep why do you get up so late ive been waiting for you to open up for hours why didnt you knock and get shot through the shutters i tried calling quietly but you obviously didnt hear wheres prince manfred over at the exercise yard ill send someone for him no ill go myself is erik fine benito yawned got any food in the next room look help yourself im going to fetch manfred i havent even done my hair she left at a run francesca never ran benito got wearily to his feet went into the next room and found a bottle of wine and a small loaf he didnt bother to try any further just flopped down in a chair in the far corner and drank wine straight from the bottle with a few hunks of bread to keep it company he just dropped in through the window said francesca unlocking the door i nearly died of fright manfred grinned made your hair stand on end did he she looked dangerously at him i came straight out to call you without even thinking of brushing it manfred youre beautiful even with all your hair standing on end francesca now where is the boy i left him here oh shed spotted benito fast asleep curled into the seat manfred surveyed the boy mud bruises scratches and a pair of tired breeches a threequartersfull wine bottle still clutched and half of a dropped loaf on the floor beside him i suppose he had to choose one of the good bottles said manfred looking at it wryly the kid must be all in he normally sleeps like a cat should we let him sleep manfred shook his head im afraid not he can sleep once hes told us what is happening he stepped over to the chair and began shaking benito the boys skin was clammy to the touch he was shivering faintly here francesca get him a shirt and one of my cottes benito woke with a start an eyesunfocused start reaching for a knife its all right benito said falkenberg beaming at him youre with us benito shook his head obviously trying to clear it sorry wine on an empty stomach and i was a bit tired thanks the latter was addressed to francesca who handed him a shirt and cotte he stood up manfred noticed he was swaying come on falkenberg lets get him into those and he can sit down again i can dress myself shut up said manfred his big fingers struggling with buttons or rather tell us news francesca said you said erik was all right benito nodded yeah fine hes looking like the cat that ate the cream hes got his vinlander and hes got his insurgents and hes making the hungarians bleed weve seen some of it from the walls but im damned glad to hear it for certain manfred sat benito down youve grown boy but my clothes are still a little big for you that was something of an understatement but at least he should be warmer for an autumn day it was warm benito wasnt so what happened to the plans for getting you over to italy is the blockade just too tight or are there just no fishing boats ive been there and back i came back with a hundred and fifty men to help erik and news that the arsenal is building a new fleet as soon as they have the ships dorma will put to sea theres a new war levy theyre recruiting mercenaries and calling for volunteers the old fox himself has put up a thousand men manfred blinked there and back and back inside he looked at the wine standing on the floor and to think i begrudged you that you deserve the entire bottle in fact make it a hogshead id rather have some brandy listendo you know what happened to maria my my friend who told erik i went there first its all shut up francesca smiled knowingly shes fine benito shes down at the little arsenal her husband got himself shot by the libri doro traitors but hes recovering slowly look is there anything else you really must ask him immediately manfred is there anything you really have to tell us benito benito shook his head just was told to bring the news that relief was coming it might be four five more months though and i left a prisoner at the southern postern oh and to ask that you hoist the knots banner at the inner wall north tower at sundown tell erik hes getting a saltcellar after all benito stood up on this cryptic utterance im going to the little arsenal sit down you need to rest said francesca firmly ill go down and tell her benito shook his head youd frighten her silly besides he added grinning in a pale shadow of his usual impishness ive got to tell her that kat wants to know why she hasnt written and i have to check on the baby for her godmama heh if youd met the godmama youd know i dont dare delay francesca shook her head disapprovingly i know men well enough to know id be wasting my time arguing but manfred i think he needs an escort manfred nodded and his own clothes everyone would think a fair had come to town otherwise im going now there was a determined tilt to that chin and a feverish glint in benitos eyes fine fine said falkenberg soothingly well just get you a horse benito closed his eyes momentarily not a horse please well at least wash your face chapter maria was working on the looms on the upper tier keeping a weather eye on the carpenters working on the next level down the gates opened maria blinked at the sunlight on armor then rubbed her eyes unbelievingly she got up slowly and deliberately took alessia from her crib in the shade and walked down the stairsbeing very careful not to stumble her knees felt a little weak benito was grinning at umberto trying not to show his shock the mastercaulker had never been a big man now he looked as if a puff of wind would blow him away he was gaunt and pale and he looked at least twenty years older i hear you got in the way of a bullet umberto the master is a hero said one of the other scuolo affronted by this familiarity he saved the citadel umbertos eyes narrowed focusing on benito signor valdosta benito nodded just benito valdosta or as your wife would have it just trouble you got out maria told me you had been successful in getting out that someone had signaled from the main island raftopo he pointed to benito this is the young man who bought your coracle remember the fellow nodded si i remember umberto wouldnt say what you wanted it for we went over the wall to the island said benito hows maria umberto the former coracleowner shook his head a stolid oxlike thinker he plainly ground everything to its finest if you got out how come youre here manfred patted benito on the shoulder because he came back of course after he went all the way to venice in my coracle ha the former owner looked as if people had all too often tried to put one over him hell nothat sank about a mile away said benito fishing boat to italy small trader up the west coast and then a damned horse over the apennines to ferrara barge to venice the scuolo wrestled with the implications of this you mean back again i see said maria you know benito youre the original bad penny but she was smiling broadly as she said it and her eyes seemed a little moist he was looking like benito at first she thought he had shrunk the she realized it was just outsize clothes good clothes but enormous the cotte hung like a dress on him which was maybe just as well the breeches he wore were muddy and saltstained his feet were bare and filthy and his face she looked at it remembering it had lost a little of the youthfulness and he was as pale as a nocturnal case vecchie gentleman he was smiling at her very oddly hows alessia he asked her godmother wanted me to ask she put a hand on his forehead it was clammy but hot you can find out when you get out of the hospital you idiot hes feverish prince take him there before he falls over on us benito obliged her by doing just that manfred walked over to the commanders offices after theyd deposited benito in the care of the monks there were times for subtlety and quiet contact this wasnt one of them commander leopoldos over at the south wall sir theres a bit of a situation there we had explosions there early this morning manfred laughed benito ill go and see him there he went by horse with von gherens having had a sudden thought he dispatched falkenberg to go and keep a watch over benito the boy could easily be the target of whoever the spies in the citadel were the morale boost to the citadel of having news from venice was huge that was why manfred had told the men at the little arsenal what benito had done it would run like wildfire around the fortress it would get to whoever was spying too emeric wouldnt enjoy hearing that news we think he may be some sort of trap said leopoldo pointing to the man at the foot of the tower hes alive weve seen him move so why is he tied up who is he and there are those barrels of what is probably gunpowder over there manfred looked at the bound trouserless man and at the shingle strip with four haphazardly lying barrels on the beach nope he said with a grin and in a good carrying voice thats benitos work you can go out and collect the prisoner ill go out and fetch him if you like thats a lot of black powder if there is shrapnel in it and it goes off prince youll be mincemeat i told you commander my agent benito valdosta caught that saboteur last night when my man was coming in from the venetian forces you should come up to the hospital and hear all the details venetian forces hadnt i told you yet the scouts for the venetian relief force have arrived if the black powder in the barrels on the shingle had suddenly gone off it could scarcely have caused a bigger explosion hidden in some aleppo pines in a rocky little defile erik surveyed the citadel gloomily it was still defiant bathed in the last of the evening light but he didnt see what he hoped to see on the first day after the young tearaway left he actually expected to see the banner of the knights in that corner tower when it wasnt hoisted hed given orders to move from all the localities benito knew torture got information out of anyone so did black magic and emeric used both the next day he still hoped tonight was merely a duty the youngster was either a prisoner or dead and most likely the latter erik thought about the sword benito had left in his keeping and sighed hed love to own it but hed part with it in a heartbeat if it could have spared the boy he was so caught up in these morbid thoughts that he didnt realize that flying above the north tower of the inner wall was the famous treble cross of the knights of the holy trinity itll be the most welcome saltcellar a bridal couple ever got he said to himself laughing in relief he must be down to two of his nine lives the slave breakout that night brought erik sixtytwo fanatical new recruits but eriks first priority was to feed the poor devils up a bit the magyar officer shook his head they seem to have forgotten the meaning of trust they wont even parley sire let alone agree to terms early daysback in juneall they did when they saw our men was make sure the gates were shut and watch us but now feeling has hardened sire theyre shooting on sight both paleokastritsa and kassiopi are still holding out ive put men on watch and theyre in a sort of siege but without cannon and a lot more men i dont see reducing either emeric considered well play a waiting game then i dont want to take men off the siege here getting the heavy cannon to either of those two towns would be very difficult anyway sire there is no road just a donkeytrack it could be done but it would take a lot of men and a lot of effort easier to starve them out when the citadel falls theyll be forced to surrender emeric nodded i see the peasants are coming back onto the land the men and the older women are sire you dont see a child except running away basically hunger forced them out but the lack of rain is worrying them emeric snorted wryly i can only have it one way the rain must stay away from the venetians too so what did you find out about the murder of those two libri doro collaborators the magyar officer scowled the peasants did it sire but they swear it was some klepthesbandits from the hills in the north we really do have a problem with that our troops cant move singly i have to send them everywhere in squads ive tried torture ive tried beatings ive executed a few in front of their families no one talks so i tried a different tactic in gastouri with that second murder were twenty miles away from where id tried the last time this time i pretended it hadnt happened i told my men to go easy to buy the locals drinks to convince them we were simply taking over from venice and that theyd find us far better masters the peasants wont drink with us unless you hold a knife to their throats i finally asked one old bastard why he said we eat babies and feed our dogs their bones i told him this was rubbish but he insisted hed been shown the gnawed bones i dont want to go back there umberto maria said knowing she couldnt tell him the real reasonthat she was certain sophia tomaselli had put some kind of illwishing on the house and on him for that matter she wouldnt put it past the woman to try to get someone to poison them at this point living there just made her feel too exposed but none of those things would have made any sense to umberto i know its getting colder down here wed benefit from living in a proper house again but im scared i wont take you there i wont take alessia there umberto smiled well it makes a suggestion i have to make easier maria i have here a letter from master grisini hes not well the honest truth is hes concerned for his wifes future if he should die the captaingeneral would then reallocate his home his wife should go back to venicein the normal course of events of course that cant happen right now because of the siege grisini is deeply worried that the captaingeneral will take a rather spiteful and petty vengeance by moving the old lady out he could do it too however the house is a very large one and what grisini proposes is that weyou and me and alessiamove into the lower section its still bigger than our old house the move doesnt have to be approved by anyone except commander leopoldo and hes a reasonable man if master grisini dies well be sitting tenants the captaingeneral wont be able to evict us and we can give houseroom to old mrs grisini until the siege is lifted and she goes back to venice the house is a lovely one and grisini is afraid if the scuolo lose tenancy of it well never get anything nearly as good again he suggests we move four of the illyrians into our old house to stop fights with the corfiotes down here maria shrugged umberto old mrs grisini isnt really in this world anyway but if it means i dont have to take you and alessia back to that house fine your agent you dared to do this without my permission eberhard cleared his throat captaingeneral tomaselli while this place is a venetian possessionprince manfred is not a venetian subject to be a bit blunt he doesnt need permission to get his men to do anything and he did in fact obtain carte blanche from the governor to get a message out signor valdosta here was delivering a message to the emperor of the holy roman empire from the prince that was his primary task which he achieved it was done on the princes orders and with the princes money the fact that young benito is a good citizen of your republic and did his civic duty by reporting the matter to the relevant authorities there also and returned with ships and men was a bonus for venice he paused i know you see this as an attack on the venetian republic but please understand to us it is a danger to the man who is second in line for the throne of the holy roman empire by comparison the emperor holds corfu or even the venetian republicthough staunch friendsto be of lesser value the reason that huge imperial efforts are going into relieving this siege is the prince our secrecy has nothing to do with a lack of faith in you personally it was just that this matter was purely about prince manfred it spoke volumes for the influence that the older statesman had been able to exert over the captaingeneral that tomaselli did calm down i hadnt thought of it like that but nonetheless i should have been consulted the security of this fortress is my responsibility and any route this man followed could be followed by hundreds of enemy troops the way must be blocked benito laughed that made him cough when the paroxysm finished he said i swam the better part of a mile in two sections i climbed a sixtyfoot cliff on the seaward side of the citadel in the dark next thing the magyar will be doing it on horseback and in full armor eberhard patted benito soothingly hes not well captaingeneral im sure hell show your men the spot when hes up but it would not be easy for anyone else ill take you down it personally captaingeneral tomaselli i wouldnt dream of letting someone else assess the security benito went off into coughing again hes fevered i think we must leave him to rest come captaingeneral eberhard showed tomaselli out and on the way shook his fist at benito behind the captaingenerals back manfred and benito restrained themselves from sending benito off into a coughing fit again until the captaingeneral had mounted his horse and was clopping away it is a good thing i insisted on von gherens staying outside said manfred his shoulders still shaking benito looked at manfred its an equally good thing i didnt tell him that petro dorma has decided to relieve the pompous ass of his post and promote commander leopoldo in his place what that would solve a hell of a lot of problems benito raised his eyebrows really do you think hed believe me its not as if i can prove it captain di negri has a set of orders signed by the doge with the seal of the republic on them but i didnt see swimming in with them i hadnt thought of that chapter maria went to the door to answer the knock it wasnt anastasia the young corfiote girl who looked after old mrs grisini she always knocked firmly and in a recognizable pattern a pity shed have loved to ask her to mind umberto and maybe even alessia if the old lady was asleep she really had to go up to the temple again umberto was upand then downand she didnt know who else to turn to but this was a very quiet knock tentative she opened the door to see benito standing there what are you doing out of bed no ones asked me into one he said with his old impish grin even the monks have chased me out his face became earnest maria before i left venice for the first time petro said i should come and see you and offer to babysit before i left venice this time an undine called juliette charged me with seeing to alessias welfare im better but im still forbidden drill or to do too much exercise so i came to do what petro and juliette said i must ive come to babysit maria gaped at him you cant be serious benito shrugged as much as i ever am petro dormas no fool as i learned eventually and i sort of made a bargain with juliette so lead me to it tell me what to do and you go out and get some time off maria held her head and shook it as if to check that it was still attached to her shoulders holy mother i dont believe this look umbertos not so good today either ive promised him id look in at the little arsenal see how thing are going ive um got another visit i really need to make lessis asleep now but would you stay with her and umberto if you mean it that is he smiled for once it was a smile with no overtones no sense of anything hidden and nothing of his mad recklessness in it i mean it like i said lead me to it when maria came back guiltily knowing that shed been away for longer than shed meant to be she heard laughter from inside her new home she found benito had umberto sitting up against the cushions in the bedroom while he was executing intricate venetian dance steps with alessia in his arms shes a better dancer than you are said maria trying not to join in the laughter she couldnt be worse benito grinned i absolutely hated the dancing instructions that dormas mother made me suffer through marco now he makes it look easy here maria i think shes getting hungry he even changed her maria said umberto wonderingly hes a braver man than i maria thought umberto was looking a great deal better than when shed left benito wrinkled his nose youve just got to switch your senses off sort of make it just a job to be gotten through its no worse than a lot of other things ive done and better than no few maria shook her head at him just when i think i know how your mind works benito you go and surprise me again i never thought youd be any good with children benito looked like mischief incarnate its because they trust me nobody else does maria snorted and thats no surprise now maria said umberto gently hes made me laugh ill say i feel better for it maria gave benito a reluctant smile oh hes not all bad just half bad now im going to feed alessia excuse me benito gave her a little bow ill take my leave too umberto maria ill take a look in down at the little arsenal umberto i want to see those boats come back and tell me what you think maria walked him to the door bit her lip looking at him thanks she said quietly he shrugged its nothing ill come again if you like umberto kind of surprised me hes got interesting ideas about those fireboats that had surprised her too he looks better for the visit but next time let me show you how to fold a napkin it was a tacit admission that she wouldnt object to a next time she thought as she patted alessias derriere this is a mess so was what i found there believe me ill see you he probably wouldnt she thought hed be off on his next madcap stunt which would be far more interesting than looking after a sick man and a baby and where have you been young fellermelad asked manfred with a buffet that would have made benitos ears ring for a good while if he hadnt ducked enjoying the adulation of the admiring young women of the citadel francesca tells me youre a very soughtafter young bachelor benito grinned its hard being popular if only you werent seven sizes too big you could try it he ducked again listen seriously do you know about the project theyve been busy with at the little arsenal the fireboats manfred shook his head no and whose project is this thats just it the arsenalotti have been at odds with the captaingeneral so theyve been doing it on their own theyve got nearly thirty of these things built they reckon theyve materials for twice that theyre smallish boatslong and slim and designed for speed umbertomaria verriers husbanddesigned the things ive just been down to have a look the guy is good manfred those things with a good following wind will be like arrows and just how are we supposed to launch these arrows asked falkenberg curiously hold the beach while theyre carried outside theyve been built to be lowered over the wall into the water he got the idea from erik and me and our coracle stunt except theyre making davits and winches one of the men down at the little arsenal was showing me and you say theyve kept this in the dark not deliberately they were just looking for an opportunity to bring it up with tomaselli in charge that wont happen said falkenberg not that it isnt a good idea might be at least take me down for a look in sometime benito count mindaug was scowling fiercely given the slight distortion always present in the summoned image above the bloodbowl the expression made him look even uglier than ever i hadnt thought hed be this cautious elizabeth mindaug admitted by now id expected jagiellon to have intervened directly the countess decided that her silvery laugh would irritate mindaug too much at the moment so she kept her expression simply serene keep in mind kazimierz that chernobog is ancient even if the shell he inhabitsthat thing that used to be the prince jagiellonis still a relatively young man for demons ancient and prudent are almost synonyms even for a demon with a savage temper like his true enough still give it time which we have by the way months yet probably the attempted treason failed and my agent in the fortress informs me that any further attempts will take considerable time to organize unfortunatelyor perhaps fortunately given chernobogs hesitancythe woman who is running the citadels counterespionage work is extremely astute mindaugs eyebrows rose a woman since when do venetians shes not venetian shes one of the imperials prince manfreds leman to boot so she has plenty of influence her name is francesca de chevreuse the name she goes by i should say since i doubt very much its her real one now the count was shaking his head for a moment the tips of his sharpfiled teeth showed what is the world coming to in the old daysyourself excepted of coursewomen handled the gossip not the statecraft since mindaugs mood seemed to be improving elizabeth issued her silvery laugh dont be silly even in lithuania thats not true or have you already forgotten grand duchess imenilda that was almost a century ago besides she was ruthenian the ruthenians have always been a peculiar lot meaning no offense elizabeth bartholdy had quite a bit of ruthenian blood in her own ancestry none taken i assure you to get back to the point kazimierz i really think youre worrying too much count mindaug studied her for a moment then said abruptly that may be elizabeth but the fact remains that i now need to consider seriously the consequences of failure if this trap of yours doesnt workeven if only because jagiellon avoids iti will be the one to face the immediate repercussions not you he raised his hand and eyed it granted its not the finest skin in the world but its the only one ive got id just as soon avoid having it served up for one of the monsters meals he lowered the hand and brought his eyes back to hers ill need to run elizabethwhich means ill need a place to run to the countess ran a delicate fingertip across her lower lip thinking she was not surprised of course that the issue had finally come up shed already given it quite a bit of thought herself in fact you understand that i do not share your interest in territorial and material matters mindaugs pointed teeth showed again youre not that indifferent to them elizabeth or do you really think youd be able to pursue your own interestsif you were a peasant woman she laughed point taken nevertheless he was shaking his head im well aware that your ambitions and mine are different all the more reason it seems to me that there neednt be any clash between us even if how to say it even if even if you were residing in the carpathians instead of vilnaand trying to subvert my greatgreatnephew and assume the throne of hungary instead of jagiellons thats putting it bluntly but yes he waited his face impassive elizabeth thought a moment further then shrugged i cant say i have any particular attachment to emeric hes easier to manipulate than you would be but on the other hand mindaug finished the thought for her im smarter than he is which means id cause fewer messes for you to have to manipulate me out of he left unspoken the obvious final clause assuming you could but elizabeth was not worried about that and the more she thought about it the more she could see a number of advantages to having mindaugif necessary which she still didnt think it would betaking asylum and refuge with her done then that assumes of course that our plans fail needless to say i assure you elizabeth that id much prefer to remain in vilna if at all possible if nothing else im too old to take any pleasure at the thought of a frantic race to get out of lithuania ahead of jagiellons wrath chernobogs wrath kazimierz dont ever forget who youre really dealing with for the first time he laughed himself no chance of that elizabeth its why i approached you in the first place a mere grand duke even one as capable and vicious as jagiellon i would have been confident of handling on my own he glanced aside as if looking over his shoulder i simply prefer to avoid the name thats all the black brain is near to me and it never pays to do anything to tingle its attention speaking of which his hands began moving i think its time to end this discussion within seconds his image had faded away part xi october ad chapter diego sighed it is fairly certain that whoever the satanist iswhoever they are i should say since theres certainly more than onehe or she is aware that we are hunting for them this is the third place where we have found their foul traces but never anything more and theyve been very cautious never to leave material we can trace to a physical place or person francis nodded and venturing beyond the physical here where we are denied the protection of one of the wards is nearly impossible eneko lopez went to a cupboard in the back of the chapel so i think we should investigate this he produced the driedout bundle of herbs and other unpleasantness that someone had once tried to use as a curse on maria verrier but it is a fake protested diego i know said eneko but let us consider the very nature of satanworship its essence is to recruit more souls unlike demons who are content to devour devils accumulateand use their acolytes to accumulate and whoever did this is ripe for accumulation theyor parts of their covenmay already be drawn into this he held up the bundle a bit gingerly here we have physical traces with some risks we can use these to divine where they came from and once we have that we may catch some trace of our other tormentor or tormentors by the time that the afternoon sun was sinking the priests knew more about the curse one of the things they knew was that the maker knew absolutely nothing about how to stop themselves being traced by magic the priests patiently set a watch on the suspected house curfew or no curfew it was after the midnight bell that they saw the various visitors arrive then the priests calmly went down the street and waited for the knights patrol just what are you doing out here father lopez asked ritter wellmann it is after curfew you know we need some venetian soldiers too ritter please fetch some for us to do what asked wellmann gods work brother im supposed to be on patrol not on missionary work eneko lopez was not amused you are knights of god your oath is to serve him first ritter send two of your men to fetch a detachment of troops and their officer here now ten minutes later an alarmedlooking lieutenant and some twenty pikemen arrived at a run i sent a message up to the fortress said the lieutenant what is it a mine spiritually speaking yes said eneko follow me the house must be surrounded and we must move in quickly wellmann take the door down with your axe ritter wellmann was an artist with an axe business thought morando was booming he always tried to think of other things at this stage it required detachment the carefully soundproofed inner sanctum hed created in the cellar of this unobtrusive house had no less than five of the citadels leading social lights in it and they were dressed exquisitely for the occasion thought the confidence trickster forcing down a snicker bianca casarini was a true gem of a recruiter the trade in information he sold fianelli was even more profitable than the money he got directly from the women since the curse incidentwhich had apparently even worked to morandos astonishmentsophia was his to command the one problem with her and the other women shed brought around was that all of them seemed to derive more from the sinfulness of the ritual hed invented than they did from the actual deeds it was trying his imagination not to mention at times his spine the other problem was getting the paraphernalia black candles had to be made and hed had to resort to stealing chickens to dye black he had a fortune hidden under a paving stone in this room but he still had to steal chickens because they just werent for sale any more tonight hed used a cat they seemed to like that even if hed felt rather sorry for the poor creature his supply of hashish was running dangerously low too he couldnt see replacing that until the siege was lifted or lost still the cellar was well hidden and he had stores of food and water hed sit out the orgy of killing and looting that he knew would happen if the hungarians won with bianca and sophia to keep him company and provide him with pleasure if the venetians won well hed farm sophia and her friends a little longer and then it would be time to shave his beard and leave with a convoy heading to outremer to enjoy a rich retirement in constantinople bianca had already agreed to come with him by the moaning and panting he would soon be called on to chant some gibberish again morando had even made an effort with a grimoire hed obtained years earlier to garner some real words and phrases grimoire socalled at least morando suspected the thing was probably a fake which was fine with him when all was said and done playing with satanism served his purposes well enough and morando wanted no part of the genuine article and then aldo morando discovered the real fault with good soundproofing and a cellar whose only secret escape route took considerable time to open they stormed in lieutenant agra made sure he was the very first in through the door the room was a grave disappointment it had a very ordinary table a straightbacked chair and a simple oil lamp the flame wavering in the sudden disturbance there was no one there nor in the single bedroom or the kitchen but the priests seemed unperturbed if in a hurry they joined hands and chanted as they did a misty trail of footprints appeared on the floor ending at what appeared to be just another flagstone in the floor break it commanded the short slight priest with the eagle gaze quickly there is bound to be another way out the knight with the axe tried to put the edge of his axe into the crack with a growl of impatience the priest took the axe from him and smashed it into the flagstone it split the stone was set into a wooden frame full of lambswool the knight took the handle of the axe and hauled and ripped the hidden trapdoor right out agra was down those smokeshrouded stairs so fast he nearly broke his neck on them at the foot of them amid the screaming despite the press at his back he stopped hed expected nearly anything but this the room reeked of smells that of hashish prominent among them naked masked women their breasts groins and in at least one case buttocks painted with strange bloody patterns clung to a man wearing a long cloak of blackandred velvet black boots and nothing else not all of the women had the sort of bodies that the lieutenant would have paid to see naked even the smoky room lit with black candles could only do so much it was the black altar and the headless cat lying with its neck in a bowl though that really got him at least until the women went berserk the lieutenant then discovered how well frightened and desperate women can scratch and bite benito sat drinking some wine with maria and umberto in their small bedroom umberto sat against the pillows and maria on the foot of the bed benito was sitting on the chair from the living room alessia was attempting to suck her toes on a rug at their feet benito had been back every day to sit a while with umberto and alessia marias initial surprise had given way to acceptance but today she hadnt taken advantage of it to go out today she wanted to know what was happening she was worried and not without reason benito grimaced at the wine i suppose the one thing we can be grateful for is that weve still got enough wine for a full ration if it was good wine we wouldnt have the libri doro didnt want to buy it because it was so lousy so even though the granary is down to an eighth full and the upper wells are running dry weve got wine if you can call it that maria shook her head at him in irritation benito stop burbling about wine and tell us what happened you were there you should know the rumors in the lower town today are amazing a coven of witches sacrificing babies and having orgies with demons and blasting priests and buildings to ashesa highclass brothela cabal of female thieves god knows what people are claiming all sorts of things ive even given in to curiosity and been to have a look not that there was much point theres a guard and a smashedin door but you cant see anything else manfred says its like a traveling players version of a mixture between hell and a brothel down below in the cellar they took him to see it its pretty tawdry in daylight apparently but the lieutenant who was testifying is thinking about becoming a monk after last night benito chuckled apparently he saw a great deal more of a number of mostly unattractive women than he really wanted to anyway it seems that some bored case vecchie women had initially gone to morando because of his reputation as an astrologer and chemist andahsexual physician apparently no matter what else he can do hes quite a lover or at least they think he is and they findingat lasta lover who wanted to hear gossip as much as they wanted to indulge in it came in droves well i guess five women isnt really a drove maria snorted theyre saying sophia tomaselli was right on the top of the heap the captaingeneral is trying desperately to hush it all up said benito nodding shes his wife after all both her eyebrows went up and the wife of the salt minister and of the largest oil exporter on the island come on benito everybody already knows all that he might as well try to hush the sea people are getting very restive about it the scuolo are all for burning the castel a terra benito was silent for a moment then he said wryly fortunately they jailed the man and the women separately because all the women came out singing one tune it was a complete fraud a putup job by the knights to discredit their husbands and allow the prince to take over theyd been kidnapped stripped abused and locked in the cellar they wanted the knights punished for the degradation by being thrown out of the sanctuary that venice had kindly offered themand the cowardly mercenaries whod sold out to them shot what umberto had started upright alessia stopped playing with her toes you cant be serious dead serious and tomaselli was ready to make it stick heh it was pretty exciting what with lieutenant agra having to be restrained and calling the captaingenerals wife a whore and witch well he was dead right yes well as it pans out half right morando lent her some of his occult booksthose were fakes too eneko saysand apparently she tried to cast curses onahpeople she considered to be her enemies he interrupted himself before he said the name but maria saw the guilty look in his eyes and she knew who he was going to say and although she had suspected it having the evidence in front of her was enough to send her simmering temper into full boil so that was indeed where the illwishing had come from but benito was continuing fortunately old man de belmondo was sick and we had the assistant podesta of corfu standing in hes one of the libri doro but he did his law in padua university and takes it pretty seriously he pointed out that since it was the captaingenerals wife accused tomaselli couldnt take part in the hearings and he sent the guard off to fetch the other justices even de belmondo from his sickbed and as i say it was fortunate that theyd kept the man separate hes from the north of italy originally milan in factpauline country they burn witches up there on suspicion his namethe one he goes by here anyway is aldo morando he was so keen to prove he wasnt a manwitch or a satanist that he was spilling the beans as fast as he could he was selling information and black lotos and acting as a glorified pimp for that gaggle of rich women they followed up several of his confessions and found them all true then they had the brains finally to split the women up and question them individually then they came apart their stories didnt tally eventually the truth became obvious umberto shook his head confused what that he really was training witches in our midst practicing black magic well no benito said that he was casting horoscopes telling fortunes dabbling in the occult mostly as window dressing for his real interestgetting information from one set of stupid bored sexually unsatisfied women to sell to whoever might be interested in it the justices called eneko lopez and he said although theyd hoped to catch real practitioners of black arts that this lot were simply nasty spoiled bored rich women and what happened then well to make a long story short eneko had cut the legs out from under the justices its not an offence to prance around naked in a cellar done up to look like a cheap whorehouse with astrological trimmings and while selling the stuff is illegal simply using black lotos is also not a crime as for participating in orgies and gossiping to your lover well the outcome of that is mostly up to the husbands not the courts what you mean theyve got away with this the scuolo will umberto was struggling to stand up benito flicked up out of the chair and pushed him down gently relax for starters selling information to enemy agents is a serious matter so is pimping morando is the one whos really to blame here and they have him dead to rights they even got him for chicken theft and two of the ladies of corfu high society are up for prostitution it appears that morando was selling their favors for certain services he renderedincluding tomasellis sophia but the cream of it is that lieutenant agrathe one who got so upset about being called a cowardly sellout mercenaryhas slapped a civil suit for defamation against them so whats happening to them now morando will rot in jail until trial in venice the treason part will probably have him executed the others well theyve been bailed released into the custody of their spouses except for the wife of the salt minister she asked to remain in jail for her own safety since he threatened to kill her benito shook his head ruefully not that i think under the circumstances those other women will find their husbands very ah protective probably beat them to a pulp so you mean that tomaselli bitch is out there free demanded maria furiously calm down maria i will not calm down ill youre upsetting alessia benito had picked the baby up and was soothing her maria pursed her lips and took a deep breath i am going out she said between clenched teeth maria said umberto anxiously promise me you wont do anything stupid please benito had moved between her and the door think of alessia maria you hurt sophia youre the one who will end up being punished and by doing that youll be punishing your baby shed rather have a mother at home get out of my way benito valdosta im not going to kill anybody unless its you for not moving im going to talk to someone a friend im your friend i need to talk to a woman a man wouldnt understand now give me alessia ill stay and take care of her just promise us you wont do anything crazy she laughed bitterly thats rich benito coming from you just let me go see ill be back once ive got this out of me renate de belmondo handed maria a cup of steaming fragrant liquid this tisane is a kind of magic too she said with a gentle smile there are more and deeper magics than eneko lopez and his kind understand there is magic in things they consider inert there is power in people that they cannot detect there are magics in love and hatred too especially here maria sipped the brew it was soothing there was no doubt about it vervain and a little heartsease there are times and places for the picking of both and it can only be done by one who has the great goddesss hand about her renate looked sternly at her you must learn maria to control and direct that anger of yours otherwise youll hurt those closest to you maria bit her lip there was some truth in that she had to acknowledge especially this afternoon she knew that the source of the curse on her house was sophia tomaselli even if she couldnt prove it shed heard some of what benito had not told herjust what sophia had said to the justices to the curious gathered around as she and the other women were taken away vitriolic to say the least and sophia placed all of the blame on being caught on maria and though of course it was not in the least logical if you believed sophia it was maria who had somehow forced her into the spys service its its just the injustice of it all its not right the older woman looked at her thoughtfully a sense of justice is a part of what makes us what we are some of us are willing to suffer ourselves to make sure there is retribution even if it costs us you are one like that maria thought back to her singlehanded vendetta against the casa dandelo when caesare wouldnt helpand benito the scamp did yes i suppose so but are you prepared to extract the cost of your retribution from others from innocent parties from your friends just the intonation said to maria that this was a very important question a question far wider than just the issues shed run to renate with she paused to think maria thought of what benito had said about alessia and of what shed decided to do she shook her head no renate smiled maria noticed that small lines eased from around her eyes the goddess and her followers do not practice retribution i dont think i can forgive that woman for what she tried to do renate shook her head neither could i but our justice is based on restitution and restitution finds no gain in mere retribution sophia tomaselli was looking for retribution she was quite content to hurt innocent parties in her quest to get it maria sighed yes but well it was such a small thing i mean she set out to attack everythingmy life my loved ones lives for something so small so unimportant who on earth cares if some people think im more attractive than she is why would it make any difference to me its not as if im competing with her for anything its not fair renate curled her lip of course it is not fair such a person is an island of their own selfimportance the fact that their retribution is totally out of proportion will not benefit them and will hurt others is irrelevant you dared to slight the most important person in her universe anything is acceptable to punish you maria paused for a while sipping the tea this might all be true but it didnt apply directly to her problem right now did it so what do i do about her priestess im not having that woman on the loose to endanger my man or my child again she might try anything poison thugs planting evidence to make us look like traitors renate smiled i am only the priestess when i let down my hair and don the robes she pursed her lips of course a charge of attempted murder should stick i suggest tomorrow you swear one out the fact that she used a weapon that she did not know wouldnt work does not alter the fact that she tried after all if a man tries to shoot another and the weapon fails to fire it is still an attempt at murder she would be confined again in that case the older woman took a deep breath other than that you must come to me every day now i must teach you certain magics and certain rituals that will protect you and yours i must teach you too how to control that temper of yours how to break it to harness me i cant do magic the priestess stood up and put her hands on either side of marias head you already do magic magic that eneko lopez does not understand exists magic more powerful than he understands an old rough and elemental kind of magic but strong she took her hands away and tugged at a sidelock of her white hair a gesture indicating thought in the priestess who was also the governors wife you know i know a great deal about sophia tomaselli in some ways we are very alike maria shook her head vehemently you couldnt be more unalike renate twinkled i think thats a compliment but there are some similarities that eneko lopez would see for example we are both aristocrats at the apogee of our social setting we both turned to other sources of comfort after we arrived here we both i believe did so for the same reasons we both wanted to get pregnant i know sophia has tried all sorts of treatments and diets and consulted churchmen at some length she fell in with a trickster i fell in with one of my maids she was a corfiote and felt sorry for me there but for fortune went i maria shook her head again vehement no sophia cares for nobody but herself its a blessing shes never had a child you care for everybody i dont believe youd have done something like trying to curse me and mine thats not like you i dont think i would have done what she did no and caring is what the sisterhood looks for sisterhood and that was why i was taken to the temple that is why you were and that is why she wasnt the two things are not alike at all said maria stubbornly sticking to her earlier contention the mother is gentlenot sick renate shrugged ruefully stella is inclined to sensationalize news but still yes those women were seeking perversion probably some of it came out of their mothers telling them that the natural urges and pleasures of their bodies were bad wrong and evil therefore they came to conclude that evil gave pleasure possibly only because they were bored and their husbands were under the impression that if they were pleasured and pleased it didnt matter if their wives were she sighed i dont want to deceive you maria the great goddess well there is one aspect that does call for a willing sacrifice and the spring ritual dance is conducted in the nude but no men are part of it it is done for a reason she stood up again now i think youre all safe enough tonight here she took from her reticule a sprig of green holly prickly thing and full of the heart of greenness put it above the door lintel not with cold iron if it turns blackcome running and bring your child and go barefoot if you can touching the earth it will be difficult for any other magic to affect you now she looked mischievous dont tell eneko lopez thats why his spells dont work well here contact with the earth of corcyra the earth here drinks magic the more they use the less well it works and the magic is reborn in other forms within the earth we use it i want to learn very well you must come to me here this hilltop was a temple before it was a fort one of the entries to the inner temple is still here chapter he looked as though he might very possibly throttle her thought sophia he hadnt said a word all the way back to their chambers in the east wing of the fortress now with the heavy door closed behind them he turned on her in fury how could you you bitch how could you im the laughingstock of the citadel ill be the laughingstock of all venice when the siege is over ill never hold another position of authority youyou my mother was right i should never have married you she drew herself up nico i did this for you i went to this man to try and see if there was somethinganythingi could do to have the heir you needed he snorted disdainfully ha yes by turning yourself into a puttana by sleeping with half my officers grand you give me an heir that isnt even mine she looked down her nose at him those are absolutely trumpedup lies nico tomaselli as if i would ever desire another man but you she sniffed i thought it was a fertility rite harmless and they they made out we were having orgies and and all i wanted was a baby for you she burst into calculated tears they had never failed her before but they did this time he folded his arms and not around her even if it were true its not what people are going to say venice takes a dim view of these things that new doge dorma is very straightlaced why he even exiled his own ward for his antics and they were nothing like being paraded through half the streets of the citadel screaming and fighting stark naked i dont know how i will ever hold up my head in venice again then dont what choice do i have sophia he demanded what choice have you left me his weak mans rage was beginning to build again sophia had one last card left to pay one last token from morando which shed been trying to think of a way to use for weeks it had come magically transported her lover had said hed suggested she make a lever out of it shed hesitated but now she had no choice i have to show you something in my bedroom im not interested right now you will be come she simply walked up to her room by the time he got there shed taken out the folded letter here she handed it to him he looked at the address the seal who opened a letter to me from the doge he demanded i did because i love you and look after you open it see how well venice rewards you for your loyal service after all these years he opened the letter she watched as his ruddy face turned pale he looked as if he were about to burst into tears who cares what they think of you in venice she demanded let us go where they will appreciate us he bit his knuckle damn dorma damn him to hell leopoldo in my place after all ive done here it was entirely typical of her husband sophia thought contemptuously that he never thought to ask her how shed obtained the letter but not for the first time she was glad he was a fundamentally stupid man she was in desperate straits herself nowwith outright treason as her only option damn drat and blast the man for an interfering busybody said francesca furiously ive had a watch on fianelli for weeksand now thanks to lopezs meddling ive lost him he was gone before the soldiers got to his shop who cares about morando he was just a minor player working for fianelli manfred patted her soothingly there dear look at it this wayyoull have a splendid time finding him again if looks could kill manfred would have been ripe for burial its not a game manfred she said in such a tone that even he sat up straight morando by himself was nothing fianelli was dangerous he still may be somehow he was getting information outfianelli not morandoin a way that none of your clever men suspected and that nothing you did uncovered if he was getting information out what did he get in what could he get in von gherens looked puzzled if you knew who he was weeks ago why didnt you let us deal with him then francesca eyed him darkly von gherens you are to intrigue what deportment lessons are to a brothel the ritter thought about this one for a while useful you mean so why didnt we deal with this spy weeks ago francesca i dont get it like the deportment lessons id guess she was planning to start feeding him wrong information said manfred yawning shed have had morando arrested quietly and blackmailed him into turning on his former allies francesca smiled on him youre proof it is possible for someone to learn even if carrying all that armor starves the brain of blood thats one reason the other was i wanted the final link i wanted to know how he was getting the information out to emeric von gherens rubbed his broken nose you should have talked to eneko lopez earlier then you could have helped each other each of you had what the other needed what do you mean von gherens crossed himself i mean fianelli was the satanist eneko was actually looking for he was using demonic magic to send the information eneko and his friends had detected him sending it but couldnt find him you found him but couldnt work out how he sent it you two should talk francesca gritted her teeth i should have and i will captaingeneral tomaselli was not the most effective soldier or administrator privately he knew that but hed tried he had been loyal to venice that they should promote thatthatupstart leopoldo into his place was unbearable it was unfair and thinking of that unfairness tomaselli dwelled more and more on the unthinkable he could ask for a great deal if he switched his allegiance to the hungarians he wouldnt have to soldier or administrate any more things which he was not really good at and sophia would be out of jail hed been horrified when apologetic soldiers had come to fetch her again those damned disrespectful scuolo sluts how dare that woman swear out a charge against sophia hed taken small but satisfying steps to have some of her familys ration reduced after all her husband wasnt working now all he needed was a way to contact emeric to make a deal he would talk to sophia she might have some idea how he could do it she was the only one he could trust it was clear to him now that the charges against her were all false shed been betrayed as surely as he had and he could take her some decent food and wine again he went as often as three times a day anyway her trial hed have to reach a deal before then theyd conspired against her thus far the trial would be a mockery of course magnifying her small digressions into vast things as a way of getting at him that was what was behind the whole thing he now understood well hed show them what are you doing here hissed the man who opened the door for fianelli the secretary for the podesta glanced over his shoulder nervously looking to see if there was anyone in the corridor behind him fianelli shouldered his way past him close the door you idiot instead of gawping at me hastily meletios loukaris closed the back door which served as the delivery entrance for governor de belmondos palace that done the podestas secretary started hissing another protest but fianelli silenced him by the simple expedient of clamping a hand over his mouth fianelli was not a big man and fat besides but the secretary was smaller stilland slightlybuilt he had no chance of resisting fianelli with sheer muscle so be it in a former life in constantinople loukaris had carried out several assassinations despite his initial nervous reaction at seeing fianelli the secretary knew that he was alone in the rear portions of the palace he could kill fianelli then dispose of the body by but as his hand slid into his cloak and closed over the hilt of the special blade he kept hidden there he felt fianellis other hand clamping onto his wrist the criminal boss was stronger than he looked dont even think of trying to use that needle on me loukaris forget those silly byzantine political games im a lot tougher than youll ever be to emphasize the point fianelli hauled the secretarys hand out of the cloak and slammed his knuckles against the wall the little needleshaped stiletto clattered onto the tiles then for good measure fianelli pounded loukariss head against the wall also twice and hard enough to daze him when his senses clearedand to his surpriseloukaris saw that fianelli was extending the stiletto to him hilt first here take it back you might need it later fianelli gave him a piercing look we might need it were still in business loukaris the only thing thats changed is that youll be hiding me from now on loukaris took the stiletto he considered trying to kill fianelli with it for just an instant but discarded the idea as if it were a hot coal in his bare hand true meletios loukaris had killed before but his victims had all been aristocratic elderly men and one woman none of whom had fianellis criminal history and skills the secretary had no doubt at all that fianelli would overcome himand then shove the stiletto into his own throat quickly he slipped the stiletto back into its special pouch this is dangerous for me if anyone spots youthe alarms out all over the fortress fianelli was faster that he looked too his fat heavy hand cracked across loukariss cheek shut up youll hide me in your own chambers nobody ever goes in there except you do they the maid complained loukaris rubbing his cheek fianellis slap had been hard enough to really hurt the criminal boss grunted well figure something out a horrid thought came to the secretary what about your men i cant fianelli waved his hand dont worry about them itll just be me theyve made their own arrangements whatever they are he grunted not that i care if they get caught they have no idea where i am since i never told them about you he jerked a thumb forward now show me the way to your chambers by the time they got there moving carefully through the corridors of the palace loukaris had already figured out the solution she only comes in once a day always in the early afternoon sullenly he went over to a very large freestanding dresser and swung the doors open the dresser was full of clothes since the secretary to the governor fancied himself something of a dandy you can hide behind the cloaks and stuff theres room in the back and the lazy slattern never looks in here anyway good enough slowly fianellis eyes scanned the room by the end he had a crooked smile on his face youll have to share the bed unless you want to sleep on the divan no way im going to the secretary grimaced the bed wasnt really that big but hed already more or less resigned himself to the inevitable by the end of the evening his resignation had become complete fianelli forced him to watch the ritual he used to conjure up the image of their mutual master king emeric of hungary loukaris had never known that fianelli was a sorcerer in addition to everything else still in business like i said fianelli seemed very satisfied hed also forced loukaris to clean up the traces of the ritual i get the wall side of the bed you can have all of it loukaris almost gagged on the words it had only been chicken blood but he felt like he might vomit i think ill sleep on the divan smart man murmured fianelli the squat criminal boss gave the podestas secretary a look that combined menace and complacency and well he might to loukaris he looked like the king of the frog demonscontemplating a fly chapter the barbary corsairs and the genovese are uneasy allies grand duke said count mindaug theyre traditional enemies of course both sides hate the venetians like poison but still it is a fragile alliance alexius may be a weak reed but he is being a very effective stopper to the dardanelles and what news have you from the holy roman emperor mindaug it didnt surprise mindaug at all that jagiellon knew of his secret messenger from germany his communications with hungary were far more carefully orchestrated the emperor is worse he took the news that his nephew is trapped on corfu by emerics men as reason to find more energy to organize things but now he is sliding again his campaign against emeric is a measure of the man why it seems quite a small campaign it is meant to be the emperor knows he is dying he doesnt want his heir to take over with a huge war on his hands a conquest of hungary would be an immense war even for the empire this one is designed to cost emeric a great dealbut it will do so only if he doesnt react to it the emperor knows that emeric simply cannot leave such an incursion alone when it becomes clear what ignoring it will cost him frankly in my opinion because emeric believes himself the greatest commander alive he would be unable to ignore any challenge however insignificant that threatened what he holds the effort i should guess is to get him to withdraw from corfu to protect assets closer to home jagiellons black eyes stared into nothingness then he turned to mindaug again and have you progressed at all with your researches into the magic of corfu in one respect yes i have been investigating the works of one trigomenses commensus he has recorded various nonhuman interviews attempting by virtue of their long lives to piece together early history it appears that back when corfu was part of the mainland it was the center of a fertility cult long before the area was overrun by invadersperhaps the dorians the nonhumans he questioneddryads undines and satyrsregarded the place as sacred too it is an old place i know that it is an old place once regarded as being of great power i can feel no trace of any great power there now myself though yet my slave and the shaman are not succeeding in their quest there they are being magically hampered but i do not know by what or exactly how it is like wrestling smoke i need to find the source of this and know if it can be harnessed this began as an exercise in attempting to flank the holy roman empire it has become a search for whatever it is that can even thwart the magic of the shaman he is an adept of great strength i was coming to that grand duke commensus interviewees all agree power there requires a connection to the earth you mean i would have to physically go there at least in spirit my lord mindaug held his breath doing everything in his power to keep his mind blank this was the moment for which he and elizabeth bartholdy had schemed for so long yes grunted jagiellon it was all mindaug could do not to let his breath explode in a gust there had not been a trace of suspicion in the sound yes jagiellon i think youre right risky butworth it to shackle that power and bend it to my will its infuriating mistress snarled bianca casarini and i dont have any choicei have to hide fianellis men from the venetians even if its in my own house elizabeth laughed having three louts lounging about your house would try the patience of a saint which you are certainly not the countess cocked her head sideways i assume youve taken steps to bring them under control the last words served to ease some of casarinis foul temper oh yes one of thempapetis his namehas been lusting after me for some time so now he thinks hes succeededand the one whom i did seduce is furious about it the right two words from me and theyll cut each other up and the third bianca shrugged hes just a slug seems interested in nothing much beyond sleeping drinking and eating i havent bothered with him since i need to keep my magics to a minimum i have to be careful here mistress sharing a small island with eneko lopez and his damned priests they cant do much because theyre afraid to work without their wards but theyre still accomplished adepts especially lopez yes i understand well that should be enough my plans look to be coming to fruition for the moment just stay out of sight before shed even had time to finish erasing the traces of the ritual bianca heard a ruckus erupting in the rooms downstairs a brief one but very loud ending in a cutoff scream those idiots she hissed hurrying from her bedroom theyll make the neighbors curious when she reached the bottom of the stairs bianca saw that her two words wouldnt be necessary after all papetis body was lying on the floor bleeding all over the tiles saluzzo redfaced was crouched over the corpse cleaning his knife on papetis blouse he hadnt even heard bianca arrive the florentines eyes were fixed on zanari the third of fianellis thugs zanari was standing in a nearby archway with a very nervous look on his face shes my woman saluzzo growled dont forget it or angrily and despite having already cleaned the blade saluzzo drove the knife into papetis ribcage again the corpse jerked under the impact saluzzo spotted bianca then leaving the knife stuck in the body he rose and took two strides toward her paulo what saluzzo was a powerful man his slap sent her sprawling on the steps the next slap on the back of her head dazed her fortunately perhaps since the pain when he seized her by the hair and began dragging her up the stairs would have been considerably more agonizing otherwise bitch ill teach you by the time they reached her bedroom and saluzzo flung her onto the bed bianca had recovered her senses furiously she began muttering the words that would destroy the man saluzzo didnt even hear them he was so consumed with anger combined with lust before she finished the incantation though bianca had suppressed her anger the situation she realized was ideal for a different use of magic someday she might well have to flee her house in a hurrya task that would be made considerably easier if saluzzo remained behind to attack her pursuers with demonic fury that of course would require turning him into a demonthe shape of one at leastwhich could be done under the right circumstances these were the right circumstances rage and lust combined were the key raw ingredients ill teach you to fool around with anyone else saluzzo snarled hed already hoisted her skirts and forced her legs apart now he slapped her again and started untying his breeches paulo please another slap time for your lesson slut the period that followed was unpleasant even painful toward the end as biancas murmured incantations began effecting the first transformations of saluzzos form but bianca had been through worse in the past and would face still worse in the future immortality as the countess often remarked had its price many prices in fact fortunately saluzzo was raping her on the bedstill better on a bed in the upper floor of her house almost twenty feet above the soil of corfu had he been assaulting bianca on the ground itself her magics would have drained away the more so since the sort of transformation she was carrying out on him was closely connected to earth magic it was not quite the same as making a golem but close whats the matter eneko asked francesca leaning forward in her chair you look suddenly ill you cannot sense it the priests voice was brittle his temples held in both hands puzzled francesca shook her head sense what the magic that is a hideous spell being used the one who uses itits the female this time not fianelliis reckless beyond belief id never dare use a spell that powerful here on corfu without wardsnot that id ever use that spell anywaybecause he croaked surprised francesca realized it was the sound of strained laughter of course i imagine shes not concerned with the danger of attracting demons since shes one herself in all that matters magic was something francesca knew very little about so she focused on what to her was the key point youre sure its a woman not fianelli eneko raised his head slowly staring at her through eyes that were nothing much more than slits oh yes theres a succubusof sortsloose in this fortress francesca and shes even more dangerous than fianelli more powerful at least when it comes to magic francesca leaned back in the chair her lips pursed a woman could it be sophia tomaselli before lopez could respond francesca raised her hand yes eneko i know the fetish she placed in maria verriers house was a fake but perhaps that was just a subterfugea way to protect her from charges of practicing real witchcraft in case she ever got caught francesca chuckled throatily its the sort of thing id have thought up enekos smile was thin at a rough estimate francesca you are eighty times more intelligent than sophia tomaselli but it doesnt matter you forget that pierre went to see her in her cell after she was arrested the savoyards the best witchsmeller ive ever met he says quite firmly that while the tomaselli woman is evil enough in a multitude of small and petty ways shes got no more demonic power than a carrot francesca must have looked a bit dubious lopezs smile became still thinner please francesca i have learned not to secondguess you when it comes to intrigue and espionage please dont try to secondguess me when it comes to magic whoever the female is it is not sophia tomaselli francesca spread her fingers in a gesture that subtly indicated assent more precisely that she was beating a demure but hasty retreat i wouldnt dream of questioning you eneko the two of them laughed abruptly still francesca continued i think we should start with sophia tomaselli we should question morando again also of course but i doubt hed say anything if this mysterious woman female francescanot woman trust me the distinction if you understood it would be even more important to you than to me female then if this female is an accomplice of his at this point hed never tell us even that she exists much less her identity why he seems eager enough to tell us everything else because morando is expecting hell be executed when hes returned to venice a traitors death too his legs broken first for a moment she glared thanks to those idiot men that includes you eneko a lesson never tell a man youre going to execute him if theres any chance he might still have information you want you just eliminated any motive for him to keep talking eneko scowled he was guilty of who cares francesca slapped the armrests of her chair with exasperation why does a whore have to keep reminding priests and devout knights that justice belongs to the lord ours is the province of practicality damnation enekos lips quirked i believe its vengeance that belongs to the lord francesca though i understand the point nor by the way have i ever called you a whore she shrugged its just a word means nothing to me to be blunt and to get back to the point morando wont tell us anything because perhaps the only hope he has lefthowever faint it may beis that his accomplice if she remains at large might somehow rescue him from his predicament yes yes its a very faint hopecriminal associates are hardly noted for their personal loyalties and devotion but who knows there might be some deep tie between them and even if there isnt a man expecting a noose will hope for anything ah thats why you think tomaselli would know francesca shook her head we should question her also but i doubt well get anything useful the problem in her case being somewhat the opposite too much talk instead of too little that woman is driven by spite more than anything else at one point in her interrogation you may recall she named half the women in the fortress as being witches participating in regular black sabbaths she had maria verrier copulating with satan himself while the podestas wife she threw up her hands ah never mind but you see my point how reliable is the information given to us by a woman whod insist that renate de belmondoat her agewas well you remember you were there lopez grimaced hed been present for most of tomasellis interrogation sophia hysterically had swung from protesting complete innocence at one moment to claiming in the next that she was the least guilty of several thousand women in the citadel the accusations shed made regarding maria verrier and the podestas wife had been particularly grotesque i see your point but that being true what do you mean by suggesting we start with tomaselli we need to start tracing sophias associations not by asking her but others ill have mouse start working on that mouse was the nickname francesca had given to the best agent shed started employing since she arrived on corfu eneko had met the man three times but could never quite remember what he looked like afterward when hed commented to francesca to that effect shed simply looked very smug ill tell mouse to start with stella mavroukis marias friend francesca mused that woman knows all the gossip there is to know about this island kerkira and the citadel anyway what would you like me to do eneko would you be able to recallpreciselywhen each instance of this female magic took place slowly lopez nodded yes i think so diego sensed it tooand sometimes francis and pierreso we can compare our memories yes i should be able to reconstruct it what good will that do maybe none replied francesca shrugging but you never know this sort of work is like trying to piece together a broken tile the more pieces you have the more likely it is that you will succeed prince manfred came into the room at that point his cheerful smile vanished like the dew under francescas glare and you if i succeed in piecing this all togetheri will expect you to exercise your power and offer morando a pardon a commutation at least so that he can confirm whatever my suspicions are what are you talking about piece what together manfred yes darling certainly eneko laughed these are the times when i know celibacy is a blessing eneko sorry francesca its true his lust satiated saluzzos anger had faded also he sprawled across her limply paulo he forced me bianca said in a pleading tone he held a knife to my throat saluzzo grunted the sound was skeptical but bianca could sense there was no longer any danger that he would strike her again that was good she was having a hard enough time as it was restraining her fury the bastard was heavy her hands began stroking his back saluzzo would think she was still trying to placate him in actuality she was trying to determine if her incantations had succeeded yes she could feel the small nubs of the wings just under the shoulder blades theyd remain vestigial until she spoke the words of power doublechecking her left hand stroked his brow yes she could feel the slight nubs there also unfortunately her apparent caresses were stimulating saluzzo again his own hands began moving bianca resigned herself to another unpleasant few minutes there was no way in the circumstances to do the rituals needed to allow saluzzo to wallow in his own sexual fantasies so be it immortality had its prices at least he wouldnt be as rough this time although ow paulo you have got to start trimming your fingernails a bit puzzled he raised his head and glanced at his fingernails how did they get so long he wondered youre careless thats how she took the sting from the reproach by nuzzling him just keep them trimmed will you she decided it would be best not to comment on his toenails those would be getting shorter soon anyway shorter wider and much thicker as his feet began to change in fact shed have to take steps to slow down the transformation even a thugand this one was florentine after allwould start wondering why he was walking around on hooves part xii november ad chapter and how are you doing at fending off the pursuit of the young ladies of corfu young man asked the governors whitehaired wife as they talked in a break during the soiree that was corfu citadels attempt at maintaining a facade of normalcy in spite of the siege the attempts were pitiful looked at from one angle but after being under siege for half a year the defenders needed them benito decided he liked renate de belmondo even if hed rather have been having a glass of wine down with the arsenalotti oh im not trying too hard that was true enough he simply wasnt interested other than their physical charms the young ladies of corfu lacked salt if hed said the moon was green theyd have agreed with him it had amused benito at first to be considered a prize but it had come as a shock to realize that more than one of the delicately bred young damsels of corfus high society never previously in a mans company without a duenna would happily lift her skirts on the floor of her parlor for the mantle of his name his position with the doge and his reputation as hero as an actual person he was unimportant he could have been a hunchback or a pygmy able to speak in short grunts only it was his position that made him valuablegrandson of the old fox second son of valdosta friend to the doge brother to the young lion confidant of prince manfred political power a coin he held as debased to the point of worthlessness was the true gold to them then there were the real heroworshipers they were almost worse he was complaining about the lack of spice here only yesterday contessa said manfred grinning at benito she waved her fan well if its spice youre after i would think youd want to consort with the ladies of our little covey of degenerates and try one of their romanesque orgies except that they seem to be keeping a very low profile these days they used to be the glitter of these little affairs benito snorted i think i want a girl to chew me out not chew me up the contessa smiled the best kind those they probably remind you of your mother he shook his head you obviously didnt know my mother contessa before this conversation could go into details about his mother benito was glad to see von gherens bumping through the butterfly crowd like a steel bumblebee prince manfred he said without bothering to excuse himself for interrupting emerics doing an inspection of his troops it looks like hes planning something youd better come and have a look very well said manfred youll excuse me milady you coming benito asked von gherens there is someone i want you to see so benito went along tagging behind falkenberg who had been doing an uncomfortable job of bodyguarding he knew it was a putup job that manfred had organized to save himself from sitting through a second hour of a hard seat and bad music well benito didnt mind being out of there either as it happens emeric really is out and about said von gherens to benito and we really do want you to look at one of his companions we think we last saw him in venice well go down to the main gatehouse you get the best view from there the late autumn air was cool and dry and that dryness lent great clarity the enemy trenches and earthworks across on the spianada were so visible it was possible to see the rough mortaring between the stones von gherens looked to a knight staring across from the battlements are they still there klaus the knight nodded yes theyre just at that end of the rampart they should move across soon they waited and sure enough men moved from one earthwork to the next it was a pity that accuracy on the cannons was so imprecise and that the king and his generals were out of range of arquebusiers there the blond head stood out clearly against the dark background benito squinted if only it were closer he gritted his teeth it could be aldanto damn his soul to hell it could be klaus here is longsighted he saw him in venice during the troubles there he says it is him by the walk if erik was here id say wed have to stop him going out to look said manfred he glanced at benito no benito no im not doing anything useful here besides sitting with umberto and lessi no benito no repeated manfred firmly benito shrugged his shoulders ill see you later i want to go and look for something in among my gear so said emeric glaring at the citadel which after all these months still refused to fall weve lost four ships all at night all in the north and at last count his voice was rising dangerously over two hundred horses and more than seventy men he pointed an accusing finger at caesare you said youd catch hakkonsen you and that yellow dog of yours as far as i can work out the situation has simply gotten worse so my involuntary and sofaruseless ally where is he caesare looked at emeric with empty eyes we have a traitor at last we will have either him or his woman soon and given the kind of man he is we will have him if we take her emeric looked at him with narrowed eyes where did you find a traitor the peasants are terrified of the idea theyd rather die weve tried word has spread that the libri doro we captured are being reestablished on their lands ah that policy has played handsome dividends it is always easier to corrupt the leadership than the people and it achieves more if benito had remembered he had it in the early days after caesare turned out to be as false a hero as possible he would have burned it but it had stayed tucked away somewhere in his gear at the casa dorma he certainly wouldnt have brought it along to corfu but as hed been sitting in jail some anonymous servant had packed it along with just about anything he owned that was reasonably presentable so it had come into the governors palace in the citadel along with a corded bag of other clothes and bags of grain and spare weaponry and whatever else he could carry easily hed seen it while looking for spare stuff maria could cut up to make winter clothes for alessia the fabrics that the casa dorma had clad the younger valdosta ward in were the absolute finest finer than maria could dream of buying and damn her pride she wouldnt take money when hed found the silk scarf hed decided that he wouldnt give that to alessia some residual trace of aldanto might cling to it maria might just recognize it too she noticed clothes and if she wouldnt take money from benito she certainly would have nothing to do with caesare in any shape or form but benito remembered how luciano marina had used marias scarf to give them some idea whether she was alive or dead perhaps eneko lopez could do the same with the scarf in a pocket benito went in search of the basque priest he wasnt at the hypatian chapel in fact it took benito some time to track him down he spotted father francis first he was trying to be unobtrusive but definitely up to something benito didnt disturb him in whatever it was he walked on and ran into another of the tightknit group this time it was diego and around the third corner lopez father lopez you dont do this well said benito calmly as he walked past eneko lopez was a man of deep faith and great patience so he didnt swear at benito he did turn around and let his breath hiss between his teeth he gave benito a look that would have turned many a mans wavering footsteps back to the paths of righteousness valdosta this is difficultand were trying to be unobtrusive benito looked about calmly and pretended to catch sight of something on one of the rooftops he leaned back casually against the wall and stared at it while speaking very quietly out of the corner of his mouth well father eneko it looks like id better teach you how to do that its something bad men do well good men by the looks of it do it badly i was taught by one of the worst i think you all need lessons and id be glad to help eneko lopez sighed let me get the others benito we may as well go back to the chapel you may have a point and what were hunting is not just bad but evil to the core ill see you there back at the hypatian chapel benito explained if you look like you belong no one looks twice at you if you look like youre doing something perfectly ordinary for a reason anyone can figure out without even thinking about it no one is interested on the other hand if you skulk all in the same habits and look at a building furtively while muttering you stand out like a bunch of daisies in a coal scuttle at least one of you needs to move out of these clothes become a seller of something beads perhaps they all looked dubious he sighed lets work this out how long does thiswhatever it is that youre doingtake you francis answered immediately about three hundred heartbeats to detect sorcerers perhaps a little less in the case of the female one were after shes powerful and skilled but careless the nightsoil cart all four of them blinked at him in confusion what asked eneko after a moment can you explain that rather remarkable statement it trundles along all the streets stops people load their buckets and it trundles on easy to stop it in the right spot it stinks so no one stays near it longer than they have to its the perfect cover for anything one of you wants to do as for the other two of youone of you should get a shill and argue religion with him stop and argue at whatever point you need to stop the shill can argue loudly drawing as much attention to himself as possible you do your ritual while you just nod and frown and the third eneko asked ah the third one can stop and preach at passersby say something a little bizarre or preach about the end of the world coming soon then he can do a few moments in prayer hell look like any other religious lunatic and no one ever pays any notice of them it appears aldanto taught you well said eneko dryly yeah well he was using us for his work or he wouldnt have he was like that look thats what i wanted to talk to you about he pulled the scarf out of his pocket can you tell me if the owner of this is on the island eneko lopez looked at the scarf it is possible it requires the same spells we use to trace anything that was once the property of someone else why who does it belong to caesare aldanto his voice was flat lopez looked askance at benito i thought he had drowned young man hes been reliably reported as alive in fact i think i recognized him myself today at a distance he was also reported heading back to odessa i want to know if hes really here if he is here manfred francesca and eberhard will want to know for the implications that it will have on the situation odessa father francis looked at the piece of bright cloth it would explain the chernobog traces eneko perhaps he is an emissary i thought he was just an opportunist and a traitor said eneko slowly i thought wed dealt directly with all of the demons vessels why do you think hes here we think we saw him from the battlements hard to tell but the way he walked the posture the headcolor and the fact that he was seen in constantinople some months before all this blew up benito shrugged thats why im asking eneko took up the scarf this could be exceptionally dangerous were deprived of some of our usual protections still we know that we have come here to confront him let us try this thing taking courage in faith benito watched as they prepared the scarf was placed over a chalice of holy water the wards placed uriel too even if the archangel did not respond he would still be there then all of the priests placed a hand on the cloth benitos latin did not extend to much beyond deus so he didnt recognize anything they were chanting suddenly the scarf burst into flames not ordinary flames either these were greenish and altogether nastylooking the only sign of alarm was in the widening of their eyes the priests fell back a step and began chanting something different it sounded different too harsher and confrontational benito got the impression of swords being drawn though no weapon was in sight the water in the chalice vaporized with a violent hiss as the flame changed color this time to a dark glowing purple at this point a horrible scalpcrawling howl arose from the flame itself a howl that cut right through benitos head the chalice melted in part and the burning shred abruptly gathered itself into a ball then it started moving it bounced off the table and rolled rapidly out of the door stop it yelled eneko as soon as it was outside the flames gathered new life and the ball doubled in size in the blink of an eye without thinking simply obeying the priest benito did one of the most stupid things hed done in a lifetime of doing stupid things he stamped on it grinding it into the earth the saint arsenius medal on his chest grew hot briefly then benito stepped back from the ash fragments the dead ash fragments eneko grabbed him with one hand holding up a relic in the other let that which cannot abide the name of christ depart he commanded it has already gone eneko said diego he looked wonderingly at benito you are both a very crazy and a very lucky young man you just stood on a demonic emissary of chernobog it must have been weakened and limited by the holy place by the holy water and the blessed vessel said francis in a shaky voice benito examined the soles of his footwear and shrugged well my holy medal got hot but i cant say it even scorched my boots eneko held out a hand lets see this medal he said grimly benito took it out from next to his skin eneko examined it as did the others it is an old one and undoubtedly genuine said eneko thoughtfully how did you get a real saints relic benito he raised his eyebrows it was given to me by the hypatian monks in messina after i did them that little favor i dont think they realized what a valuable gift they gave you said diego or what a powerful one or how well it would serve the church said eneko exhaling a little sigh of relief forgive me benito stop it was meant for my comrades not for you benito shrugged he was quite certain that the hypatians of messina knew exactly what they had given him after all it was meant to reward someoneeven a thieffor returning some rather valuable property and just perhaps because you never knew with the hypatian magicians they might have gotten an inkling that he would be going into spiritual and magical danger it worked and im the one who got you to try this in the first place well you have your answer caesare aldanto is here indeed and he is possessed by the black brain chernobog the priest sighed this calls for more than we four can do this calls for the knights of the holy trinity perhaps true steel and faith can destroy this thing as magic cannot benito took a sideways glance at the man he appeared in earnest there were times when benito wondered whether the intense basque cleric was in the real world or not there is a siege out there eneko a whole army between aldanto and the knights if he is destroyed chernobog will be one factor removed from the siege lopez sounded earnestbut also resigned after all how was even a single knight going to slip out unnoticed benito shook his head i wouldnt mind doing it eneko but it is a question of how if it means going outside the wall then it must be done said lopez fine you tell manfred to let me go hes already forbidden me to try i havent said i am going to listen though he paused you know there is one knight out there already erik hakkonsen and if he knew aldanto was alive and worse a minion of chernobog he let that percolate into lopezs mind still you have to talk manfred into letting me go over the wall or i cant tell him eneko sighed i will if in that brief encounter i divined it right then he is seeking something in countryside erik could perhaps deal with him ideally i should like to be there while this is a perilous foelike all slaves it would lack most of the strength of chernobog it would still be very dangerous certain relics could limit it that medal of yours for instance benito looked down and to think i nearly didnt tie it to my belt when i was disguising myself as a slave it is a sailors talisman it might just be what kept you afloat said francis mindaug noticed that the grand duke was distinctly short of breath and that his jowls beneath the mask were almost gray he hardly seemed to hear the news that the venetian atlantic fleet had been forced to retreat from the pillars of hercules he wondered what had just happened but knew that he would never learn jagiellon would never ever tell a subordinate about anything that had given him so much as a moment of weakness manfred rubbed his chin getting out there well eneko you have a spyno two you saywith some ability at black magic to catch who is more important and can your companions do it without you eneko lopez pursed his lips and thought a while chernobog is a great threat on the other hand the cunning of these magicians whoever they areis almost worse i suppose this fight is against emeric and his minions first and we need four for the cardinal points but but me no buts man of god said manfred firmly ill have klaus on watch if we get a chance again like today where we can maybe get emeric and aldanto well sally speed and steel we can get away with it at the moment the captaingeneral isnt playing the role he was since his wife got herself into trouble being a fugitive hampered fianellis movements thought emeric studying again the latest reports his agent had sent through but the man was capable and had found a safe hideout so it was time to destabilize the military structure of the enemy from within fianelli had mercenaries still on his payroll the commander must die and so should this benito valdosta hed become an icon in the citadel a symbol well hed be a dead symbol proving how long emerics arm was chapter only a flicker of movement in the window saved benito he rolled just in time the crossbow bolt was buried to the flightfeathers in the bed benito stared at the bolt felt his neck looked at the broken glass got up and went over to the mirror his neck had a fine cut from the touch of the barb a crossbow was slow to reload by the time the bastard in that tree reloaded benito was going to be shoving his rapier right up the place the wouldbe assassin deserved it but by the time he got there there was no one in the tree no one anywhere around in fact there might just as well never have been anyone there at all except for that crossbow bolt in the pillow ten minutes later benito crossbow bolt in hand was in manfred and francescas chamber manfred i worked with him for years this he held up the bolt stinks of something caesare would organize if he didnt do it himself he cant fly so this must be something a hireling did but ill bet it was at his orders he and his master know we found them now theyre out to kill me personally well i wont sit still while they do it and i dont care what you say about it you could be right said francesca indirectly at least it would have been fianelli who gave the actual order though not caesare hes still somewhere in the citadel and his three goons have evaded capture also she turned to manfred my dear you are going back to living in a koboldwerk shirt now that they seem to be turning to crude assassination youre a target too manfred rubbed his jaw thoughtfully look benito i understand what youre getting at but but this fortress is fluefull of conspirators spies and traitors i dont know who or what to trustsweet jesu man what can i do if i cant even be safe in my own bed manfred winced benito kept going while he had momentum aside from anything else out there they seem to have sorted out the treachery problem im safer running with erik than i am here besides if we get the chance i want aldantos head he knew what his voice sounded like and he moderated it before manfred decreed he was too emotionally involved to go safely look it might not be aldanto but all the signs point that way and i agree with eneko get rid of this assassin this agent of chernobogwhoever or whatever he isand well get rid of half the menace will you let me finish asked manfred irritably what i was trying to say is the story of your exploits getting in and out of this place is now common property you can bet your last penny that emeric has had a full report you can bet youre being watched you can also bet that emeric has done his damnedest to make sure you dont use those ways again weve seen the beach patrols the smallcraft screen its a lot harder the chance of you making it into the slave encampment never mind out again has vanished benito shrugged ill have to think of something else then what i was going to suggest is that we do this the oldfashioned way von gherens and i were just saying we are letting the enemy have too much leisure to do what they feel like those causeways are basically both repaired were going to lose what advantage the water gives us when they are able to attack in large numbers at will we thought we might use one of these misty mornings weve been having to damage their little causeway and make emeric concentrate on defending his siege camp more from this side as well as eriks side manfred grinned so what do you say young fellow get you on a good horse and have a little gallop i wont promise to take you to the other edge of emerics camp but in the chaos mist and few nice little fires well dress you up as a croat horseman and you should get yourself to the far side and out easily enough itll beat this swimming or sailing eh benito groaned it sounded like a good plan to me said manfred a little defensively given the mist and the fact that there hasnt been a sally except in response to an attack they wont be expecting it von gherens was just saying their entrenchments on the spianada are too central emeric wanted the space to marshal his cavalry no doubt but itll work in our favor its the horse part i was groaning about i fall off the damn things manfred chuckled there had to be something you werent much good at i cant dance and marco says i cant cook either francesca gave a little snort of laughter but a little bird told me you can change diapers she said mischievously manfred stared incredulously at benito and then burst into laughter maria listened to benito in silence her expression grew more severe as he talked then she stood in silence looking at him for a while finally she said i dont suppose anything i say will stop you no i just stopped by to say goodbye and to see alessia and umberto i had to stop and see my favorite baby maria shook her head have you ever even touched another one she sighed wait here i want you to take something with you she came back a few minutes later with a wheellock pistol kat gave it to me you take it with you and promise me this if you get close to caesare blow his guts out before he gets too close remember hell mislead you with his talk dont give him a chance and dont miss clinging to the saddle benito cursed all horses there had to be a better way to travel fast overland had to be chariots or cutting canals everywhere or anything trained giant serpents such as there were reputed to be in faroff africa or dragons as in faroff qin or flying carpets anything but an idiot animal that went up and down in order to go forward true the gallop hadnt been as bad as hed expected true too a grinning ritter had had to haul him back upright when hed started that slide down the side of the horse during the charge butlike the raid on the hungarian campit had been pretty successful the hungarians were totally unprepared for those inside the citadel to take the offensive the men had settled into the humdrum of siege cannon fire every now and again daytime arquebus fire to slow down any signs of repair work on the walls otherwise sit around sleep if you could play dice eat keep a weather eye behind for an officer the assault would come when they had to go in and face enemy fire but for now the worst you had to fear was a work party or being part of the outer perimeter guards and patrols that was dangerous this was just military routine sleep while you could even in the front trenches a good two thirds had been in dreamland the night workers on the causeway were already pulled back the seamist was blowing and swirling it would burn off in an hour or two having given the cracked dry earth no relief the mist swallowed sound quite well the knights scouts had advanced cautiously on foot with their trumpets in hand seventy or so yards back the knights a hundred of them had come forward at a walk theyd been able to get right onto the causewayand the scouts off the far sidebefore the trumpet had called them to charge yes it had all gone well benito hoped the retreat had gone just as well he hadnt stayed around to find out instead hed discovered the two drawbacks to manfreds plan the one was that he was still very close to the hungarian camp and it was now full daylight and the horse was a lot more in control than he was the other drawback was trotting now all he had to do was find erik without the two downsides killing him he decided the best thing for it was to abandon the horse he must be at least a couple of miles from the camp now a shot boomed from a nearby hillside benito abandoned the horse by falling off into the dry broom up the hill he saw two corfiotes scrambling for cover lying there trying to catch his breath benito decided that the croats headgear had to be the next to go before he was killed by own side falkenberg came running in leopoldos been shot a crossbow again manfreds chair fell over as he sprang to his feet damn we should have expected this he started heading for the door von gherens blocked his way not without plate armor and that koboldwerk mail shirt and francesca hes to stay away from all windows until we find this crossbow man leopoldo may live benito was lucky next time we may not be so lucky francesca nodded and steered the prince back to a chair its left a power vacuum manfred the captaingeneral hasnt been near his office for two weeks hes just abandoned things commander leopoldo has been running the defense of the citadel since then and much better run it has been manfred said grimly you say hes not dead well not yet hes being taken to the hospital is he conscious he was a short time ago cursing ferociously in fact go there von gherens get him to appoint a successor if hes compos to do so one of his junior officers will fill the post on seniority otherwise and that may be a poor idea right now von gherens came back a little later the opium seems to be making him think clearly he said with a wry smile hes just nominated falkenberg to fill his shoes but falkenberg isnt part of the venetian forces protested francesca the captaingeneral is bound to kick up a fuss eberhard of brunswick cleared his throat you could second him to the service of commander leopoldo prince that would be completely legal the oneeyed falkenberg grunted if this means i have to take orders from tomaselli forget it eberhard smiled well technically youd be taking orders from leopoldo as you would have to be seconded directly to his service and leopoldo would be taking orders from tomaselli we could persuade him to be too ill to pass them on of course this does presuppose leopoldo staying alive if he dies it is another matter you really could have trusted me with the sword benito said erik i would have given it back to you i think benito blinked svanhild was definitely giving erik a sense of humor which was strange as benito didnt think she had had much of one to share perhaps it was just that the icelander was so much happier i needed it erik otherwise id have trusted you truly but there is someone i have to deliver the sharp end of it to and who would that be a mutual friend who had a crossbow bolt delivered to my pillow a couple of days back a blond fellow with excellent classical features that the girls all admired at least they used to im not sure what he looks like after all hes been through eriks head shot forward like a snapping turtle aldanto hes here benito nodded and he hasnt changed except for the worse either hes joined up with another old friend that youve met before with your old tomahawk the look in eriks eyes was something that gave benito a shiver i want him but benito was not about to back down this time youll have to stand in line erik ive got a claim on behalf of my mother my brothers wifes family and maria not to mention myself and this time i intend to get him if i fail hes yours erik looked speculatively at benito he doesnt play by the rules you know i know so should we play tag with him asked erik with a foxlike look ill find out where he is our network of informers is unbelievable especially since your jailbreak he grinned at benito your status on this island is at a level thatll never survive the reality chapter the middleaged man looked about nervously youre sure we cant be seen or overheard caesare aldanto shook his head the dog would have detected anyone ambrosino he can smell out the smallest trace of life over as much as two hundred yards and we simply cannot be seen through the solid walls of the olivepress you are satisfied with what you have heard from count quatrades giuliano lozzas uncle nodded yes i was surprised to tell the truth the emptyeyed blond shrugged why king emeric wants an income off the lands he conquers hell need vassals who understand local conditions local peasantry and how to get the most out of them ambrosinos eyes were wary i would have thought he would have given the land to his own nobles signor aldanto there is enough and as you have seen count quatrades is well treated if aldanto sounded indifferent it was for a good reason he was and protected ambrosino asked sharply the peasantry have become violent if there is one thing these peasants should never have been allowed it is encouragement to rebel to take up arms the venetians have planted and nurtured a seed in this war that will be impossible to put back into the seedpod ive said as much but they dont want to listen to me the magyar captain who had accompanied aldanto laughed coarsely king emeric has a way of dealing with that there are always more peasants nonetheless i want that estate in the ropa valley but i also want a fulltime guard of least twenty men stationed there and five thousand ducats he raised his chin clearly he was not going to be bargained down aldanto nodded we have brought the gold the bags are behind you on that pressshelf greed overrode the mans nervousness he looked into a number of the bags eagerly spilling gold pieces we have had engineers from the army repairing the villa on the estate said aldanto smoothly you could go there now if you can tell us where to find hakkonsen or the girl ambrosino snorted with contempt youd need a lot of men to take hakkonsen in that spot its got three ways out and he has good lookouts hakkonsen is planning a raid on trembolino in two nights you could ambush him and why is he going to attack trembolino asked the magyar captain suspiciously thats where we are based i believe said the middleaged man slyly that they wish to kill a certain blond man a man they call caesare aldanto the empty eyes gazed at the corfiote aristocrat why it appears that they want to repay some old scores with you milord he said picking up every loose ducat and carefully putting them back where he had gotten them that is an aspect i had not considered said aldanto are you privy to the detail of hakkonsens plans the man closed up the bags no im not part of this raid my nephew giuliano is i could have asked him but i thought it best not to excite comment weve had a bit of a falling out milord if you could try and spare him he and i have argued about the way things are being done but he is still my sisters son of course families do have their differences but blood is still thicker than water aldanto spoke with the ease of one who does not care what he promises would you be able to guide say five of my men in while the bulk of hakkonsens troops are trying to find me we could be waiting for them when they return with all the advantage of surprise the man coughed politely five men you would need fifty milord the five will do to open the path we will have a hundred men out of our camp without it appearing too deserted signor ambrosino a hundred men in blackened cuirasses whats left will give them a fight while we do our business svanhild clung to him couldnt someone else go erik i worry so about you my precious man erik hugged her i worry about you elskling but i am going with that young rascal he has the luck of the devil so it should be fine she kissed him but frowned just a little i do not approve of benito he is not enough respectable for you ja and altogether too wild erik patted her soothingly never mind love when all this is over my time of service to the godar hohenstauffen will be near an end and we can go home and never see him again he reminds me of manfred a few years back in many ways and you dont disapprove of him do you oh no but he is a prince she said kissing him the kiss turned into a longer kiss outside the cavewhich the vinlanders had made unrecognizably comfortable and erik still felt terribly guilty about having to have svan live insomeone cleared his throat time to go sir erik recognized the apologetic voice lozza he had to smile to himself giuliano lozza fat and unfit undisciplined and obsessed with revenge then he was now lean athletic and tough as whipleather also now eriks chief arms instructor what a difference six months could make the curious thing was that lozza hated to kill he was erik admitted better with a rapier than erik would ever be his father possibly the greatest master of bravura style had started training him when he barely breeched giuliano used the weapon like other men used their fingers he had the reflexes and he had the strength he just didnt like to kill erik was terribly afraid that such a weakness would kill him one day it was why he always paired giuliano with thalia for one thing giuliano would kill anyone who came near her he was as protective as a mother hen about the peasant girl and thalia with her new netcarefully blessedand the knifeskills giuliano instilled into her did not hesitate ever a strange relationship erik had never seen either so much as touch each other she still called him master lozza he kissed svan for a last time and parted from her take care she called after him do my best they rode through the darkness benito as usual clinging to his horse and swearing horses even the most docilenatured like the one theyd mounted him on seemed to know benito was not a rider and that he was afraid of horses they sensed his nervousness and that made them skittish which made benito worse doesnt it seem odd benito that caesare aldanto is out here instead of with the main army damn this animal said benito in his mildest comment so far hes probably out here up to no good erik someone to be murdered or spied on or stolen from and who do you think that could be my young friend asked erik dryly you or me at a guess probably you of course he probably doesnt know who hes hunting erik cantered a few more yards in silence ill grant him this he was very good with a sword and hes not afraid to use it good with a sword he was indeed benito acknowledged grimly and if i get a chance erik i wont give him an opportunity to use it hes a master of dirty fighting and one of the things he taught me was to never try to be fair in a fight kill your opponent before he kills you he ground his teeth angrily i intend to return the favor of that lesson caesare aldanto might have been far more successful at seizing control of the canals of venice had he been able then to select men as he did now but he had perceptions of their natures and ability now that he didnt have then the men hed brought along for this expedition were killers the most effective he could cull from an army hed principally stuck with cavalry since moving fast would be of the essence the other four accompanying ambrosino into the defile should all have been hanged long ago in a proper army with the discipline to take halfmad killers out of their ranks and dispose of them they would have been these four would not only cheerfully perform atrocities on the defeated and the peasantry of the defeated theyd perform them on their own comrades if they got the chance they reached the first sentries ambrosino called the password whos that with you asked the sentry new recruits good men all we can use ahh and they moved on the yellow dog pressed against his flank they talked as minions of the same master did without audible words the shaman sniffed the netwoman she has been here curse her name ill deal with her or the troops will erik looked at the fires at the sentries not quite lazy enough in the darkness and peered through the gloom at the horse paddocks something prickled his awareness he looked at the horsepaddocks again it was like ice water running down his spine theres something wrong here thats half the number of horses reported benito looked caesare he took erik by the sleeve mount up now lets get out of here this smells of aldanto and ambush erik nodded tomorrow is another day weve got him tagged now the countrypeople will tell us where he goes well choose the time not him svan will be pleased to have us home unbloody somewhere in the distance a horn sounded it didnt mean anything to them and it was a good distance away the vinlanders are in the cave to the south there ambrosino pointed the others use the caves lower down the very bottom cave is waterfilled its their water supply and something to be very careful of the valley over there is where the horses are kept its another way out they can also go over the back there but only on foot guards on both of course hakkonsen leaves nothing to chance except you aldanto turned sylarovich bring the cavalry up to that point tell them that any man that even so much as allows a harness to clink is dead you saw the exits split three units of twenty off the troop when i sound the horn they must ride as fast as possible for each exit kill any guards and seal them off from escapees the other forty are to take the caves especially the top one and tell them about the lower cave we should have at least an hour to clean this lot out before the rest come back from the camp very pleased with themselves we should surprise them nicely full dark and eriks nerves were on edge they rode into the narrow gully that erik had designated sole entry to the camp erik at the head of the file paused waiting for the request for the password silence and then distantly a scream arquebus and pistol shots ride yelled erik ride all of you get out of here but he himself was spurring his horse frantically riding into the defile kari and his brother took off after him as if their tails were on fire benito turned to the rest you heard him youalexander take some of the boys to the top way out and gino the other half of you to the valley way alexander hesitated and his horse curveted and danced sideways we need to follow our captain benito aimed a blow at him you need to obey his orders now move alpha group will go with me giuliano said calmly omega takes the bottom way and theta you will ride around to see if survivors need help if there is nobody there dismount and set up an ambush lower the horsebarriers they will not ride out of here these were the groups used in raids they were each twenty strong they were used to working together and each had its section leaders perhaps it was that or giulianos calm that did it the troop split fast as soon as they were on their way benito began kicking the horse to get it to follow erik and not the other horses his will triumphed to his surprise maybe the animal thought it was going to pasture down in the valley bottom the stream had stopped flowing but thanks to the watercave they had water there and some grazing donkey loads of stolen hungarian oats had added to that thalia georgio stephanos gigi marco you will take the inner guard post stop any of them escaping and buy time for us if we need it to get out said giuliano lozza taking charge mikalos will go instead of me said thalia that calls for shooting i cant shoot dont argue or what master she said calmly please thalia giuliano wasnt quite begging no chapter svanhild had gone down to the horses restless with a bright moon overhead they were upset about something she loved horses and especially the steeds of the magyar which were superb shed talked with erik about taking some home to the great plains beyond cahokia apparently the magyar steeds were bought from the ilkhan and crossed with an old warhorse breed shed certainly never seen their like she walked among them in the moonlight murmuring a bit of praise here patting a neck or a flank there then she heard the thunder of galloping hooves erik must be back so early something must have gone wrong she gathered her skirts in order to run back toward the cave a group of cavalry thundered past her heading for horsepaddocks shed just come from she ran for the cave and her brothers she could see bjarni already out sword in hand running toward her yelling and beckoning the main body of caesares cavalry had waited until the two blocking groups were past caesare mounted his horse the yellow dog had gone ahead scrambling up a steep limestone edge claws scrabbling for a hold on the rock it would attempt to deal with the guard on the upper footpath the shaman basically had to get out of the way horses tried to trample the shaman if they smelled or saw him the iron horseshoes were painful lead bullets the creature found harmless but cold iron he liked not at all now caesare pushed forward and saw in the moonlight how things hadnt waited to begin going wrong those idiots going down to valley floor had broken open the horsecorrals and ridden straight past his target horses panicky and confused were running back toward the camp he could see her blond hair streaming running in the moonlight shed never get to the men pouring out of the cave as they began to charge into the little valley caesare saw her turn and look back and stop even amid all the other noise he heard the whistle she gave the twist of horses that the rush of cavalry had released stopped too and as a group they began galloping toward her they had less than half the distance to cover that caesare did and they had no riders to weigh them down caesare knew that this one would have no trouble riding bareback shed get away he called for the shaman the shaman was closer sliding and scrabbling half falling the yellow dog came down the slope from nearly straight above her he would end virtually at her feet as in dust and flurry and snapping teeth the yellow dog cascaded toward her caesare saw that the horse herd was nearly at the woman and then he realized what hed done go leave her stay away but the steepness of the slope meant that for all the pale creatures snarling and scrabbling the shamandog still ended up actually hitting svanhild it half knocked her over the lead stallion reared chernobog looking through his slaves eyes didnt understand horror in human terms but he felt the slaves horror nonetheless when he saw the blond woman and the yellow dog fall beneath the flailing hooves the horror of failure the horror of knowing what his master would do to him when the woman died which with ironshod hooves pounding her as they tried to reach the yellow cur was an inevitability the yellow dog yowling with pain exploded out of the side of the horsemass straight toward caesare the magyar cavalrys horses felt just the same way about the yellow dog as the corfiote guerillas horses horses and humans had been together a long long time there was a deep bond between them only the true dogs hate the betrayer more more than half of the main body of the cavalry charge including caesare were unseated as the hungarian horses tried to kill the yellow dog erik arrived at a scene of pandemonium it was apparent that caesares raid had run into more resistance than hed expected part of the problem was horses there were riderless horses at least forty milling in the narrow valley standing in the middle of the slope were three vinlanders they were defending something against a considerable force defending it well by the rampart of bodies as erik galloped toward them one vinlander fell screaming like a banshee erik struck the flank of the attackers he was vaguely aware of kari and his brother beside him there were a good fifteen or so magyars attacking the remaining vinlanders but the sudden furious attack drove them off just as the second to the last vinlander collapsed only big bjarni remained standing and it was plain that it was only sheer force of will that kept him up erik he croaked his breath bubbling svan take her home erik was already kneeling beside the crumpled form on the ground his heart swelling until he thought it would choke him he took her up tears pouring down his face as he felt her bones grating against one another felt the pulpy flesh moving in ways it never should gently he called her holding her svan svan she stirred in his arms the horse hooves had left her body bruised and broken the skull halfshattered her long blond hair was soaked with blood looking black in the moonlight erik it was barely a whisper you came love you stay with me he could not see for tears ill never leave you svan never when benito and the others burst on the scene kari and his brother were desperately defending erik who was holding someone svanhild benito guessed seeing the long hair in the moonlight erik seemed oblivious of his own impending death then just as the impetuous kari fell erik put his burden down stood up picking up a sword from the ground as he did so even from here benito heard his scream it was both heartbreak and pure rage and with bjarnis great sword in his handsa weapon so long it had had to be slung across the vinlanders backerik went berserk benito had heard of berserkers before now he realized that the magnitude of the truth defied the stories in berserker rage erik literally split a horses head hewed two more attackers apart from downslope benito heard caesare yell we want him alive stupider things have been said but not often benito didnt care he was too busy fighting his way down the hill toward caesare the thing that was aldantos puppet master saw through the puppets eyes how one man could turn a battle and that far from being trappers his troops were now surrounded by men who knew the terrain by men who were determined on vengeance too and in the middle of his hungarians was a man seemingly possessed of superhuman strength unstoppable who was cutting down seasoned warriors like a scythe through cornstalks somehow this man had turned the situation from one where they outnumbered their surprised foes into a developing rout he heard someone yell just keep out of his way he cant tell friend from foe the only trouble with this advice was that the newly arriving corfiote irregulars were herding men toward their berserker and fearand the stupidity that it bringswas killing them fast it was time to intervene the slave still had considerable skills one of them being with the sword and if need be chernobog could draw on reserves of strength that might kill the slave later then there was someone in his way between him and his target someone who had once been a nobleman by the ragged finery and the dark wavy hair not showing the rough crop of the peasantry he was clean shaven too which in itself was unusual among these spiky rebels the slave had many duel assassinations to his credit this fool would be one more chernobog allowed the reflexes of the slave to take over and came within an eighth of an inch of losing the slaves life an accident surely the slaves one real attribute had been that he was a truly great swordsman chernobog seconds later realized that it was no accident the swordsman had looked like hed be another provincial aristocratfull of delusions about his swordsmanship and short on real skill or practice a quick kill a soft man despite being lean and sunbrowned chernobog could see it in the eyes does eyes he could see it in the face the fine lines there were those of someone more accustomed to a lazy smile than to anger the slave caesare was a lion to such men except this time the prey was a lot better with a rapier than caesare aldanto ever had been or could have been the swordsmans movements seemed almost effortless fluid yet the blade moved faster than chernobogs slave physically could caesare was driven back forced back down the hill toward the opening of the lowest cave the watercave fencing with one who could kill him in a heartbeat it also took the black brain very few of the slaves heartbeats to realize something else the masterswordsman didnt want to kill so he lowered the sword point took the blade itself in his left hand and held the hilt out to the man i surrender he called out as the masterswordsman stepped forward to take the sword caesare stabbed him with the stiletto shaken from his sleeve it struck something hard and skittered cuttingbut not as intended piercing the heart as he did this ambrosino the traitor shouted and rushed to him and grabbed at him you promised you wouldnt kill him caesare hit the traitor with the butt and pulled back the stiletto to stab again something hit him so hard he sprawled yards away the stiletto gone hed been hit by the lead weights of the birdnet that the yellow dog had so dreaded the woman threw herself over the fallen swordsman protecting him with her body caesare staggered to his feet snatching up the rapier he had pretended to surrender from where it had fallen conveniently near at hand she was now trying to pick the swordsman up so be it two for the price of one then a voice like doom behind him aldanto caesare turned slowly and realized it was erik hakkonsen hakkonsen was at that final stage of berserk when sanity returnsjust before the berserker collapses hakkonsen was bleeding from a dozen wounds and swaying with exhaustion he was also intent on killing caesare even if it meant dying himself hakkonsen had he been in the peak of physical shape would have been very evenly matched to the old aldanto now his muscles were quivering with fatigue and yet a will a spirit harder than adamantine made erik hakkonsen drive caesare back back toward the watercave one quick double twistdisengage riposte twist and eriks sword fell clattered to the rocks die caesare lunged forward somehow erik managed to move so that the sword passed between his arm and ribs he trapped the blade holding caesares sleeve the tomahawk came up the part of caesare that was elsewhere used powers that could only be released in fleshy contact a coup de grace of spirit world only hampered by this place magical force huge amounts of it flowed through from chernobog to the slave and then into the icelander coruscating rivers of power that should have burned and shattered the victim should have but did not instead it seemed to flow through him and into the earth of corfu nonetheless hakkonsen fell back as if flung by some great force he lay sprawled on the ground like a puppet with severed strings the dry grass he lay on smoked theres still me caesare the tiny part of caesare that remained caesare saw benito valdosta an older broader but not taller person yet a very different boy from the one who had once idolized him benito had plainly hurt his one arm as it was tucked inside his shirt see this sword caesare aldanto its my fathers carlo sforza the wolf of the north hed eat five of you for breakfast im going to cut your head off with it the boyman stalked closer you think youre a great swordsman aldanto whats wrong with your arm benito cut the tendons back there the fingers arent working but thats all right because i only need one hand to fence with you if i hadnt cut it id tie it behind my back sheer bravado caesare was sure benito had always been prone to that mistake he had the mental edge on the boy the boy was close now barely three yards off and walking in fool benito stopped just about within reach of a lunge i thought i told you not to brag when you fought unless you had a reason said caesare you did benito smiled mockingly but i didnt always listen you also said this business of saluting your enemy before you fence with them was an opportunity to kill someone while theyre sticking to fencing etiquette but ive got a salute to give you from maria benito raised his sword as caesare began to lunge something slammed into his chest with the force of a mule kick driving him down his rapier went flying dazed caesare looked up to see benito drawing a wheellock pistol from the shirt where hed hidden itholding it in his supposedly maimed hand the boy had fired right through the fabric some part of caesare felt an odd little pleasure then realizing how much hed taught the boy in happier days its marias grunted benito holding the pistol up smoke was still drifting from the barrel it seemed a nice touch to me you swine the cave was just behind the puppet chernobog realized the puppets vision began to blur it was dying but if he could lure the boy close enough benito stepped in hefting the sword chernobogs power built and fled hastily from the mind and soul of the slave the sword itself was blessed and there was something about the boy himselfsome strange virtue that would not allow the magic to even touch him benito wished he could just turn away but caesare had always taught him finish it be sure and then the dying man spoke the voice sounded ecstatically joyful benito thank god kill me kill me please kill me before it can get to me again please please if you ever loved me suddenly something huge black and slimy with a barbelfringed longfanged mouth launched out of the water benito barely managed to dodge aside cutting at it caesare didnt dodge and it seized him the water closed over the monster and the blond assassin there might be a battle going on but benito sat down there wasnt much of a battle left anyway caesare had been lying with his i surrender but the hungarians had been similarly fooled unfortunately for them it had been a case of no quarter after caesares treacherous aboutturn chapter some time laterprobably somewhere near midnight benito guessed by the height of the moonthey were taking stock erik lay wrapped in a blanket beside svanhild his wounds were bandaged and the stump of one finger cauterized he lay as still as death his breathing weak bloody and bubbling his pulse which could only really be felt in his throat tremulous and faint the physical wounds even the one to the lung he might survive the greatest physical danger was that he had nearly bled himself white but everyone knew it was that final magical blow that left him in the coma from which benito doubted he would ever wake he looked dead svanhild was it had seemed right to put them beside each other the cost to the insurgent camp had been high all but one of the guards had been killed of the fifteen men and three women left in the campbesides the vinlandersone survived of the vinlandersonly bjarni and kari and two of the duniwassals might yet live the youngest of karis brothers had been one of those whod been in camp as part of svanhilds guard there were some dead and some injured among the raiding party too but by comparison theyd suffered lightly eriks berserker attack had cost the hungarians dear in sheer numbers and in panictrapping them between a human threshing machine and guarded exits the vinlanders had cost the enemy at least thirty men it would take daylight and a collection of body parts to say just how many erik had killed in his frenzy of the hundred magyar whod galloped into this place not one had escaped some thirteen were wounded some would die a number had retreated into the store cave they were still holed up there the corfiote irregulars were collecting firewood while they watched the cave mouth and there were three prisoners two who had surrendered to the guard on the upper way out and ambrosino giuliano lozza had bandages around his chest but hed very much taken charge of the camp and now he came to his uncle i always looked up to you trusted you uncle said giuliano quietly but my eleni didnt and neither did thalia they both tried to warn me in their ways and both of them saved my life from the results of your treachery he took a golden locketa large oneperhaps three inches by two there was a gouge through the goldplate revealing the harder metal underneath the locket was so indented that it would never open again one day ill have her picture repainted it was all i had left of her theres a piece of my baby sons hair in there too you babbled on about family about blood ties about how important it is to support your own no matter what and then you betrayed us to the people who killed your kin i asked them to spare you i tried to save you and you killed our comrades and now i am your judge jury and executioner i find you guilty guilty by all the gold in your pockets gold was worth more to you than blood more than honor i find you guilty of treason of murder do you want to make your peace with god before i carry out the sentence ambrosino looked disdainful youll never kill me you havent got the guts you dont even kill rabbits on the hunt youll get someone else to do your dirty work ill do it said thalia ambrosino gave her a look that was full of more contempt than if he had spat on her peasant slut giuliano put a hand on thalias shoulder it is a pity in a way that i am going to execute you otherwise i would challenge you to a duel and cut you into doll rags for insulting a good woman and you know i could do it but i am going to execute you as the ranking officer of this unit of the venetian corfiote army i am giving you a last chance to pray this time ambrosino spat giuliano lozza drew his sword and ran him through ambrosinos mouth gaped wide widened you did it you bastard you he coughed blood his eyes rolled up giuliano withdrew the blade and turned away from the dying man may god have mercy on his soul throw his body with the other carrion his voice was hard our own we will bury with honor this lot we will dump outside their camp there are the wounded and the ones in the cave said benito what are we going to do with them kill the lot of them said one of the peasantrecruits cut the throats of the wounded and the prisoners best way of dealing with vermin what do we want asked benito calmly a few more dead hungarians or a lot of frightened ones if you ask me scared ones will make them weaker than a few more dead bodies they sent their best with a traitor to ambush us they were outnumbered by a smaller group of men i dont see them telling their commanding officers that though by the time they get back there will be thousands of us in the hills i reckon we offer them a choice they can live stripped bareass naked or they can die and well strip their bodies strip them benito grinned nastily they all wear those stupid helmets and that sash over their cuirasses i suppose we can be grateful this wasnt a fullarmor missiontheyd have been harder to killand i dont think armor is easy for people whove never worn it i need a group of men in those clothes i want anyone who sees us to take us for magyar and if we do that once is there any reason for the hungarians to assume we wont do it again fairly good chance well get some of them to shoot at each other and theyll never be sure that patrol they see over in the distance is it really their men over there giuliano nodded it makes every kind of sense well make them nervous about everything therell be accidents tell me about it said benito i nearly got shot by our supporters for wearing a croat hat giuliano sighed well we must get to it get those uniforms get out of here we need to get this camp broken and moved before dawn my traitor uncle might have told them how to find this place as well as just showing them and they might come looking moving our wounded is going to be difficult he sighed again most of them are going to die im afraid we lack medicines or surgeons and quite a few like erik cant ride we cant abandon him he is our leader and hes a symbol of some fear to emeric or he wouldnt have sent this aldanto hunting benito shook his head giuliano erik is not ever going to get better neither are a good three of the others in their case for simple medical reasons but erik my brother is the physician and i wish he was here now but im sure that what is wrong with erik is magical there is only one person that i know of on this island who could treat that eneko lopez or his companion francis and theyre inside the citadel erik meant a lot to you men out here didnt he giuliano nodded he is a legend more now i suppose the peasants refer to him as the iceandfire man or the hand of god right i want to break into the citadelagain im beginning to feel like a ball tossed between inside and outside ill need at least fifteen maybe twenty volunteers who are prepared to do something insane to keep erik and the other badly wounded alive signor valdosta you always do the insane said thalia who had come up quietly behind them i will volunteer i owe you and erik my life i was not sure if i was grateful at the time but i have decided i am glad to be alive after all i wish youd call me benito everyone else does she insists on calling me master said giuliano no matter how often i have said that were comradesinarms now and of course yes i am with you too i owe him my sanity my life and it was my bloodkin that betrayed him the bad news is that i wont take either of you youve got to take over here giuliano recruit to replace what weve lost and you thalia youve got keep him tough hes too nice for this but he is also too valuable to waste hes a good man i know she said quietly you and erik saved my life but he gave me back myself my dignity im an olivegrower said giuliano irritably not a saint or a soldier youre also the best man for the job and as doge dorma was silly enough to invest me as a captain in the army of the republic i hereby give you a fieldbrevet to lieutenant id do more but as a captain i am limited to promoting you to below me and i wish the two of you would stop wasting time and get a priest to marry you as i dont think either of you will settle for anything less there was an uncomfortable silence thalia looked down and wrung her hands it is too soon master lozza will mourn his wife and child i will mourn my man someday he will marry someone from his own order giuliano looked benito in the eyes ill thank you to keep to your own business benito thalia and i both lost precious people benito shrugged you both also nearly died tonight and im not blind or stupid this is a war you could both still be killed while you fuss on about not hurting the other ones feelings i dont think either of you didnt love your spouses i just think youre hurting each other now as for this difference in rank worry about it if youre still alive at the end of the war giuliano put a hand gently onto thalias arm i dont wish to hurt you thalia you were hurt enough you are hurting me now she said with a sniff you all the other men in the camp they make suggestions passes you just taught me to fight they mock you too they are scared to do so in the open because of your swordsmanship master if i married you would you stop calling me master she gave a watery sniff you dont want to do that actually in among the ten thousand other things eriks injury has forced on us i want to do that most but i dont want to hurt you more than youve been hurt i dont expect much would you two hug kiss and get on with it grumbled benito ive got a crazy plan to go through with and i need to find a wagon and something to hide the wounded in and ive got some bodies and prisoners to strip and some blacking to clean off the breastplates is that an order sir asked giuliano putting his hands on her shoulders yes and you too newly promoted sergeant it is about time we had a few female sergeants theyre naturally good at telling men what to do yes sir said giuliano putting his arms around her she folded into them as naturally as breathing youre good at managing peoples lives benito yes i wish id been as good at managing my own now do you think anyone in that crowd speaks hungarian chapter late the next afternoon a wagon escorted by a mounted patrol of magyar joined a number of other wagons heading into the camp eriks raids had forced emerics troops to dig earthworks and station guards but a wagon with a magyar driver and a military escort excited no comment it didnt even get stopped benito reflected that erik had missed some wonderful opportunities benito put his earlier time within the citadel to good use hed stood on the inner battlements making sure hed get through the ruins of the town and the maze of tentareas belonging to the different units of emerics army eberhard of brunswick had stood up there with him while he watched and had explained the interactions between the various tribes and nationalities in emerics kingdom to the old statesman those were potential danger areas of misunderstanding to be avoided to benito they were something to be used the magyar the elite of the army emerics pets werent very popular according to eberhard if you had to choose for least love lost between two groups the levies from southern carpathia detested the magyars most the slovenes came a close second and in the watching of detachments moving to and fro to the front benito knew where these two groups were encamped they were on the southern end of the spianada behind a halfscreen of buildings that the officers of both sets used for slightly more comfortable quartersjust out of cannonshot there was an open patch that both sets of troops used as a parade ground benito took his set of magyar there with the wagon and parked it on the edge of the parade ground his men dismounted some played dice some just lounged against the wagon it was covered with a tightly tieddown tarpaulin benito hoped the poor devils inside werent roasting as the afternoon sun blazed down nobody came over and talked to them except for one slovene officer benito didnt understand a word however he could offer a pretty good guess stephanos with his few words of hungarian was posing as the group officer stephanos snapped one wordorderswith as much arrogance as he could muster and jerked his thumb at the ornate pavilion on the hill benito thought he could have done a better job but then he had to give stephanos credit for looking the part the man had been a taverna owner at the start of the war in younger days however he had spent some years in rugosa as a clerk working for a venetian buyerwho couldnt operate there and had needed a trusted man stephanos was a positive graybeard to benito but he had the posture and attitudes of someone who is used to being respected stephanoss hungarian unlike his illyrian was limited and certainly wouldnt fool a magyar trooper for an instant but it worked fine on the slovene benito got to drive the wagon with nico nobody seeing benito ride would have believed him to be a magyar cavalryman just after dark they set out for the northern causeway it meant crossing the entire frontbut the croats were on that side they had two fluent croatspeakers from istria whom benito had recruited from captain di negris venetian volunteers one of the wounded from inside the covered wagon groaned shut him up whispered benito hoarsely they were approaching the two earthwork and masonry fortresses that had been constructed to deal with any sally by the looks of it a lot of work had gone into these since benito had left they stopped the wagon just short of one of the forts the two croat speakers dismounted benito held the wheellock pistol between his legs if things didnt work now it would mean theyd failed to fool the guards then it would be whether they retreated and tried to leave the hungarian base in the morningbecause thered be no leaving nowor decided to rush the causeway forts having looked at the causeway and the improved forts benito knew that one in ten of them might make it halfway before the venetians started shooting the two returned and said something in stephanoss drilledin hungarian the twenty fake magyar dismounted grumbling suitably looking hangdog a number of grinning croats had turned out to take the horses and watch the magyars discomfort the magyar and the croats had a healthy respect for each other that didnt mean they didnt enjoy seeing the other lot suffer really suffer proud magyar having to do manual laboroff their precious horseswhich had to be left with the croats fleabitten nags was a sight to be enjoyed mocking cheers and jeers followed them struggling to haul the heavy wagon by hand along the causeway dragorvichs engineers had built a snaking set of ramparts along it and the farm wagon had to be backed and hauled around these several of the engineers and a group of sappers actually gave them a hand tch what a degradation for the creme de la creme it served them right for being stupid enough to be caught drunk on duty they were lucky the punishment was so slight if it had been the king whod caught them they wouldnt just have to take a load of gunpowder casks to the front for count dragorvich the sappers might have wondered why they hadnt been told about this latest plan but in an armyespecially emericsnobody ever told common soldiers anything since manfreds sally a forward post had been added to the defenses by the looks of it the venetians had been pounding them the wagon would certainly go no further the officer from the forward post emerged and snapped something caustic probably what the hell are you doing here you idiots get that damn wagon out of here the poor fellow wasnt expecting a blow to the head with a knife pommel the corfiotes and venetians moved fast into the forward post now there was no time for subterfuge just violence benito and the eight cutters didnt wait to see how it went in there he flung off the magyar helmet and tore the sash off and joined in cutting the cords that held the cover flipping it over so the carefully chalked inner lining of the canvas sprang onto its bannersupport poles benito just had to hope shots being fired in that forward post would be taken as normal around here in the meantime he had a stretcher to carry erik and the other three couldnt run themselves they started running forward benito just hoped the shooting would only start in earnest after the wagon got to burning the wagon was neatly jammed across the causeway supporting a banner of the winged lion of saint mark shots rang out from the walls theyd been seen san marco yelled benito with what breath he could spare the other runners were shouting too he looked left back at the causeway the wagon was burning merrily the chalked outline of the lion of saint mark reflected back golden they were almost at the corner tower and then round it now the hungarian forces were firing too press against the wall san marco san marco a rescue who in the hell is down there bellowed someone from the wall valdosta wounded men help valdosta san marco help us weve got wounded men the north postern spilled light benito saw pikemen come hurryingbut wary and with their pikes ready valdosta yelled someone from their ranks here benito waved a hand help us its all right boys its him its the madman benito recognized the voice of large alberto umbertos arsenalotti friend the citadels pikemen surged forward grabbing them grabbing stretchers shouting valdosta cheering even laughing benito didnt feel like laughing only eighteen of his band of heroes were here to enjoy the cheering jagiellon prepared his favorite dish for the shaman there were properties about it that would help to heal the shapechanger even if the skin was only that of a palace servant in the meanwhile the shaman huddled in a corner in his featherandbellhung spirit cloak he sat there shivering making the bells tinkle and flickering his fingers across the surface of the tattooed quodbadrum the noisewhich reverberated outside the mere physical planewas an irritation but jagiellon ignored it he had no choice if he wanted to retain the services of this very powerful shaman the shaman was enacting a kind of selfhealing and painstilling he was despite his formidable skills still a primitive man or something near that anyway right now jagiellon could have killed him effortlessly the shaman was in too much agony to care but jagiellon needed to send him back whatever it was about corfu that hampered his own magics was powerful intensely so jagiellon could not afford to let it fall into emerics hands he knew that emeric was a catspaw for someone whose interest in mere geographical possessions was limited the sorceress across the carpathians soon therefore the shaman must go back the power of corfu would be centered on a specific place the shaman must be the first into that place the slave was useless now his wounding had been physical and dire and jagiellon was not sure if he was going to bother to repair him chapter so i was thinking said marco maybe i could try to contact benito sister evangelina shook her head even our most powerful mages cannot contact eneko lopez corfu seems to have become an island in a magical sense also besides eneko lopez advised you not to try scrying out of the confines of the venetian lagoon did he not brother mascoli smiled gently according to my researches corfu has always been a magical island marco looked stubborn look the danger with my scrying was that the focus of my vision was too wide that evil can enter and attack me i can defend myself now ive been practicing as you know with kat whom i know and love i can narrow that down eneko didnt say never he said only in a case of dire need i think there is now need mascoli nodded and blood connections are always stronger there is a magical resonance between them but still marco even if you could narrow your search and only reach benito and protect yourself corfu cannot be reached i grant there is need said evangelina but is it dire i believe so said marco quietly i believe benito needs me is there anything that can be done for him god willing yes eneko lopez scowled although here on corfu but we will do our best manfred let one of his meaty hands rest on eriks foreheada surprisingly gentle gesture for so big and powerful a man i owe you a debt i cant ever repay benito may god forgive me for letting him go or i should have gone with him he shook his head what a mess benito i always thought other people died in combat since this siege started im beginning to realize that other people can be your closest friends if eneko succeeds then hes going to need close friends manfred shes dead caesares men or at least their horses killed her i didnt know erik like you did but before this happened he was very much in love hetheywere about as happy as a couple can be when he got there she was dying already he went berserker he killed half the hungarians himself then caesare nearly killed him with this magical blow and what happened to caesare aldanto i swear this world isnt big enough for both of us to live in it was said with a calm assurance that was no less terrifying for its calmness all the more so coming from a prince of the holy roman empire i shot him i think hes dead some monstrous eel thing took him down into the water chernobogs minion exclaimed brother francis the hagfish manfred put a big arm around benito you shot him well done are you sure you hit him certain i wasnt more than three yards off i shot him in the gut liver and spine would have been hit too how did you get so close melee i did what he taught me distracted him convinced him i was going to fence with him and then i shot him when he thought i was dead meat well done repeated manfred he never taught you anything better in his life now you look exhausted he managed a grin these jackinthebox visits to the citadel are all very well but theyre not good for you go and rest ill sit with erik ill just go to see maria bout caesare youre swaying on your feet shell have the news by now or i know nothing about women and ill send von gherens down to tell her youre fine but that youre in bed your own alone asleep benito chuckled not that she cares but i suppose it will keep benito slept a full twenty hours he hadnt realized just how exhausted he was now up washedin salt water as fresh water in the citadel was under severe rationingand dressed he carefully checked unloaded and reloaded marias wheellock pistol then he set off to see her its the bad penny again umberto said maria and it is good to see him if we had ten bad pennies like this youngster emeric wouldnt have a siege umberto waved to a chair have you come to see my daughter again he asked with an attempt at a stern look i tell you i want a respectable scuolo husband for her benito not someone everyone calls the madman where is she mrs grisini and her maid have taken her out for a walk the old lady is a little crazy too ive sat with her a few times when anastasia has been sick she sees things but shes harmless and she adores lessi i dont normally let her alone with her but anastasia is very good with both of them and wheres the goat there was an awkward pause we sold her we just couldnt find enough food for her any more i couldnt bear to kill her myself she was a blackhearted menace but she was twice the guard that a dog would have been have you heard that sophia tomaselli escaped the guards claim it was witchcraft maria sighed i suspect it was simply money theyve searched all over even searched the captaingenerals apartments at his invitation anyway lets talk about something else is it just as dry out there just about you can still find water underground or in the bigger rivers but even the olives are suffering benito took out the wheellock pistol here im returning it with thanks it did exactly what it was supposed to do i think hes dead and if that woman is around she might get vindictive you might need it careful its loaded and primed she took the pistol you killed caesare yes i think so anyway maria nodded seeing her husbands frown she shook her head good riddance i say im sorry umberto im just being honest caesare aldanto was an evil man he did terrible harm to me and benito and marco and lots of other good venetians best that he is dead hed only go on doing it to other people umberto nodded i agree with you on this one my dear you told me how he deceived our garavelli cousins but he was supposed to be a great swordsman and a fighter how did you he smiled apologetically at maria itll be a story to tell the other scuolo masters young benito here is one of the favorite sources of stories i must tell you benito it has done my prestige and popularity no end of good with all the wild journeymen and apprentices that i am valdostas friend maria snorted that lot are as bad as he was umberto smiled they are the ones who really believe in my fireboats the masters mostly say the authorities will never use them that they will say we wasted the materials he sighed they would work it is my dream to see that they get the chance to work well tell us about this caesare i had marias pistol in my hand inside my shirt i pretended the hand was injured i boasted a lot about fencing about the sword and then when were close he lunged benito lunged himself demonstrating the glass in the small window shattered a black crossbow bolt sailed through the space benito had just vacated and hit umberto squarely in the chest maria still had the pistol in her hand she turned and as you might point a finger fired by the time the guards arrived umberto was dead in his wifes arms his hand was still holding benitos there was a blood trail outside from next to the low wall where the killer had hidden they found him said benito quietly he was hiding down in the ruined houses near the kerkira side of the outer wall your shot shattered his right hand and hit him in the gut hell die its amazing he got that far theyve been questioning him hard as they reckon his time is short maria held alessia and rocked her who was he why did he kill my husband her voice was hard bitter his name is zanari a mercenary from apulia whos been working for fianelli benito looked down and bit his lip he shot umberto by accident his orders were to shoot me only i moved imitating caesare that bolt was meant for me im sorry maria im really sorry all i ever seem to bring you is sadness her eyes were luminous with tears no benito i still believe this is that womans hatred im learning that here on corfu magic goes further than the chants and words and symbols that eneko believes in she closed her eyes briefly im scared for alessia nito benito patted her awkwardly well do what we can maria francesca is hunting she always finds eventually he cleared his throat we um ive been down to the little arsenal talking to the scuolo and the workers they want to arrange the funeral your husband was a muchrespected man maria maria stood there tears now pouring from her eyes slowly as if her head was too heavy to move she nodded he wasnt like you bravura just solid good not clever but wise he used every little bit of intelligence he had and used it likelike the artisan he was and he was kind so kind you would never believe how kind i wish he could have seen his fireboats used he put so much into that project benito squeezed her shoulder he was a damn fine man i started out intending to hate his guts only well i couldnt maria nodded again his fussing used to drive me mad at first i wasnt used to being a good little scuolo wife she gave out a halfsob i guess im not any more well there is a pension and i know you wont take money from me but for alessia she shook her head firmly no benito anyway right now what we need is foodand all the money in christendom cant buy much in the citadel right now thanks to old grisini alessia and i have a place to stay it was a kindness that has repaid itself already i suppose alessia squirmed and grumbled in marias arms is something wrong asked benito anxiously maria shook her head according to stellawho should knowshes starting with teething pains alessia gave a niggly bellow maria rocked her to try and soothe can i hel both benito and alessia cut off their vocal output on the instant and both of them seemed to be staring right through maria then benito shook himself like a wet dog weh what an experience he took a deep breath marco and kat send their love and their condolences maria what ive just had a magical communication with my brother he said absently he lookednot dazed exactly but certainly deeply preoccupied obsessed even there was of a sudden a strange look in his eyes a fire that was nothing like that crazy look he used to get whenever he was about to go off on some wild excursion a magical communication from his brother but she began benito how he shook his head violently look maria i must go i need to see manfred and eneko straight away ill be back later to see if there is anything you need ill come and babysit for a while maybe if you need to go out there was a furious knock at the door it was a panting alberto maria come down to the workshops quickly theres a fight between the illyrians and the corfiotes again me they listen to you maria theyre used to it oh jesu maria if you dont come someone is going to get knifed she swore a sailors oath halfway between anger and weeping oh gods teethill come go on benito benito went but he was privately certain that maria would be spending a fair amount of her time at the little arsenal even if umberto was dead and that would be no bad thing she would need something to keep her mind off her grief for a while and maybe that would keep her from blaming him for umbertos murder chapter rome must hear of this said mascoli excitedly evangelina shrugged the requirement is a powerful magician with a nonhuman demideity in support who has a blood relation on corfu i dont think it will help eneko much marco blinked you know the strangest thing was that i was talking not just to benito but to someone else as well a sort of person human i think so although its thoughts seemed somehow formless it was sore hurting just an annoying ache i soothed it eneko lopez stared intently at benito a blood bond and with such a one as marco valdosta powerful indeed yeah and the news was pretty powerful too even if none of it was good the atlantic fleet still being held outside the pillars the fire in the arsenal the heavy snows in bohemia so the imperial forces have made poor headway into slovenia and hungary to say nothing of the church failing to prevail on either the magical defenses or the earthly authorities of aragon and genoa lopez shook his head we never did have much influence with barbary anyway what i wanted to say wasif crisis struckor if we found out something could i contact him eneko shrugged magical ability tends to run in families the valdostagiven their long association with the lionare known for it and with the working of metals so are the delleste sforza well not that i know of but we could try with us supporting you it might be dangerous because of the warding problem we could try if the need was great signor valdosta said alberto diffidently it would mean a great deal to all of the scuolo from the little arsenal if youd say a few words at the funeral we well umberto derived a great deal of pride and pleasure from having his family associated with the casa valdosta it would be a mark of respect benito found the last part of that statement compelling he found the rest of it an alarming burden i dont think ive ever met a man i came to respect more than umberto verrier he said quietly and ive met all sorts from priests to princes but well me alberto the honor of the casa valdosta belongs with my older brother he got all the honor and i got all the wildness alberto shrugged everybody expects a young case vecchie to run amok he said tolerantly but what counts with us is that when the real trouble came you were there weve heard from one of the venetian sailors who fought their way back with you how you worked in the arsenal he took benitos hand turned it over looked at the calluses and smiled thats not the hand of an idle nobleman signor we scuolo were guildsmen we respect a man who labors we respect the fact that youve been first in the fight for us and we like it that you can work and drink just like us were proud that the casa valdosta chose to be the friend of one of the scuolo it would be a good thing for his widow too it will do no harm that some people see the mantle of the valdosta is there to protect her benito raised his eyes to heaven its a pretty thin mantle and dont say that to maria she doesnt believe she needs any protecting tell you what alberto ill ask her im sure shell agree benito was certain she wouldnt he was wrong maria nodded when he said that theyd asked him to do a eulogy it would have meant a lot to him nito he really liked you he was very proud of you you know she sniffed he even asked me to be nicer to you benito found his reply had got stuck behind the lump in his throat but he nodded the little hypatian chapel was full to the wallbulging point the little arsenals scuolo the corfiotes the illyrians men women and children today there was no fighting among them today theyd come to pay their last respects to commit to god and the earth one of their own to show to his widow whom theyd come to respect and love too how much theyd valued her man sibling eleni conducted the service giving comfort with the old words the air was full of incense it was getting in his eyes after the homily benito had to stand up and speak facing the court had been easier he swallowed umberto verrier when i was asked give this eulogy i struggled to get the words i wanted to say about this man so i came here last night its not a place i come to often enough my head stayed empty i knew what i wanted to say about umberto but not how to say it and my eyes wandered to the icons then i saw a face that had something in it that reminded me of umberto i saw the same look as i have often seen on the face of the man i was proud to call my friend in the face of the holy saint peter the face of man that you know is as solid and reliable as the rock beneath your feet when i first met umberto we hauled baulks of timber together at the gate where our ships landed it took me very little time to realize that here was a man who spoke not with his mouth but with his hands and that those hands knew exactly what they were doing umberto wasnt a great talker he was a man who did instead and like the rock he was a man you could rely on and trust because he was what he was as good and solid as a rock benito had struggled to start speaking now the words came easily painting a deep and full picture of umberto of the treasure that this husband had been to maria benito had not realized what effect the quiet small scuolo master craftsman had had on him he was always just there when maria was solid you almost didnt notice him until he wasnt there if benito felt like this now how then was maria bearing it the pallbearers were all scuolo alberto had been polite but firm in his refusal of benitos offer you can speak for him but we carry our own they laid him in the grave and gave him into the embrace of the earth and the world seemed a poorer place full of dust and ashes maria stood whitefaced and weeping at the graveside workroughened hands touched her awkwardly gently hands trying to say what the scuolo the corfiotes the women and illyrians could find no words for benito did it himself words were too inadequate she turned to him thank you she said quietly you said the right things about him i wish that bolt had hit me instead he said im worth less than he was maria if you need anything or need help with lessi ill be there she nodded he was not too sure what she was agreeing with erik opened his eyes at the end of what seemed like a long long tunnel of grayness he looked up into manfreds face are you dead as well did i fail you too the voice was a dry cracked whisper no youre alive thanks to that mad scamp benito i must talk to uncle about a barony for the boy at the very least maybe on the border of aquitaine itll do him and the aquitaines good erik blinked where am i in the hospital in the citadel then the despair washed over him shes dead manfred shes dead i promised i would never leave her i must go to her a firm hand pushed him down onto the bed shes dead youre alive and youre going to stay that way because you are my hearthman i need you here i order it manfred knew the icelander was still on the border between life and death and the direction he took now was very uncertain but he had never seen erik cry tears welled up in those gray eyes drowning them then erik swallowed tightened his jaw and said in a quiet voice very well duty remains manfred he paused to every life there comes a season of happiness i have had mine the baby wailed and maria tucked sweatdamp strands of hair behind her ears then bounced alessia in an attempt to soothe her she might as well have tried to stop the tide she got no more result than when shed tried to feed the poor mite a moment ago maria felt her own irritation building to an irrational anger and did her best to control it i know youre teething child she told the youngest member of the verrier family wearily and i know your poor mouth is hurting but youve been so good up to now cant you suffer in silence she heard a familiar step at the door it was benito i tried knocking but the competition was drowning it out he said with a smile i was down at the little arsenal and albertos wife was there she told me alessias teething and giving you a hard time maria nodded tiredly im nearly at my wits end with it benito produced a jar from his pocket i came here via the monks at the hospital brother selmi said this might help what is it benito grinned i dont even look like marco maria its no use asking me i told him what it was for i told him how old she was and i told him that if it did her any harm id feed him his own cassock he seemed a bit taken aback that id offer a man of the cloth violence maria raised her eyes to heaven youre impossible benito well he seemed to think his cassock was safe lets try it anyway its in a honey base and it has cloves in it but that is all i know he opened alessias mouth and rubbed a fingerful onto the sore gums i wish i had ice for her but the nearest is over in illyria which you are not to fetch he was quite capable of deciding to do that benito chuckled only if this doesnt work which it seems to be he held out his arms albertos wife said youve been trying to quiet her half the night ill be glad to take her for a bit until she falls asleep which probably wont be long i bet shes tired herself out to nothing with all that crying shes tired me out if nothing else maria admitted letting benito take the baby from her arms itll pass according to the brother at the hospital the truth to tell i think he was glad of a teething baby problem that he could help with rather than malnutrition and siege wounds he cant maria watched as benito moved with a sort of slow catlike walk that alessia always seemed to find comforting she was still amazed at how good he was with the child and how frequent and constant hed been about visiting lessi he seemed to have no problems about the fact that she maria was using him as a mere babysitter his arrival usually signaled her departure he wasnt just coming to see her the truth was she was uncomfortable about her feelings for benito umbertos death was still recent and raw shed been troubled about it when umberto was alive now she was careful to keep her distance but he was very good with lessi seeming to derive a deep satisfaction from looking after her shed never have thought it of him although there was a tender side to the younger valdosta he just tried not to ever let it show perhaps it was having to survive on the canals after his mother had been killed hed been very young she sighed he still seemed completely oblivious to the fact that alessia could easily be his child probably was in fact had no one ever explained to him about how long a pregnancy was or had he just deliberately excluded the idea shes out poor lamb said benito quietly shall i put her down in her crib maria nodded part xiii december ad chapter benito the panting arsenalotti porter yelled youd better get yourself back to maria verrier youre needed there somebodys kidnapped her baby who he snapped the chill grip of fear on his throat who took her the corfiote porter shook his head dont know nobody knows some says its more witchcraft some reckon it is something to do with a hungarian spy some blame the captaingenerals wife its every rumor you can think of going through the citadel like a fire no ransom note no clues no nothing but theres guards and that eneko lopez looking benito felt stark horror eneko lopez and the satanists he was sniffing for and a missing baby it added up to things he didnt like to think about when he got there out of breath he found a crowd of arsenalotti an officer of the citadel guard eneko and francesca too the baby vanished some time between when you left signora verrier and about half an hour ago eneko said curtly raising his voice a little to be heard over the crowd of arsenalotti you dont remember seeing anyone hanging around the outside when you left do you benito shook his head whoever took her didnt leave a note and hasnt tried to contact us said the guard officer unfortunately that doesnt rule anyone out they must have been around watching said benito numbly if they took her that soon after i left the guard officer nodded we just dont know where to start milord have you asked anastasia seeing the officers blank look benito explained the girl who looks after old mrs grisini in the upper floors of the house maria shook her head shes up at the hospital benito just lack of food i think i found her passed out on the stairs the day before yesterday the old lady was still pottering around and hadnt even noticed the old lady is also up there at the hospital she has arthritic pains and it turns out shes been taking poppyjuice tablets to help her with it maria made a face it appears shes been taking too many of them washing them down with grappa on the quiet well that leaves her out mused benito id wondered shes always been potty about alessia about babies in general said maria she lost her own from her first husband poor woman i cant blame her entirely for her tablets and grappa shes had a miserable life benito shrugged well my sympathies but i want to find alessia im just glad to have her excluded because id worry about what she might do to a child she always seemed as mad as bedlam to me maria pursed her lips she made some bad decisions that first marriage of hers poor short but happy then she married grisini it was childless andon her side anywaymore for sustenance than affection the childlessness obsessed her a bit but shed never have hurt a baby it cant be her anyway she was being looked after up at the hospital the last i saw if we knew roughly where alessia had been taken to wed have a pretty easy time finding her benito said shes going to wake up in a strange place with her gums hurting and shes going to start right in screaming well set the arsenalotti kids to listening for a baby where there shouldnt be one if we knew roughly where she was francesca pondered that for a moment while benito turned away from the window and slumped down into another chair so whod want a baby especially one thats likely to give them away benito thought about that for a moment if i were some kind of agent or someone wanting a baby for a ritual the last thing id pick to kidnap would be a teething baby francesca persisted you cant reason with it and you cant shut it up without hurting it you cant even shut it up by hurting it so what if this isnt a kidnapping as maria thinks it is who else would want a baby who would want a babyexcept a mother he looked up to see maria nodding thoughtfully somebody who lost a baby already and maybe cant have any more francesca pursed her lips and sat up a little straighter and youve got a little chinadoll right here about as pretty as anybodyd ever want all right that makes sense but who remember benito we are probably looking for someone who isnt entirely well balanced but its also probably someone too careful to give herself away by disappearing with it lord only knows why they took the baby benito felt a finger of ice trace the line of his spine you dontyou dont think theyd hurt her do you not if it was someone looking for a baby to care for theyd try to look after her which leaves harming her by accident his heart sank again saints if the baby starts fussing again wakes up and starts crying it was around dusk when the young corfiote boy came panting in down near the southern wall theres a building thats been pretty well wrecked in the shelling milord no one living down there but i heard a baby benito got to his feet lets go maria struggled to keep up emerics bombardment had turned from being largely focused on the front wall to working on the morale of the besieged by shelling the buildings inside the wall the result was that the forequarter of the city inside the southern curtain wall was largely uninhabitable with many damaged buildings it was to this part that the boy led them into a small square it was here i heard it milord at precisely that moment a baby cried a fierce howl of pain and frustrated anger benito knew that it had come from directly overhead he knew that cry knew that babyvoice it was his baby his little girl anger hed been carrying around inside since the abduction exploded into a white rage he went up through the skeletal remains of the building without a thought to fragile masonry but at the third floor level he was confronted by a piece of staircase that was plainly newly fallen this stopped maria but it didnt stop him not for an instant he climbed across on tiny stubs of masonry willing them to be big enough to hold him he gained the landing get someone with some planks he called back to maria he pushed open the door at the top the room here was virtually intact and leaning over the cradle at the far side of the room was a woman theyd supposed safe in the hospital mrs grisinis hair was awry gray straggling locks hanging about her face her eyes looking up from alessia and into his were unfocused the pupils wide she saw him and screamed in competition with alessia its all right said benito trying for an air of reassurance she looked mad enough to do anything and alessia was right within her grasp he walked slowly forward making no hasty movements she screamed again and snatched the infant from the cradle holding it so tightly against her that the baby howled in protest at this mishandling benito froze where he was she edged away from him step by step until her back was against the outer door that had once led to another room before benito could stop her she kicked the door open and dashed out onto what was left of the structure torches and lanterns lit her eerily from below she looked like one of the condemned souls in the holy book get away she cried her eyes wild waving her free hand at him get away from me benito walked toward her through the broken masonry then out into the room one slow step at a time i wont hurt you signora he said as quietly and calmly as he could and still be heard over the babys screams ive just come for my little girl his heart pounded painfully in his chest and his throat was too tight to swallow as she backed up another step a cool reasoning corner of his mind was calculating footing the length of his own lunge the amount of safe wood still behind her the rest of him wanted to shriek and grab for his baby now you cant have her the woman said shaking her head violently shes mine not yours she was meant for me i saw it in the dreams what dreams signora benito asked edging another foot closer the wood creaked dangerously underfoot and the whole building swayed again he made a drastic revision of his safety margins the dreams the holy dreams the woman babbled clutching her hand in her hair while the baby subsided to a frightened whimper as if she somehow sensed the danger she was in shes mine she was meant for me he was almost within reach suddenly she looked over his shoulder as light poured from the door behind him and her eyes widened still further benito maria called there was a murmur of shocked and frightened voices and someone stifled a cry of despair stay back he warned sharply as the woman took another two steps backward onto wood that moaned under her weight signora he said urgently recapturing her attention signora the dreams what about them what did they tell you she transferred her attention from whoever was behind him back to his face you dont care about the dreams she said accusingly you just want my the wood gave benito made a desperate lunge as the woman shrieked and teetered on the brink of the gulf one arm flailing wildly the other still clutching the baby he reached hershe fell just as his hands brushed the cloth he grabbed for it and held as he was falling himself a blow to his chest knocked breath and sense from him but he had a handful of fine linen fabric and he held onto it past all pain and sense the universe spun then came to rest again he was dangling facedown over the street three floors down to the cobblestones with one hand and both legs he held on to the timberstrut that had saved him the other hand was clutched in the linen dress of the little girlbaby who was likewise dangling head down over the empty darkness howling at the top of her lungs he edged back until his chest was supported by the timber then drew her up only when she was safely cradled against his chest did he breathe again and held her carefully like the precious thing she was murmuring her name over and over hardly daring to believe he had her back safe he might even have burst into tears of his own at that point but suddenly the others were on him hauling him to safety praising him to the skies arsenalotti arsenalotti wives everywhere pounding his back touching his sleeve crying over the baby maria her face as white as fine porcelain held alessia and stared down at her fierce tears in her eyes no one seemed to be thinking about old mrs grisini benito tilted his head to look down and then wincing looked away the torchlight showed enough the crazed old womans body was a broken ruin in the crowd below bianca casarini turned and began walking away she was disgruntled a bit at the failure of the schemebut not excessively so it had been fianellis idea in the first place not hers emerics servant was now desperate to do anything that might placate his master given that all the other attempts at treason and sabotage had failed no matter how petty the attempt might be under pressure bianca had agreed to inflict the dreams on the old woman she hadnt wanted to herself because she could sense the net thrown by eneko lopez and francesca de chevreuse closing steadily around her but countess bartholdy had insisted i cant afford to have emeric get suspicious this close to success which he will if fianelli reports that you are suddenly balking so do as fianelli wants bianca yes mistress well shed made the attemptand the attempt had failed now the net would be closing more tightly still it was time for bianca casarini to prepare for her escape chapter the entire point of the exercise is not to surrender said captaingeneral tomaselli it is to waste time we know venice is coming to our rescue we know they have been delayed manfred was pleased to note that the captaingeneral seemed to have accepted the de facto situation that first falkenberg and now erik had simply assumed control of the military of the citadel erik especially erik these days was someone people tended not to question if they could avoid it besides erik had produced the letter from the doge brought by benito putting him in overall command of any forces in support of the republic of venice who are still at large on the island of corfu somebody might argue they werent at large but so far no one had been that stupid not even captaingeneral tomaselli ever since his wifes escape from prison tomaselli had been a very subdued man all the more subdued manfred thought because he clearly had no idea what had happened to her francesca had tomaselli under constant observation and she was sure the captaingeneral had no contact with his wife manfred knew that francesca herself was puzzled by sophias ability to stay hidden in such a relatively small place as the citadel of corfu and was getting worried about it some of the possible implications were disturbing manfred shook off the thought erik was speaking it is a possible idea the icelander agreed falkenberg chuckled well send old eberhard out if theres anyone in the whole world who can turn please pass the salt into a three month negotiation its him we have to be wary whom we send said erik grimly emerics middle name should be treachery well youre not going he wants your head said manfred firmly and youre not going either said von gherens too valuable as a hostage send falkenberg or me they dont know us and we can observe the military layout on the ground i think i should go said the captaingeneral i am highranking but expendable manfred blinked that had been in his mind but hed kept his mouth shut about it very well ill ask eberhard the old man has been feeling underutilized when the captaingeneral had left francesca stood up i must go and talk to eberhard too this has interesting possibilities for espionage a parley emeric smiled savagely such a thing presents some opportunities yes raise a truce flag we can use the time to move materials onto the causeway without hindering cannon fire sire dragorvich hesitated you dont think theyre using this to buy a respite this would be the first time for many months that the western half of the citadel will not be being fired on emeric shrugged i think it worthwhile aside from anything else we can see if their delegation is worth taking hostage dragorvich kept silent of course but not for the first time he reflected that the king of hungary was ultimately something of a fool emeric always thought rules were for other people without ever once considering that his own behavior might bite him back there was a good reason after all that civilized nations considered diplomatic envoys untouchable the mongols were utterly fanatical on the subject they had on three occasions that dragorvich knew of destroyed entire kingdoms for breaching that rule of war they were met by a delegation of magyar officers his majesty will not receive you with weapons weapons are to be left here falkenberg in full armor creaked to eberhard of brunswick it is to be hoped that he doesnt want us mothernaked as i hear these magyar cavalry have to go now by the pinched lips and dull red faces falkenberg hadnt made any new friends eberhard of brunswick smiled sweetly now ritter accidents will happen when you are foolish enough to give carlo sforzas son trouble the story will be a matter of interest to the brotherhood of knights im sure it will elevate the status of the magyar no end said falkenberg calmly putting down his sword the knight knew he was playing to the gallery watching from the walls plainly the magyar knew it too but by the looks of the bright eyes it might not make any difference in a minute fortunately a factotum from emeric turned up to escort them down the causeway to the king sire this was given to one of the guards by the venetian officer said the factotum handing emeric a slip of parchment it read contact me deal emeric smiled wolfishly well captaingeneral tomaselli maybe his wife did pass on that little letter to him additionally the elderly imperial who i accompanied when he went to relieve himself asks that your majesty consider a private deal the man said he has magical word from his master the emperor wants his nephew intact for which he is prepared to pay a quarter of a million ducats and also your majestys former territory of ceska and to withdraw from the districts of soporon and vas what emeric started forward what did he say the factotum repeated himself faithfully damn him damn him hes letting me know what the emperor is doing trying to draw me back to hungary ha well ill play him at his game the citadel is so close to starvation ill win soon enough anyway then ill take back soporon and vasand takeceska in the bargain my principal fear about your plan my dear said eberhard to francesca is that it may backfire on us i think we may just have told emeric what a valuable card he has to play in manfred francesca shrugged surely hes figured that out for himself by now eberhard the older statesman shook his head emeric i have serious doubts about his sanity francesca he thinks himself vastly clever and vastly superior he has welded the fractious elements of the hungarian kingdom into a unit but his decisions are sometimes odd there is a theory that the emperor has that someone else in hungary is pulling his strings it may well be true i did very little time in buda and ive never been so glad to leave anywhere not even the weather in ireland his capital is a pretty placewith a monster corrupting it i can see i still need to stop thinking like an aquitaine said francesca but i was sure wed get an approach from his spies soon we may said eberhard but first well get the attack emeric simply agreed to everything you dont negotiate like that when youre in earnest trust me negotiations are one thing ive done so often that i know exactly how genuine ones feel erik is preparing for emeric to break the truce falkenberg yawned it was long boring and windy and dusty he grinned nastily the dust was getting to emeric too now is there any wine eberhard rationed me on emerics i wouldnt buy horses from that man who emeric erik never bought any of them benito had come full of curiosity to nose out what he might no eberhard of brunswick he kept that dickering going all lifelong day when we had no intention of surrenderingand emeric has absolutely no intention of abiding by the terms he offered us mans a snake dresses like a pimp too well how long have we got before fighting resumes asked manfred weve probably given the outer wall another two weeks life with the work weve done to it today falkenberg shrugged eberhard insisted on until sunrise tomorrow to consult his principals i suspect emeric will try an allout assault about an hour before the truce is over as events proved he was wrong the assault came at midnight it was overcast and as black as the inside of a cat out there and emeric obviously found the opportunity too good to miss eriks men had also found the opportunity too good to miss since sunset they had been outside the walls digging pits in the shingle and covering them with sailcloth and more shingle the oil and pitch pots had been heating since dusk sometimes a bad reputation is a serious impediment to treachery chapter two days later after the failed attack the approaches francesca had expected arrived they arrived in a way shed never expected howeverfrom someone shed liked and trusted who had given her a great deal of information the little greek secretary to the governor meletios loukaris francesca had put a lot of manfreds money into watching and shed put a lot into the gossip grapevine it had brought her a fair amount of information but not the kingpin not yet now the gossip chain brought in another piece the captaingeneralhaving withdrawn from social life of any sort since his wifes arrest and become almost entirely reclusive since her escapewas hosting a gathering it couldnt really be counted as a party the guest list was comprised of the worst bores among the case vecchie and libri doro no women were invited francesca had a very good idea of the guest list for someone who hadnt seen it an interesting group to choose for a party and now on her watchlist the awkward question said francesca is whether de belmondo is involved because his secretary is test him said von gherens tell de belmondo were going to arrest the man and watch the secretary to see if he runs francesca screwed up her face in disgust the thing i think i hate most about you military people is your crude attitude toward espionage i was going to feed de belmondo some informationconfidential and absolutely not to be repeatedand see if the hungarians got it and what were you going to tell him asked manfred ive been trying to think of something said francesca irritably i think we should arrest this secretary and make him talk stated falkenberg francesca shook her head the trouble with that falkenberg is that some people will keep their tongues even under torture and you would make a feeble torturer anyway falkenberg tugged his moustache and why is that milady because there is a great deal you wouldnt do falkenberg nodded true enough but ive usually found that its not what i would do but what the ones being interrogated believe i am going to do manfred sighed look francesca well do it your wayuntil tomorrow sundown then we do it von gherens and falkenbergs way well tell the governor were going to arrest the man at dawn and arrive at midnight if hes packing we know where we stand if not we put my oneeyed frightener on him i just dont believe we can play around with this as it happened they didnt need either step good fortune finally favored them de belmondo came to see manfred a little later just after francesca had left for her walk the timing was too precise to be coincidental prince manfred said the old man uneasily forgive me intruding on you like this but this morning one of the libri doro a gentleman by the name of alexander konstantis came to see me in secret the old man looked embarrassed he and i share an interest in the collection of naturalistic curiosities he is an avid collector of birds eggs under this pretext he came to see me privately and not in the office he ah has something of a reputation as a malcontent i think he just likes to argue but that is easily misconstrued alexander was invited to a gathering at the captaingenerals rooms last night now signor konstantis doesnt like captaingeneral tomaselli and very nearly didnt go and only decided to do so to give the clothheadin his wordsa good mocking he found himself part of a group of very unlikely people either very wealthy landowners or people with a reputationlike himselffor being malcontents his curiosity was pricked and he decided instead of just enjoying himself to find out why the captaingeneral wanted to mix the likes of him with those the old governor shook his head sadly the purpose of the gathering was treason im afraid tomaselli sounded each of them out and alexander played along when it came to his turn he is astute and in his words tomaselli is as subtle as a charging bull he was invited to stay on after many of the others had gone home then it came down to open treason tomaselli pointed out that venice had not only failed to protect their estates but also had armed the peasants he gave details of water and food stocks he argued that the citadel must fall and that all within would lose everything even their lives he offeredconditional to the surrender of the citadelthat his allies would retain lands and privilege under emeric i see said manfred de belmondo smiled my nastytongued friend said hed go along that he had both the perfect plan and method but that he wanted some guarantees first in writing and tomaselli was much struck by the goodness of this idea de belmondo snorted and shook his head as if emeric would abide by a piece of paper anyway theyre due to meet again an hour after vespers at the captaingenerals rooms in the castel a terra alexander thinks that action is imminent and so we need to take steps unfortunately i dont know what parts of the army the captaingeneral may have suborned but i was sure it wouldnt be the knights as you are outsiders well be glad to assist said manfred i think well need some witnesses your excellency and i think that the only reason that the captaingeneral has resorted to civilians is that he has very little following in the army any longer if he ever did de belmondo looked around uneasily very well now prince manfred i have a very awkward request do you mind not telling francesca de chevreuse about this this sent ideas racing through manfreds head but he allowed no sign of his perturbation to show certainly but why the governor pulled at his earlobes well someone has told me she may possibly be a spy interesting said manfred keeping his urbane expression eberhard would have been proud to see how well hed learned so would francesca and who told you this my secretary meletios loukaris de chevreuse has been pumping him for information and tried to use him to set up other informants manfred couldnt keep a straight face any more he grinned youre quite right de belmondo she is a spy or at least an agent shes been working for my uncleand for me of coursesince we came here are you sure that is her true allegiance asked the old man doubtfully i mean in this revolting world of doubledealing and treachery it is possible for a person to serve two masters manfred nodded indeed it is which is why i want to show you these manfred produced the letter from emeric offering to manfred safe conductand setting out the terms this was delivered this morning in response to a trap set by francesca and eberhard of brunswick i think you must agree that he is beyond suspicion he has been one of the emperors finest and most trusted statesmen for many years de belmondo sighed treason and treachery all around us who brought this to you manfred looked steadily at the governor your secretary loukaris who has been an agent of francescas and provided her with several other informants this man didnt serve two masters he served three it was eneko lopez admitted an effective way of being unobtrusive and as hed felt he could not ask any of the others to take the nightsoil wagon duty he at least got to sit down this weather had been troubling the old wound and that made walking and standing painful nothing that could not be borne but it was still a relief to sit and benito had been right no one stuck around the wagon or paid it any more attention than they had to and then he had to leave the wagon in hurry theyd found himat last fianelli must have been laughing at their earlier efforts given where the demonuser had been hiding all this while we have him we have him absolutely pinpointed the magic use was unmistakable erik hakkonsen looked at the cleric skeptically and why have you come to me eneko you are very capable of arranging for satanists to be caught because this is within the castel a mar inside the governors wing the governor himself no doubt said erik dryly or maybe his wife yes eneko no doubt after the last performance which ive heard all about the governors wife reputedly the kindest women on the island youre getting like sachs eneko witches under every cobblestone eneko lopezs single line of eyebrow lowered fractionally but he kept his even tone actually erik it is the governors secretary we suspect a man named loukaris or rather someone hiding in his chambers as he wasnt there when the magic activity took place erik made a face hmm awkward but better than the mans wife being a black magician i suppose the stern lines on eneko eased he shook his head and smiled easily saintliness shines out of her erik he just dropped dead mamzelle the tail was one of the best francesca had hired right now he was also one of the most distressed hed been following the count timeto one of the guests at the captaingenerals suspicious little gathering the night before franco or i had him right under our eye almost every moment of the time he went in to try to see governor de belmondo this morning i was at the door when he spoke to the governors secretary and what did he say mouse he wanted an appointment with the governor now he was very insistent the secretary lied to him loukaris said he would check to if the governor was available franco followed him he went into his own chambers and nowhere near signor de belmondo and then he came back and told the count that the governor was out mouse took a deep breath i was following the count not too close not too obvious there was quite a crowd in the courtyard and it was easy but when he got to the gates there was no one near him and he just fell over he was dead signora they took him to the hospital but he was already dead and no one killed him the small spy crossed himself francesca bit her lip mouse do you know where benito is the spy looked startled he was nowhere near signora he was on his way to the armory i need to see him ask him to come here si but why signora a good spy like you should never ask questions like that but she had a soft spot for the little nondescript man hed brought her so many interesting titbits my elders taught me how to play politics and manage spies benitos master taught him how kill people he is a soldier signora said mouse looking doubtful the count was killed by magic im sure of it benito might be starting to become a soldier but caesare aldanto was an assassin and benito learned a lot from him a few minutes later benito appeared he looked wary what is it francesca thats a thief you have running your errands by the way i know benito if caesare had wanted someone to die without making it obvious how could it be done in a hurry let me tell you what happened and she explained benito raised his eyebrows there are a couple of possibilities but the most likely well caesare told me that if you push a very sharp thinbladed stilettoactually a sort of lethal pininto the victims heart the bleeding is almost all internal the strange thing is there is apparently no more than a momentary pain especially if the victim is corseted up like a woman or used to momentary aches and pains like someone whos elderly or outofcondition the blade is pulled out and the victim can continue walking for a good few heartbeats while the killer escapes get someone to examine the corpse carefully one of the guards was suitably corruptible and mouse was sent on another errand francesca had to wait impatiently benito was right de belmondo at least was in the clear why else would the count have been murdered its a good thing not all de belmondos informants are so trusting that theyd talk to his secretary said manfred when she told them the story or alexander konstantis might be dead too and for once just once i know more than you do dear you see de belmondo really was out of his office he was seeing me while that wicked spy his secretary had told him about was away erik came in from the office of the garrison commander i have news for all of you eneko has found fianelli the actual arrest coming after all those months of looking for fianelli was almost an anticlimax thanks to alexander konstantiss inspired meddling those who had conspired with captaingeneral tomaselli were caught redhanded in possession of documents from emeric with their names on each eneko and the knights burst in on the secretarys chambers at the same time so that loukaris could not get warning they caught him and his master fianelli who had been hiding like a boll weevil right in the middle of his hunters well francesca you should be pleased with yourself said manfred patting her on the back she looked at him consideringly what i have found is a series of strings and levers pulled by an evil man i cant call emeric anything else im just afraid of what else there is eneko nodded this drought for example it is undoubtedly magical and undoubtedly the product of emeric although i had not realized him capable of such great magics and the female satanist is still at large dont forget so is sophia tomaselli grumbled manfred how can a woman that dimwitted have evaded us for so long that evening as she studied again the records she had slowly compiled it was francesca who felt herself to be dimwitted never more so than the moment she realized the truth of course she exclaimed slapping the table with a combination of exasperation and triumph how could i have been so stupidits right there in enekos recordsonce i match it properly against every else especially the inheritance records the creature inherited the house within days after her aunt and uncle were killedand they were killed according to those same records at the same moment that eneko and diego remember a terrible burst of black magic manfred raised his head from the pillow hed been lying on the bed a bit disgruntled becausevery common latelyfrancesca was working at her desk instead of being her usual seductive self what are you talking about francesca ignored the question too busy scrabbling furiously through the mass of papers piled on her desk yes and again that little boy who disappearedanother burst of satanic magicand he was known to beggar on the same street where she lives more scrabbling her names everywhere in these records now that i finally have my senses everywhere always seemingtaking each thing at a timelike a minor and insignificant figure but more scrabbling a paper held up triumphantly yes she was known to be a friend and confidant of sophia tomaselli scrabble another paper scrabble yet another francesca rose a paper clutched in each hand her eyes were slitted and she was noticed twice in the company of one of fianellis thugs and in the company of aldo morando on one occasion all small incidents buried in the mass but taken as a whole its obvious i have been so stupid manfred was on his feet now reaching for his armor and weapons you wont need those francesca muttered shes just a woman manfred not a magyar cavalryman besides the venetian authorities will do the arrest he shrugged continuing what he was doing eneko says shes a female not a woman ive encountered a monster in the basque priests company onceso i think ill do it my way impatientlyno moving manfred in a stubborn moodfrancesca waited till he was done by the end she was even in a good mood about it might be just as well i need to get confirmation from morandoand for that ill need you to intimidate the venetians into allowing me to offer him a commutation of his sentence she patted manfred fondly on the cheekwith only two fingers that being the most she could get past the cheek guards you do look so impressive in full armor you would even if you werent a prince come dear morando had been halfasleep when his cell was suddenly invaded he woke up instantly howeveras a prisoner condemned to death is bound to do when he finds his cell occupied by almost every major figure of authority in the area several priests three knights of the holy trinity in full armorand a beautiful woman francesca de chevreuse in a dramatic gesture drew forth several slips of paper from her gown she handed one each to the podesta the commander of the garrison one of the priests and the hugest of the knights ive written a name on those slips morando the same name on each one if you can match that nameits the identity of your accomplice the one youve been keeping a secret from usyoull live if you cantor wontyoull be executed here todaynot later in venice so forget about the possibility of being rescued if emeric takes the citadel not that he wouldnt kill you himself anyway she grinned at him mercilessly in honor of venetian authority we will use the traditional venetian method of execution it begins i believe by breaking the legs thenthough im not sure about this its all too ghastly for a delicate woman to contemplatethey do something with your innards morando swallowed he did know the procedures used by venetians when they executed someone who had truly and genuinely infuriated them traitors being right at the top of the list it was indeed too ghastly to contemplate bianca casarini he croaked slips of paper were studied briefly a moment later the cell was empty again chapter bianca detected the coming soldiers when they were still some distance awayand had sensed the presence of eneko lopez even sooner she had many weeks earlier established a faint degree of mental control over the urchins who were always in the streets and who served her as unwitting and unconscious human alarm signals thats it then she murmured to herself its time to hide the thought was neither hurried nor frantic shed prepared for this moment and prepared well three weeks ago working mindlessly under her control saluzzo had finished breaking a hole through the rear wall into an adjoining house the residents of the house an elderly couple had never noticed a thingbeing also under biancas compulsions shed slide through the hole pass through the house and be out on another street and heading for morandos hideout before lopez and the soldiers could finish breaking down the front door she rose and took a small bag from the side table in her bedroom shed had the bag ready for days with all of her essential instruments and ingredients in it moving quickly down the stairs she smiled savagely then theyll have saluzzo to deal with and the fools came at night to boot in the darkness the mindless thing he becomes will be twice as dangerous saluzzo was slumbering on a divan in the front room as he usually was these days he spent most of his time lately doing nothing but eating and dozing awash in the reveries bianca provided him hed grown a bit fat and soft as a result but that didnt concern bianca the transformation he was about to undergo would make fat and soft completely meaningless she strode over placed her hand on his face and sent a jolt of sheer agony blazing through his head then stepped back quickly sputtering and yowling saluzzo scrambled to his feet and stared at bianca he was simply confused at the moment his confusion vanished as bianca slapped him across the cheek then spit in his face rage came instantly to a man like saluzzo his face contorted with fury looking even uglier in the light cast by the single lamp in the room he took a step toward her his big fist raised perfect rage was essential to a full transformation all that was needed now were the words of power words that had never been intended to be shaped by human lips but which bianca had long practice in uttering again saluzzo yowled with pain a yowl this time that went on and on and onand as it continued started changing in timbre and tone within seconds sounding more like the scream of a beast than a human being bianca sped from the room she had perhaps a minute to escape while saluzzos body was paralyzed by the changes it was undergoing by then the semimindless demonshaped beast hed have become tormented by the agony of muscles nerves and bone wrenched into new shapes and the unfettered paincharged anger she had invoked would not be able to think at all much less clearly by then also the soldiers would have started breaking in the door and the saluzzomonsters rage would have a different target and what a shock they would have when their steel and iron weapons and armor did not protect them outside on the street eneko lopez fell to one knee his hands clasped his head as if hed been struck by a sudden and ferocious painlance straight into his brain the venetian soldiers paused as did manfred and erik the arresting unit was still some twenty yards from the casarini house there was a full moon out this night so the house was clearly visible whats wrong eneko the priest seemed unable to speak manfred could see that his face was tight with pain it also seemed pale as a sheet although that could have been the effect of the moonlight erik waved to the sergeant commanding the ten soldiers go on theres no time to waste the sergeant and his men continued forward two of the soldiers hefting axes while four others held torches aloft erik knelt alongside eneko manfred couldnt because he was wearing full armor his icelander bodyguard as he usually did given the choice had opted to wear nothing more than halfarmor for the occasion erik had learned to fight in iceland and vinland and never was really comfortable in the heavy teutonic armor favored by the knights can we do anything eneko he asked the priest shook his head then slowly withdrew his hands from his temples when his eyes caught sight of the soldiersnow standing before the door raising their axesthey widened and his face impossibly seemed to grow paler still oh dear godno erik get them away from that door they will be no match for it was too late the door shattered from within not a second after the first axe landed something erupted out of it because of the darkness it was difficult to see it clearly manfred could only discern a thing of scales and wings and horns and talons with a face like a gargoyles shrieking fury the soldier holding the axe was smashed aside by a taloned paw that shredded his throat in passing a backhand blow from the same paw sent the other axewielding soldier sprawling knocking down two other soldiers with him their torches scattering the monster took a stride forward and crushed the sergeants skull its talons stripping away the helmet as if it were a mere skullcap then to manfreds horror seized the sergeant by the shoulders as he collapsed and bit his head in half the fangs sheered through the poor mans skull and brains like a knife through cheese the creature flung the sergeants corpse aside and spit out the top part of his head then spread its huge arms and bellowed with rage and a kind of hideous triumphant glee still the moments the demon had taken to kill the sergeant had given the rest of the soldiers the time to back away back away frantically two of them dropped their weapons and simply ran the remaining soldiers stood their ground more or less but they looked about as confident as fiveyearboys facing a tiger in full fury manfred felt calm settling over him a calm so profound it was almost serenity theres always adventures when youre around eneko he said cheerfully drawing his broadsword erik get that creatures attention for me if you would manfred stepped forward holding his sword in both hands the huge blade gleaming in the moonlight from the corner of his eye he could see that erik was hesitating not surprising of coursethe icelander was supposed to guard the prince from danger after all not draw the attention of monsters upon him now erik manfreds voice was soft but the words came like iron the commanding words of a princewhen all was said and done erik stared at manfred and then felt calmness coming over him as well he knew finally in that moment what he had begun to suspect for some time if manfred survived his lifeno telling that of coursehe would become one of europes great legends so be it erik hakkonsen had been charged with guarding a prince not just a man he could hardly complain if in the end the man lived up to his station a true prince was not simply an heir he was also charged with protecting his people erik drew his tomahawk stepped forward and hurled it unerringly the weapon flew toward the demonunseen by it in the dark of nightand struck the creature between its horns had erik been using the proper algonquin tomahawk hed once had that strike might well have felled the monster itself as it was the blade sank into the skull but didnt succeed in splitting the creatures brains not too surprising of course the things skull was considerably thicker than the little brain remaining within the demon screamed with pain and fury its vaguely boarlike face swinging toward erik and manfred erik thought the eyes gleamed red though it was difficult to be sure of color in the dim moonlight manfred took another step forward come to me beast still screaming the demon sprang off the stoop and hurtled down the street toward manfred its wings were spread fully now and flapping they were not sufficient to lift the great heavy thing off the ground entirely but they enabled it to race forward at an inhuman speed an instant later the horrible creature was leaping in the air sailing down upon manfred like a hawk stooping on a chicken a very large and dangerous chicken manfreds great shoulders hunched and he swept the sword across chesthigh to the demon dia a coir it was an incredible swordstrike the blade severed the monster in half the upper half still screaming bounced off manfreds lowered helmet and shoulders and spilled on the street behind him almost at enekos feet the lower half gushing ichor and intestines flopped backward eneko lopez stared at the thing writhing in front of him the boars face with its tusks still gnashing the taloned paws scrabbling at the cobblestones he raised his crucifix that which cannot abide the name of he never finished the sentence thunk manfreds sword removed the monsters head entirely sending it rolling down the street like a loose cannonball erik hurried after it muttering something about lost tomahawks thunk manfreds sword driven straight down with both hands pierced the monsters spine and pinned the torso to the street itself whether by luck or simply the princes great strength the tip of the blade wedged itself between two cobblestones meanwhile working both fearfully and frantically the soldiers were hacking the lower part of the demons body into pieces it was hideous work if not particularly dangerousthough one soldier was knocked off his feet by a reflexive kick from one of the monsters flailing legs fortunately the leg ended in a hoof instead of talons so the soldier suffered nothing worse than a bad bruise the demons torso was still twitching but more feebly now eneko looked down the street the other way and saw that erik was returninghis tomahawk in one hand and the demons head held by one batshaped ear in the other the heads maw was still gnashing and as the priest watched made an attempt to bite erik on the leg stupid manfred grunted sure enough erik set the head down on a nearby stoop and proceeded to smash out all its fangs with the tomahawk three quick blows delivered with all of eriks skill with the weapon and there really wasnt much left of the thing except blood and bone fragments held together by strips of hide not that erik was probably planning to mount it as a trophy anyway manfred glared down at his sword damnation he growled its going to take me hours to sharpen it properly eneko sometimes i think youre more trouble than youre worth the priest rose to his feet scowling were not finished yet prince manfred thishe pointed at the demons carcasswas just a tool the real monster is still inside eneko looked at the shattered door feeling immensely frustrated or not probably not any longer thats why the creature set this thing loose i sensed the incantationas horrible as any ive ever encounteredwhich is what sent me to my knees manfreds bulllike strength was put to use again even for him withdrawing the sword was a struggle but within a few seconds he and erik were pushing through the entrance into the house their weapons ready with eneko and his crucifix coming right behind and as eneko had foreseen it was too late bianca casarini was gone within a minute theyd found the escape route shed taken but the elderly couple living in the adjoining house seemed comatose and their own rear entrance was wide open after looking down that street manfred stated the obvious its nighttime she could be anywhere by now chapter as soon as she entered morandos cellar from the secret entrance and closed the wall behind her bianca felt a thrilling surge of triumph her plans were workingand working perfectly shed be safe from discovery here the venetian authorities in the citadel had weeks earlier sealed the front entrance to morandos domicile theyd had to in order to put a stop to the constant stream of curious visitors that meant no one would even think of reopening the cellar and looking in it again only one danger remained and shed deal with that now bianca went directly to the altar not bothering to look around the altar was a fake true enough but put to biancas use instead of the charlatan morandos it would serve her purpose quickly using the tools and ingredients in the bag shed brought with her she performed the necessary ritual not like the much more difficult scrying in blood she needed to use to speak with her putative mistress this was a simple thingcommunication by fire nothing that the powers of corfu would be able to touch or hinder she kindled the flame of a candle made of the rendered fat of an unbaptized baby then bent over the flame cupping her hands about it and whispered a single name this was a mild incantation not something she had any fear that the cursed lopez would be able to detect in and of itself simply a communicationand with someone whom shed prepared long ago for the purpose in his cell morando suddenly awoke gasping for breath bianca he whispered is that you he saw the image of her beautiful face emerge seeming like an apparition in midair she was smiling gently its me aldo but keep your voice down thank god then speaking softly listen they still dont know anything about youand they say theyll commute my sentence to ten years on the galleys so with your help nothing aldo they dont know about the secret entrance to the cellar he shook his head no i kept that from them the only he got no further bianca said some words he didnt catch and a sudden sharp pain stabbed through his chest he gasped clutching his chest with both hands dimly through the pain he saw biancas smile widen poor aldo she said thats the needle youre feeling the one i implanted below your skin months ago while you were sleepingand then numbed the nerves in the area so youd never sense it her mouth worked speaking more words he knew it was an incantation of some kind though he didnt understand the words themselves its working its way into your heart now dont be concerned though i dont have time to enjoy this properly itll all be over within a minute the agony was now too intense for speech or even screaming the shock even more so he simply gaped at her until he died in casarinis abandoned house eneko lopez broke off his part of the search they were conducting his hands started to fly to his temples again but this time his frustration and anger was so great that he slammed them against a wall instead may the saints blast the monster shes doing it again he leaned against the wall shuddering his face full of concern manfred took a step toward him then suddenly the priest whole body grew rigid wait he murmured something is happening perhaps a minute later eneko pushed away from the wall and turned toward manfred to the princes astonishment there was a smile on the priest face a very very very grim smile i shall have to do penance for this of course said the priest vengeance is indeed the province of the lord still i cant help but treasure this moment as she turned away from the altar smiling broadly with satisfactiontreachery was so sweetbianca was startled by a sudden motion in the darkness of the cellar sophia tomasellis face loomed in front of her bianca barely recognized the woman the oncefastidious case vecchie looked like a hag filthy her hair disarrayedand with a hags contorted grimace you bitch this is my refuge too late bianca saw that sophia held a heavy candlestick in one handand was raising it to strike she threw up her arm to block the blow but her recent use of two powerful incantations had left her very fatigued she couldnt get the arm up in time the brass candlestick smashed into her forehead like a mallet sending her dazed and halfconscious to the floor consciousness returned perhaps thirty seconds later pain leading the way she couldnt breathe her hands flew to her throat there was something it was a silk scarf she realized digging deeply into her throat cutting off all air and blood somewhere behind her sophia tomaselli was holding the thing strangling her as bianca had once strangled a niece you stinking slut aldos mine not yours tomasellis words came in grunts sounding more like something uttered by a peasant than a noblewoman besides sophia hissed theres not enough food ill share it with aldo when he comes but not you bianca was frantic now the situation was absurd how could such a pathetic creature as sophia tomaselli possibly be a threat to her but the fact remained that the hag was in such a frenzy that shed kill bianca if she werent stopped automatically bianca started to utter the incantations that would destroy the creatureonly to realize then that whether sophia understood what she was doing or not strangling a sorceress is perhaps the safest way to kill her she couldnt speak a word in fact her mind was becoming so fuzzy from lack of air that she wasnt sure she could have remembered the words well enough to incant them properly even if she had been able to speak bianca went into a paroxysm of terror writhing and twisting on the floor but everywhere she went sophia stayed on top of herlike some hideous leech sucking out her life desperately she planted her hands on what part of sophia she could reach nothing more than her hips unfortunately which were protected by the womans tattered but still richly thick garments the pain touch worked much better on bare skinespecially skin with a lot of nerves close to the surface even if she could have clawed her way past the fabric to sophias buttocks shed only have been touching fatty flesh still bianca used the last of her strength to send agony pouring into sophias body as best she could and a great deal of agony it was too despite the handicaps bianca casarini was fighting for her life and the agony she summoned was driven by a will to live that had sent her into every foulness imaginable for years it was perhaps the worst thing she could have done not that she really had any options sophias body arched like a suddenly drawn bow from the excruciating painbut her hands clenched by the same agony never let go of the scarf the silk that had been choking casarini now collapsed her windpipe completely crushing it into ruin bianca spit out blood feeling her life going with it i cant believe it sophia tomaselli i wanted to live forever shes dead eneko said grimly i felt the monster dying i knew the moment she was gone he knelt and crossed himself then kissed the crucifix reverentiallyand yet erik thought with some other emotion as well guilt regret though erik could not imagine what eneko lopez could possibly have to feel guilty about at least in this instance how did she die asked erik after he rose to his feet lopez shrugged that i couldnt tell you i am not clairvoyant you know i could simply sense the monsters frantic attempts to use magic to forestall her deathsomebody or something was killing her that much i know though i couldnt tell you who or whatand her eventual failure his expression was grimmer than manfred had ever seen itand eneko was a man given to a grim view of the world vengeance is mine sayeth the lord he heard the priest murmur still the beast died in great despair as well as fury it was fitting and you shall live forever bianca casarini oh yes most certainly confused bianca opened her eyes she was more confused then by what she saw first because all the images seemed duplicatedno multiplied many times over oh youll get accustomed to compound eyes soon enough perhaps unfortunately from your point of view not mine of course the strange voice seemed to be coming from all directions at once biancas eyes moved over the landscape hard to tell it just seemed like a world made of cables a kind of enormous net of cables dirtywhite in color stretching to what seemed like infinity she sensed that the effect was not simply caused by the weird multiplication of her vision a reddish glow somewhere to her left drew her gaze that way dully she stared at it for a while how long she couldnt say she seemed to have difficulty determining the passage of time the color of the glow changed slowly shading from red to yellow to eventually a particularly loathsome shade of yellowgreen the color of slime if slime were as hot as lava also the color shed once seen in a glimpse shed gotten of the great one the eyes that werent eyes at all but something that had reminded her at the time of staring into bottomless volcanic cesspools welcome bianca casarini welcome to eternity realization finally came to her she opened her mouth to scream tried to rather she had no mouth looking down all she could see was a proboscis of some kind where shed once had a nose looking down still further at her body she saw that her lungs were now on the outside redveined and pulsing oh yes that im afraid that certain physical laws still apply here on this level at any rate there are quite a bit more than nine incidentally how many hard to say depends on which mathematical formula you use she tried to scream again the only effect was to make her proboscis grow more rigidand cause the lungs to pulsate quicker yes yes im afraid so volume to surfacearea ratios that sort of thing all very tawdry im afraid it also means that discreet little spiracles wont do the trick at all so ive had to modify your lungs a bit it does make you hideously ugly true but then thats now the least of your problems im afraid crocell lost his sexual appetites long agoand wouldnt care in the least if you were still as comely as you were paralysis was giving way to terror biancas eyes now ranged down the rest of her body there were way too many legs and she was quite sure that wasnt simply a function of her strange new vision skinny weirdly jointed hairy legs six legs to be precise im something of a stickler when it comes to tradition very conservative actually despite my reputation as a rebel ah here comes crocell now give him a nice run would you bianca i have to keep him wellexercised for the rare occasions when i let him out she sensed the vibration first looking down she saw that her feetfeet what were those horrid clawlike thingswere planted on one such cable the cable seemed to be undulating as if some great weight had been placed upon it she twisted her bodyawkwardly since she was unaccustomed to its new shapeand saw that a monster was moving toward her along the cable like a great spider except for the face it was the face that finally broke what was left of bianca casarinis selfcontrol for some reason the sight of a middleaged mans face on such a monsterexcept that he possessed mandibles as well as jawswas more horrifying than anything else worst of all was the look of bleak despair in the mans eyesutter and complete despair such as bianca had never seen beforenot even in the eyes of her own victims crocell was a much better cheater than you were bianca oh much better thats why he gets a privileged position here so to speak as i said i even let him out now and then a privilege which im afraid youll not be enjoying bianca fled down the cable shrieking silently she could feel the cable thrumming beneath her feet under the treads of something much heavier than she oh please bianca have no fearafter he sucks out your juices ill replenish them again its agonizingly painful of course but not terminal in the least if only she could scream no no not in the least bit terminal even though you were planning to cheat me im not at all vengeful despite what you may have heard if only she could scream you wanted eternal life bianca casarini and now you have it if only she could scream as food part xiv january ad chapter theyve landed on vidos island like everyone else benito scrambled out of bed and rushed for a viewpoint of the island off to the northeast of the citadel benito eyed the beached vessels on the island with impotent fury the castles defenders were firing but it was obviously too little and far too late vidos island had guarded the northern sea access to the citadel now with the island obviously under heavy attack the people of the fortress realized that there would be no place that would be entirely free from cannon fire there would be no respite the cannon from vidos would not be able to hit the citadel but the byzantine fleet would now be able to sail into that area and shell the citadel without coming under direct fire from both flanks benito strode off in search of manfred he found him standing with erik contemplating the situation grimly theyre in the outer walls of the island already said the icelander the keep might hold out a while but it wont be for too long and theyll be able to harry the northeast too benito sighed with emerics latest increase in bombardment on the city itself rather than just the walls much of the population had taken to at least sleeping over there true very few people had been killed by the cannon fire but it was frightening and hurt morale knowing there was no place that they could truly get away from the possibility of a cannonball killing themor worse their childrenwas going to dent morale even further emeric was slowly chipping away at the spirit of citadel with starvation and fear we need to strike back somehow a sortie is out of the question manfred said you two have forced emeric to invest more in defense than he has in attacking capability the shingle out there is a set of death traps for horses then lets take it to the bastards by sea urged benito weve got the fireboats if the keep on vidos hasnt fallen by tonight theyll have all their carracks bunched around the island firing ships cannon at the keep manfred cocked his head at erik youve looked at those cockleshells what do you think erik nodded almost all of their larger cannon are on the carracks the cannon on those carracks are what theyve mostly been using to harass the citadel from the sea with anyway burn them and youll reduce their marine gunnery to a pitiful effort but will it work erik shrugged those little boats are works of shipbuilders art manfred theyve got one weakness they were built to run straight with the wind if we can row them to a point where theyre directly upwind leave each of them with a slowmatch and a dead bearing well it is going to be a question of how well we aim and how well we can judge the slowmatch time youd be aiming a small boat at a small target a long way away most of them would miss still its worth trying were not going to get as many byzantine ships so close together again get one of those little sailing bombs in among them and well likely see a fair number catch fire benito compressed his lips were not going to miss not if i have to ride those little ships all the way in myself call it umbertos legacy the little arsenal has about fifteen longboats the byzantines would either have to up anchor and out oars in the dark or with the light galleys beached at vidos launch its the better part of a mile but with a start and twelve rowers we should do it what are you suggesting benito we lower longboats give each team two fireboats to tow out the enemy are going to be focused on vidos we should be able to get really closetheyre firing and the muzzleflash will be easy to see set the fireboats on their line leave one man to each have him jump overboard at the last moment with luck the longboats will recover the aimers why does someone need to stay with each fireboat because they dont have steerage if they arent moving quite fast he saw the puzzled look on manfreds face just take it from me or erik thats how it works manfred manfred looked at him with a strange expression youll need men who are tired of life benito the longboats wont be able to hang about looking for anyone manfred were starving were down to four cupfuls of water a day per man you dont have to be tired of life to volunteer for thisyou have to want desperately to live he shook his head the people down at the little arsenal are furious about umbertos murder theyre tired of being powerless to do anything a lot of themespecially the caulkersswim like fish the caulkers have to for when theres a sprung plank theres only so much you can do to repair a ship from the inside and if the ships on the water it means diving with a rope around your waist and some wadding ill get volunteers all right he sighed ill get too many you know i will not assist in the war of one christian soldier against another said eneko lopez regardless of what vileness emeric delves into or what chernobog does most of emerics troops and the byzantine soldiers are of our faith benito held up his hands pacifyingly im not proposing you do anything that kills anyone eneko all i was hoping for was some way to save good men from drowning in the darkness like the glowing winged lion on the sails of the great galleys eneko lopez looked at him with those penetrating eyes and apparently decided in benitos favor tell me what you are planning i suppose i should be grateful that a fiendish mind like yours is on the side opposing chernobog and the devilworshipers benito told him eneko lopez shook his head and you have thirty men prepared to do this i think at last count even places on the longboats were doublesubscribed benito looked at eneko consideringly you know father lopezeverybody always lectures or preaches to me antimo said it was my face now im going to do the same for you seeing as youve also done it to me he grinned wryly fairs fair after all you priests justiceseven princesseem to think you have the monopoly on a sense of justice it isnt like that at all i promise you the scuolo the boatpeople hell even thieves have a sense of justice of what is right it may not always be what the priests and others think is right but they believe in it and theyre prepared to pay a high price for what they believe in the arsenalotti are angry and frustrated about this siege and about the murder umberto was a quiet fellow but he was theirs hed stood by them hed bled for them maria too the corfiotes think more of her than they do of the governor for instance theyre bitter about her loss shes even won over the illyrians ive got men who cant swim volunteering i had four times what i wanted for the fireboats now are you going to help me keep these men alive or are you going to get sanctimonious with me eneko lopez looked at him in silence then he drew a deep breath i stand humbled you know those of us who fight the battle for the human spirit do so because we believe in its potential we are after all made in the image of god but sometimes we spend so much time isolated and only dealing with the bad that we forget yes some luminescence can be magically contained in small bottles it is not without cost but i suppose if you fail and the citadel falls evil will have its day unchecked ill take the bottles with gratitude said benito but as for unchecked eneko short of clearing corfu of people emeric is just going to meet unending resistance whether were here or not erik sowed the wind out there emeric is reaping the whirlwind the wind was to the southeast blowing dust from corfus once green fields across the citadel its not natural grumbled one of the corfiotes it should be blowing northwesterly and it should be raining too said his friend with a dry smile and then we could row twice as far and get wet from above with fresh water and below with salt stop complaining dimitros his companion continued blackening his face i need something to keep my mind busy this is crazy have your tot of grappa and lets get on with it one by one the small boats were lowered into the sea in tense silence now the little flotilla began running out toward the muzzle flashes around vidos the inner keep had no large cannon the byzantine vessels were perfectly safe but some good admiral had still deployed a couple of small galliots to patrol benito thought his heart would stop when one of them loomed up through the darkness what ships called the watchman on the prow tell them were some greek name weve sprung a leak and were taking water whispered benito and then we row like hell we have to board them obviously at least five of the longboats had had the same idea the small galliot was a twentyoar vesselbut she was quartering the wind and the oars were shipped abandoning all stealth the longboats closed fast shots rang out and then they were on board desperate venetians and corfiotes outnumbering the crew boarding from several vessels the silence theyd hoped for was a lost dream now all they could do was move fast benito had volunteered for the fireboats the scuolo liked him too much to tell him he was an inexperienced amateur seaman besides he was lucky and crazy they needed that too a caulker grabbed him by the shoulder come milord the lads are getting the sails up well deal with this ship you get to yours therell be trouble coming benito scrambled over the side of the galliot and onto the fireboat assigned to him someone handed down the slowmatch go valdosta go the darkness ahead was vidos with the fireboats sixteen feet of oilandgunpowderladen hull accelerating beneath the belling sail benito did what steering was possible then he put the rudder into the bracket shed run straight now but any lookout attracted by the shooting out at the galliot could hardly miss her just as he thought that benito realized that the carracks at anchor were firing now not at vidos castle keep but at them salt spray flying benito touched the slowmatch to the fuse it sputtered and lit taking a deep breath benito dove overboard the water was chilly as he came up the night sky was suddenly lit by an explosion and a plume of flames one of the fireboats wasnt going to get to the fleet benito tugged at the bottle tied to his waist fiat lux he spluttered there was light there were other lights in the water mostly farther back toward the citadel and the oil from the cannonhit fireboat was burning on the watermuch too close for comfort benito took a desperate look around wondered how long he could hold his breath and swim underwater and resolved hed drown before he burned then a longboat with the boatswain calling stroke as if this were a regular trip out to a carrack at anchor came out of the darkness and hauled him inboard i might have known youd be the closest to the enemy said a wet erik grimly weve lost a good few men and the galleys are going to be after us look benito saw a galley silhouetted against the flames saw the muzzle flash and laughed helplessly thats the one we captured erik it looks like the boys are trying to take it home there was huge explosion and flash behind them the men at the oars pulled the little boat raced toward the citadel vidos might fall but as benito peered back at the pandemonium of fireboats exploding he knew umbertos idea made sure it hadnt been a cheap victory for king emeric it was a fitting repayment it was morning before they could see just exactly what the damage had been benito already knew the cost four men had not been picked up one dimitros had ridden his fireboat right in while his longboat team rowing frantically behind had screamed at him to jump only god knew what had been in his mind now presumably he was explaining himself to the recording angel trying to persuade him that it hadnt been suicide in attacking the galliot now beached on the northern shingle beside the san nicolo and dolphins hulks the venetians and corfiotes had suffered nine wounded and five killed theyd seen that some of the byzantine fleet had burned last night but now at first light every survivor who wasnt in the hospital of what was being called umbertos revenge was on the northern wall looking out counting ships there was silence lord and saints said someone awed if we could come along now with four great galleys wed hold the sea that might have been something of an exaggeration but the carrack fleet was considerably reduced the fire had takenor made the skippers run up onto vidosat least fifteen carracks the bulk of the cannonbearing vessels but it was the flag on the outer walls of vidos castle that brought a cheer that must have rung right across the bay between them when the fireboats had struck the besiegers must have run to the shore the islands trees had also caught fire and the galleys and smaller craft the enemy had landed with must have had to either be rescued or burn and the surviving soldiers had used the opportunity to retake the outer walls how long the small garrison could keep the winged lion flying there was another matter as the gate must be smashed but it was a heartwarming sight nonetheless a gunner from the walls of vidos celebrated first light with a round into a largely intact carrack but looking at the cheering men and women on the citadel benito couldnt escape the fact that they were all gaunt the siege had now lasted more than eight months starvation might beat them yet even if theyd just singed emerics beard for him chapter we still hold total military superiority here on the island weve still got some several hundred men on vidos and the barricade the defenders have put up on the gates ruins cant hold general krovoko was trying to put the best face on the situation that he could but he was going to have to tell all of the truth and he knew itas he knew of emerics propensity to kill the messenger but the byzantines are whimpering with the bad weather most of their fleet was here in the shelter so naturally we used them for the attack on vidos it was a fiasco they were anchored in close formation off the southern side of the islet when they saw the fireboats several captains tried to run anger crept into his tone if theyd just stayed put wed have lost half as many vessels in the dark in panic they ran into each other fired cannon into each other ran aground or just plain ran three of the vessels ran all the way to the albanian shore and one of them was wrecked we had a ship burning make landfall at kommeno point the local people killed most of the crew before the cavalry arrived we lost nineteen carracks and three galleys with fire damage to another four vessels were down to seven carracks the blockade with nothing more than the narenta galliots and that handful is worth little sire general krovoko was done with his report now he waited fatalistically for the sky to fall on him emeric pushed himself back in his throne i know but thats not really what concerns me the atlantic fleet hasnt come home and we know that the eastern fleet is still sitting in trebizond after their attempt on the dardanelles its the steady trickle of losses here on the island that worries me especially as the weather and the lack of ships limit my fetching more troops krovoko shook his head he was a little surprised to find himself still alive and discussing the matter sire the countryside is definitely hostile the insurgents in the north must number in the hundreds and although weve taken kassiopi paleokastritsa still holds out the place is inaccessible and the locals have managed to resupply when the insurgents have attacked the forces we have there but the island grows drier lack of water must be affecting them general krovoko nodded what we really is need a safe place to rest our men this campaign of raids and ambushes its wearing them down sire emeric looked thoughtful but offered no comment the magyar cavalryman pointed to the map we can land men here on the mainland near this lake make a base for accumulating supplies and let the troops rest we have more men than we need for the siege and less than we need to hold siege and subdue the island theyll be safe from the venetians or even corfiotes the narenta pirate captain muttered in his dialect it was by the tone something derisive emeric looked coldly at him what was that the pirate captain looked uneasy but stood his ground i said that would be escaping from an angry cat into the lions den that is iskander begs land the lord of the mountains will not like it emeric pinched his lips into a harsh line he doesnt have to like it ive tried to contact him to reach an agreement with the bandit well he doesnt wish to treat with me i would have preferred to bring my men here by land but the mountains have too many places where ambushes are easy but the land next to the lake is gentle with the lake behind us the sea in front this should be an easy strip to hold i like the idea see to it general it will act as one side to the pincer i want to work on the coastal strip ill leave the bandit chief to his mountains well hold the lowlands from here to montenegro in the next few years now onto other affairs we must press the attack on the citadel hard now let drought take the rest of the island weve walled and entrenched the moles said dragorvich the troops can move forward protected the front wall is crumbling give us another two weeks cannonade sire a determined push will take the first curtain wall you can have a few weeks i want them pounded into submission at the end of februaryor at the latest early marchwe must be in the venetians will doubtless make something of a push in the spring with whatever ships they have ready well want at least three weeks to repair and reequip the citadel against that attack were down to thirdrations it was so dry that maria and the other horta gatherers were not finding much to gather winter was not the best time for wild greens anyway but there had always been something but with this many women and a restricted area to hunt in it was getting less easy by the day the sound of the cannons was by now such a normal part of the background noise that it was only its stopping that they would have noticed the attack on the walls now was relentless the hungarians had so increased their forward positions and fortifications that they could sally and attack the walls repeatedly with relative impunity food ships and water carts arrived for them each day here inside it was relentless starvation and less in the water ration by the day marias biggest worry was having milk for alessia two of the other womens breasts had already dried up too little water too little food alessia now weighed less than she had two months ago maria could not weep for umberto anymore she dared not waste the water on tears what would she do if her milk dried up it was a constant nagging fear i know its risky said benito irritably but were on our last legs here if we actually knew when they were coming it would make the world of difference come eneko please the cleric nodded wearily very well well try again but there was no response marco had an almost overpowering compulsion to make contact with his brother but both mascoli and the stregasage du catres who sailed with them advised against it they had to be precise forbidden it utterly marco had insisted on going on this voyage theyll need healers and food more than soldiers hed said finally doge dorma had given permission for him to go under conditions the first was the shield of mages who accompanied him the second was that kat remained in venice at least until the siege was lifted dorma made it very clear that he would prefer it to be until marco returned the priestess looked at the halfalmond on the altar and wondered there was only one candidate she had explained everything as best she could she had instructed without demanding without as far as she could tell even hinting the candidate must choose of her own free will that was the law but would she would she even see the need she must she must or they would all die here perhaps even the goddess and the cold god yes perhaps even them part xv march ad chapter back shouted erik back to the inner curtainwall maria watched as the knights charged again making space and time for the footmen and others to pull back without endangering the wall benito was out there somewhere rearguard setting explosives with the knights bombardier she herself had only just gotten up here having led the women up from the wall by the little arsenal toward the end theyd been reduced to throwing cobbles and bricks at the enemy the arquebusiers had shot out their powder blades were blunted and nicked and yet there always seemed to be more foes maria closed her eyes to pray then opened them looking at the scene below already the bulk of the hungarian forces were pouring in through the breach in the outer wall the inner wall which enclosed the castel a mar and the castel a terra was higher than the outer curtain wallbut it certainly wasnt thicker and the wells in the upper part of citadel were long dry true theyd all taken part in the filling of the huge cisterns up in the castels uphill all the way carrying water ewers but when that was gone there would be no more according to benito the water available might last the ten thousand people inside the citadel two weeks the cisterns had been intended for the garrison only on wet verdant corfu the wells and the two springs in the inner citadel never ran dry except now there was an evil thing out there as the high priestess had explained a spirit of dryness fire and death a thing that caused green life to wither just by its existence maria sighed first her home then umberto and now this they were being devoured slowly she made her way through the crowded streets and to the hospital and the hypatian chapel where some women and the children who were too young to fling rocks had been sent when it was realized this was an assault that might actually succeed stella had taken alessia and a number of other scuolo and corfiote children so that the younger women could go to help on the walls she found stella at the chapel looking stunned and crying albertohes missing they tell me he was shot he was with the rearguard there was no one to bring him in dear god dear god for once her children were silent big eyed scared even the ones too young to fully understand maria couldnt find words so she simply hugged her hard the older woman clung to her maria swallowed stella you you stood by me when when umberto and i were new and friendless you were there when there was that curse and others avoided me youve stood by me ill help as much as i can stella pulled away despair warring with anger in her face gods death maria dont you understand were all going to die here my man my babies all of us well either die of thirst and starvation or the hungarian monsters will get us maria picked up alessia the little girl hung listlessly in her arms ill do something i have to she turned and walked out of the chapel a horrible thought had just crossed her mind if there had been no one to bring alberto in where was benito he was with the rearguard benito would always choose the hardest the riskiest task he would be in the front of the vanguard and at the back of the rearguard maria went searching eventually she found erik and manfred the princes armor was dented his visor was now up and there was blood oozing from a small cut above his eye prince manfred im looking for benito he looked a little annoyed that someone should trouble him at this stage at the mention of benitos name though the expression eased last i saw of him was when we were returning from that final sortie he and a couple of othersa big fellow and another manwere lighting the charges to the houses on the road have you seen him erik erik frowned no and hes supposed to report to me check with the gate guards wait ill come with you thatll get answers very shortly maria knew the worst seven of the rearguard hadnt reached the gate alberto and benito were both among them benito gone what little remained of the bottom of her world crumbled and fell away leaving her hollow and utterly utterly alone she turned blindly from erik not hearing what he said and walked away alessia whimpered and nuzzled weakly but maria had no milk to give her marias eyes remained dry there were no tears to cry now the time for weeping was over shed lost umberto hed not been her soulmate perhaps but hed been someone shed gone from liking to loving and now shed lost the man shed truly loved too benito was gone she hadnt even had a chance to say goodbye to him much less tell himwell much of anything except that he was a fool which he was and that his wildness was going to get him killed which it had and very soon shed lose her baby too alessia was dying slowly of hunger the worst of all possible deaths even being spitted on a hungarian spear was better than this dying by inches and that was when she knew what she had to do it came to her all of a piece not as a blinding flash of revelation but settling over her like a blanket certainty and perhaps it was folly equal to benitos or insanity and perhaps her soul would be damned or perhaps it just wouldnt work at all but there was only one person here who could and would do what she was about to therefore she would do it she had nothing to lose now except alessia and if she did not do this thing alessia was lost anyway there was only one way forward squaring her chin maria walked determinedly through the frightened crowds onward and upward to the castel a mar to see the high priestess to tell her that she was ready to become the bride of the master of the black altar the guards recognized her let her pass unquestioned it all happened very quickly renate was waiting for her her hair loose her white robe on if you had not come the priestess looked exhausted and seemed twenty years older than when maria had first come to the island well she said i did they took the passage down from the castel to the hidden temple merde theyve come up the side struggling with the weight of albertohe might no longer be fat but he was still largebenito took a side street alberto was plainly in shock but was doing his best to hobble supported by the smaller man the road was unfamiliar to benito but the sound of hooves galloping up the street was not he hauled alberto over a low wall and they hid as a troop of croats rode past lying in the shadows benito suddenly realized that he had in fact seen the house across there before it was dilapidatedlooking with a smashed door that was now boarded over the last time hed been there thered been a guard on it to keep away the curious from the house of the black magician aldo morando hed been there to look at the frauds cellar it might do as a place to hide alberto needed his leg tended needed to rest the gates of the inner curtain wall were bound to be closed by now they were stuck on the outside and benito had a feeling getting in might be next to impossible even for him come we must hide better before the footmen start searching for loot alberto wincing and trying not to cry out struggled up leaning on benito god i cant leave me valdosta cant do that that gabby wife of yours told me to look after you big man come on theres a place just over there it didnt take benito long to pry away the boards sealing the doorway inside benito found the place much as he remembered it even with morando in prison people had been too superstitious after the initial curiosity to come here the trapdoor as he remembered was in the passage he hoped it wasnt too damaged to put back only when he looked in the passage the broken door wasnt there he had to get down on hands and knees to find it the knights axe had split the thin stone but someone had put it back together again and smeared dirt very carefully in the crack benito used the faithful shetland knife to lever it up someone had nailed the split wood together again also who and why the whole thing smelled of trouble but could it be worse than the hungarians he helped alberto to the stairs i can crawl said alberto through gritted teeth you close it benito did so as alberto edged his way downwards it was as dark as stygia in here there was also a bad smell nothing very strong just the trace of corruption that came from a putrefying corpse or carcass not buried deeply enough suddenly someone struck a light on the far side of the garish cellar and benito knew at last the answer to the mystery that had been plaguing maria sophia tomaselli looked a lot more like a storybook witch now her once magnificent hair was wild and tangled she wasnt wearing any clothes shed painted herself with something black now anyway some of the patterns were smeared she had a wheellock pistol she was also swaying drunkwhich was presumably why theyd made it this far she blinked owlishly at them two of you whats wrong with him benito really hadnt had time to look hed been just ahead running for the gate when alberto had gone down with a scream he knew the man had been hit in the lower leg he was in pain and bleeding i dont know ill have a look he spoke in as level a voice as he could manage sophias eyes narrowed you youre valdosta the wonderful hero she snarled that out in such a way as to make it abundantly plain that whatever he was in her opinion it was neither wonderful nor heroic i need to see to his leg said benito calmly he might as well not have spoken come over here come here or ill shoot you her voice was ugly with triumph my prayers to the devil have been answered i saw how she looked at you that scuolo puta babysit ha she stepped over to the altar and took up a knife now were going to have the true sacrifice the little giggle that followed had a halfinsane flavor to it the one that morando was too scared to do but im not afraid i promised if he let me destroy her i would give him the old sacrifice killing you will do both first im going to cut she gestured obscenely with the knife in her hand for the first time pointing the pistol at the roof and not them benito threw the shetland knife by now the oncestocky boy had the shoulders and chest of a very powerful man the blade went right through her thin chest stopping only when the hilt slammed into the flesh sophia was flung backwards onto morandos mockaltar benito already had his rapier out and was running forward but she wasnt going to vent her spite on anyone ever again from the amount of blood the shetland knife had split her heart holy mother of god lets get out of here alberto was already trying to crawl up the stairs again benito looked at the dead woman death had eased the lines of hatred fear and misery from her face stay there alberto she was crazy and now shes dead she said she prayed to the devil to destroy maria that she promised human sacrifice and look what it got the poor silly bitch dont worry alberto the best priest i know examined this place and said it was all a fake a complete fraud she was crazy and she believed in it but its nothing for us to worry about your leg and the hungarians out there are a lot more serious benito tugged at his knife struggling to free it from the bone but you did come here here of all places cleaning the knife on the piece of black velvet that morando had used for his pseudo altar cloth benito shrugged maria says this is corfu magic here happens and so do coincidences he took up the lamp and the knife and started toward alberto and then stopped his eyes caught by something to the side well ill be no wonder she could hide out here morando must have been prepared to do just that theres more water and food stashed in here than there is in the whole citadel this was a false wall benito walked over to alberto and started gently cutting the fabric away from the bloody mess a bit of bone protruded from the jagged wound benito sucked breath between his teeth i wish i was my brother i really wish he was here i think youve got a open fracture of the fibula ill have to see what the hell i can find for a splint and lets see if that woman left any of morandos wine i could use a cup myself actually even kakotrigi would do alberto managed a weak laugh kakotrigi is like this place you get used to it get to like it the hagfish had swum as close to the edge of the shingle as it dared if anyone had looked down from the walls now they would have seen the sinuous shape of it in the clear azure water fortunately the fury of the attackas seen through the eyes of the shamans hawkswas on the front wall the hungarian forces had gained a foothold inside the broken wall and men were starting to pour through the gap and up onto the walls the shaman was able to change into the other form and lope ashore shaking the water clear of its fur it ran to where the wall was pounded into steep rubble here with no defenders it gained entrance with the fleeing townspeople it ran through the inner curtainwall gates it began searching tasting the air relishing the fear hating the crowd on the slope behind corfu town giuliano lozza marshaled his men he was de facto commander of the corfiote irregular army because he had the most soldiers by far the venetian captain had had the sense to recognize an unstoppable local force and go along with it and across the island so had everyone else the story of the naked magyar having to walk back to camp in the buff spread from village to peasant to fishermen greeks loved to laugh and their sense of humor could be a bit rough this man lozza was no foreigner theyd decided this was someone who spoke their language and knew more about olives than any libri doro theyd ever met hed even married one of their own a peasant woman once theyd called him loukoumiafat little sweetmeat no one did that any more not since hed given a very pointed but nonlethal lesson in swordsmanship to one idiot who had dared put a hand on his wife we beat neither our women nor our olive trees on corfu hed said firmly and finally it was a local peasant saying too that was the final and vital detail women asked their menfolk why they hadnt joined giuliano had nearly three thousand men men with everything from old boarspears to new and recently acquired hungarian arquebuses and torches waiting like the great banks of heavy cloud that hung seemingly just off shore the rain never came the corfiotes were going to when the hungarian units had begun pulling back three days ago giuliano had known this was to be the big assault hed begun sending out word and the corfiotes had come giuliano was a master swordsman he knew he was outnumbered and that the enemy had the edge in professionalism and equipment but he also knew that it was not the strength of the swordsman that wins the day it was the timing of the stroke with the hungarians sweeping into the outer citadel now was the time for the stroke loot or the desire for it made the hungarian encampment virtually empty the artillerymen were sitting around disgruntled at not being able to join in the spree the cannon would have to be moved now all they got out of this was hard work and giuliano lozza chapter the circle is unbroken out of life comes death and out of death life maria looked at the point in the rock engraved with a circlethe symbol of the motherand surrounded by spirals so old that time was weathering them away from the middle of that circle the water of the sacred spring had flowedapparently unceasingly for millennia now as she watched a tiny drop slowly formed and dripped down to the clay basin that stood in for the cracked holy pool maria put alessia down beside the cracked pool the baby girl was too listless to go anywhere too listless to even cry maria turned with sad eyes to renate youll see her safe to katerina holy mother tears streaked the older womans face she nodded this can fix things maria if you are willing maria shrugged it is too late for me benitos dead itll be too late for alessia soon so what do i have to do drink the water of the holy pool take up the almond offer yourself as a willing bride i will do the rest maria stared up at the figure of the mother the old old figure cut out of the living rock legs like barrels fat thighs that stood for the plenty she provided the cleft of her mystery overhung with the great belly of fertility the huge domes of pendulous breasts the round ball of a head featureless except for a hint of carving that might have been hair a mouth how old was she who had carved her was there still any power in her at all maria tried to feel something from that figure all she could feel was her own despair well even if nothing happened there would be a few drops of water she went to the basin raised it to her lips and drank with the taste of sweet water still on her tongue she walked the two steps to the altar and took up the half almond her fingers touched it with a shock her hand closed involuntarily on it and she whirled to stare at the mother gathering about the shapeless form were tiny dustlike sparks only they werent dust they were sparks of golden light more and more of them with every moment outlining the figure then enshrouding it enveloping it in a blanket a haze of gold the color of corn the color of wheat the color of life a sigh eased from her she closed her eyes and let the power lead her where she needed to go the yellow dog found the cliff entrance to the templecave by nose there was only womanscent coming from it and for the first time on this accursed island also the strong heady smell of powerful magics unless the other had sent a woman he was here first the only problem was that the cave mouth was up there and the yellow dog form was not good for climbing trees he wondered briefly if he should assume his human form but decided against it that was by far the most vulnerable he hesitated by the intensity of the magics up there time was not on his side he changed into the hagfish form this body did not like the dry but it could climb like a snake he ignored the screams of people who saw the huge oilyblack monster twining its way up the graveyard poplar and oozing into the cave mouth soon it would not matter it was dusty and dry and spiked with stalagmites here so the shaman assumed the doglike form again his nose led him hastening up the narrow labyrinthine passages panting and slobbering a little yes this was what he had been sent to find to the shamans senses the entire place pulsed with power throbbing like a racing heart the masters advisor mindaug had said the master needed to be physically present to claim this the shaman wished he knew how to do so himself he ran into the temple chamber yowling in triumph ready to fight there were two humans there an old woman with long white hair unconscious and crumpled on the floor and a babydying by the smell of it he could feast later the shamans nose told him there had been three he quested for that third to rend to kill with the magical energies in this place growing around him to his eyes the place was full of sheets of green light she wasnt hereyet she had not left the shaman gave a halfvulpine halfcanine sort of shrug and began the ritual to call his masters physical presence here it was as if all solid things had become shadows maria with the almond in her hand her firm chin up and heart hammering walked down steps of light set into the shadow she could not have said how long she walked but she came at length to a great hall at the far end were two thrones a tall man stood up from the lefthand throne and walked toward her palms out on his right hand rested the other half of the almond a tall man made of shadows as the mother had been made of light shadows but not evilthe restful shadows of twilight the dark before dawn and yet she sensed there was a great deal concealed by those shadows and she willed them away greetings bride he seemed to be looking through to the inside of her he did not seem to notice that his concealment was melting until he stood before her unveiled your spirit is very beautiful he was blackhaired and grayeyed lean pale grimlooking she set her jaw just because she had agreed to this did not mean she was going into it blindly oh no all right the marriage with umberto not unlike this one had worked outbut shed known umberto hadnt she thispersonshe knew nothing at all about so before she took the last irrevocable step she had to know she would do it yes but she still had to know just exactly who are you she demanded husband she added as an afterthought it took the man aback in fact he literally stepped back a pace you are a willing bride the palevisaged man showed both surprise and a hint of doubt maria nodded feeling completely out of her depth and brusque with it yes of course i am the priestess said that without a bride the mother could only resist passively that without a bride you would not intercede look she continued in growing irritation my baby was dying my friends are dead or dying the man i loved benito valdosta is dead i was too proud to tell him that i loved him and now hes dead the whole island is dying somebody had to do something so i said i would do it i knew i had to be willing and i had to be fertile of childbearing age i didnt know i had to know all about it just like a man assuming she supposed that because things had always gone a particular way they always would go that way just proving gods could be as dense and intransient as humans im a new acolyte and somehow or other nobody got around to telling me what im supposed to be doing the priestess assumed i knew everything already i suppose and i assumed shed tell me sometime and never got around to asking i knew that to take up the almond to become the bride meant i would die but if that was what it took to get you to help i was willing you are going to help us arent you perhaps that last came out a bit aggressively butoh stupid mangod why was he just standing there as if none of this mattered to him was he going to act or not he seemed altogether startled now it is not that i did not wish to help it is just that i cannot my only connection with the mother is through her embodiments you are the embodiment of the mother the things above the earth are hers only i have no power there but i can lend my strength i always have willingly given my help to my mother maria was now more confused than shed been before i dont understand she repeated just who are you he blinked slowly i am the lord of the underworld aidoneus is the name i am sometimes given the devil he didnt seem evil just distant he shook his head in violent negation the first time hed shown any sign of emotion no shaitans realms are elsewhere and i want none of his kind of darkness he spread his hands as if in apology the spirit world is a complex place all things are possible here and none well that was certainly unhelpful it was like arguing with eneko lopez it all seems to be shadows she said doubtfully he nodded more certain this has been called shadowkeep at times and hades which is nothing like hell more often simply the realm of the dead some of the dead leave here to go on to other realms but all are here at least for a time time is meaningless to the dead of course you are not dead so you are not outside of time she wrinkled her forehead she thought the point of this was that she died this was getting more confusing by the moment so am i not dead he shook his head no only a living one can be the living embodiment of life one day you will die but you are not destined to do so for many years you will stay down here and be my wife and the mother earth will be fertile and grow because i can lend her my strength stay here and be his wife was that what all this bride business was about to be a realwife to a god or something well shed accepted dying and you could get used to anything she shook herself all over and one thing swam up out of her sea of confused thoughts alessia what was going on out there or up there or wherever there was alessiamy baby surely the lord of the dead would know if alessia was dead or if the hungarians had broken through thered be many dead including stella he looked past her his face gone indifferent again your child is lying beside the sacred pool in the temple of the great goddess there is an evil creature of darkness a cursed one sniffing at her he sounded as if it all meant nothing to him actually it probably didnt but she reacted with outrage butbut youre supposed to help renate was supposed to take her away why didnt she shes not going to kill my baby is she he looked into the middle distance he was plainly seeing things in the shadowy places the priestess lies within the portals of the underworld she has expended too much opening the way outrage was no proper word for what she felt now all the sense of betrayal all the despair all the anguish that had brought her here welled up inside her and spilled out youre supposed to help youyou cold fish youre supposed to be stopping all of this thats the bargain thats why i came here maria knew she was screaming although in this strange place it didnt seem so the sound was curiously deadened he looked at her as if she was a child to whom he had already explained the situation i need to be asked and death and life need to be joined so the circle can be complete well im asking you do something now she stamped her foot this sound too was faint and thin more like the memory of a sound for the first time a flicker of expression ran across that cold face it was hard to say what it was but his voice was somehow warmer more interested you remind me of my first wife kore was from before the humans came she brought fire and light into this place we had some terrible fights as i recall she also had a quick temper like yours he sounded nostalgic maria felt her fury rage against the flatness of the man and the place listen you ill make your life a misery for all that long life youve said id have unless you do something now about my baby about the siege about renate now her voice seemed louder somehow than it had when shed shouted earlier and edges to everything seemed sharper clearer you have a beautiful strong spirit he said with what could almost be a smile he reached toward her and she saw the hands were like benitos brothers hands long and shapely and the almond seemed to glow come join me then avatar of the great goddess join me and then i can do this something you demand she reached out her hand opening it to reveal the almond her hands were workcalloused and rough compared to his doing something is always better than doing nothing she said firmly as their hands clasped the two almond halves touched she felt them draw toward each other click the seed began to swell and then burst into growth the roots were wriggling against their clasped hands and leafy shoots came questing upwards and maria found she could see things in the strange shadows of this place people and places myriads of them its a strong tree the strongest i have seen in centuries he said his voice was definitely warmer now and somehow he seemed less inhuman let us plant it it needs light and earth and water snapped maria not shadows and i need to get on before it is too late for little lessi the place was definitely lighter then get on make earth and light and water for it his voice was deeper stronger and more powerful now and there was definitely a gleam in those gray eyes it was a test of some sort she knew and she had no idea what to do she looked into the strange shifting shadows looking for a place for it instead she saw alessia lying still and pale renate just beyond fetal and breathing so faintly you could hardly see movement in that frail chest and a great yellowfurred dogcreature it was scratching symbols with undoglike precision on the stone floor of the temple drool hung down from its jaws she searched her memory of all the things the priestess had said desperate for a clue all she could think of was renate saying calmly use your anger channel it with your will she looked around at the pale shadowy hall either she was getting used to it or it really was more substantial and more clearly defined than it had been there was a dead piece of wood there in the middle of the floor she channeled her will at that place let there be earth rich fecund earthy steaming with the scents of morning as she remembered it from the forests of istria that wonderful earth that could support a hundred thousand mighty trees growing strong and tall and straight let there be sunlight as warm as a lovers caress as golden as as the morning sun on the wings of the lion oh she remembered that too that sunlight that was so full of life you could drink it like wine light that touched hurt and left healing behind it let there be water cool and clean and refreshing as the water in the temple had been that first time shed gone to pray for umberto water oh blessed jesu let there of all things be water she felt the power answer to her will where it came from she did not know but she launched it as she had launched a thousand rocks at the enemy as she had launched herself into this voyage as she had launched alessia into life by the hotness of her anger at wrongness of all this by the love she held for all of them let them be and they were the earthsmell that had been so strange to her when she first came to the forest tickled her nose with its lush scent sunlight welled around the dead stick coming from everywhere and nowhere and there was a mist curling lush with water around the remains of the last brides tree and suddenly the hall seemed very small to contain such richness he actually laughed im grateful you left me some hall come let us plant this tree and see to your need they walked forward into the sunlight off the cold flags and onto the loamy earth using their free hands they dug a hole into it and then put the seedling into the soil the rootlets actually started reaching through their fingers and pushed hungrily into the earth it was growing growing even as they formed the soil around it it will be the finest tree i have had here in many millennia there was respect there interest too still holding her hand he turned to point earthy fingers at the shadows the yellow dog was howling there let us see what happens with the halfjackal firstthe cursed one in a way it is protected from me it cannot die in the shadows maria saw the creature now for what it was no dog one removed from the dogline a cross between gray wolf and golden jackal a howling halfdomesticated creature from the wet northern forests that could have been the father of humankinds fourfooted loyal companion could have been it had once fawned and guarded and pretended loyalty and when the man and the woman had left it to guard their most precious thing it had eaten the child the one they had trusted was cursed cursed to live until it had been forgiven for the betrayal that was now long forgotten by men but the memory and the shame were with all dogswhose ancestors were cousins to itand mans other ally the horse forever the hyena they would hunt and hurt as often as possible they could hurt it even if they couldnt kill it there was also a shadowy person in there someone who had taken the cursed creatures name the shaman had taken the form and with it the curse he thought not being able to die a good thing and cared nothing for the rest how do we deal with it the lord of the dead shrugged we protect your babe and that is all we need do for now the great goddess is dealing with it already as she does with all those who work magics here this is the place of the great goddess you know what the earth of corfu does to foreign magic the greater the magicthe faster it will draw that power the creature relies on magic for its being it would have been dead millennia ago if nature were to have run its course the magics it uses now would kill itwere it not unkillable for magical reasons the more it does the more the earth of corfu will draw that power that sustains it she understood now the goddess was absorbing anything worth having from the creature and the longer it remained the more she would take even the curse that kept it alive would be affected it was diminishing itself stillthis was that passive defense again and that was not enough surely there is something i can do she said feeling her anger welling again the god shrugged very much amused you are she and my power is yours take it up my bride and she did chapter the shaman paused as a wave of weakness came over him just a few more lines and jagiellon himself would arrive here he could rest then he started to scratch symbols again he shook himself trying to focus his tired old eyes and then it came to him he did not ever feel tired not in this body and as for the illeffects of age the curse that had been laid on the yellow wolfjackal had stopped the creature knowing those at last the shaman understood the nature of mindaugs trap and mindaugs treachery the shimmering halfmaterialized form of the master felt it too now the shaman knew why he had found the stink of magic everywhere this place was a fertility temple a mumiplace the whole damned island was that and the shaman who was old past the reckoning of most men knew that new life was a cyclic thing it needed death life and death were one big wheel the very soil here was sucking him dry rotting him away like decomposing leaves in winter to fuel new birth the more magic he used in trying to fight it the faster it was happening it was swallowing him and it would have swallowed the master because their own magic was the fuel used a trap he could sense his masters shriek and his own thoughts shrieked in answer all of ita trap laid by the traitor mindaug to supplant jagiellon working with his ally the hungarian witchcountess but chernobog had not yet fully materialized the demon could stillbarelywithdraw from the closing jaws the shaman felt him fading away leaving his servant behind behind and alone and sucked nearly dry of magic the arthritic neartoothless rheumy old wolfjackal dragged and swayed his way to the cave mouth it was a long way down and the sight of the hagfish had brought people and knights in armor and on horseback the wolfjackal didnt care even pain was better than death by the time it had dragged itself to the water hounded over the wall and attacked afresh by the croat horses it was yowling and shrieking with agony the curse assured that the wolfjackal wouldnt die although the pain was not ameliorated the magic of corfu meant that each time his body repaired itself he was closer to the real death every spell every twist of enchantment he controlled was drawing it out of him he abandoned what magics he could the shaman knew jagiellon would not help he must have suffered too and wouldnt dare use magic to help the shaman falling into the water and assuming the shape of the hagfish kept the shaman alive but did nothing for the pain and it was not the great beast it had been oh noit was a little little thing a wraith of the monster it had been struggling feebly toward the deeper water and two hawks hit the hagfish in the shallows gouging at it beak and claw in their newfreed fury had they been creatures of the earth not sky the island of corfu would have freed them long ago they were goshawks torn from their native forests forced to fly over water stranded here their fury knew no bounds but behind that fury was another who lent speed to their wings and strength to their talons and beaks and when the shaman tried to strike them knocked it back into the water yet would not let it escape the hawks savaged the hagfish with ragethe rage of goshawks protecting their young for that other told them deep in their halfmade hearts that this thingthis outragehad menaced young had eaten young they were going to avenge every young thing it had ever taken in its long long life and so they did as the other hauled it back from the depths and protected them from its evermorefeeble assaults they tore at it and tore at it until there was nothing left to tear nothing but blood slicking the water like oil and shreds of flesh and the taste of its vileness in their mouths then that other gave them some strength as their own began to fail lifted them lofted them back to the land and showed them a placeforest not like theirs but like enough and it soothed them with the promise of game to hunt and sweet water to drink and no one to disturb them ever again go build a nest raise young and prosper and so they went flapping heavily away through the hot heavy air birdwise and with the wisdom of birds letting go of their rage and forgetting the thing that had bound them except not quite keeping enough that they would never allow themselves or their young to be bound ever again maria took a deep breath and flexed her hands and the lord of the shadows now turned and pointed to a shadow that nearly made her sick there is the thing that is causing the mother much pain it was hideous anger and pain radiated out from the little fetalcreature it had wings crumpled and twisted and deformed it would never fly but the small wings beat furiously thrashing away the mere pressure of their gaze that hurt that burned it like acid it was trapped by the magical confines of this place it floated above the earth a creature without weightbut still pinioned here above corfu pinioned with chains of bloodthe nonhuman blood of its parents her first reaction had been horror now she felt simply pity its just a baby she objected of sorts yes he waitedperhaps to see what she would do not destroy itblessed jesu it didnt know what it was doing no she had toheal it help it what can i do for it its not on the earth of corfu the lord of the underworld shrugged its somewhere between death and life that puts it in both of our realms we can see it and it can see us the anger hurt and bitterness flowing from it were almost too much to bear whoever did this must be a monster said maria recognizing the unborn fetal thing for what it was elizabeth bartholdy there was a brief shadow moment of a beautiful woman plainly the twisted warped creature saw it too because it howled in frustrated rage how do we help the poor creature she cried feeling its pain deep inside herself it was a babyonly a babyforced to do what it was doing remove its bonds remove just one of the sigils in its parents blood wash them away in the shadow now she could see the spidery tracings on the rocks of a blood that had never been red with what there is no rain or water because of the poor thing if it would let it rain maria sniffed swallowed i wont cry she choked this is no time to cry she had to do something not dissolve in tears crying wouldnt help why not the shadow lord asked quietly tears will wash as well as rain it wont live you know it only survives in this sort of half existence because of the magics worked on it i wont cry because its soft to cry she paused feeling a strange stillness come over her like that blanket of understanding that had settled over her letting her understand what she needed to do a new understanding stole quietly over her in the stillness maybe it needs something soft yes the shadow lord said a hint just a hint of encouragement in his voice i dont think its ever had care or any love she thought of alessia how even so loved a baby as she had nearly driven her mother mad a time or two this isnt its fault its just a baby a baby doesnt mean to make you miserable when its hurting it just doesnt know how to do anything else and its hurting its hurting so much from what that awful woman has done to it this time it was rage that followed the words it was despair for all the children that had died because of those horrible people out there for this poor little thing that had suffered the tortures of the damned been forced into birth no baby ever asked to be born but this one had been tormented into existence and nothing would make it better except to be ushered out of life maria wept for it a mothers tears the tears fell down and into the shadow and the silvery bloodwriting boiled there was a brief moment of movement of wind and of fire and then there was a surcease of pain the rain began the clouds so long held back swept in swept over the hawks in their new forest so that they held up their heads to the falling rain and drank in the sweet water that washed away the foulness on their tongues it swept over the peasant women who set out jars and bowls to catch it it soaked into the earth that drank it with a million thirsty throats and sent it down into the streams into the unseen crevices of the rocks with the sound of life renewing at last it is in my kingdom now said her new husband i have put it where it belongs what else must we do asked maria tiredly he shrugged the mothers place has rain at last and will heal it has got its people again and they love it it is in a magical place with those that perished giving birth to it they blame it no more than you and now they can cherish it with that it will heal what about the siege ah tall already he seemed to grow taller and grimmer war is deaths kingdom mine not hers hah maria replied feeling anger giving her back her strength maybe so but im going to help chapter erik was on the battlements of the inner curtain wall organizing and trying to prevent panic most of all wishing silently that the inner walls had been built as the outer had to withstand cannon but the outer walls had been rebuilt not fifteen years back this inner wall was probably a century old the outer wall had stood up to months of pounding the inner wall would last weeks at best which was more time than they had water for anyway a cannon across on the spianada boomed they must be mad they should move them up first a second then a third cannon spoke and erik realized they were firing into the outer city into their own troops peering out to the enemy encampment on the other side of the spianada eriks jaw dropped for the first time since svanhilds death he began to laugh it was harsh sound but it was laughter nonetheless the hungarian camp was burning not as if from a little brave band in a small patch but across a wide front it must have taken thousands of men and more and more of the hungarian artillery fired into the hungarian troops in the citadel if they spiked those guns before retreating the inner citadel would last as long as its water held out erik wondered whether this was venices forces at last like the rain those had just never seemed to get here manfred came up behind him helmet under his arm and grinning like the cat that had eaten the cream von gherens was just behind well erik what do you think half of them seem to be running back to camp are we going to sortie again erik shook his head the cannonfire is doing it for us as soon as it stops a cold wet something hit him on the nose then another hit his cheek i dont believe it its raining the rain came down in a gray hissing curtain so heavy that the view of the spianada and then the section of the citadel outside the inner curtain suddenly disappeared manfred erik and von gherens stood there rain driving in their faces plastering their hair down grinning at each other come on you pair of loons said von gherens your armors getting wet behind them the citadel was echoingdespite the rainto cheers and cries of san marco erik was the last to leave the battlements he looked out at the rain but he saw her face and no one in the downpour could tell rain from tears anyway he hadnt been able to weep since that early moment in the hospital now here alone in the rain where no one could see him he could somehow it lifted a weight from his soul giuliano saw the first heavy drops splash on the dusty earth like erik he gaped but hed lived here all his life and he knew that when it rained here it rained in earnest sound the retreat he said to the young venetian with him but sir we still have some cannon to spike believe me nico they wont be using them for a while anyway look at that rain this place is going to be fetlock deep in mud soon and this rain will cover the retreat beautifully eh thalia she smiled at him eyes like stars good for the olives too she was a jewel past price the cannonball must have hit the house because even in the cellar they felt the impact of it flakes of black paint fell from the ceiling alberto looked owlishly at benito i believe ill have that second drink after all no sense in dying sober in benitos informed opinion if the next cannonball came right through into the cellar in two heartbeats time and hit alberto he still wouldnt die sober yet hed suffered benitos rough surgery stoically the wine might have helped they hadnt eaten much in the last while and a little wine went a long way air holes but no view grumbled benito passing the bottle over no wonder the woman went mad in here you ask me she was mad to start with said alberto phlegmatically once hed got over his shock the big man had rapidly reconciled himself to staying down here for a while benito hadnt hed been pacing the cellar like a caged animal for the last while being pinned down would kill him as surely as bullets or swords he decided alberto im going to have a look outside in the temple cave alessia stirred the rock beneath her moved slowly slightly readjusting from the terrible stresses that had been put on it and were now washed away the crack that split the holy pool healed water rising from a deep artesian flow began to drip slightly faster and as the rains beat down outside faster still the drops became a trickle and the trickle became a stream the clay bowl overflowed the pool filled up the healing and the magic in this place affected other things too alessia woke up she got to her knees then waving her arms for balance stood up it was no great height she took little swaying babysteps forward and fell into the pool another baby might have drowned but this child was hemmed in by certain protections she sat up wet through and screamed and screamed she wanted her mother she wanted her mother now and if her mother is not there to care for hershe just has to touch running water to call me or my kin to help so had the undine juliette stated at her christening alessia hadnt understood the words at the time of course nor would she have now but in a pinch the new babysitter would do he was big and warm and smelled nice not like mother but nice familiar benito had eased the trapdoor up very cautiously ears straining for the sounds of danger instead he heard a peculiar drumming noise he couldnt place it at first it was a long time since hed heard rain on the roof hey alberto what asked the big scuolo man warily hed bet alberto had the late sophias wheellock at the ready its raining out there not just raining bucketing it down no after all this time im going out youll get wet said alberto with a laugh yeah but so will anyone else its nearly as black as night out there ill stay here and look after the wine i cant run and youll probably need to benito realized very shortly that rain was an understatement it was as if the heavens were trying to catch up on the whole dry winter in one fell swoop even in a final assault on a beleaguered city troops would be reduced to seeking shelter in this he stalked up the narrow street seeing no one benito felt he could hardly have seen someone across the narrow street it was sheeting down so hard and then he realized he was seeing someone after all walking toward him as he turned to shrink back against a doorsill he realized this was a very strange someone the woman wasnt wearing any clothes except for a crown of water lilies and even in this light her hair was green in spite of his attempt to hide she obviously knew where he was and beckoned imperiously at him you your daughter needs you come who are you he said warily i am the crenae of the spring within the hill and your daughter wants either her mother or you our kin promised we would help if she was in need besides she is nearly shaking the holy mount with her screaming nothing we can do will comfort her er id help but youve got the wrong person i dont have any daughters the cold rain was soaking benito it didnt seem to perturb the nymph yes you do she said firmly juliette examined your blood alessia the rain was getting in his eyes shes my daughter she certainly isnt your son snapped the nymph now come we must go to the cliff on the side of the castel a mar she is in a cave there benitos mind groped at the thought of alessia as his daughter hed thoughtcaesare suddenly it all clicked into place for him the timingmarias sudden determination to marry umberto and the truth was the baby didnt look in the least bit like aldanto in fact now that he thought about it he pushed it all aside for a later time got a place i can climb the inner wall in this the gates are open the people of the city have pushed back the attackers what i must go and tell alberto your daughter needs you now she is very young and very unhappy i have left my sister with her but she is screaming the place down benito shrugged lets go then ill send someone for him on the way to the gates the rain slackened off slightly it looked to be a mere lull in between waves of heavier downpour but benito realized the venetians were making the most of it troops were marching down to the outer wall set on doing what repairs they could ordinary people were hastening to their homes and lodgings to see what the hungarians had left benito was pushing against this tide when a wethaired redeyed woman grabbed his arm benito hadnt even recognized marias friend stella without her permanent smile signor valdosta her face was a map of misery my alberto you havent seen him even dear god his body he squeezed her shoulder hes fine hes got a broken leg thats all stella simply dissolved on his shoulder clinging to him where is he ill murder him ive been so worried so unhappy i hid him now look he doesnt know whats happened out here and hes scared and has a pistol for gods sake dont get yourself shot getting to him she nodded her smile was back in fullforce ill call hell recognize my yelling at him for sure where is he you know the house that guy was using for his orgies with the case vecchie women the fake magician morando i know you went and had a look she nodded i even got a peek into the cellar where they did that stuff well we hid out in that cellar the trapdoor is closed and it has been mended its in the passage and as i said for heavens sake be careful hes armed and scared she kissed him bless you benito valdosta i will be careful she started to hurry with the tide of people he grabbed her shoulder uh stella yes she turned hes also a bit drunk ill break his other leg for him she said with cheerful savageness and youd better go and find maria shell be worried sick by now will you come on said the nymph tapping her foot impatiently benito realized as he hadnt in his preoccupation that no one else seemed to notice his strange escort well marco said that the undine juliette had done much the same thing to the audience in the church at alessias christening she led him to the cliff the hagfish had broken away part of the concealing tree and benito could see the cave i can go with waterflow you will have to climb up there the limestone was wet the handholds and footholds were tiny and rounded it didnt matter a damn to benito he kicked off his boots and began to climb reaching the cave he wondered for a moment just where to go the cave was dark but then he realized that all he had to do was follow his ears a hundred heartbeats later he was holding and comforting a small cold wet child against his wet but exertionwarm body why in hell didnt you dry her he snapped at the two nymphs we dont know much about human babies what sort of gratitude is this demanded the other crossly benito sighed look im sorry i thank both of you now i must dry her warm her up and find her mother what was she doing here youd better ask her said one nymph pointing to the curled body of renate de belmondo shes been starting to stir and with that they slipped away into water that benito would have sworn could not hold a minnow benito looked around the temple and took the finely woven cloth off the altarstone he stripped off alessias wet clothes and using the shetland knife cut the altar cloth into a sort of poncho for her cut a strip to make a nice belt he took off his own soakingwet shirt too and tossed it onto the altarstone hed be better off without it there was no food down here and lessi was undoubtedly hungry the whole of the citadel was but she could at least drink he took a tiny clay bowl from beside the altar and helped her to drink it seemed to do her a great deal of good and shed warmed up nicely against him she started settling down for sleep loved cared for and with not a worry in the world benito put her down carefully then he took a double handful of water and splashed it on renate de belmondos face he did it several more times adding more sacrilege to the large number of incidents hed already managed she moaned he tried shaking her she opened her eyes he sat her up then remembering something marco had said put her head between her knees chapter renate de belmondo had been in the service of the great goddess for nearly forty years she came to the temple almost every day the sounds here were as familiar as her husbands breathing the fountain bubbling and the sounds of the tiny waterfall cascading into the sacred pool were like the voices of old friends even in her giddy and confused state they comforted and caressed she tried to sit up the someone who had been holding her head between her legs helped her to lean back against the wall then it came to her as she tried to focus her eyes the fountain had been reduced to oozing droplets the cascade to accumulating drips falling slowly into the clay bowl instead of the rock pool she blinked and then screwed her eyes up willing them to focus the pool swam into clarity it was brimful and the glad cascade was running stronger than shed ever seen it she breathed a sigh of relief at least their troubles were over then as a very angry male face leaned into hers renate de belmondo realized that her troubles on a personal front might just be starting and being nearly seventy and the high priestess of the great goddess werent necessarily going to help what was lessi doing down here he demanded angrily and where the hell is maria it was a question she really didnt want to have to answer she struggled to focus her mind to draw on some of her powers she looked at him he was barechested and muscled like a stevedore across that chest and those shoulders when shed first met benito valdosta hed looked like a mischievous imp of a young man now he looked like some kind of dangerous wild beast men are not allowed in the mothers temple you will be curs he shook her again respect for persons or places was not with him i want maria and as for your godforsaken temple im here because you left my daughter where she could drown the nymphs from your private water supplythat youve been enjoying while the citadels people went thirstycalled me because my daughter has an undine for a godmother she put her hands to her head please dont shout you must leave now i understand why you came but the great mother goddesss temple is forbidden to men i see you have committed various sacrilegesi am sure unknowing because you are still alive but you must go and never return be assured there was no water here before the rite and the baby was in no danger now go you will leave marias child here i have sworn by the great mother that i will see that she is taken to katerina valdosta benito took a deep breath renate de belmondo saw deeper into people than most mortals if not as deeply as the undine juliette she saw the wildfire in there wildfire accepts no limitations shes my child too i always thought she was caesares baby it doesnt matter to me anyway long before i knew the undine asked me if i loved her i do she as good as told me i was the father then but i didnt understand the words were tumbling out of him in no particular order but renate was used to hearing hysterical words tumbling out of distraught women and managed to make sense of them or at least as much sense as could be made since she had no idea of who or what most of the people he was talking about were she told me it was my responsibility to look after alessia i accepted it then and i accept it now ill look after her if anyone but her mother is going to maria told me about katerina and babies kat might be better when she has her own but for now im keeping her as for you lessi was cold wet and miserable and whether you admit it or not in danger while you were supposed to be looking after her im keeping her try if you can to stop me he stepped over to pick her up reluctantly renate called on the power of the great goddess to prevent it and realized that absolutely nothing was happening benito picked up the baby and cradled her as naturally and easily as any mother the great goddess obviously feels the justice of your claim said renate reluctantly but i did promise her mother i must admit she thought you were dead where is she said benito in a calm voice that renate could feel paperthin skin over a volcano of emotion the priestess took a deep breath there was no avoiding it she has gone to be the bride of aidoneus benito gave her a flat stare that said if you thought one man and an altar cloth were sacrilegei havent even started yet im more patient than maria but not that much were in the middle of a war maria only married umberto for alessias sake and now you come with a cockandbull story about maria getting marriednowand just abandoning alessia merde im going to find her if i have to pull the citadel and every person in it apart ill start right here if i have to renate held herself in stillness and acknowledged the justice of his words if maria had known he was still aliveshe would never have gone renate had not tricked her but there it was maria went as a willing sacrifice to live in the underworld with aidoneus the lord of the dead believe me she only did this because because she believed you were dead and that her baby was dying she did this to save alessia to save the island sacrifice you killed her it was not a statement it was a deathsentence renate saw it in his eyes shes alive i did not touch her i swear by the great goddess as her high priestess he looked at her without understanding she is alive only a living bride can go to the lord of shadows she will probably live a very long time the last bride must have been nearly a hundred before she died in the body it is magic benito she has gone living into the underworld she shook her head im sorry benito there is nothing you can do about it shes alive but there is no way back benito looked at her with eyes of flame hear me priestess he spat the word out i want her back from wherever youve hidden her alive unhurt now or there wont be any priestesses or any temple ill hunt down all of you and i wont send you to any playplay lord of the dead i wont be stopped wont the baby wailed at his anger interrupting his tiradehe suddenly had to turn his attention back to the child which would have been comical except that it wasnt there was heartbreak for him he just hadnt figured it out yet there alessia its all right ill fix it you arent letting yourself understand benito valdosta renate had gathered herself by now and stood straight looking him directly in the eyes the lord of the dead is as real as your brothers lion or eneko lopezs saint hypatia his kingdom is just as real the magic that allows a living bride to serve as the channel for his power is as real as that which allows your brother to serve as channel for the lion or lopez as the channel for his angels the choice was hers to make she has gone to spend the rest of her life in the kingdom of the dead the real dead you can kill me i wont even try to resist you can kill every priestess on the island you can destroy the temples of mother of the great goddess all it would take would be enough gunpowder somehow that was starting to get through to him perhaps it was her conviction and her steadiness perhaps it was the mother reaching him past his anger you could be an inhuman monster to make emeric look pleasant she continued sternly massacre dozens of innocent women it wouldnt make any difference to maria believe me i didnt want to make this happen in fact i didnt make it happen at all it just did the priestesses and devotees have been dreading it we are a peaceful fertility cult and we have never taken an unwilling woman to be the bride but there has to be a bride an opposite for the lord of the underworld just as there has to be a male as well as a female for fertility and it has to be a fertile woman i love my husband dearly and still i would have gone rather than maria but i couldnt there was only one among us who could and did at the crucial moment she took a deep breath his anger was fading but the bleakness that was taking its place was painful to see accept it benito accept it as you have accepted your daughter no one comes back from the kingdom of aidoneus she is trapped there until her body is returned to be buried with honor in the sacred glade im very very sorry benito there is really nothing you or i can do other than accept it and honor her sacrifice there were tears in benitos eyes but his voice was rock steady you can accept it and the consequences im not going to ill keep trying to find a way if i have to study magic until the day i die he pointed an accusing finger at her she wasnt due to die you did this to her im not finished with youor this placebut i need to get alessia out of your hellhole besides i want to mourn among decent people and not with a murderess you can run if you like but it wont help you renate was a high priestess and not without pride i wont run and im just as unhappy as you are ha benito this was her choice she was a willing sacrifice alessia and i arent willing and if i cant get her back ill at least see there are no more victims i will clean up this rotten mess if it is the last thing i do he turned on his heel and walked away into the darkness toward the cavemouth holding the baby in his arms he was scarcely out of sight when the two nymphs came sinuously out of the pool it had to be that ones ladylove didnt it you humans are such fools now that benito had gone renate allowed herself the weakness of tears she was willing and she thought he was dead one of nymphs looked at her with disgust the other stamped her foot and now hes going to blow up the sacred pools dig up the glades burn the groves the great goddess has always had the power to stop that we endure one of the nymphs said dourly and who do you think the current embodiment of the great goddess is and how do you think shes going to respond to your requests for help when she sees who you want help against especially if she thinks you deceived her about him being dead i didnt know one of the nymphs rolled her eyes you could have found out though minor magic and aidoneus would have known ive been through a fractious brideperiod before but that womans lover was a fool and as ordinary as dung this one hes been on a knifeedge between good and evilor worse what hes probably going to inflict on corfu the kind of narrow intolerant good thats worse than evil even i dont see what you expect me to do nothing as usual said the one nymph cattishly renate sighed if they could only talk its its all just a terrible misunderstanding we all did it for the best well let him talk let him go and see her renate shook her head aidoneus can see out through the shadows and together they can affect all things living and dead but short of being in the land of the dead they cant see each other they cant talk so lets send him there said the one nymph tugging at a tangle in her hair renate drew herself up we dont kill the nymph clicked her tongue at her oh you dont have to be dead to go to shadowkeep thats the easy way its been done the hard way before a couple of times and by different ways but you shortlifers have probably forgotten the one nymph turned to the other cocking her head what do you think sister acheroussia the first nodded if the limnaiad there is willing renate sighed again well let me at least make sure the rituals of spring still happen this year very well well ask valdosta if he wants to visit the lord of the dead and make arrangements with she of lake acheroussia chapter its my opinion said benito stiffly that even the paulines are too lenient with witchcraft and magic its time they were both eliminated im sorry you dont see things my way eneko but im not going to let that stop me the church believes we will achieve more by a degree of tolerance benito tolerance is well and fine eneko lopez but tolerance doesnt mean making doormats of ourselves the price of our tolerance is that they practice their religion within the constraints of our law and our society if they step outside itand if human sacrifice isnt stepping outside it then the church law and society need a wakeupim not going to sit back and turn a blind eye even if you are eneko lopez shook his head i think youre allowing personal unhappiness to affect your judgement benito this is not exactly human sacrifice of course the church frowns on it benito stood up you can continue to dance around this eneko im not going to he walked out down toward the sea part of him longed to simply fling himself off the walls and down into it to make an end of sorts but well there was alessia she depended on him and right now he depended on her and there was work to be done as he was passing a street fountain now gurgling with waterthe citadel had water if not foodhe heard someone call he turned to see the crenae nymph hed followed to alessias rescue beckoning to him valdosta alessia is she all right there are lesswellguarded crown jewels sniffed the nymph sarcastically anyway youre worrying about nothing the priestess wouldnt hurt a child not even for her own lifes sake a matter of opinion said benito angrily not really said the nymph we see deeper into the spiritual side of you humans than you can and our sister juliette would not allow harm to come to alessia since her mother sacrificed herself for the island we of nonhuman kind feel repayment to her child is the great goddesss justice good now if youll excuse me i have a poplar tree to fell the first part of my justice the nymph plainly realized just which tree he was speaking about she winced retribution wont help benito and you will hurt many of those who are trying to help the child our kind depend on the protection of the mother goddess maria is the living embodiment of that goddess benito shrugged thats what you say as far as i can work out de belmondo at best helped maria kill herself deprived alessia of her mother and me of my anchor i dont look on what i am going to do as revenge id call it prevention of this ever happening again as for the nonhumans youre longlived dont tell me this hasnt happened before dont tell me it was always a case of siege and starvation you let probably miserable women do this time and again leaving broken hearts and spirits in their wakefor your benefit you were content to benefit from their misery you just let it pass you had your chance to do something you didnt now you must suffer the consequences the crenaenymph wilted back somewhat from the sheer force of his bitterness there was some justice in what he said most of aidoneus brides had gone to him deeply unhappy if we arranged it so that you could speak to maria you could see that we and the priestess spoke the simple truth would that be acceptable to you she isnt dead benito valdosta just beyond the reach of mortals creating life and light into the shadow world so that it may be reborn into ours benito shook his head i only look stupid nymph im not gullible you nonhumans are masters of illusions id want to see touch and be sure this was maria before i trusted and then id bring her home the nymph bit her lip you could try shelike youdoesnt belong in the kingdom of the dead aidoneus can do nothing to stop you she is there by her choice and while glamour may work on other peoplewe know it doesnt work on you you can see us probably because you choose to be seen the honest truth is that i dont trust you i certainly dont trust that priestess of yours and i dont trust this great goddess cult show me and i might change my mind its not likely though the nymph nodded very well well arrange it you will need to take a boat to the acheron and then go to acheroussia the lake of lamentation you tell me where and when and ill be there said benito ill have to break out of here and ill have to take a bit of care about that ive got responsibilities now the nymph lifted a shoulder then why dont you wait the venetian fleet is coming tomorrow and with it your brother the mage marco you can give alessia into his care very well im going to go and read up on this acheroussia and this aidoneus i never saw the sense in booklearning before im beginning to understand its purpose your tree and your temples have a respite but it is a temporary one and im going to take steps to see that just killing me wont get your lot off the hook his expression left no doubt about the reality of that threat in shrines across the island women enacted the rites of spring danced the star dances to the sound of the reedpipes and this year the embodiment of the great goddess she who is fertility and new life responded with a vigor not seen for many a century renate had the satisfaction of knowing that the new avatar was the strongest for many years the women who had gone as willing brides werent usually of the caliber of maria she also knew that maria had brought a dark cloud to rest over the old religions centuries of invulnerability from time immemorial the great goddesss place had been something immovable in the face of changing times now it met a force that would not be stopped i told you i would help maria said stubbornly but with no little pride he laughed she was a little startled she hadnt expected a laugh out of him so you did he said soyou whose magic is of the earth and lifewhat is it that you think you can do in war maria paused and thought and remembered a certain legend shed heard sung by a troubadour at kats weddingfeast the man had run out of love songs and in desperation was trotting out some wildly inappropriate ballads this one was about saint joseph of arimathea and his staff and a thorntree ill show you she said taking a deep breath and gathering in her power she began on land for everywhere in emerics camp there was wood tentpoles wagonwheels guncarriages where the blessed rain fell on them she reached with her power woke up the wood and reminded it that it had been alive once and growing she passed over the land with her power and his stretched out in a great shadow behind her and where her shadow fell whatever could grow did whatever had once grown grew again on the plains of desolation a carpet of flowers grew and trees many of them growing out of what had been emerics weapons of war which he would not be moving again any time soon if at allfor out of life comes death and his mighty cannons were not faring well at all beneath her rains now she turned her attention toward the siege on the water true water was not her province but eventually all ships come to landor have earth aboard them in the form of ballast and where earth was so was she beside her the lord of shadows laughed and laughed and laughed emeric looked at the stream of muddy water creeping into his ornate gilded pavilion and swore it had been raining now for five days sometimes it had slacked off to a drizzle but mostly it had just poured the homunculus elizabeth had provided had plainly been destroyed emeric had to regard any magician who could do that with respect the resultant rain was making the siege into a disaster the spianada was a quagmire the accursed venetians used the chaos ensuing when the hungarian cannon were turned on emerics own men and the burning of the camp by raiders to retake the outer curtain wall they probably couldnt hold it if the rain let up but the rain was altering everything the rain had flooded the mine it had also flooded the gap between the moles washing one away and making the other unstable emeric had insufficient tents for his men after the fire and the mosquitoes had used the rain as a time to catch up on a winters worth of breeding the nightair hummed with them emeric could only hope the venetians in the citadel and the insurgents in the mountains were suffering just as much but apparently the sea breezes gave the citadel some relief and the higher places were never as bad what was truly worrying were the reports of disease starting to break out in the crowded quarters it appeared to be some sort of cyclic fever what the locals called malaria it was apparently something theyd mostly lived through as children emerics troops largely came from areas where it didnt occur without that childhood immunity the soldiers who caught it often died a rider came galloping up through the rain sire the venetian and imperial troops have landed in sidari we think at least twenty thousand men emeric closed his eyes call the admiral he is coming up the hill sire emeric and the admiral looked at the hulls of the galleys they wouldnt be sailing anywhere in those vessels the dead wood had started to sprout sprout that was too mild a word for what was happening it was growing before his very eyes roots were creeping down toward the earth shoots were edging out of the twisting wood toward where the sun would be if it stopped raining if they were touching the shore this is what happened even if they werent touching the shore this is happening in the holds where the ballast is with the fireboat attack and then this the admiral shrugged i dont have a fleet any more the galliots have almost all been pulled up and wont be sailing again unless you want to start building from scratch that is the timber is turning back into woodland its plainly magical emeric snarled in frustration it is magic very powerful magic he sighed very well we need to start ferrying my troops across to our camp over on the illyrian shore he already knew what would be happening to the wooden wheels of the guncarriages emeric saw defeat looming it was time to snatch what he could and run maria was learning how the shadows of this place intersected and related they shifted and moved in something like a great complex dance but she had as yet to find exactly how the steps went or hear the music they moved to she found she could see into places distant and remote if not quite as aidoneus didat willat least with increasing clarity some of them led into this place too it was vast beyond all imagining here she could walk into the shadows walk among the deadeven talk to them the intensity which theyd had in life was gone and now they gave her great deference as the lady of the living and bride of the king she discovered she could find people just by desiring to do so they were considerably less frightening than shed thought they would be and somehow no matter where she was the almond tree remained in sight shed expected to find umberto or eriks svanhild but not here the lord of the dead said divining her thought before she could speak it not now they came here and passed on to their own place your christians all merely pass on and the followers of allah and of other gods only those who believe that death will bring them here to me remain with me every man goes to his own afterlife according to his beliefs and every man sees me as his beliefs dictate he looked over his kingdom musing a little smile on his lips you would be surprised to hear what your christians see me as that made her blink saint peter she hazarded sometimes sometimes and he would say nothing more than that time down here seemed to have little meaning but maria found there was one person she had not been able to find she supposed aidoneus might be keeping benito aside she was at first embarrassed to ask he was dead and shed made her choices but she wished she could just tell him she asked instead for help in choosing the right shadow to see alessia aidoneus would be a patient lover she thoughtif he was going to be a lover at all in that sense he seemed to have infinite time to attend to her to talk to her to listen he was she decided much like umberto in some waysexcept that he allowed her space too but now aidoneus took her hand again and directed her eyes into a pattern of shadows she could see alessia as if she was leaning over her crib but the place was unfamiliar it was very grand it must be renates apartments she tried to move her view outwards to see the priestess wishing she could thank her for her care something resisted that change in focus maria tried again the resistance held firm but she recognized the person behind it now aidoneus she let go his hand still staring into the shadow it blurred becoming one with a myriad of other shadows she squinted at it wrinkling her forehead in effort it was like staring into the brightness of reflected sunlight on the water but she saw now saw through it saw benito pick his daughter up and hold her she turned away after staring for a long long time she turned to aidoneus you knew he nodded i number the living and the dead i know each by their inner flames each and every one is different i know the when of their passing if not the other details that the fates weave sometimes there is doubt a place where the thread is thin that ones thread is like a cable from a high vantage point iskander beg watched the lord of the mountains was waiting very few of the invaders would return to hungary jagiellon had known before he arrived in count mindaugs chambers that the treacherous advisor had fled still there were ways of extracting information even from walls if one were as powerful as the grand duke was mindaug had plainly planned it well every volume of his precious library was gone too jagiellon set about the magics that would let him know where mindaug had gone eventually a face appeared in the bloodfilled bowl a very beautiful womans face elizabeth bartholdy so much was now clear to the demon who lurked within jagiellon the grand duke of lithuania had a new enemy it seemed not new exactly for hed always known that the hungarian sorceress was hostile but he hadnt realized till now that she was such an active opponent a player herself in the great contest it seemedand a major one her motive was clear also and it was not the normal drive for conquest elizabeth bartholdy was in her own way more interested in the spirit than the flesh she thought to tap the power of the one whom not even chernobog would name without paying the inescapable price and might even have grown powerful enough to have done so had she succeeded in trapping him bathing in the blood of virgins prolonged her life bathing in the blood of chernobog would have prolonged it for a very long time if not perhaps eternally grand duke jagiellon ordered servants to sterilize mindaugs quarters clean away every trace of the traitor then when they were done ordered his soldiery to sterilize the rooms still further smearing the walls with the blood and brains and entrails of the servants then when that was done he ordered that wing of the palace burnt to the ground the bonfire produced a memorable stench the flames despite the feverish efforts of the soldiers singed some other portions of the palace also but jagiellon was indifferent a few charred timbers here and there were a small price to pay for power he need no longer fear that mindaug might have left some magical links behind jagiellons fury had ebbed by then in any event there was always this to look forward to the skin of the beautiful hungarian sorceress would make a memorable meal someday in the future with mindaugs as the appetizer the triumphal fleet sailed into the anchorage off the citadel of corfu led by three light galleys and a number of fishing vessels it was a small gesture but a significant one amid the cheering marco was one of the first ashore looking for benito among the emaciated defenders he found him with a baby on his knee ah godfather said benito with a tired smile the man i need here have her er stella here will help you with practical details like feeding and cleaning said benito putting a hand on her shoulder as for entertainment brother youre on your own she sleeps a lot luckily for you and she likes to dance even my dancing although she probably wont by the time i get back but where are you going what happened to maria benito im going to try and bring her back from the kingdom of the dead marco grabbed benito as he began to turn maria was my friend too nito now tell me exactly what youre planning to do and what has happened marco was unprepared for the tears streaming down benitos face chapter im going to hades said benito grimly hades apparently where this cult sent maria to you mean hell they say it isnt the same at all just the kingdom of the dead except that she is alive in it i want to bring her home are they telling you the truth manfred asked doubtfully benito shrugged its a chance ill take ill try anything the nymphs seem quite earnest about it the entry is on the greek mainland the byzantines are nominally at least in control but i can get a fishing boat to take me across without causing any upset i reckon i will accompany you erik said firmly for two reasons benito one is that youve come with me and been my spear carrier and borne me away on my shield when i needed that the other is that i also lost someone precious i would give anything to see her again anything at all benito took a deep breath i dont know erik i dont know if theyll allow it and even if you do find svanhild she is dead my friend maria is somehow alive down there they tricked her into this im going to get her back if i can erik smiled sadly and put a hand on benitos shoulder i know this but you must understand even if the chances are tiny we must take them even if i can only speak to her i will accept that the loser must accept what terms he can get and svan there were so many things i still wanted to say manfred lumbered to his feet well i have to tell you this this time youre noteither of yougoing off on this without me i cannot permit it it is too risky said erik automatically manfred squeezed his shoulder erik you are my bodyguard and my friend but the dangers of the halls of the dead dont relate to the body the dead dont touch the body they cant what they can damage and destroy is the mind and the heart to be honest with you your mind and heart are a lot more fragile than mine you dont have a mind to damage above your belt said erik grumpily a spark of his old self asserting itself but i cannot take that chance im not actually giving you the choice erik said manfred with simple finality benito realized then just what power rested in the house of hohenstaffen the emperor ruled millions in the holy roman empire but it wasnt just because of being in line to the throne that manfred could speak so erik had always seemed to order manfred around for his own safety and good of course but when he wanted to exercise it ultimate authority rested with manfred it always would well have to do this quietly said manfred or ill have to go through this pointless argument with everyone organize it benito the acheron you want the nekromantio arheas efiras asked spiro dont do it beni he said for once in earnest thats a bad lot of fakes that they prey on the fact that if youve lost someoneyoure miserable easy victim theyre parasites bloodsucking ticks once someones time comes theyre gone he put a hand on benitos shoulder come and have a drink with me and talk it out im buying this time benito was touched spiros ability not to pay for wine was as legendary as the fact that he would never be serious now he offered to do both thanks spiro not this time and im not going to the nekromantio maria was taken before her time i have talked to the nonhuman waterfolk they say there is a way that i could go on a lake called acheroussia and neither you nor anyone else can stop me apparently if it isnt my time the lord of the place cant touch me of course he might not help either well well take you land you quietly the truth is the byzantine officials arent locals and the locals arent about to tell them about a fishing boat from corfu a venetian galley would be another matter benito nodded knowingly exactly what i thought so can i hire a passage over spiro nodded taki will say yes chapter manfred spent the trip overpolishing his armor polishing it to a mirrorgloss manfred was methodical about weapons and armor without the fanaticism that characterized some knights this was excessive and unlike him finally erik asked why he was doing it cleanliness is next to godliness and where were supposed to be going to i thought i could use a bit of help erik snorted in your case i think it is futile my nurse used to tell me about the gray hosts when i was a gossoon said manfred bright steel was supposed to banish em i thought it might be useful from the hilltop they could see the lake its dark waters were long and narrow and a patch of cold mist clung to the middle but it looked depressingly like a very ordinary lake they walked down to the edge where the limnaiad awaited them with a bag of old old coins she pointed at a seemingly ordinary boat rowing toward them charon you will need the obols for the ferryman dont expect the other side to be anything you recognize erik shrugged i can see the other side from here it looks very much the same as this side there is more than one other side to the acheroussia said the limnaiad in a cool voice youll see benito opened the bag and counted the coins three is not enough he said sternly i want eight the limnaiad pouted they said you wouldnt know the more foolish them whoever they were the crenae i wonder how well they do in dry fountains i saw some ways of draining this lake on the way here dont pay the ferryman until you get right across said the limnaiad hastily the beach of black sand seemed to stretch to the far horizons the only mark on it was the keel of the ferrymans boat and looking back they could only see mist you wont need the rest of that grumbled the ferryman as benito put the purse away return fare the ferryman snorted ive never had one wed still hate to get back here and find you werent going to take us because of it said manfred cheerfully they walked onward in toward the gray gloom of the interior of deaths country the way ahead was funneled by tall glassy black cliffs and then they came to an end point a place where only three trails led on one steep rocky and draggled with straggly thorns and seeming to peter out a few hundred yards on the second wide and well cobbled went on into the middle distance the third seemed to lead off into a valley winding up toward the clifftop where now asked benito looking at the three trails erik took one look the narrow one the hardest one mortals are not supposed to pass it would be said manfred with a groan climbing a steep path in armor was pure misery upward and ever upward the trail wound eventually they came out at a misty gray plain do we have any idea where were going next asked manfred to look for the dead i suppose said benito were already among them said erik slowly benito realized that the gray mist around them was full of shifting forms almost seen out of the corner of his eye he could see faces he could also see the expression of eagerness on eriks face benito took out a small crock sealed with wax from the bag hed carried with him he opened it and poured the contents into a dish whats that colyva taki insisted i bring it he said it feeds the souls of the dead and theyd be more likely to leave us in peace taki had had no trouble in believing they were coming to visit the dead the captain had stayed sober the whole trip and benito had seen him crossing himself and fingering an amulet repeatedly what is it manfred looked curious and hungry enough to steal morsels off the plate set for the dead wheat pine nuts almonds and raisins and pomegranate seeds i had the merry devil getting hold of those all soaked together in honey each part of it has some significance but taki was pretty vague about it its as old as greece he said if the dead dont want it i could use it grumbled manfred but the dead did kin came first and then friends erik looked for svanhild but she wasnt there he peered forward into the distance manfred looked oddly at his friend erik you remember you said youd never leave her erik nodded my vow i wish i wish i had not broken it i will doubtless go to the place of oathbreakers manfred shook his head no he said solemnly you wont she promised the same didnt she i think so in her dying breath manfred took a deep breath i think youve been looking in the wrong place i dont think shed come here this place is for the people that believe in it shes gone somewhere else and shes waiting for you but i think he added warningly that if you try to get there too soon shes going to have some sharp words for you the lord of the dead has sent me to fetch you into his presence said one of the shades but only you may come into the presence of the living embodiment of the great goddess she wishes to see you and aidoneus cannot refuse her i want to see her too but what about manfred and erik they must remain here no harm will come to them no harm can benito walked through shadows at length he came to a great hall in the middle of it in a patch of sunlight stood an almond tree in full blossom and standing in front of it were two people not the insubstantial shadepeople of this place but real people one of them was maria benito gave a glad cry and would have run forward seeing her there but something stopped him i can put unimaginable distances between us should you even take one step further forward said the sternfaced man at her side the avatar of the mother the great goddess she who is the earth of corcyra wants to speak with you speech i will permit nothing more ive come to fetch her she doesnt belong here in this prison the lord of the dead shook his head she came willingly she has to honor her bargain did you maria asked benito calmly she nodded i thought you were dead benito alessia was dying i thought i could save her and the island benito grinned you told me i wasnt allowed to die without your permission you think id dare disobey seriously maria they tricked you into this on false pretenses thats no bargain a bargain takes honor on both sides lord of the dead maria turned to aidoneus you knew he wasnt dead aidoneus nodded reluctantly yes i told you i number the living and the dead i can see the ends of the threads of destiny i can see his end and i can see yours yours is far further than earthly time would allow you must be remaining here in the underworld our time passes differently and does not wear out the flesh as fast marias eyes narrowed but when you asked if i was a willing bride i told you that was why because benito was dead you deceived me you cheated aidoneus was silent for a long time finally he spoke yes i do cheat but only by allowing people to cheat themselves i wanted you your spirit is bright and strong many of the brides who have come were barely able to sustain themselves never mind sun and light and flourishing life the compact is for a willing bride said maria you told me that you asked me if i was willing twice you knew that you were deceiving me thats why you tried to stop me seeing benito in the shadows the lord of the dead held up a hand you gave me three reasons for being willing aidoneus pointed to benito he was dead your baby was dying and the siege was killing your friends benitos eyes narrowed you know that maria is destined to live for many years just exactly when is alessias time it is some time into the future said aidoneus calmly i may not tell mortals the exact time or place of their dying i also may not lie so you cheated a second time accused benito aidoneus nodded but the third reason would have been true the weave of fates was altered by her coming here so does one third of a compact make it valid maria pursed her lips then rubbed her square chin i dont cheat benito it makes it one third valid because i was willing for that reason benito sighed agreed but that still makes you mine for one third lessis for another doesnt that outweigh the other maria sat silent for a while she looked from benito to aidoneus biting her lip benito youve just come all the way to the kingdom of the dead for me no one else could do something like that but fair is fair one third of my life is aidoneus heand corfuneed me the lord of the dead looked at her with eyes of longing and sadness ill accept that he said quietly i did cheat but i also gave fair return maria nodded you did but can you accept it benito he started to reply immediately always the quickwitted one benito was but thenperhaps for the first time in his lifestopped to think first really think he thought for quite some time in the end it was the quietly sad longing face of aidoneus that gave benito his decisionand perhaps most important allowed him to accept it calmly for all that the two didnt look at all similar there was something about aidoneus that reminded benito of umberto verrier lonely men in middle ageinsofar as that term could be applied to someone like aidoneuswho always did their duty including when the need arose sheltering and caring for a woman that a younger and more flamboyant man had not been able to do or willing to do benito still felt that he was responsible for umbertos death that aching guilt had never left him until now when he made his decision the first truly adult decision he thought hed ever made in his life yes i can accept it benito shrugged id be a damned liar to say i liked it maria but i thought id lost you forever and completely two thirds is a sight better than none at all i see aidoneus point id take one third if that was what i could get how about eight months with me and four down here aidoneus actually looked nonplussed i thought youd refuse very well i accept also maria will spend the four months of winter with me the rest of the year with you maria looked at him with a curious expression youve grown benito im still not sure if i want a maneven for eight months of the yearwho doesnt know if hes a wolf or a fox im neither maria im me and im yours if you want me ill have you under any terms take me or leave me maria bit her lip again then nodded i think i prefer benito to wolves or foxes aidoneus sighed very well a bargain is a bargain but this is my kingdom there is a last clause to our agreement go back to your friends now maria can follow you out but if you look back before you reach the far shore you have lost her forever aidoneus voice was full of grim certainty benito looked at maria its a deal but how do i know if maria is following us out you can turn and have a look said aidoneus with a raised eyebrow or believe she cannot make any sounds out there away from the tree youre cheating again of course aidoneus smiled wryly yes benito shrugged my companions cant turn either i suppose it doesnt mean as much to them as it does to you it is possible for them but no they cant turn either benito took a deep breath youre on what happened demanded manfred she doesnt belong here and he cheated to get heron two of three counts but he did keep his side of the bargain on that third count so maria will spend four months of the year here she can come out now following usbut only if i dont look back to see if she is following not until i get out on the further shore and you two cant turn around either thats impossible said manfred benito shrugged its the terms ive got its better than no terms at all but i have one request manfred what walk in front of me if i walk behind you i can try and stop you turning benito shook his head manfred you said you owed me for bringing erik back that i could ask for anything well this is what i ask they marched and marched even the final black beach sands seemed endless the ferryman held out his hand pay me benito snorted youll get our fares on the other side show me the money holding the ancient coins firmly benito held up four obols isnt that one too many play fair said benito boredly and sat down he did not even twitch his head the sunlight on his face was the sweetest thing manfred had ever felt the boat slid into the shallows and benito still not turning around held out the four obols can i keep the change asked the ferryman grimly play fair said benito climbing onto the beach without so much as a glance both feet firmly on the beach he turned and took maria into his arms out of charons ferry he kissed his love slowly and long her lips were warm as was her body pressed against his they stood like that for a very long time manfred leaned back against takis bulkhead and grinned at benito and maria i take my hat off to you benito id have looked id have had to benito grinned i didnt need to look youve got faith said erik seriously actually erik what i had was manfred walking ahead of me youve got wellpolished armor prince manfred laughed until the ship shook the foxs grandson all right maria stuck her tongue out at him no hes just benito my benito benito smiled at maria lovingly i could see you the whole time maria dearest all the way i wished i could have told you not to look so worried he cheated i never said i wouldnt for you i would do anything epilogue spring ad now that the relief effort was fully underway the citadel was allowed a day of celebration of feasting of laughter the feast was of course entirely brought from the ships it was not very good food but there was enough governor de belmondo is retiring as soon as venice sends a replacement said marco the doctors have told the old man to quit or die in harness soon the siege took a toll on him and hes nearing eighty but hell stay on in corfu he has a small estate in the south benito snorted him i can deal with but his wife id prefer to see back in venice if not vinland maria pinched his arm youre not being fair benito ive told you benitos expression hardened slightly ive heard you im never going to entirely agree with you but i agreed to let it be youre impossible benito valdosta said maria it was plain that thered still be some stormy exchanges on this one but marco noticed she still held his hand firmly so who will they send to govern us asked alberto plainly keen to move the subject away from this area marco laughed hes come to talk to you o new head of the little arsenal i was in magical communication with venice from the ships this morning benito has been nominated to be interim deputy governor by the senate and to repair the war ravages here the senate has voted a budget allocation of half a million ducats deputy governor benito gaped me are they crazy marco shrugged the senate was adamant apparently for the moment given de belmondos age they mostly want someone whom they trust to keep corfu venetianand despite your hairraising reputation in some other respects you now have a rather towering reputation as venices maninapinch benito was still gaping marco smiled and patted him on the shoulder dont worry benito its just temporary until the senate can finish wrangling over who they want as a permanent governor to replace de belmondo if it makes you feel any better petro told the senate they were out of their minds he proposed you for temporary captaingeneral instead but the military types had fits over that idea that brought a grin to benitos face and well they might im never going to be their favorite in peacetime but ive got the perfect candidate for the job giuliano lozza now that the supply distribution is well in hand said manfred well be heading onward to jerusalem a part of the fleet is going east to canea therell be other vessels there and we can go on to ascalon manfred looked sad ive a need to do some praying for my uncle who may well not live much longer and the business of politics goes on so well be loving you and leaving you benito valdosta unless youd like to come along ive always a space for you in my company benito felt the earnestness behind those lightly spoken words he thought back command and siege had made manfred grow he was no longer likely to challenge eriks watchkeeping ability id enjoy it but i think venice and maria would prefer me to stay put awhile ill be here when you come back they also wanted me on the fleet that is set to deal with the aragonese barbary corsairs and the genovese too strange to be wantedand not just by the schiopettieri for a change everyone laughed benito i have to agree with maria you were born to be hanged said francesca erik squeezed benitos shoulder i really dont feel partylike yet ill be back to collect bjarni and the other vinlandersexcept kari who insisted on coming with usand to collect what remains of svanhilds things honor demands i must return them to her kin in vinland youll take care of them for me benito nodded theyre managing to feed bjarni at least erik if he comes out of it ill take care of him erik mustered a smile i couldnt think of a better caretaker benito assumed a look of injured virtue im respectable these days id be a married man if the church would agree i think the authorities are mistaken in that still i think i have learned those who are truly joined neither mans laws nor god nor death really put asunder words and rituals dont really seem to mean that much are you entirely mad demanded giuliano looking at benito as if he had offered him a lifetime in purgatory instead of the highest military position on the island who would look after my olives no thalia and i he put a possessive arm around her are going to grow good eating kalamatas not little lineoleas ive got a new vineyard in the planning too i could have told you that he wouldnt do it said eberhard quietly when giuliano had walked away cincinnatus what youd benefit from some history lessons young benito said francesca giuliano lozza could be a great condottiere if he wanted to he doesnt all he wants is a few acres of olive trees some vines and a wife to make plump with his spoiling give him a pack of noisy children too and hed be happier than any king there are some people who just dont want power or adulation or even too much money benito laughed you know why no because it is his for the asking so if i cant have giuliano who do we make captaingeneral leopoldo will do for now while he recovers but hes good and ambitious venice will move him on for sure youre all off to the holy land so who am i left with you can always do double duty while you look for someone else and why dont you make thalia the minister of agricultural reform youd get giuliano that way and if the island really needs himgiuliano will be there that should give the surviving libri doro the hissyfits said benito with a look of pleasure when they discover what youre planning on doing about tenant farms said manfred cheerfully you might just need lozza benito grinned evilly no well do it slowly its like cooking lobsters if you start with cold water then they dont flap and snap like they do when you try to drop them into boiling water but the system as it stands is a recipe for insurrection as we saw during the siege said eberhard but you may find that loosening the bonds will lose venice this island benito shrugged the system as it is will definitely lose it i plan to work on ties of trade and blood instead youll make a good deputy governor said manfred with a chuckle keep the taverns in trade anyway for four months of the year said maria sternly benito looked at her there was a sadness in his eyes but acceptance also he put an arm around her its not every husbandin all but name anywaywho gets a fourmonth holiday spiro came up with a venetian glass of tawny liquid in hand here you are beni kakotrigi youd better get used to it if youre going to be our governor thats your third said maria taking it herself benito shook his head i should have said it is not every man who needs a fourmonth holiday ow i was only joking maria youll get lessi wet if you pour it over me maria looked sternly at him i have walked among the dead and asked them secrets hidden from ordinary mortals benito valdosta and among them i found out your weakness tonight i am going to tickle you the last part was said with a maria smile full of promise full of loving an older maria confident at last of herself of being loved enough of being someone who no longer felt insecure about her station about being a canaler with a case vecchie man she had something now that made her realize just how irrelevant these things were maria pointed a finger at spiro you fetch us two more glasses of thisthis kakotrigi i didnt like it much at first sip but im finding it better and better it grows on you said benito putting his arm around
