of the tests weve passed or the ones weve failed monday milo s call punctuated a hard gray november day that had finally erupted into rain he said turn on your tv i glanced at my desk clock just after twoforty pm talk show time the cathode freak display what nuns who murder or pets with esp just turn it on alex his voice was hard what channel take your pick i flicked the remote the sound came on before the picture sobs and whimpers then faces small faces lots of them eyes wide with bafflement and terror fragile bodies blanketed and huddled together on the floor of a large room gleaming hardwood floors and chalkwhite goal lines a gym the camera moved in on a little blackhaired girl in a puffsleeved white dress as she accepted a plastic cup of something red her hands shook the beverage sloshed a false bloodstain spread on white cotton the camera lingered feasting on the image the little girl burst into tears a chubby boy five or six cried the boy next to him was older maybe eight staring straight ahead and biting his lip straining for macho more faces a sea of faces i became aware of a mellowvoiced commentary calculated sound bites alternating with strategic pauses sucked into the visuals i let the words pass right through me camerashift to rainslick asphalt acres of it squat fleshcolored buildings spattered calominepink where the rain had penetrated the stucco the voiceover droned on and the camera got manic a flurry of visual slices so brief they bordered on the subliminal flakjacketed baseballbatted swat cops crouched on rooftops poised in doorways and muttering into handheld radios yellow crimescene tape assault rifles the glint of telescopic scopes bullhorns a cluster of grim men in dark suits conferring behind a barrier of squad cars police vans pulling away policemen packing and leaving then a sudden wide pan to something in a black zipbag being carted away through the rain the owner of the mellow voice came on screen sandyhaired gq type in a burberry trenchcoat and electricblue crunchknotted tie the coat was soaked but his hair spray was holding up he said information is still trickling in but as far as we can tell only one suspect was involved and that individual has been killed here we see the body being taken away but no identity has been released zoom in on black bag wet and glossy as sealskin stoic morgue techs who might have been taking out the garbage the bag was hoisted up and into one of the vans slam of door closeup of the reporter squinting into the downpour playing intrepid war correspondent recapping then nathan hale elementary school in the west side community of ocean heights was the scene of a sniping that took place approximately forty minutes ago no deaths or injuries are reported except for that of the sniper who is reported dead and remains unidentified the exact circumstances of the death are still unknown previous rumors of a hostage situation have turned out to be false however the fact that state assemblyman samuel massengil and city councilman gordon latch were at the school at the time of the shooting has fueled reports that an assassination attempt may have been involved latch and massengil have been on opposite sides of a controversy concerning the busing of innercity children to underpopulated schools on the west side and had planned a televised debate though at present there is no indication if the shooting was related to okay said milo youve got the picture as he spoke i spotted him standing behind the open door of one of the squad cars one hand over his ear the radio speaker pressed to his mouth a background figure too far away to make out his features but his bulky figure and the plaid sport coat were giveaways alex he said and i watched him scratch his head on screen a weird juxtaposition phoneavision it faded as the camera swung back to the wet empty schoolyard a second of blank screen station identification a promise of resumption of our regular programming followed by a commercial for weightloss surgery i switched off the tv alex you still there still here all these kids its a real mess we could use you ill give you directions use my name with the uniform at the command post ocean heights isnt far from your neck of the woods you should be able to make it in what fifteen twenty minutes something like that okay then all these kids if anythings got your name on it this one does okay i hung up and went to get my umbrella ocean heights adheres to the west end of pacific palisades awkward as a pimple on a cover girls chin conceived by an aerospace corporation as a housing tract for the hordes of engineers and technicians imported to southern california during the postsputnik boom the district was created by bulldozing lime groves landfilling canyons and performing radical surgery on a few mountaintops what emerged was a slice of disneyana a planned community of flat wide magnolialined streets perfect square sod lawns singlestory ranch houses on quarteracre lots and smallprint deed covenants prohibiting architectural and landscaping deviance the corporation is long gone vanquished by poor management had it leased the houses instead of selling them it might still be in business because la landgrab mania has pushed ocean heights prices into the high sixfigure mark and the tract has emerged as an uppermiddleclass refuge for those craving salt air seasoned with norman rockwell ocean heights disapproves of the untrimmed septictankandhomegrowndope ambience of neighboring topanga glares down like a dowager aunt upon the beachblanket licentiousness of malibu but the view from the bluffs is often hazy fog like complacency seems to settle in and stay milo s directions were precise and even in the rain the drive went quickly a spurt down sunset a turn onto a side street id never noticed before three miles along a glassy canyon road that had a reputation for eating joyriders a year of drought had ended with a weeks worth of unseasonal autumn downpour and the santa monica mountains had greened as quickly as homegrown radishes the roadside was a tangle of creeper and vine wildflower and weed a boastful profusion nature making up for lost time the entrance to ocean heights was marked by the death of that boast a newly surfaced avenue bisected by a median of grass and shaded by magnolias so precisely matched in contour and size they could have been cloned from the same germ cell the street sign said esperanza drive beneath it was another sign white bluebordered discreet proclaiming ocean heights a guarded community the rain took on power and spattered against my windshield a half mile later the police command post came into view sawhorse barriers blocking the street a domino spread of blackandwhite squad cars a battalion of yellowslickered policemen projecting the guiltytillproveninnocent demeanor of iron curtain border guards something else fed the checkpoint image a group of about a dozen women all hispanic all soaked and distraught trying to cross the barriers meeting stoic resistance from the cops other than that the street was empty shutters drawn on diamondpaned windows colorcoordinated panel doors deadbolted the sole movement the shudder of flowers and shrubs beneath the watery onslaught i parked and got out the downpour hit me like a cold shower as i made my way toward the barricade i heard a woman cry out mi nino her words were echoed by the others a chorus of protests rose and mingled with the hiss of the rain just a short while longer ladies said a babyfaced cop struggling to appear unmoved one of the women called out something in spanish her tone was abusive the young cop flinched and looked over at the officer next to him older thickset graymustached catatonicstill the young cop turned back to the women just hold on now he said suddenly angry mi nino gray mustache still hadnt moved but his eyes had settled on me as i approached a third cop said man coming up when i was within spitting distance gray mustache gave a straightarm salute showing me the lines on his palm up close his face was wet and puffy laced with veins and chafed the color of rare steak no further sir im here to see detective sturgis the mention of milo s name narrowed his eyes he looked me up and down name alex delaware he cocked his head at one of the other patrolmen who came over and stood guard at the barrier then he went to one of the blackandwhites got in and talked into the radio a few minutes later he came back asked to see some id scrutinized my drivers license and stared at me a while longer before saying go ahead i got back into the seville and pulled forward two cops had cleared a carsized space between the sawhorses the hispanic women surged toward it automatically like water down a drain but were stopped by a shifting line of blue some of the women began to cry gray mustache was waving me through i pulled up alongside of him opened my window and said any reason they cant go see their children go ahead sir i drove on braving a gantlet of accusing eyes nathan hale elementary school was eight more blocks up esperanza a blacktop and fleshstucco flashback to the images id just seen on the tube three empty school buses were parked at the curb along with paramedics vans and a few straggling press vehicles the main building was sprawling and grayroofed skirted by a waisthigh hedge of podocarpus the front door was pumpkinorange two cops guarded it from behind a cordon of yellow crimescene tape more palmsalutes dirty looks and radio checks before the chainlink gate to the school grounds was unlocked and i was directed around to the back as i made my way i noticed another tape cordon wrapped around a small shedlike structure with wiremesh windows about seventy feet from the main building over the door was a sign equipment crimescene techs kneeled and stooped measuring scraping snapping pictures getting drenched for their efforts beyond them the rainblackened schoolyard stretched like scorched desert vacant except for the distant galvanized geometry of a jungle gym a single female reporter in a red raincoat shared her umbrella with a tall young officer what was passing between them seemed more flirtation than information transfer they paused as i walked by just long enough to decide i was neither newsworthy nor dangerous the back doors were tinted doubleglass above three concrete steps they swung open and milo stepped out wearing a quilted olivedrab car coat over the plaid sport jacket all those layers and the weight hed put on substituting food for booze made him look huge bearish he didnt notice me was staring at the ground running his hands over his lumpy face as if washing without water his head was bare his black hair dripping and limp his expression said wounded bear i said hello and he looked up sharply as if rudely awakened then his green eyes switched on like traffic lights and he came down the stairs the car coat had large wooden barrelshaped buttons dangling from loops they bobbed as he moved his tie was gray rayon waterspottedblack it hung askew over his belly i offered him my umbrella it didnt cover much of him any problems getting through no i said but a bunch of mothers are having a problem you guys could use some sensitivity training consider that my initial consultation the anger in my voice surprised both of us he frowned his pale face deathly in the shade of the umbrella the pockmarks on his cheeks standing out like pinholes in paper he looked around spotted the cop chatting up the reporter and waved when the cop didnt respond he cursed and lumbered away shoulders hunched like an offensive tackle moving in for the crush a moment later the patrolman was sprinting out of the yard flushed and chastened milo returned panting done the mommies are on their way police escort and all the perquisites of power yeah just call me generalissimo we began walking back toward the building how many kids are involved i said couple of hundred kindergarten through sixth grade we had them all in the gym paramedics checking for shock or injuries thank god nothing the teachers took them back to their classrooms trying to do what they can until you give them a plan i thought the school system had people to deal with crises according to the principal this particular school has trouble getting help from the school system naturally i thought of you we reached the steps where we were sheltered by an overhang mile stopped and placed a heavy hand on my shoulder thanks for coming down alex its a goddam mess i figured no one would do a better job than you i dont know what your schedules like or if theyll be able to pay you but if you can at least get them started on the right foot he cleared his throat and rubbed his face again i said tell me what happened looks like the suspect got onto the school grounds before school opened either by scaling or walking through couple of the gates were left unlocked proceeded into the storage shed which had a dinky lock on it and stayed there no one uses the shed he shook his head empty used to be for athletic equipment they keep all that stuff in the main building now suspect was settled in there until a little after noon when the kids came pouring out for recess latch and massengil and their people showed up by twelvethirty and thats when the shooting started teachers began shoving the kids back in the building but it was a real mob scene mass hysteria everyone falling over everyone else i glanced back at the storage shed tv said no one was hurt just the suspect permanently swat he shook his head it was over before swat got here one of latchs guys did the job fellow named ahlward while everyone else was diving for cover he rushed the shed kicked the door in and played rambo bodyguard im not sure what he is yet but he was armed lots of people in politics are we climbed the steps i took another look back at the shed one of the mesh windows offered a clear view of the main building it could have been a shooting gallery i said nearsighted sniper he grunted and pushed the door open the interior of the building was ovenwarm ripe with the mingled aromas of chalk dust and wet rubber this way he said turning left and guiding me down a brightly lit hallway hung with childrens artwork in fingerpaint and crayon and health and safety posters featuring grinning anthropomorphic animals the linoleum floor was claycolored and mottled with muddy shoeprints a couple of cops patrolled they acknowledged milo with stiff nods i said the newscast said latch and massengil were going to debate on camera it wasnt set up that way apparently massengil had a solo press conference in mind planned to make some speech about government tampering with family life use the school as a backdrop the whole busing thing school know of his plans nope no one here had any idea he was coming down but latchs people found out about it and latch decided to come down himself and confront him impromptu debate cameras ended up getting a better show i said the doors off the corridor were painted that same pumpkinorange all were shut and as we passed sounds filtered through the wood muffled voices the matteroffact sonata of a police radio what could have been crying i said think latch or massengil was the real target dont know yet the assassination angle brought the antiterrorist boys zipping over from downtown theyre interviewing both of the staffs right now as long as the political angle is a possibility theyre in charge meaning i collect info and hand it over to them so they can classify it then refuse to let me look at it on grounds that its classified perquisites of power hooha he gave a hollow laugh top of that the fbi just called from westwood wanting to know everything about everything threatening to assign one of their guys as a consultant he hummed a few bars of send in the clowns and lengthened his stride on the other hand he said if its your everyday runofthemill socal psycho killer gunning for innocent babies none of the muckamucks will give a shit cause the psychos dead no headline value and yours truly will catch the paperwork good old perquisites of power he stopped at a door marked principal turned the knob and shoved we entered a front office two straightbacked oak chairs and a secretarys desk untended to the right of the desk was a door bearing a brown plastic slidein sign stamped linda overstreet ed d in white milo knocked and pushed it open without waiting for a reply the desk in the rear office was pushed to the wall creating an open space that accommodated a sandcolored lshaped sofa tiletopped coffee table and two upholstered chairs plants in ceramic pots filled the corners next to the desk was a waisthigh shelving unit well stocked with books rag dolls puzzles and games framed watercolors of irises and lilies hung on the walls a woman got up from the sofa and said detective sturgis hello again for some reason id expected someone middleaged she was no older than thirty tall five eight or nine leggy highwaisted and slim but with strong shoulders and full hips that flared below a tight waist her face was long lean very pretty with a clear fair complexion rosy cheeks and fine features topped by a thick shag of shoulderlength blond hair her mouth was wide the lips a trifle stingy her jawline was crisp and angled sharply as if aiming for a point but ending in a squaredoff cleft chin that granted her a bit of determination she wore a charcoal cowlneck sweater tucked into a kneelength denim skirt no makeup other than a touch of eye shadow her only jewelry was a pair of square black costume earrings as promised milo told her dr alex delaware alex dr overstreet the boss around here she gave him a fleeting smile and turned to me because of her height and her heels we were almost eye to eye hers were round and large fringed with long almostwhite lashes the irises were an unremarkable shade of brown but radiated an intensity that caught my attention and held it pleased to meet you dr delaware she had a soft voice mellowed further by some kind of southern twang she held out her hand and i took it longfingered and narrow exerting no pressure i wondered how someone with hands that submissive that beautycontestant voice would handle a position of authority i said hello she freed her hand and brushed her bangs thanks for coming down on such short notice she said what a nightmare she shook her head again milo said scuse me doctors and moved toward the door see you later i told him he saluted when he was gone she said that man is kind and gentle as if ready to argue the point i nodded she said at first the kids were scared of him scared to talk to him his size but he really handled them well like a good father that made me smile her color deepened anyway lets get to work tell me everything i can do to help the kids she took a pad and pencil from her desk i sat on the short section of the lshaped sofa and she settled perpendicular to me crossing her legs i said are any of them showing signs of overt panic such as hysteria breathing troubles hyperventilation uncontrollable weeping no at first there were tears but they appeared to have calmed down at least the last time i looked they seemed settled amazingly so weve got them back in their classrooms and the teachers have been instructed to let me know if anything comes up no calls for the last half hour so i guess no news is good news what about physical symptoms vomiting urinating loss of bowel control we had a couple of wet pants in the lower grades the teachers handled it discreetly i probed for symptoms of shock she said no the paramedics already went through that said they were okay remarkably okay quote unquote is that normal for them to look that good i said what do they understand about whats happened she looked puzzled what do you mean has anyone actually sat down and explained to them that there was a sniper the teachers are doing that now but they have to know what happened they heard the shots saw the police swarm the campus her face tightened with anger i said what is it she said that someone would do that to them after all theyve been through but maybe thats why theyre handling it okay theyre used to being hated the busing thing the busing thing and all the garbage that resulted from it it was a match made in hell because of massengil more anger he hasnt helped but no doubt he speaks for his constituents ocean heights considers itself the last bastion of anglosaxon respectability till recently the locals idea of educational controversy was chocolatechip or oatmeal cookies at the bake sale which is fine but sometimes reality just has to rear its ugly head she drummed her fingers and said when you came in did you notice how big the yard was i hadnt but i nodded she said its a huge campus for such a small neighborhood because thirtyfive years ago when the school was built land was cheap ocean heights was supposed to boom and someone probably landed a juicy construction contract but the boom never materialized and the school never came close to functioning at capacity until the budget crunches back in the seventies no one paid much attention to that kind of thing whod complain about small classes but resources started to dry up the board began examining head count efficient allocation of resources all that good stuff most white schools were experiencing a dropping census but hale was a real ghost town the kids of the original homeowners were grown housing had gotten so expensive that few families with young children were able to move in those that could afford to live here could also afford to send their kids to private schools the result was classroom capacity for nine hundred pupils and only eightysix kids attending meanwhile on the east side things were nuts fifty sixty per classroom kids sitting on the floor the logical thing seemed to be what the board so quaintly terms modulated redistribution the b word but totally voluntary and oneway innercity kids brought in no locals bused out how longs it been going on this is our second year hundred kids the first semester hundred more the second even with that the place was still a ghost town but the locals felt crowded sixty of the eightysix stragglers were transferred immediately to private schools all the rest left mid semester you would have thought we were importing the plague she shook her head i can understand people wanting to be insulated the whole idea of the neighborhood school i know they must have felt invaded but that doesnt excuse how ugly it got alleged grownups standing outside the gates waving signs and taunting the kids calling them greasers wetbacks vermin i said i saw it on tv it was ugly she said during summer vacation we got vandalized racist graffiti broken windows i tried to get the board to send down some mental health people someone to mediate with the community before the new school year started but all i got were memos and countermemos hales a stepchild that theyre obligated to feed but dont want to acknowledge how have the children reacted to all the hostility very well actually theyre so darned resilient bless em and we worked on it last year i met regularly with each class talking to them about tolerance respecting differences between people the right to free speech even if its unpleasant i had the teachers play games and do things to enhance selfesteem we kept drumming into them how good they were how brave im no psychologist but psych was my minor and i think i did at least a passable job i said sounds like the right approach maybe thats why theyre handling things well right now she waved off the compliment and her eyes moistened thats not to say everything was perfect not by a long shot they felt it the hatred had to a few families pulled their kids out of the busing program immediately but most stuck it out and after a while things seemed to be quieting down i really thought this semester was going well hoped it had finally dawned on the good folks of ocean heights that a bunch of little kids werent going to rape their daughters and rustle their cattle or maybe they just got bored this place is the capital of apathy only other issues that get them going are offshore oil drilling within a fiftymile radius and anything that relates to landscaping so i made sure our shrubs were well trimmed brief bitter smile i was starting to think we could finally concentrate on educating then massengil goes and dredges it all up hes always had a special thing for us probably cause hes a local lives in sacramento but keeps a house here for legal purposes obviously he views us as a personal burr in the butt she punched her palm her eyes were flashing i altered my assessment about her ability to handle authority the creep she said if id known he was planning a dogandpony show today id she frowned tapped her pencil on her wrist i said what she hesitated then gave another mirthless smile i was about to say id have met him at the gate with a loaded gun she looked down at her pad realized shed written nothing and said enough talk whats your plan the first step will be to establish rapport with the kids and the teachers your introducing me and explaining who i am will help that second ill focus on getting them to express their feelings about what happened talking playing drawing individually or in groups groups class by class its more efficient and more therapeutic opening up will be easier if theres peer support ill also be looking for the highrisk kids those who are especially highstrung have had previous anxiety problems or experienced loss or an unusual amount of stress within the last year some of them may need oneonone attention the teachers can help by identifying them no problem she said i know most of them myself the other important thing maybe the toughest will be to convince parents not to keep their children out of school for extended periods whats extended more than a day or two the sooner they get back the easier it will be for them to adjust she sighed all right well get on it what do you need in the way of equipment nothing much some toys blocks figurines paper and pencil clay scissors glue weve got all of that will i need a translator no most of the kids about ninety percent are latino but all of them understand english weve worked hard at that the rest are asian including some pretty recent immigrants but we dont have anyone on staff who speaks cambodian or vietnamese or laotian or tagalog or whatever so theyve come along pretty fast ye olde melting pot uhuh forbidden phrase she said the memo god commands us to use salad bowl she raised a finger and recited every ingredient maintains its integrity no matter how much you toss it around we left her office and stepped out into the hall only one cop remained patrolling idly she said okay now what about your fee i said we can talk about that later no i want things straight from the beginning for your sake the school board has to approve private consultants that takes time going through channels if i put in a voucher without prior approval they can use that as an excuse not to pay you i said we cant wait for approval the key is to get to the kids as soon as possible i realize that but i just want you to know what youre dealing with also even if we go through channels therere bound to be hassles getting you compensated the board will probably claim it has the resources to do the job itself therefore theres no justification for bringing in anyone from the outside i nodded same song and dance they pull with the parents of handicapped kids youve got it dont worry about it i worry about everything its my job she said most of the softness in her eyes had melted away i said its okay really you realize were talking potential freebie i realize thats fine she looked at me why are you doing this its what i went to school to learn how to do there was distrust in her eyes but she shrugged and said who am i to look a gift horse we walked toward the first classroom a door at the end of the corridor swung open a tight cluster of nine or ten people poured out and barreled in our direction at the groups nucleus was a tall whitehaired man in his sixties wearing a gray sharkskin suit that could have been purchased for eisenhowers victory party his face was stringy and hawkish above a long wattled neck beak nose white toothbrush mustache pursed mouth eyes buried in an angry squint he kept up a vigorous pace leading with his head pumping his elbows like a speedwalker his minions were whispering at him but he didnt seem to be listening the group ignored us and blew by i said looks like the esteemed assemblymans run out of words she closed her eyes and exhaled we continued walking i said what do you know about the sniper just that hes dead its a start she turned sharply a start at what dealing with the kids fears the fact that hes dead will help youre going to get into gory details with them right away im going to be truthful with them when theyre ready for it she looked doubtful i said the key is for them to make some kind of sense out of a crazy situation in order to do that theyll need as much accurate information as possible facts about the bad guy presented at their level as soon as possible the mind abhors a vacuum without facts theyll fill their heads with fantasies of him that could be much worse than reality just how much reality do you think they need to absorb nothing gory basics the snipers name age what he looks looked like its crucial that they see him as human destructible gone forever even with facts some of the youngest ones will be incapable of understanding the permanence of his death theyre not mature enough developmentally and some of the older ones may regress because of the trauma temporarily forget that dead people dont come back to life so theyre all vulnerable to fantasies of the bad guy returning of his coming back to get them again adult crime victims go through it after the initial shocks worn off it can lead to nightmares phobias all kinds of posttraumatic reactions in children the risk is higher because kids dont draw a clear line between reality and fantasy you cant eliminate the risk of problems but by dealing with misconceptions right away you minimize it i stopped she was staring at me grimly the brown eyes unwavering what i want i said is for them to understand that the bastards truly destroyed that hes not some supernatural bogeyman thats going to keep haunting them bastard made her smile okay just as long as it doesnt end up scaring them more she stopped herself sorry you obviously know a heck of a lot more about this than i do its just that theyve been through so much for so long ive gotten protective thats okay i said good to see someone caring she ignored that this one definitely didnt like compliments i dont know a thing about the bastard she said no one saw him we just heard the shots then there was a lot of panic screaming and shoving we were trying to stuff the kids back into the building keeping their heads down we ran as fast and as far away as we could trying to make sure no one got trampled no one even knew it was over until that guy ahlward came out of the shed waving his gun like a cowboy after the big draw when i first saw him it freaked me out i thought he was the sniper then i recognized him id seen him in latchs group and he was smiling telling us it was all over we were safe she shuddered byebye bogeyman the lone patrolman had tilted his head toward our conversation he was young handsome coalblack permapressed i walked up to him and said officer what can you tell me about the sniper im not free to give out any information sir im not a reporter i said im a psychologist called in by detective sturgis to work with the children unimpressed it would be useful i said for me to have as many facts as possible so i can help the kids im not free to discuss anything sir wheres detective sturgis i dont know sir i returned to linda overstreets side shed heard the exchange bureaucracy she said ive come to believe its a biological urge a door farther down the corridor opened disgorging another group this one revolved around a man in his early forties midsized and chunky he had a roundish freckled face under an earlybeatles mop of graystreaked dark hair which covered his brow his clothes were formula juniorfaculty oatmealcolored tweed sport coat rumpled khaki pants blackandgreen plaid shirt red knit tie he wore round tortoiseshell eyeglasses the kind the british health service used to give out for free they rested atop a nose that would have done a french bulldog proud the rest of his features were too small for his face pinched almost effeminate i thought of old pictures id seen of him longhaired and bearded the facial hair had made him look more seasoned twenty years ago the academic image was enhanced by the people around him young brighteyed like students vying for the attention of a favorite professor each of them was finalexam solemn but the group managed to radiate a boisterousness that was almost festive the roundfaced man noticed us and stopped dr overstreet hows everyone doing as good as can be expected councilman latch he came over to us the staffers hung back with the exception of one bulky bluntfaced redhaired man about latchs age none was older than twentyfive a cleancut bunch dressed for success latch said is there anything i can do dr overstreet for the kids or your staff how about calling out the national guard for some protection he flashed a brief campaignposter smile then turned serious anything a little less martial actually she said we could use some information what kind of information about the sniper who he was his motivation dr delaware here will be working with the children he needs to know as much as possible in order to answer their questions he seemed to notice me for the first time held out his hand and gripped mine hard gordon latch alex delaware good to meet you alex youre a psychologist psychiatrist psychologist from the school board before i could answer linda said dr delawares a private practitioner recommended by the police hes a specialist in childhood stress latchs blue eyes focused behind his welfare specs well all power to you and thanks for coming down on such short notice alex its been a horror unbelievable thank god it turned out the way it did he glanced back at his staffers got nods from some of them whats your game plan visàvis the kids i gave him a brief rehash of what id told linda he took a moment to digest it sounds right on target he said i was involved in your field once upon a time majored in psych up at berkeley crisis counseling community mental health primary and secondary prevention we had a place in oakland trying to integrate mental patients back into the community back in the good old days when humanism wasnt a dirty word so ive heard as had anyone who read the papers different times he said sighing gentler and kinder what happened today just underscores how far weve drifted damn what a tragedy linda said what can you tell us about the sniper councilman latch not much im afraid we dont know much ourselves the police have been awfully closemouthed as is their wont she said mr ahlward would know something if he feels up to it perhaps he could educate us latch looked over his shoulder again bud cmere please the redhaired man raised pinkish eyebrows and stepped forward he wore a brown suit white shirt solid brown knit tie had the kind of overdeveloped upper body that makes custom tailoring a necessity this suit was off the rack and hung on him like a tarp his hands dangled loosely at his sides big pale fuzzed with copper his hair was tightly curled and he wore it close to his head he had a fleshy jutting jaw and lazy amber eyes that remained fixed on his boss councilman up close he smelled of cigarette smoke bud these good people want to know about the sniper what can you tell them nothing yet said ahlward he had a soft boyish voice sorry cops orders he zipped a finger across his mouth latch said nothing at all bud atd was real clear on that councilman latch turned back to us antiterrorist division you might recall them from a couple of years ago the lovely fellows who were spending taxpayers money on surveilling innocent taxpayers weve since gotten them to clean up their act so i suppose well have to let them do their thing for the moment and they were adamant about keeping things under wraps until theyre sure theyve got the big picture buds on his way downtown right now to give a formal statement if were all lucky thingsll clear up soon after that to ahlward bud soon as you get the green light visàvis informational flow make sure these good folks get anything they want immediately understood you bet said ahlward latch nodded ahlward returned to the group thank god for bud said latch loud enough for the group to hear someone patted ahlward on the back the redheaded man appeared unmoved standing with the others but not one of them a distant look had settled on his face zen placid as if hed projected himself to another place another time not a hint that hed spent his lunch hour shooting someone to death okay my friends said latch taking a step backward its been a long day that shows no sign of ending dr overstreet if you need anything bypass the red tape and come straight to me i mean it lets get things on an even keel once and for all dr delaware sounds like the kids are in good hands but you too feel free to get in touch if theres anything i can do he reached into his jacket removed some business cards from a leather holder and gave them to us a twohanded grasp of lindas hand then mine and he was gone linda crumpled the card her face had tightened i said whats the matter suddenly hes mr helpful she said but last spring when the kids were being put through hell i tried to get his help ocean heights is part of his district even though im sure he didnt get too many votes here i thought because of his reputation all the civil rights stuff he used to be into hed come down talk to the kids show them someone with power was on their side if for no other reason than to use it for public relations i must have called his office half a dozen times not even a return call he came down today to square off against massengil some kind of ulterior motive no doubt theyre all the same she blushed listen to me you must think im a foursquare ballbuster you might very well be i said but id have to study you under more optimal circumstances in order to be able to come to a conclusion visàvis that issue she opened her mouth then broke into laughter the cop down the hall pretended not to hear the classroom was large and bright and filled with an unaccustomed silence only the rain broke the quiet sloshing against the windows in an insistent carwash rhythm twenty pairs of eyes stared back at me i said im the kind of doctor who doesnt give shots i dont look in kids eyes or ears

you cecelia said the teacher everyone likes all of you the chubby girl shook her head and began to cry by the time i finished the rain had abated i made a stop at linda overstreets office but it was locked and no one answered my knock as i left the building i saw milo in the yard near the cordoned storage shed he was talking to a slim darkhaired man in a wellcut blue suit he noticed me and waved me over alex this is lieutenant frisk antiterrorist division lieutenant dr alex delaware the clinical psychologist wholl be working with the kids frisk checked me over and said hows it going doctor in a tone that let me know he didnt much care fine good to hear it he flashed a barrel cuff and consulted his rolex he was young and tan the dark hair permed in a neat cap and wore a mustache that had taken a long time to trim the blue suit was expensive the shirt turnbull asser or a knockoff the tie that bisected it was heavy silk patterned with dancing blue parallelograms on a background of deep burgundy his eyes matched the parallelograms they never stopped moving he turned to milo and said ill let you know afternoon doctor he walked away spiffy dresser i said looks like a tv cop young man on the way up said milo masters in public administration from sc good connections dthree by the age of thirty promoted to loot three years later is he taking over the case you just heard hell let me know we walked across the schoolyard so he said howd it really go not bad really i managed to meet briefly with all the classes most of the kids seem to be reacting normally meaning meaning lots of anxiety some anger its the anger i tried to harness get them to feel more in control i told the teachers to contact the parents and prepare them for possible appetite loss sloop problems psychosomatic stuff clinginess some school phobia some of the kids may need individual treatment but a group approach should work for most of them the important thing was getting to them quickly you done good he said whatd you think of ms principal feisty lady texas lady he said cops kid daddy was a ranger brought his work home she knows this scene by heart she didnt mention any of that to me why should she with you she probably talked feelings i said her main feeling right now is anger plenty of it simmering beneath the surface its been building since she got here shes been dealing with lots of crap and getting very little support she tell you about the vandalism he frowned yeah first id heard of it the school board reported it directly to downtown it never went any further bad pr i said perish the thought sounds like the schools been embroiled in politics since they brought the kids in think the sniping was political at this point who knows latch or massengil have any theories about being targets themselves i wouldnt know he said kenny frisk and the atd boys did all the interrogation hushhush behind closed doors afterwards kenny comes out and informs the rest of us peons that official policy is tight lips all press releases to emanate from atd informational infractions will be severely dealt with i searched his face for signs of anger all i saw was a big white mask a few steps later he said though with politicos good luck keeping their lips from flapping so far latch seems to be complying i said i ran into him in the hall as he was leaving tried to get some information from him and received zip he turned his head and looked at me what kind of information some sort of basic description of the sniper who he was anything tangible the kids need to form an image of their enemy i repeated the rationale id given linda and gordon latch theyre already asking questions milo it would increase my effectiveness to be able to answer some of them he said just basics huh who he was i nodded of course any details you can tell me would be useful short of an informational infraction he didnt smile details well first thing i can tell you is that youre operating on a false premise whats that it wasnt a he it was a she the restaurant was dim and mockenglish collections of tankards and heraldic shields displayed on roughtextured dun walls dartboards in ye olde pub room lots of distressed crossbeams the tallowy sweet smell of seared meat a catacomb jumble of small dining rooms a respectful maitre d had seen to it that ours was empty milo looked up from his tbone put down his knife and took something out of his coat pocket that he slid across the table a piece of white paper folded double in the center was a photocopy of a drivers license the photo was dark and blurred a young female face oval unsmiling a little weakchinned thin neck white blouse dark straight hair cropped short straightedge bangs hovering above arched eyebrows i searched the features for something some harbinger of violence the eyes looked a little dull sullen heavylidded shallow as rain puddles but that could have been the poor quality of the copy or weariness at waiting in line at the dmv other than that nothing average a face youd never notice i read the id data holly lynn burden jubilo dr ocean heights ca sex f hair brn eyes blue ht wt dob rstr corr lens local girl i said very local that address is five blocks from the school jubilo drive spanish for joy and i think esperanza means hope aplus sherlock you caught the pattern the street next to jubilos belleza court beauty some optimistic urban planner hispanophile urban planner i said guess the locals dont share the spirit hey he said street names are one thing letting them marry your sisters another i examined the picture again reread the information what do you know about her just what you see in front of you frisk says atd will be checking out known associates going through their subversive files to see if her name comes up when he left us he was on his way to her house nineteen years old i said and gave him the paper he folded it back up and put it away now forget you saw it alex im not even supposed to have a copy why not official atd document howd you get it he shrugged and began sawing his steak after the print boys finished frisk designated one of the offices as a data collection center had all the evidence hoarded in there i just happened to saunter in when he just happened to take a leak there just happened to be this xerox machine that kept whispering turn me on big boy you know how ive always been a sucker for the soft touch why all the obsession with secrecy milo once frisk gave you her name you could have gotten the license yourself hell i could get it myself thats the way atd works comes from spending too much of their time hanging around washington the department sends them there and to fbi heaven at quantico seminars hobnobbing with the cloakanddagger freaks makes em insufferable but thems the rules no sense bucking without any payoff besides it shouldnt take long for things to ease up only a matter of time before the whole case goes public how long unless something interesting turns up about the late ms burden in somebodys files frisk plans on releasing her name to the press around noon tomorrow soon as that happens you can tell your kids the bogeyman looks like their friendly neighborhood babysitter hows he going to stall the press in the meantime the old fashioned way lie sorry ladies and gentlemen no definitive id pending autopsy which is almost true she did take a couple of bullets in the face but you could still tell it was the same face as the one on the license i imagined the young bland countenance swollen perforated bleeding shook that picture out of my head and said around noon should work out anyway im meeting with the kids at one great but if for some reason frisk hasnt gone public neither do you okay ive got enough troubles without leaks getting traced back to me this early in the game what kind of troubles the usual his expression said change the subject we ate for a while my mind kept drifting back to the license photo a girl sniper i said hard to believe womens lib alex he said with his mouth full theyre trying to catch up to us in the asshole division then theyve got a long ways to go i said i remember county jail visiting jamey cadmus in the violent psych ward one thing that impressed me was that they had twenty rooms for males only two set aside for females and those two were rarely used for females what percentage of violent crime is committed by women less than ten he said but the stats get interesting when you look at the age pattern violent offenders under eighteen the rate for males is still much higher than it is for females but the overall rate for males is dropping while for females its going up the gap is closing and even without the numbers id know theres something happening alex on the streets i can sense it rules of conduct breaking down maybe mansons girls broke the ice i dont know squeaky and the other one taking potshots at ford those assholettes in the sla now the gangbangers have started using fems as triggermen triggerpersons they figure the courts will go easier on psychopaths in dresses and theyre right so far meanwhile more and more bonnies wanting to be clydes he cut a large piece of tbone free and stuffed it in his mouth hell he said still chewing nastiest thing ive seen this year was some stenographer over in mar vista doing in her boyfriend with a chinese cleaver jiltedlover stirfry call the frugal gourmet i looked at the sirloin on my fork and put it down bon appétit he said thanks of course he said the distaff does have a long way to go weve got thousands of years of experience behind us tankfuls of testosterone but theyre working on it the whole goddam cultures changing female wrestlers girls pumping iron shooting steroids talking dirty hell you ever see women flipping off truckers on the freeway till recently theyre feeling their oats pal i made another go at my steak prime huh he said taking another mouthful prime private stock management knows me he patted his gut which is to love me big tips and its cholesterol heaven he dipped a piece of meat in steak sauce dont get me wrong its not like i have a thing against the fairer sex just telling it the way i see it i know that yeah well sometimes people assume you know i swore off assumptions for lent he gulped another gargantuan piece of steak the meat was bloodyrare and some juice dribbled down his chin he dabbed at it did i ever tell you i once had a girlfriend never yup high school days im not surprised no what the hell does it take to surprise you how about an honest politician his laugh was harsh yeah find one put him in the cage next to the condor i said why bother he laughed some more any indication the burden girl was aiming at latch or massengil ye olde participatory democracy im serious milo being able to tell the kids they werent the targets would make my job easier then by all means go ahead and tell em no i said if i say it i want it to be true sorry then he said nothing solid to give you she didnt leave any political message at the scene far as i know no fringies have called yet expressing solidarity and frisk said he didnt recognize her name offhand from his subversive lists though like i said theyll be running her through the software maybe hell turn up something at her house some diary or wacko manifesto meanwhile all weve got is one dead girl and lots of question marks he thought for a moment if she was trying for one of them my guess would be massengil looks like no one except latchs insiders knew their boy was going to be there the press knew he shook his head uhuh only about massengil that much i confirmed from talking to the reporters the invite came from massengils staff this morning it was supposed to be a oneman show latch didnt announce he was coming the idea was to surprise the enemy howd latch find out massengil was going to be there once the press knew it wouldnt be too hard for anyone to find out would it i said anyone anyone in the grapevine frisk does his job correctly thats the first thing hell check about her maybe she once worked for massengil or latch or knew someone who did no one on either staff recognized her name but she could have been lowlevel stuffing envelopes whatever some meek little gofer they treated like shit never took the time to notice she swallows it for a while then quits no one notices shes gone meanwhile shes smoldering making plans for vengeance fits the masskiller profile then again maybe the political thing was coincidental latch and massengil had nothing to do with it maybe all she wanted to do was kill kids and bigger game intruded local girl makes bad i said wonder if she attended hale revenge for a bad report card got anything that makes more sense as a matter of fact i dont he said so far this is your quintessential senseless crime as opposed to all the real sensible ones we get were the reporters there when the shooting started he shook his head no the press conference wasnt called until one massengil showed up half an hour before walking around the yard observing latch dropped in on him a few minutes later i said if latchs intention was to upstage massengil why not arrive when the media were in place make a dramatic entry we wondered about that too according to frisk latchs explanation was that his object wasnt to confront massengil but to defuse him he was giving massengil a chance to call the whole thing off before the cameras showed up saint gordon yeah and im mother teresa my guess is his real intention was to spook massengil work him up good massengils got a reputation for having a short fuse got into a punchout with another politico couple of years ago likes to yell back at hecklers go head to head latch probably figured in half an hour he could get the guy apoplectic by the time the media showed really make a jerk out of him then the shooting started and took the edge off their little drama one of the kids told me it sounded like war i said how would he know she from cambodia oh tell you one thing old holly was no prowarrior the rifle was a remington sevenhundred classic bolt action scoped nine pounds stripped one of the heavier ones they make lots of kick not a girls gun you just dont pick up something like that go boom and hope to hit your target even with the scope sighting and aiming wouldnt have been the problem alex holding on to the damned thing would be according to the license she weighed under a hundred and twenty and she hadnt gained anything since applying for it i saw the body skinny no muscle on her unless she had plenty of practice she might as well have brought a cannon to shoot mice women succeed in the shooting game they get up nice and close use a comfortable little handgun not that a handgun would have been of much use in a sniping situation the license also said corrective lenses was she wearing her glasses yup took a bullet in one of them glass went right into the eye socket like shrapnel how many shots did she get off before ahlward stormed the shed looks like three out of six rounds though to listen to the teachers and kids she had a machine gun it was a regular blitz but panicll do that magnify things and some of what they heard was probably ahlward shooting her he put eight right in her theres your pro i said remembering the redheaded mans calm excop nope frisk said some kind of exmilitary commando hardass type for a guy like latch to employ not if latch is a pragmatist its like that old bumper sticker that used to be on half the lockers at the academy mugged call a hippie latch may spout the loveandcompassion line but when it comes to saving his ass he aint gonna hire cesar chavez howd ahlward get into the shed same back door burden used she left it unlocked i told you she was no pro he ran around the back waltzed right in and pow i thought again of the face on the drivers license superimposed a mesh of blood and glass over the dull face what is it said milo nothing my my my you feel bad for her dont you not really not really he clucked his tongue jesus alex you turning mushy on me i thought by now id raised your consciousness i said the whole things pathetic milo a girl holed up with a rifle she couldnt handle god knows whats going through her head so so i guess it just would have been nicer for the bad guy to be badder he put his fork down and stared at me oh she could have been plenty bad no thanks to her she wasnt real bad just imagine a couple of lucky shots couple of those cute little kids catching rifle slugs in okay i said i get the point good he said crumpling his napkin get it and keep it situation like this got to keep the old priorities straight now how about some dessert i got home by eight picked up calls did paperwork and chores then spent half an hour with a new acquisition a crosscountry skiing machine a genuine implement of torture that left me a sopping ball of sweat in the shower i kept thinking about terrified children and evil babysitters so much for aerobic cleansing at nine i watched the news on one of the local stations the shooting at nathan hale was the lead story file clips of weeping kids followed by the official lapd statement delivered by lieutenant kenneth frisk the atd man was articulate and at ease with the cameras as he sidestepped questions his designer duds and mustache proproom photogenic newage cop lots of style very little substance armed with few facts and needing to stretch the broadcast the newspeople flashed more file clips a segment on massengils state house fistfight a year before with an assemblyman from the northern part of the state named dimarco the bout had taken place in the chambers of the legislature the two of them going at it verbally some esoteric issue having to do with gerrymandered districts massengil had come out of it without a scratch dimarco had suffered a bloody lip the camera showed the loser pressing a crimson handkerchief to his mouth then cut to footage taken today dimarco leaving his sacramento office asked about massengils temper and how he thought it related to the sniping he passed up a chance for retribution said it wouldnt be prudent to comment at this time got in his stateissued car and drove away discretion or a losers reticence next came a retrospective on gordon latch the speedy compressed history that only a tv photomontage can accomplish beginning with a twentyyearold film latch hirsute and brighteyed marching with mario savio at berkeley shouting slogans getting busted at the peoples park cut to a hippiestyle marriage in golden gate park to the former miranda brundage the bride only child of a movie tycoon former art history grad student at berkeley former young republican fashion plate programmed for deliberate understatement and the junior league had worn tiedye latch had radicalized her fast she got arrested with him regularly dropped out of school lived in splendid telegraph avenue squalor to the press the irony was irresistible in hollywood circles fritz brundage had long been regarded as a cryptofascist a prime mover behind the mccarthyera blacklist and a passionate unionbuster the media covered his daughters wedding as if it were hard news latch played to the cameras enjoying his role as first radical soon after the wedding he took miranda to hanoi recorded messages for the viet cong exhorting gis to desert their posts the networks were there with open mikes the latches returned to the united states topping the ten most hated list fielding death threats and possible prosecution for sedition they went into seclusion at a ranch owned by the old man somewhere up north people wondered why fritz had given them sanctuary the government decided not to prosecute there were rumors of fritzs calling in markers latch and miranda stayed out of the public eye for five years until fritz died then emerged the heirs to a fortune freshly barbered and mature apologetic for hanoi selfproclaimed democratic humanists eager to work within the system a move to the west side of la a couple more years of good works environmental activism groceries for the homeless charity camps for disadvantaged youths and latch was ready for the electoral process a city council seat vacated by the carcrash death of a wellloved incumbent with a wellhidden drinking problem and an abhorrence for delegating authority no designated successor a sudden vacuum filled by latch and some generous monetary transfers from the former brundage estate to the partys coffers the only protests against latchs nomination came from veterans groups latch met with them ate crow said hed grown up had a vision for the city that transcended partisan politics he ran against token opposition regiments of college students went doortodoor in the district distributing potholders and talking clean air latch won made an acceptance speech that sounded downright middleoftheroad miranda seemed content to host political teas she photographed well i noticed kneeling on the beach scraping tar off an oilslicked pelican end of montage the anchorman offered a twosentence review of the racial tensions at hale more shots of crying kids worried parents a long view of the empty schoolyard the tail end of the story was an interview with a portly whitebearded psychologist named dobbs billed as an expert on childhood stress whod been enlisted by the school board to work with the children that held my attention dobbs had on a threepiece suit that looked as if it had been woven from shredded wheat and toyed with a heavylooking watch chain as he spoke his face carried a lot of loose flesh and he pursed his lips a lot which made him look like a rubber santa mask gone sour he used homegrown jargon that made my head reel talked a lot about crisis intervention and moral values had plenty to say about how society had lost its moral fiber i kept waiting for him to hold up a book jacket the phone interrupted his spiel dr delaware speaking this is linda overstreet you gave me this number so i figured it was all right to use it sure linda whats up have you by any chance been watching the news got it on screen right now so you saw him dobbs in all his tweedy glory hes lying believe me no one called him in on anything i know because i spoke to the board this afternoon and they hadnt gotten themselves in gear yet whats going on i dont know what i do know is that dobbs has got connections with the board so he probably assumed theyd give him the okay just went steamrolling ahead on his own what kind of connections a couple of years back after one of the earthquakes he presented a very slick proposal to the board crisis intervention free of charge at several schools including the one where i was in training what he actually ended up doing was having his assistants administer computerized tests to the kids and hand out brochures nothing handson couple of weeks later some of the parents started getting phone calls informing them the tests had shown their kids to be suffering from severe emotional problems strongly advising them to bring the kids in for individual therapy those who resisted got followup calls letters notsosubtle pressure funny thing is all of the ones who were followed up lived in highpriced zip codes the poor get poorer and the rich get therapy yup the board got a few complaints about the hard sell but overall they were pleased with dobbs because he hadnt cost them a dime and they got testimonials from some of the parents of the kids who went for treatment saying it had been helpful are his credentials on the level far as i know hold on for a second ill check i went into the library got an american psychological association directory and came back on the line whats his first name lance i thumbed to the ds found a bio on dobbs dr lance l and skimmed it birthdate in phd in educational counseling from a landgrant college in the midwest internship and postdoctoral training at a drug rehab center in sacramento state license in director of cognitivespiritual associates inc since two addresses west la and whittier looks bona fide i said maybe but with assistants doing all the work whats the big deal if he himself is qualified i see him as a selfpromoter the kind who loves to see himself on screen this is la i said people demand more than their fifteen minutes of fame she laughed so youre not ticked off why should i be you do the work he takes the credit seems to me i spend half my time dealing with ego stuff stepping on toes guess im sensitized to it my toes feel fine okay she said i just wanted to keep things straight if dobbss people show up ill handle it thanks and thanks for calling sure silence i said hows everything going at school good as can be expected her voice broke its just starting to sink in how close we all came what a mess the whole thing is howre you doing oh ill survive what im really concerned about is the kids i talked to a few of the teachers and the feedback i got on your sessions was positive im glad how do they look to you the kids scared but nothing abnormal whats encouraging is that they seem able to express it you and the teachers have obviously done a good job over the past two years what are they scared of specifically the youngest ones are concerned about separation from their parents so you may see some school phobia and increased absenteeism from them the older ones talked more about pain and suffering trying to imagine what it felt like to be shot some discussion of death some angers starting to come out too which is good anger and fear are incompatible in kids one drives out the other if they can harness their anger and focus it itll help them feel more in control in the long run anger heals huh she said maybe i should try it maybe i said though i have to be honest with adults the fearanger thing isnt that clearcut figures why should life be simple anything else i should know ive made a list of about twenty kids who seem extrafragile ill keep an eye out for others any of the highrisk kids who still look shaky within the next few days will need individual attention and ill want to meet with their parents when do you want the parents how about friday ill get carla on it first thing in the morning thanks howre you doing with the parents persuading them to send their kids back so far so good ive been through this before with the busing so most of them trust me but its not easy telling them weve provided a safe place for learning for their kids well keep trucking good luck thanks i saw you leaving today with detective sturgis learn anything new on the sniper remembering milos warning i hedged the police dont know much yet expect to be finding out more soon sounds like the old cop shuffle that reminded me of what milo had told me about her father guess youd know about that what do you mean detective sturgis told me you were a cops kid did he she said suddenly chilly yes thats true well have a good evening and thanks again see you tomorrow linda maybe not she said ill be running around all over the place if you need anything ask carla good night good night i placed the phone in its cradle the chill lingered milo hadnt said anything about her being touchy about her background i wondered about it but not for long too many other things on my mind tuesday morning was crystalline the kind of nosetweaking palatetickling weather la earns after a storm i checked the morning paper for an update on the shooting found nothing and scanned the tv and the allnews radio stations just rehash i returned calls finished a couple of childcustody reports working until just before noon when i took a break for a pepper beef sandwich and a beer remembering milos prediction i turned the tv on again flipped channels game shows soaps vocational training commercials i was just about to switch it off when a press conference cut into one of the serials lieutenant frisk more than ever his tan his teeth and his perm made him resemble a soap opera cop and the conference seemed like a continuation of the serial just another scripted scene he straightened his tie smiled then proceeded to give holly lynn burden her own ration of fame enunciating her name repeating it spelling it adding her birthdate the fact that she lived in ocean heights and was believed to have had psychiatric problems all indications he said are that miss burden was working alone and no evidence of any political affiliation or conspiracy has been found though were still investigating at this time what do you have asked a reporter by way of a motive none at this time but you said she had psychiatric problems thats true what kinds of problems did she have were still looking into that said frisk sorry i cant be any more specific at this time lieutenant was she gunning for the children or was this an assassination attempt were still collecting data on that as well thats all at this time folks get back to you soon as we have more segue back to the soap a cocktail party full of beautiful people hautecoiffured and hautecuisined but riddled with angst i knotted my tie and put on my jacket time for school i arrived at hale at lunch hour but the yard was empty a grizzled man in shabby clothes was walking up and down the sidewalk in front of the school he carried a tenfoot cross and wore a sandwich sign proclaiming jesus is lord on the front no heaven without redemption on the back a middleaged cop stood at the entrance to the gate watching him blue uniform but not lapd i got close enough to read the insignia on his sleeve school police i gave him my name he checked it against a list on a clipboard asked for id verification and unlocked the gate the man with the cross had shuffled halfway down the block now he turned and shouted suffer the children in a hoarse voice the school cop looked at him as if at a puddle of vomit but made no move the crossman resumed his march i entered the yard the storage shed was still wrapped with crimescene tape despite the fine weather a sense of desolation hung over the grounds gloom coupled with tension like the pause between thunderclaps maybe it was the emptiness the lack of childish laughter or maybe just my imagination id had the same feeling before at deathbeds i pushed that aside and checked in with linda overstreets secretary carla was young tiny and efficient she had a punk hairdo and a smile that said life was a big joke i went to the first classroom yesterday thered been two dozen students today i counted nine the teacher a pale young woman just out of training looked defeated i gave her an encouraging smile regretted not having the time to do more as i took her place at the front of the classroom she excused herself sat in the back and read a book the pattern of absenteeism repeated itself in every other class at least half of the children had stayed home many of the ones id tagged as highrisk were among the missing therapists dilemma those who need help the most run the farthest from it i concentrated on the help i could offer went to work reestablishing rapport giving the children time to ventilate then introducing them to their bogeywoman telling them holly burdens name the few facts i knew about her they were skeptical about the notion of a female sniper many of the youngest kids kept calling her him i had them draw her mold her out of clay build her out of blocks rip her up smash her bludgeon her erase her kill her again and again blood and glass through it all i kept talking kept reassuring it went on that way until in one of the fourth grade classes the mention of holly burdens name made the teacher go pale a woman in her fifties named esme ferguson she was a tall squarefaced bleached blonde heavily madeup conservatively tailored she left the room and didnt return some time later i spotted her in the hall caught up with her and asked if shed known holly burden she took a deep breath and said yes doctor she was from here from ocean heights from hale she was a student here i taught her i used to teach sixth grade she was in my sixth grade class years ago what do you remember about her penciled eyebrows rose nothing really nothing at all she bit her lip she was odd the entire familys odd odd in what way i really cant this is too hard to talk about doctor too much happening all at once please excuse me i have to get back to class she turned her back on me i let her go returned to my work to talk of the odd girl try to explain madness to children madness as it turned out was something these children grasped easily they loved the word crazy seemed to revel in it in graphic discussions of deranged people theyd known their view of mental illness was skewed toward blood and guts wetbrained vagrants carving each other up in alleyways over a bottle of redeye hebephrenic bag ladies walking in front of buses drooling molesters shrieking youths run amok on pcp and crack cocaine random bursts of psychotic poetry at the corner minimarket i sat back listened to all of it tried to cloak myself in the therapists objectivity after a couple of hours the world they lived in began to overwhelm me in the past when working with children whod been traumatized id always taken pains to put the traumatic event in context isolating disaster as a freak bit of cruelty but looking into the knowing eyes of these kids listening to their experiences i heard myself faltering had to force a note of confidence into my voice my last class of the day was a rowdy bunch of sixth graders whose teacher hadnt shown up i let the frazzled substitute out on parole and was about to begin when the door opened and a young latina walked in she had teased frosted hair wore a tight knit scarlet dress and had matching inchlong nails her smile was glossy and happyface wide in one hand she carried a huge briefcase in the other a red purse hi kids she announced im dr mendez how are you all doing today the children looked at her then at me her gaze followed theirs hi she said to me im dr mendez im a clinical psychologist and you must be mr i held out my hand dr delaware im a clinical psychologist too her smile went stale um she said still staring at my hand the purse dropped from her hand the kids started laughing she bent awkwardly because of the tight dress and retrieved it they laughed harder i said hold on a minute guys and asked her to come out into the hall i closed the door she put her hands on her hips and said okay whats going on good question dr mendez im here to do therapy with them for the sniping so am i ive been doing it since yesterday i dont understand she said flustered the police called me in to investigate to help this makes no sense at all she said i said do you work with dr dobbs she pulled out an engraved business card and handed it to me patricia mendez ma cognitivespiritual associates inc two addresses on olympic boulevard in west la and in whittier four phone numbers tiny print at the bottom identified her as a psychological assistant to lance l dobbs phd and gave his license number i handed it back to her and said have you checked with the principal she should be able to clear things up she wasnt in but im here on authority of the school board theyre really in charge you know not the police i said nothing her briefcase was making her shoulder sag she lowered it to the floor i said i think you should check in with the principal anyway well she folded her arms across her breast i only know what i was told sorry you wasted time coming down here she frowned thought look im just here to do my job couldnt you go to another class these kids have been through plenty they need the comfort of routine predictability i can provide that she said by walking in right in the middle of my session fitting them to your agenda she tensed but smiled you seem to be coming from a hostile place possessiveness and you seem to be coming from a deceptive place ms mendez billing yourself as a doctor with just a masters degree pretending to be a psychologist when youre an assistant she opened her mouth closed it and opened it again tha thats just a technicality next year ill be a phd then next year youll be telling the truth if youre implying theres something how many classrooms have you been to so far seven didnt anyone mention id been there they didnt i you didnt really take the time to talk to them did you just blew in did your canned bit and blew out i looked down at the briefcase whats in there brochures youre a very hostile man she said a wave of laughter rose from inside the classroom then a thump overturned furniture i said look its been fun but i have to go until you check in with the principal and clear this up please stay away from the kids for their sake you cant order me and please think twice about misrepresenting yourself the board of medical examiners wouldnt be pleased is that a threat just sound advice she tried to look tough and failed miserably its my job she said almost pleading what am i supposed to do check in with the principal you keep saying that she said it keeps being a good idea i said turning the doorknob the sound on the other side grew louder just a minute she said are you bilingual no then how in the world are you going to help them their english is fine thats not what ive been told then youve been misled in more ways than one the sky was dimming as i left the yard i saw linda overstreet just outside the gate talking to the man with the cross trying to explain something to him he stared at the sidewalk then raised his head abruptly and seemed to swoon she backed away he moved toward her went nose to nose with her wagging his finger she attempted to talk back he talked over her gestured more wildly she finally gave up turned her back on him and walked away he opened a toothless black hole of a mouth and began shouting something raw and incoherent she made it to the gate before noticing me gave a whatcanido shrug stopped and waited until i caught up with her she was wearing a black linen dress simply cut suitable for mourning but the contrast with her blond hair and fair skin lent a touch of unintended glamour getting religion i said she grimaced crazy old jerk he showed up early this morning screaming about the whore of babylon suffer the children all this other garbage i tried to explain to him that the kids didnt need any more disruption but its like talking to cement he has this tape in his head keeps on playing it what about the school cop see him anywhere she said pointing to the unguarded gate gone at three wont stay a minute later and not much good when he is here standing around with his clipboard claiming hes not authorized to deal with old screamo as long as all he does is mouth off right to free speech and all that hes giving me a civics lesson the crossbearer howled louder what is it the phase of the moon she said brings them crawling out of the woodwork speaking of crawlies youve already made an enemy ms red dress she nodded she came bursting into my office on the verge of tears claiming youd humiliated her she gave her arm a dramatic wave what really happened i told her she said you really need this dont you try to help us out and get embroiled in all this political garbage i can take it in small doses i said the question is how do you stand it she sighed sometimes i wonder anyway dont worry about her i told her not to come back until i see the proper forms gave her a stack to fill out if theres a call from the board ill deal with it the way they deal with nuisances ignoring them putting them on hold memo blizzard by the time they take a meeting and decide what to do youll probably be finished and out of here and the kids will be all right howre they doing the ones that showed up are doing fine i said her face fell yes fiftyeight percent absent and my ears are still burning id like to think i was persuasive but lets face it how can i in good conscience tell them everything will be okay she shook her head i thought i saw her lip tremble but she covered it with a grimace wouldnt it be something if they finally won because of something like this she said some stupid crazy anyway dont let me keep you on your way out or in out im right over there she pointed across the street to a white ford escort i walked her to it she unlocked the car and put her briefcase inside i said id think the principal would get a private parking slot the principal usually does but the entire grounds are still closed off orders of the police no parking no foot traffic weve had to keep the kids inside for lunch and recess not that theyre exactly begging to go back out its important they do go back out i said to desensitize their fears of the yard how long did the police say they needed it closed they didnt no ones been here at all today collecting evidence or anything so i cant see the point i mean what could there be left to find out guess id better check it out meanwhile you have a nice evening i opened the car door a gentleman she said getting in how nice i searched her face for sarcasm saw only weariness the black dress had ridden up very long white legs take care i said closing the door see you tomorrow listen she said im heading out for some dinner nothing fancy but i wouldnt mind some company she blushed looked away jammed the key into the ignition and turned it the escorts engine came to life with a poorly tuned sputter belched and finally caught when it had settled to an idle i said i wouldnt mind some company either she blushed deeper uh just one thing youre not married or anything are you no i said neither married nor anything that probably sounds weird to you my asking before i could answer she said its just that i like to keep things straight give a wide berth to trouble okay i said her laugh was brittle not that its worked too well so far i followed her to a place of her choosing on broadway in santa monica allyoucaneat salad bar with enough produce to stock a county fair exhibit seafood on a grill lots of woodsmoke lazy fly fans alphonse mucha reproductions on paneled walls sawdust on the floor nothing really good or really bad budget prices we constructed our salads and took them to a back booth linda ate with enthusiasm went back for a refill when she finished the second bowl she sat back wiped her mouth and looked sheepish good metabolism she said do you exercise a lot not a fig lord knows my hips could use it i thought her hips looked fine but kept it to myself count your blessings the entrees came and we ate without talking comfortable with the silence as if we were old friends using the silence to decompress after a few minutes she said what do you think of the sniper being a girl and all it took me by surprise by the way one of your teachers mrs ferguson told me she knew her had taught her in sixth grade taught her at hale i nodded good old esme she didnt say a thing to me par for the course but if anyone would remember it would be her shes been around for years and shes a local all the rest of us are recent transfers or carpetbaggers as weve been called what else did she have to say about her just that she was odd her family was odd odd in what way she didnt get more specific didnt want to talk about it the ferg tends to get overwhelmed a little victorian she said to her odd could mean anything using the wrong fork at dinner but ill have a talk with her see what i can learn what about transcripts i said can you look them up there may be some old records but im not sure before we started busing the east side kids in the place was cleaned up most of the files were moved downtown ill check tomorrow how long have you been working at hale since last year they brought me in with the buses first assignment out of postdoctoral probation i think they sensed i was trouble wanted to get rid of me quickly and thought a few months at hale would do it i said it is a hell of a way to start she grinned fooled em and stuck it out too young and too dumb to know better same thing happened to me when i started out i said i was offered a very tough job right out of fellowship working with kids with cancer by the time i was twentyseven i was directing a program for two thousand patients overseeing a staff of a dozen trial by ordeal but looking back im glad i did it cancer how depressing it was at times but also uplifting lots of the kids went into remission some were cured more and more each year we ended up doing a lot of rehab helping families cope pain reduction sibling counseling clinical research that could be applied almost immediately that was satisfying seeing your theories come to life being useful in the short term i really felt i was doing some good making an impact twentyseven god how old were you when you got your phd twentyfour she gave a low whistle whiz kid huh nah just obsessive i started college at sixteen kept pushing sounds like false modesty to me she said actually i was sixteen when i started too but in my case it really was no big deal small school back in texas anyone with fluent english and half a brain skipped where in texas san antonio i said nice town i was there about ten years ago consulting to the med school took a river ride ate grits for the first time picked up a pair of boots remember the alamo she said gripping her coffee cup hard more chill time to veer onto a different road i said so here we are couple of precocious kids enjoying the fruits of success oh yeah she said still tense aint that a hoot what made you decide to stop teaching and go back for your doctorate i could give you all these highfalutin explanations but truth be told i wasnt a very good teacher not enough patience i found it hard to deal with the ones who werent bright i mean i could sympathize with them in the abstract but id grind my teeth waiting for them to come up with the right answer shrug not too compassionate huh compassionate enough to shift gears what choice did i have she said it was either that or become a witch and go home hating myself each night you on the other hand must have tons of patience with kids yes not always with the rest of the world so how come you dont do therapy anymore detective sturgis told me youre retired i was expecting an old guy i stopped a few years ago havent gotten back yet long story id like to hear it she said i gave her an abridged version of the last five years casa de los niños death and degradation getting overdosed on human misery dropping out living on real estate investments made during the california boom of the late seventies then redemption missing the joys of altruism but reluctant to commit to longterm therapy making a compromise limiting myself to timelimited consultations forensic referrals from lawyers and judges and cops she said just one cop milo and i are old friends i can understand that you both have that heat intensity wanting to do more than just coast by she laughed sheepish again hows that for sidewalk psychoanalysis doc ill take my compliments any way i can get em she laughed said real estate investments huh lucky you i dont know what id do if i didnt have to work i mean sometimes i really despise my job maybe id opt for club med full time your present job cant be too easy on the old patience true she said but at least now i can close my door get ticked off scream my head off throw something carlas tolerant i just didnt want to be losing it in front of the kids taking it out on them also what you were talking about the chance to do something to be effective on a largescale basis is appealing i mean if i can institute something systemic something that really works im affecting a couple of hundred kids at one time but what i really hate is knowing what has to be done knowing how to go about doing it and having all these stupid roadblocks thrown in my way she shook her head said i really hate bureaucrats then some days i sit back look at all the crap on my desk and realize i am one ever think of doing something else what and go back to school nosir im twentynine already comes a time you have to just settle down and bite the bit i wiped my brow twentynine whew ready for the old porch rocker sometimes i feel i could use one she said look whos talking youre not much older eight years older whoa grandpa tighten the truss and pass the geritol the waitress came over and asked if we wanted dessert linda ordered strawberry shortcake i chose chocolate ice cream it tasted chalky and i pushed it aside no good have some of this then she blushed again from the intensity of her color she might have offered me a bare breast i remembered how shed warded off compliments pegged her as afraid of intimacy distrustful nursing some kind of wound my turn at sidewalk analysis but then again why shouldnt she be reticent we barely knew each other i took some cake less out of hunger than not wanting to reject her she removed most of the whipped cream from her cake ate a strawberry and said youre easy to talk to how come youre not married theres a certain woman who could answer that for you i said she looked up there was a crumb of cake on her lower lip gee im sorry no reason to apologize no i really am sorry i didnt mean to pry well yes of course i did didnt i thats exactly what i was doing prying i just didnt realize i was prying into anything sore its okay i said just about healed we all have our sore spots she didnt take the bait divorce is so rotten she said common as brown sparrows but rotten just the same no divorce i said we were never married though we might as well have been how long were you together a little over five years im sorry no reason for you to apologize for that either i realized my tone was sharp irritation at doing all the revealing tension filled the space between us like an air balloon we busied ourselves with dessert let it deflate gradually when we were through she insisted on separate checks and paid with cash well dr alex delaware she said putting away her wallet its been edifying but ive got to get home and attack some paper will you be coming by tomorrow same time same station we stood she took my hand in both of hers that same soft submissive touch so at odds with the rest of her her eyes were soft coals burning i really want to thank you she said youre a very nice man and i know im not always the easiest person in the world to be around im not always joe mellow either face to face tight silence i wanted to kiss her contented myself with walking her to her car and watching the movement of her hips and legs as she got into it as she drove off i realized wed talked more about ourselves than the sniping but alone back in the seville thoughts of the sniping kept intruding i picked up an evening final at a eleven near barrington drove to westwood and north through the village and examined the front page as i waited out a red light at hilgard and sunset two photos one of the storage shed titled snipers lair the other a head shot of holly lynn burden shared center top to the right a point headline shouted sniper fire breaks out at school latch aide ends it children on playground flee in panic female sniper slain by councilmans staffer the head shot looked as if it had been taken from a high school yearbook white collar over dark sweater single strand of pearls starched pose same face id seen on the photocopied drivers license but younger some baby fat softening the edges longer hair flipped at the shoulders darkframed eyeglasses that same sullen dullness behind them the light turned green someone honked i put down the paper and joined the chromesurge onto sunset traffic was slow but insistent when i got home i started reading skimming the recap of the shooting slowing down when i got to the bio of the shooter holly burden had lived all nineteen years of her life in the house on jubilo drive sharing it with her father mahlon burden fiftysix a widower and selfemployed technical consultant the contents of the fathers police interview hadnt been made public and hed declined to talk to the press as had a brother howard burden thirty of encino through school board records the paper had found out about holly attending hale but didnt quote esme ferguson or anyone else who remembered her the future sniper had gone on to attend a nearby public junior high then pacific palisades high school where shed dropped out one semester short of a diploma guidance counselors had trouble remembering her but an adviser at the high school managed to locate grade transcripts showing her to have been a poor student with no participation in extracurricular activities the few instructors who remembered her at all described her as quiet unobtrusive one english teacher recalled shed had motivational problems wasnt academically oriented or competitive but hadnt participated in remedial programs not an alumna to brag about but no one had picked up the slightest hint of serious mental disturbance or violence neighbors along the quiet treelined street in this affluent west side district were a good deal more forthcoming speaking anonymously they described the burdens père et fille as unfriendly secretive not involved in the community they stuck to themselves mahlon burden was characterized as some kind of inventor some people think hes eccentric holly was termed a weird girl who hung around the house all day usually inside she never got any sun was white as a ghost no one really knew what she did with herself she was a dropout didnt go to school or do any kind of work there were rumors she was sick maybe it was mental the reporter used that maybe as a bridge to the next focus of the article guesswork about the state of holly burdens psyche proffered by the usual pack of experts willing to pontificate without benefit of data prominent among the guessers was dr lance l dobbs clinical psychologist and director of cognitivespiritual associates of west los angeles an authority on the psychological impact of childhood stress hired by the school board to treat the young victims at the school dobbs termed the dead girl a probable antisocial schizoidal personality or sociopath its the kind of aberrant character thats made not born and went on to lambaste society for not meeting the spiritual growth needs of its young people he described his treatment plan as a comprehensive and systematic program of crisis intervention including the use of bilingual therapists weve already begun working with the victims and have made excellent progress however based on prior experience we do predict severe reactions on the part of some youngsters they will have to be treated more intensively nevernever land the article ended with a profile of the hero of the day darryl bud ahlward fortytwo listed as councilman gordon latchs chief administrative assistant more than just a bodyguard unless that was latchs way of getting highpriced muscle on the city payroll and muscle did seem to be what ahlward was all about former marine drill instructor commando bodybuilder martial arts expert all of which fit the tightlipped macho posture id seen yesterday what didnt fit was that kind of cryptosoldier working for someone of latchs political pedigree apparently latch had been asked about it before explained it by citing a mutual rapport between bud and myself especially visàvis environmental issues i put the paper aside a pebbletoss of whos whats hows no whys i called my service for messages routine stuff except for a request to phone assemblyman samuel massengils office accompanied by two numbers one local one with a area code sacramento curious i phoned the la number got a recorded message expressing assemblyman massengils eagerness to be of service to his constituents followed by a list of other offices and numbers where many municipal and county services could be obtained thus avoiding contact with assemblyman massengil finally a beep i left my name and number and went to bed with a head full of questions at eightthirty the next morning i got a call from a woman with a laugh in her voice she introduced herself as beth bramble executive assistant to assemblyman samuel massengil thank you for returning our call doctor executive assistant i said bud ahlwards counterpart pause not quite dr delaware you dont have a black belt another pause briefer ive never known a psychiatrist with a sense of humor im a psychologist ah maybe that explains it what can i do for you ms bramble assemblyman massengil would like to meet with you for what purpose i really dont know doctor hes flying back up to sacramento this afternoon for a vote and would be pleased if you could join him this morning for coffee i assume this is about the hale school thats safe to assume she said whats a good time for you im not sure there is one my work with the children is confidential the assemblyman is well aware of that the last thing i want is to get involved in politics ms bramble i assure you doctor no one has any intention of corrupting you but you have no idea what this is about no im sorry i really dont just delivering the message would ninethirty be too early the invitation intrigued me but it smelled bad my instinct was to stay away given massengils temper it was a tricky situation reject him and he just might vent more of his spleen on the school then there was the matter of my curiosity i said ninethirtys okay where our district office is on san vicente in brentwood she gave me the address and thanked me for my cooperation after she hung up i realized the laugh had left her voice early in the conversation and never returned a blue plastic sign stamped with the state seal was visible just above the address numerals halfobscured by the leaves of a scrawny hibiscus the building was anything but imposing nothing remotely governmental about it two stories of white stucco moderne trimmed with sandcolored brick and sandwiched between a larger glassfronted medical structure and a minimall whose main attraction was a frozen yogurt parlor svelte people in sweats streamed in and out of the parlor concerned more with body tone than better government fronting the building was a towaway zone i turned the comer hooked into an alley and parked in a visitors slot pushing open an iron gate i stepped into more fresh air the basic garden office setup half a dozen suites on each floor each with its own entrance arranged in a right angle around a jungle of banana plants clump bamboo and asparagus fern the district office occupied two suites on the ground floor of the building its neighbors an insurance broker a graphic artist a travel agent and a publisher of technical manuals the door to the first suite instructed me to please use the door to the second before i had a chance to comply it swung open and a woman stepped out into the garden area she was in her mid to late thirties with blueblack hair drawn back and tied in a tight bun a full face icy graygreen eyes a fleshy mouth and ten pounds of extra weight in all the right places she wore a tailored black suit that flaunted the weight a white silk blouse and black string tie fastened by a huge smoky topaz the suit skirt ended at her knees her spiked heels were long and sharp enough to render grave bodily harm dr delaware im beth bramble her smile was as bright and durable as a camera flash wont you come in the assemblymans free i resisted the urge to ask if the assemblyman was also easy and followed her inside she swayed when she walked more flaunting and led me into a reception area soft spineless music flowed from an unseen speaker the furnishings were vintage highway motel woodgrain and mylar ostentatiously frugal the walls were limesherbet grasscloth hung with a few blurry nautical prints and rockwell reproductions but most of the vertical space was covered by photos scores of them framed in black massengil entertaining foreign dignitaries presenting trophies holding aloft official proclamations crowded with calligraphy gripping chromiumplated groundbreaking shovels doing the banquet circuit surrounded by alcoholglazed tuxedoed rubberchicken eaters and mixing with the people wheelchairtrapped oldsters sootyfaced firefighters children in halloween costumes athletic team mascots dressed as hyperthyroid animals she said hes a beloved man twentyeight years representing this district it sounded like a warning we made a sharp left turn came to a door marked private she rapped once opened it stepped back and ushered me in when the door closed she was gone the office was small and beige borderlineshabby massengil sat behind a plain scuffed walnut desk a gray suit jacket was draped over a gray metal file cabinet he wore a shortsleeved white shirt and tie the desk top was protected by a sheet of glass and bare except for two phones a legal pad and a bell jar of cellophanewrapped hard candies on the wall behind him were more photos and a diploma a fortyyearold degree in engineering from a state college in the central valley perpendicular to the desk was a hard brown sofa with wooden legs a man sat on it portly whitebearded loose face ruddy complexion santa claus with indigestion just like on tv another vested suit this one leadheavy loden green bunched up around the shoulders shiny gold watch chain and fob which he toyed with a flystraining melon of belly protruded beneath the points of the vest his shirt was yellow with a starched spread collar his tie a green paisley fastened in an enormous windsor knot he kept playing with the chain avoiding my eyes massengil stood dr delaware sam massengil appreciate your dropping by his voice was thin as charity soup louder than it had to be we shook hands his was large hard with callus and he squeezed my fingers a bit too tightly for the camaraderie he was trying to fake a man prone to excess though that didnt apply to fashion his shirt was washandwear out of the sale bin his tie a riot of powderblue eagles soaring across a beige polyester sky the short sleeves revealed arms too long even for his protracted body scrawny but knotted with muscle and coiled with white hairs arms lathed by manual labor a face sunspotted and wrinkled as dried fruit one side of the white toothbrush mustache was longer than the other as if hed shaved with his eyes closed he looked every day of his age but hard and fit railsplitting i couldnt see him jogging with the yogurt crowd he sat back down continued to look me over i said i didnt realize there were going to be three of us assemblyman yes yes this is a distinguished colleague of yours dr lance dobbs dr dobbs dr delaware ive seen dr dobbs on television dobbs gave a faint smile and nodded made no effort to rise or shake hands i said what can i do for you assemblyman massengil and dobbs exchanged glances have a seat wont you i took a chair facing the desk dobbs shifted position the better to study me and the brown couch squeaked massengil held up the bell jar candy no thanks no sign of the promised coffee how bout you lance dobbs took the jar palmed some candy unwrapped a green one and put it between his lips he made wet noises turning it between tongue and lips gazing past me over at massengil expectant i thought of a soft spoiled kid used to parental protection as if cued massengil cleared his throat and said we appreciate your coming down on such short notice doctor all in the interests of good government assemblyman he frowned exchanged another look with dobbs dobbs ate another candy and made a lateral move with his eyes some kind of signal i began to wonder about their relationship who was the parent massengil said well no sense shillyshallying obviously this is about the tragedy at the school its been some couple of days hasnt it doctor yes it has assemblyman now we know youve been working with those kids which is fine as it stands absolutely fine a smile that looked as if it hurt now exactly how did you get involved the police asked me to get involved the police another smile photoopportunity caliber i put a black frame around it i see i see wasnt aware the police did that kind of thing what kind of thing is that assemblyman referring to specialists getting involved in social welfare issues are you on some kind of official police referral list no one of the detectives is a friend of mine ive worked with traumatized children before he thought one of the detectives said massengil im a great friend of the police you know best friend they have in sacramento in fact crime bill needs pushing im the first one the police chief comes to county sheriff too he turned to dobbs was prompted again by a small nod so a detective referred you which detective might that be detective sturgis milo sturgis hes the new dthree the new supervising detective at westside robberyhomicide sturgis he said contemplative ah yes the big heavy fellow with the bad skin they didnt let him in when they conducted the interrogation throat clear another exchange of glances pause hes homasexual im told though you wouldnt know it to look at him he waited for an explanation when i offered none dobbs made a small satisfied sound as if id behaved predictably well said massengil is he is he what homasexual assemblyman i dont think detective sturgis sex life is no need to shillyshally sturgis sex life is common knowledge in the police department quite a bit of resentment too colleaguewise regarding his promotion his being in the department in the first place what with all the diseases and related hazards my nails were digging into the arms of my chair is there anything else assemblyman ive got to be getting over to the school ah the school hows it going with those youngsters fine thats good he leaned forward put his hands on the desk fingers blunt and splayed yellownailed let me ask you this pointblank you one too one what homasexual assemblyman i dont the thing is doctor everythings a real mess societally speaking i think we can all agree on that right my responsibility is to make sure things dont get any messier than theyve already gotten its a crazy world were living in punks shooting at elected public servants big government forcing alternative lifestyles down peoples throats moving children around like truck produce pushing ivory tower theories not backed up by real life experiences making no one happy at either end not the people or the youngsters you being in your line of work should know all about that though ive got to tell you it seems to me more often than not that people in your line of work forget all about reality push for thisn that quick fix here quick fix there causing more erosion he picked up the bell jar caressed it said erosion thats an important word the soils got a lot to teach us cause when you boil it all down were talking erosion of standards boundaries gradual but severely deleterious just like it is when the soil erodes everything boils down to that preservation or erosion what stays what goes this is my district son my responsibility for close to thirty years its been my responsibility i fly up and down between here and sacramento three times a week using airplanes the way other people use cars because this world we live ins a big one this district is the part of that world thats my responsibility and ive got to cover it know whats going on in terms of every part of it and when i see changes i dont likeerosion i step in he paused for dramatic effect a dimestore cicero dobbs said sam hold on a minute lance i want the doctor here to know where im coming from another big smile hows that for your contemporary lingo where im coming from and where im coming from is a posture of professional responsibility for my district wanting needing to know if standards are being compromised the boundaries loosened up any further wanting to know exactly whos in charge in charge of what systems systems of influence educational systems psychiatric treatment systems anything that influences impressionable young minds dobbs smiled and said dr delaware given what the children have been through we obviously need to make sure theyre being given optimal treatment we we said massengil my team dr dobbs is part of your team another flash of ocular morse code hes on the team said massengil boasting but sounding oddly defensive along with lots of other good people dobbs said ive worked extensively with the assemblymans staff management seminars you bet said massengil too quickly topnotch stuff he ticked off on his fingers foundations of character pathways to leadership spiritual growth in service of the soul dobbs smiled but seemed wary a drama coach watching the performance of an unreliable ingenue massengil said weve all of us benefited from dr dobbss input the whole staff has so you see were not opposed to your line of work per se as far as it goes but we just need to know whos doing it lance is someone we know and trust because he understands the real world the realities of the district real life and its spiritual underpinnings thats why he was asked to treat those kids after the earthquake why hes exceptionally qualified to treat these youngsters wide smile now all of a sudden youre involved which is fine as far as its gone we appreciate your enthusiasm and we thank you kindly but we dont know who you are what your background is i gave him my academic credentials using the long form he halflistened and stroked the bell jar sounds fine sir but you still havent answered the main important question i said am i gay no im not but detective sturgis is my friend do you think im in danger of catching it the creases around his eyes tightened into paper cuts and his fingers curled on the desk top clawing the glass whitening the horny nails but he kept smiling showed those brown teeth no telling what can be caught nowadays right bottom line were all after the same thing arent we whats that cleaning up the mess doing right by those youngsters seeing to it that they become good citizens im sure you want that just as much as we do now dont you doctor right now i said im less interested in teaching them civics than in helping them sleep through the night his smile faded dobbs said all assemblyman massengil is saying is that values are crucial when working with these children any children maintaining an order what kind of order a system of values being overt and aboveboard with ones personal value system is a necessity in clinical work one thats too olden neglected children need that kind of security the knowledge that their significant others believe in something surely you wouldnt disagree massengil said lets get down to brass tacks doc we greatly appreciate everything youve done im sure youve made a great start psychologywise from now on though lances people are gonna take over the way it was supposed to be in the first place i said i cant agree to that assemblyman breaking off and starting with someone new would only confuse the children further weaken whatever sense of security theyve rebuilt he gave his head a choppy wave dont you worry about that im sure lance will be able to remedy that absolutely said dobbs if youre using a standard crisisintervention mode it should be no problem to transfer from one attachment figure to i said come on doctor the last thing the children need is more unnecessary change before he could answer i stood and looked down at massengil assemblyman if youre really interested in their welfare keep your politics out of their lives and let me do my job massengil put his hands on the arms of his chair sucked in his breath and rounded his shoulders as if preparing to himself up but he stayed in place all the tension rising to his face compressing and darkening it like meat turned to pemmican in the sun politics eh like thats some sort of dirty word like its somehow criminal to want to serve god and country ive got news for you young man people dont want to hear that kind of libertine guff anymore they respect competence experience know who their leaders are where the bedrock lies he shook a finger at me if its politics you find so objectionable let me tell you something your homasexual friend got his promotion cause of politics he called you in cause of politics and this whole mess started in the first place cause of politicsthose kids and the agitators behind them are making a deliberate choice to bring politics into their lives every morning they get on that bus from boyle heights and head west so if you want to talk about politics lets talk about the whole damned picture i said im not concerned with any of that all i care about is helping them deal with being shot at wasnt them me i was the target because of what i stood for put in the crosshairs by some vicious radical punk trying to erode the boundaries is that what you told atd he hesitated for a moment looked at dobbs then back at me what i know is my business preservation and erosion fact is its about time someone took charge of that school set things right place is nothing but an open sore on the face of the district social experimentation at the expense of stability i try to talk straight about it and nearly get gunned down in cold blood theres your being shot at he was breathing hard and his fingers had left wet marks on the glass dobbs said sam assemblyman he made a faint wiggling motion with one hand then lowered it like a magician delevitating an assistant massengil settled back down and let out breath all right doctor said dobbs lets emphasize cooperation not confrontation work together id be happy to integrate you into my program all smiles i remembered what linda had told me about his earthquake program and shook my head that would be pointless dr dobbs im well into my treatment the children are responding well theres simply no reason to complicate things the smile lingered but turned condescending are you sure that isnt ego talking doctor not ego i said just good common sense a contradiction in terms if there ever was one dr delaware if good sense was common wed both be out of business wouldnt we same goes for good values values i said like truth in advertising he pursed his lips before he could get them in gear i turned to massengil and said yesterday at the school i met one of dr dobbss staff handing out cassette tapes misrepresenting herself as a psychologist and claiming a doctorate she didnt have two violations of the state business code assemblyman hows that for erosion massengil looked at dobbs dobbs laughed and said picayune sam a technical ity patty mendez is a good gal but green not wellversed yet in all the red tape the bureaucrats throw at us dr delaware here was pretty rough on her ive talked to her set her straight massengil stared at him for an instant then swung his eyes back to me you heard that lets not go making a mountain out of a molehill how about we get back on track said dobbs gently right said massengil i want lance involved one way or the other plain and simple i looked at dobbs selfsatisfied in control suddenly i understood all the crossglances hand signals the bond between them went beyond management seminars what they had was deeper something with a parentchild flavor to it it explained the odd defensiveness massengil had shown when id asked about dobbss being on his team weve all of us benefited the whole staff all of us not just me patient and therapist the bedrock of the community baring his psyche to santa claus why not psychotherapy under the guise of management seminars would be a nifty cover legitimizing dobbss presence in massengils office and sparing massengil the trip to the doctors office spiritual growth in service of the soul mindprobing disguised as brainstorming the bills could be laundered among the office invoices massengils thin voice snapped me back to the present making another speech more gobbledygook about values i said gentlemen if thats all im on my way and i expect to finish what i started without further interruption youre making a big mistake said massengil a damned big one no you are i said loud enough to surprise all three of us the latest in a series of mistakes like using the school exploiting those youngsters to further your own agenda obsessing on trivial nonsense when there are so many important issues to deal with and if you are right about being the target you did a lot worse than that you drew a killer to that yard put those kids in mortal danger massengil shot up and came around the desk you snotty fag bastard froth had collected in the corners of his mouth flecks of it flew as he talked and one of them settled on his tie dobbs looked pained sam he said struggling to his feet trying to restrain the older man but massengil was strong for his age and fueled by rage the two of them wrestled awkwardly for a moment then dobbs said sam sharply and massengil stopped struggling he glowered at me from behind dobbss sloping loden shoulder loudmouthed snot dobbs turned and gave me a lookwhatyouvedone glare i said you have a very impolitic temper assemblyman massengil said dont worry lance hes out youre in got my word on it plain and simple i said assemblyman heres something plain and simple the slightest attempt to interfere with my treatment and im going straight to the press they dont have many facts on the shooting itself and you can bet theyll be overjoyed to pick up a juicy side angle political meddling massengil surged forward now you just dobbs held him back but gave me a threatening look himself i walked to the door so juicy theyll drool assemblyman doctors who arent doctors a crisis intervention program that hasnt begun despite dr dobbss inspired little tv speeches a nonprogram that your office has already paid for sounds like poor fiscal policy at best multiple fraud at worst someones going to want to know why why the connection between you and dr dobbs is so strong that youre willing to stretch this far at the very least therell be an ethics investigation you know how those things get when they pick up momentum so lets see if those hungry newshounds think its picayune the color drained from massengils face dobbss face froze he picked up his watch fob and began rubbing it hard i turned my back on them and left beth bramble was outside the office smoking a long pink silvertipped cigarette everything go okay she said smiling squeezing the laugh back in peachy keen my jaws ached from tension and my voice was hoarse she stopped smiling looked back at the office door dont worry hes all right i said still beloved good show of cool but as i walked to the seville the anger hit me i found a pay phone near the yogurt place and put in a call to milo he was out and i left a message to phone i went inside bought a cup of coffee drank it and took a refill while standing at the counter lots of ambient conversation about pulse rates mine was racing i got out of there and drove to the school traveling slowly trying to settle down arriving a little before eleven still keyed up and not ready to face the kids i parked did a little deep breathing and got out of the car both the school cop and the crossbearer were gone as i walked toward the gate a car came tooling slowly down the street silvergray compact honda accord in need of a wash the body dimpled and scarred the finish not much shinier than primer but a single display of kaliforniakustom flair caught my eye gleaming blackened windows that wrapped around the car like electricians tape making the lackluster paintwork appear even more tarnished windows that would have seemed more in place on a stretch limo the little gray car stopped to let me cross lingered and continued cruising for a block before turning left i walked onto the school grounds linda was in her office behind a pile of paperwork when she saw me she swiveled stood and smiled she was wearing a blue oxford buttondown shirt and khaki skirt brown boots with sensible low heels the bit of leg that showed was smooth and white her hair was swept back and fastened at the temples with tortoiseshell barrettes revealing small closeset ears adorned with tiny gold studs hi youre early she said pushing aside some papers got thrown off my schedule deep breathing or not there was still ire in my voice she said what is it i told her about the confrontation with massengil and dobbs leaving out the part about milos sexuality the bastards she said and sat back down trying to profit from tragedy i took a chair opposite her thats what you get for being a nice guy she said i wasnt such a nice guy half an hour ago when massengil started leaning on me things got hot hope i didnt make things worse for you dont worry about it she sounded weary how much damage can he do nothing in the immediate other than make more noise which is unlikely after the shooting she thought for a moment i guess he could try to screw the school budget when it comes up next year in sacramento but it would be hard for him to target hale specifically so dont worry about it just keep doing your thing hes a strange one i said really rough around the edges not at all wellspoken whatd you expect a statesman some sophistication polish hes been at it for twentyeight years on top of the crudeness hes got a nasty temper surprising hes lasted this long he probably knows who to punch out and who to kiss up to thats the whole game isnt it and over twentyeight years hes fixed plenty of potholes besides being rough around the edges probably works well here the whole cowboy thing hes got to have something going i said hasnt had any opposition for the last two elections i know cause im a constituent i keep leaving the space blank im a constituent too i write in alfred e newman i smiled she said might we be neighbors sir i live up in beverly glen beverly glen and where north of sunset up toward mulholland mmm real pretty up there she said way out of my league all ive got is a little hutch near westwood and pico mischievous smile guess neither of us loyal constituents has much chance of getting our potholes fixed better learn to mix your own asphalt i said or cozy up to dr dobbs speaking of which she said and took something off her desk and handed it to me it was a cassette tape white plastic with black lettering that had smeared the title was keeping a clear mind ages copyright lance dobbs phd cognitivespiritual associates inc this is what little miss phony doc was handing out before you aced her she said i confiscated all of them took one home and listened to it last night far as i can tell what it comes down to is brainwashing literally dobbs goes on about how bad thoughts make children sad and angry then he tells them to imagine their mommies taking their brains out and scrubbing them hard with soap and water until theyre all clean all the bad thoughts are gone and whats left are good clean sparkly thoughts sounds hokey to me is there any way something like that could be beneficial doubtful i said techniques like that have been used with chronically ill people positive thinking guided imagery trying to get them to focus away from their discomfort but generally those patients are screened and counseled first encouraged to express their feelings before they try to clean their heads thats what our kids need right now to unload so youre saying this could hurt them jam them up if they took it too seriously it could also cause guilt problems if they started to view their fear and anger as bad to kids bad means theyve misbehaved damn quacks she said glaring at the cassette was there anything on the tape that would hold a childs interest not that i heard she said just some ditsy music in the background and dobbs droning on like some kind of oily guru real low budget then theres probably not much risk the kids wouldnt sit through it long enough to be damaged hope so low budget i said just like massengils interior decorating i can see why that kind of thing would appeal to him a quick fix no mucking around with anything psychologically threatening and outwardly costeffective two hundred kids treated at one time dobbs could probably rig up some computerized test showing the kids were doing great then the two of them throw a press conference and end up heroes i put the tape in my pocket ill take it home and give it a listen she said what really burns me is the grief we go through trying to get mental health funds out of the legislature theyre always demanding outcome studies proof of efficacy pages of statistics then a creep like dobbs gets his mouth on the government tit with this kind of nonsense thats because the creep has a special in what i cant be certain but id be willing to bet hes massengils therapist she lowered her chin and raised her eyebrows old blowhard in analysis cmon you just said he wouldnt go for anything psychologically threatening he wouldnt dobbs probably couches it in nonthreatening nontherapeutic terminology musclerelaxation training management efficiency or even something quasireligious one of the seminars had something to do with the soul down on the old knees and emote whatever it is im pretty sure theres something going on between them i told her what id seen of the interchange between dobbs and massengil the cues and covert looks when i hinted at exposing the nature of their relationship massengil almost lost his cookies oh boy she said theres a charming image for you she touched a finger to her lips wonder what kink hes having straightened maybe its temper control or relief of some kind of stressrelated symptom like hypertension dobbs seemed accustomed to calming him down and massengil obeyed him as if theyd practiced together a minor league eagleton she said shaking her head wouldnt play too well with the good folks of ocean heights would it hence the seminar cover i said and extra payoffs to dobbs for being discreet like referrals after the earthquake and the tapes how much you want to bet massengils office paid for them for a minor investment massengils buying the chance to come out of this whole thing smelling fragrant he and dobbs had no way of knowing id get there first after dobbs had already started talking to the press the scandal potential is there at the very least massengil would look like a damn fool she shook her head same old story youd think id get used to it i hope all of this hasnt soured you too much i realized that talking about it had leeched the anger out of my system dont worry ive seen worse anyway im here to work how many kids showed up a few more than yesterday but not nearly enough a lot of the parents couldnt be reached by phone during working hours carla and i will try again tonight i noticed how tired she looked and said nice to see you havent been soured she examined a cuticle one does what one can i said i see the school guard is gone must mean were safe huh you dont feel safe actually i do i truly believe massengil brought things to a head the worst is over the look on her face didnt jibe with her words i said what is it then she opened a drawer pulled out a manila envelope and handed it to me inside were three sheets of paper one blueruled and torn from a spiral notebook the others cheap white stationery unmarked the message on one of the white sheets had been typewritten on an old manual the other was handwritten in very dark penciled block letters the blueruled sheet was covered with birdscratch redballpoint cursive different hands the same message spick lover fuck you mongrel racemixer biches your day of reckon is soon repent or burn with all nigger types in damn nigger hell illeagals go back to beanerland no more stealing jobs from american working people white peoples liberation front she said i used to get this kind of swill regularly but it had stopped guess it brings back memories of how rough things were in the beginning have you told the police she nodded i called that detective from the terrorist squad frisk he had me read all of it to him over the phone said hed send someone over to pick up the letters but he didnt sound too hurried kind of bored actually didnt care that id gotten my fingerprints all over it or that carla had thrown out the envelopes i asked him about putting the guard back on duty just for a while the guy was no great shakes but better than nothing right frisk said the guard had been supplied by the school district and it was out of his bailiwick but that it really didnt seem to be anything to worry about the perpetrator had acted alone i asked him what about copycats and he said that was highly unlikely did you tell him about the crossbearer old elijah thats how i think of him crazy prophet down from the hills i mentioned it but frisk said there was nothing he could do unless the turkey actually broke a law or unless i went to court and got a restraining order incidentally he showed up again this morning elijah shouting through the fence about hell and perdition i went out to him and told him hed done good work here everyone had heard the word then i asked if i could read his bible with him he jumped on that turned to something from jeremiah death and destruction of the holy temple you should have seen the two of us reciting out on the sidewalk after we finished i told him he should check out hollywood boulevard lots of needy spirits aching for salvation over there he called me a woman of valor blessed me and marched away singing when i stopped laughing i said crisis intervention youve got the knack doctor right all the time i was stroking the morons ego what i really wanted to do was give him a good kick in the pants any word from frisk on when the kids will be allowed back in the yard theyre allowed as of this morning when he said there was nothing to worry about securitywise i asked him about releasing the yard he said oh yeah sure go ahead hed clearly forgotten about it no big deal to him that weve had to keep two hundred kids cooped up we are not talking paragon of sensitivity i said did he have anything more to say about the shooting not a blessed thing and i asked did you tell him about ferguson knowing the burden girl she nodded he said to have her phone him that same bored tone doing me a great big favor old esme called in sick so i phoned her at home and delivered the message while i had her on the line i asked her what she remembered about the girl didnt turn out to be much holly was a loner not very bright tended to space out in class had trouble learning but she did have one nugget of gossip the girl had a black boyfriend old esme lowered her voice when she delivered that as if i cared as if it really mattered now she also said the fathers got a reputation for being a little strange works out of his house some kind of inventor no ones really sure how he supports himself incidentally i did paw through our old records and found nothing on her apparently all the records that old were brought downtown i called downtown and they informed me a manual search was being made of her transcripts anything to do with her was classified information orders of the police a boyfriend i said you think thats significant not that he was black but if the relationship was relatively recent he might be able to tell us something about hollys state of mind did ferguson say anything else about him besides that he was black just that capital b when i didnt comment on it esme started making flu noises and i hung up somehow i sense shes not your favorite person im sure its mutual shes a grind biding her time until pension i wouldnt count on getting any insight from her on the burden girl or anything else i said speaking of insight has ahlward or anyone else from latchs office called yet about what visàvis informational flow i said in a puffedup voice we good folks were supposed to get anything we wanted as soon as the police gave the old green light right promises promises not that it matters at this point in fact its better hes stayed away the kids dont need any more political involvement neither do the adults she said the noon bell rang outside in the hallway loud enough to vibrate the office walls i got up time to heal young minds she walked me to the door in terms of reaching the parents i dont know if friday gives us enough time how about monday monday would be fine i said okay well keep calling i want you to know i really appreciate all youre doing she looked beaten i felt like putting my arms around her instead i smiled and said onward non illegitimati carborundum ah on top of everything else the mans a latin scholar sorry prof i took spanish i said inscription on ancient roman tomb dont let the bastards wear you down she threw back her head and laughed i kept the sound in my head as i went to class the children greeted me with eagerness talking freely i had the younger ones build replicas of the storage shed with blocks manipulate figurines representing holly burden ahlward the teachers themselves acting out the shooting over and over until boredom set in and visible anxiety diminished the older students wanted to know what had caused holly burden to go bad caused her to hate them i assured them she hadnt targeted them had been deranged out of control regretted having little with which to back that up a sixthgrader said what made her crazy no one knows i thought that was your job knowing what makes people crazy i said trying to know theres still a lot we dont understand about craziness i got an aunt whos crazy said a girl she got it from you said the boy next to her and they were off i walked out of the last classroom sapped but feeling a sense of accomplishment wanted to share that feeling with linda and brighten up her day but her office was locked and i left the school as i got in the seville i noticed a car turn a corner and approach slowly silvergray honda dirty black windows it pulled up alongside me stopped i powerlocked the seville the honda remained in place engine idling then suddenly drove off i snapped my head around and made out four digits and three letters of a license number held the information in my head until i could retrieve pen and paper from my briefcase and write it down then i sat there trying to figure it out some kind of intimidation or just a curious local checking out the carpetbaggers i thought of the racist filth linda had shown me and wondered if there could be a connection i looked over at the school grounds graying in the autumn twilight a handful of students remained in the yard waiting to be picked up playing under the watchful eyes of a teachers aide the school buses were gone transporting kids from suburbia back to the mean streets but which streets were meaner i watched the children frolic enjoying their newly paroled schoolyard hide and seek kickball hopscotch losing themselves in the game of the moment so trusting it hurt i looked up and down the street before pulling out drove home too fast and kept checking my rearview mirror the first thing i did when i got in the house was pick up the phone and dial west la robberyhomicide this time the new dthree was in hey alex got your message tried to call kind of crazy right now strange things are happening milo lets talk sure later he said in a voice that let me know he wasnt alone let me handle a few things and ill get back to you on that he rang the bell shortly before seven and operating on reflex went straight into the kitchen i stayed on the leather sofa watching the roundup of the news nothing new on the shooting just closeups of holly burdens yearbook picture a school board official reporting that a detailed and extensive manual search of several years of school records had confirmed her attendance and graduation from nathan hale elementary school but revealed no new insights then more psychiatric speculation including one theory that shed returned to hale to take revenge for some imagined slight when asked to fill in the details the psychiatrist demurred saying he was speaking theoretically in terms of classical psychodynamic wisdom dobbs came on again in a segment that looked prerecorded caressing his watch fob still talking about his treatment program at hale blasting society i wondered how long hed keep up the charade milo returned with a comice pear in his mouth one of a dozen sent me each year as a gift by a grateful patient now living in oregon he chomped nice to see youre buying good healthy food again all for you i said nutrition for a growing boy he patted his belly and sat down scowling the camera drew back from dobbss rubber face the psychologist was stroking his beard had put on a sad sanctimonious expression part mourner part huckster milo snorted and began humming jingle bells i said yeah the resemblance is striking but this guys no saint better be careful he knows if youre naughty or nice dobbss pronouncements on spirituality dissolved into a commercial milo stretched his feet out and said okay you promised me strange time to deliver i started with my encounter with massengil and dobbs he said i dont know that id classify any of that as strange alex seems like good old politics as usual the asshole feels the school is his turf wants his boy in on anything that goes on there you have to think like these guys do powers their dope youve infringed of course hes gonna get offended so what should i do about it not a goddam thing what can he do to you not much i said but he might be able to do something to you he talked about how your promotion had caused resentment im quaking milo said and wiggled his hand but hes right in one regard the troops are not happy with my ascension up the administrative ladder one thing to tolerate a faggot whole other ball of wax to take orders from one make things worse the other dthrees are getting antsy with my approach to the job most of them are your basic desk jockeys marking off time my wanting to work the streets makes them look like the comatose slugs they are the only other guy who stays active is the homicide dthree out in west valley but hes a bornagain doesnt like deviates so theres no bonding potential there still no sense pissing and moaning right dont do the crime if you cant hack the slime besides getting rid of me would be more trouble than its worth departments like one of those dinosaurs with the peasized brains impossible to budge real easy to get around if you watch your step so dont worry about me do your job and forget it thats exactly what linda said he grinned linda were on firstname basis hoohoo down rover linda all that fluffy blond hair the southern accent but feisty gives her an appealing edge not a bad choice at all pal time for you to be getting back into the social swing anyway no ones made any choice uhhuh he made rude sounds leenda muy leenda hows rick fine dont change the subject i said thats exactly what im going to do i told him about the silver honda he looked unimpressed what did it do other than stop for a few minutes nothing but the timing was weird it was there when i arrived driving by when i left maybe someone thinks youre cute alex or could be its just one of the locals playing paranoid posse checking out the neighborhood for strangers thinking youre the weirdo could be if it would make you feel better he said give me the license number i did and he copied it down service with a smile he said anything else i can do for you i said massengil seemed sure he was the target you hear anything backing that up nothing not that frisk has opened his files to me maybe the old coot knows something but whats more likely is that hes got an inflated sense of selfworth thinks hes actually worth shooting or maybe hes the paranoid one and thats what santas treating him for he ate more pear said some milk would go well with this and went to get some he returned drinking out of the carton something else you should know about i said and told him about the hate mail your basic bedbugs he said too bad she has to go through it she said frisk didnt take it too seriously to tell the truth alex theres not much you can do with that kind of garbage now if it turns out the burden girl was affiliated with some racist group thatll be different would frisk tell you if she was not until after he put on his giorgio suit smiled into the camera and told the greater metropolitan area first but chances are if she was highly political hed know already atds got everything computerized would have moved on her known associates and i would have heard it through the old interoffice rumor transport system is there anything now you can tell me about her milo the kids are asking ive learned a few things by way of my source at the coroners but i doubt its the kind of info thatll help you she was wearing black jeans sweater shoes everything down to the undies sounds like a commando getup or ninja nutcase or her taste in couture ran to basic black and a string of bullets or maybe she just didnt want to be seen in the dark who the hell knows what else yeah she was clean drugwiso and boozewise an intact virgin in excellent physical health prior to being perforated stomach contents showed shed eaten around six the previous evening there was a paper cup with urine in it in the shed the chemical composition of the pee implied shed been camped out there some time during the night sipping and waiting sound like something you want to tell the kids i shook my head i learned something too she had a black boyfriend he put down the milk carton oh yeah whered you hear that one of the teachers at hale lives in the neighborhood taught her years ago she told linda about the boyfriend and linda told me linda told frisk but he wasnt any more interested than hed been in the hate mail he ran his hand over his face boyfriend huh active or ex thats what i wanted to know if he was recent he might know something right but the teacher never said not that active anyway he said the intact virgin part got a name no just what i told you well he said interracial datings no crime officially i thought back to the hate mail racemixer biches even casual interracial dating would be considered a felony in ocean heights milo meaning she might have gotten a lot of social punishment for it nasty comments ostracization or worse and it also implies she was anything but a racist wouldnt have been likely to be shooting at those kids unless she and the boyfriend had a nasty breakup and she started resenting all minorities maybe i said heres a more likely scenario what if coming face to face with local racism radicalized her and turned her against someone she viewed as racist a racist authority figure massengil maybe she and massengil even had some kind of confrontation before the shooting something hed never admit to you should have seen how he reacted when i accused him of drawing a killer to the school milo it definitely struck a nerve with his temper even a minor confrontation with her could have gotten ugly combine that with her history of psychological problems by the way where did frisk come up with that he shook his head in disgust i resolved to stop evoking feelings of impotence anyway i said mix those elements and youve got something potentially explosive it would explain why massengil was so sure he was the intended target milo thought about it said guess its feasible but good luck proving it i said dont you think its worth talking to the boyfriend checking out known associates sure but its possible frisk has already done it he didnt mention it to linda he wouldnt guy would swear off orgasms if it gave him the upper hand he who dies with the most secrets wins you got it must be a blast working with him oh yeah like a cattle prod to the prostate anyway whats this teachers name esme ferguson she teaches fourth grade she called in sick this morning you can get her home number from linda he copied down the name she have anything else to say about the late ms burden lousy student used to space out in class not too social fits with what the neighbors told the papers about her hanging around the house all day how he said does she meet a black guy if she spends all her time just hanging around the house in that neighborhood good question he closed his pad put it back in his pocket only good question my friend is one that can be answered profound yeah someone profound said it heidegger krishnamurti or maybe it was harpo marx squeak squeak he finished the pear with two ferocious bites and emptied the milk carton sounds more like zeppo i said care for some dessert after he left i listened to the white cassette the contents were nothing that would have intrigued a gradeschooler synthesized harp music that sounded as if it had been recorded underwater and dobbs talking in the syrupysweet patronizing tone people who dont really like kids put on when they talk to them the gist of the message was play ostrich clean your brain blot out reality in order to make it go away pop psych in all its superficial glory freud would have turned over in his grave b f skinner wouldnt have pushed the reward button i turned off the tape recorder ejected the cassette and lobbed a twopointer into the nearest wastebasket wondering how much dobbs charged per tape how many copies hed peddled to the state via massengils expense account the phone rang i took it in the kitchen hi alex its me a voice that had once soothed me then cut me first time id heard it in months hello robin she said im working late waiting for some lacquer to dry just wanted to see how youre doing im doing fine how about yourself lets hear it for sparkling repartee she said im fine too burning the midnight oil the irish spinners just got into town for a concert at mccabes the airline damaged a bunch of their instruments and im doing the repairs ouch i said imagining my old martin guitar in splinters emergency surgery i feel like a surgeon the poor guys were devastated and theyve been hanging around the shop looking over my shoulder i finally shooed them away so now they stay outside in the parking lot pacing and wringing their hands like relatives waiting for a prognosis how is the prognosis nothing a little hot glue and artful splicing shouldnt be able to fix how about you whatve you been up to repair work also i told her about the sniping my sessions with the children oh that alex those poor little kids how are they doing surprisingly well not surprising theyre in the best of hands but wasnt there another psychologist talking about it on tv hes limited himself to talk which is all for the best he didnt impress me either too glib lucky for the kids they got you actually i said the main reason theyre coping relatively well is theyve grown up with violence seen lots of hatred how sad well i think its great youre getting involved with them using your talents silence alex i still think about you a lot i think about you too as little as possible i i was wondering do you think its reached a point where we could get together sometime to talk as friends i dont know i realize im coming at you out of left field with this its just that i was thinking about how rare friendship is between men and women part of what we had was friendship best friendship why do we have to lose that why cant that part of it be preserved makes sense intellectually but not emotionally i dont know more silence alex i wont keep you just take care of yourself okay you too i said then stay in touch you mean that sure i said not knowing what i meant she wished the kids at hale well and hung up i stayed up and watched bad movies until sleep overtook me sometime after midnight the santa ana winds arrived in the darkness i awoke on the sofa and heard them shrieking through the glen sucking the moisture out of the night my eyes felt gritty and my clothes were twisted around me not bothering to remove them i made it to the bedroom crawled under the covers and collapsed sunrise brought a glorious thursday morning skies scoured and buffed a perfect delft blue trees and shrubs varnished a luminous christmas green but the view through the french doors had the jarring cold perfection of a computerfabricated old master i felt sluggish drugged by dream residue confusing hyperactive images had embedded themselves in my subconscious like fishhooks too much pain to tug them loose time to play ostrich i dragged myself into the shower as i was toweling off milo called ran the plates on the honda the car is an registered to a new frontiers technology limited post office box in westwood ring any bells new frontiers i said no sounds like some kind of hightech outfit which would make sense if the driver was one of the locals whatever meanwhile thought you might want to know ive got an appointment this saturday with mrs esme ferguson her residence at two tea and sympathy pinkies extended i thought frisk was doing all the interviewing he has first dibs but he never called her hes just about ready to close the case apparently nothing politicals come up on burden in anyones files no criminal record not even a parking ticket no funny phone calls that can be traced from her home to anywhere else no job at massengils or latchs so theyre considering it a nut job and are ready to file it as a solve isnt it nice when things go smoothly back at hale by ten several dozen children were out on the yard for morning recess running climbing hiding seeking the asphalt sparkled like granite under an unencumbered sun i finished my group sessions by noon reserving the rest of the day for individual evaluations of the children id tagged as highrisk after a couple more hours of evaluation i decided five of them would be okay the rest could use oneonone treatment after spending another couple of hours doing play therapy supportive counseling and relaxation training i checked in lindas office carla was going through a pile of forms her punkdo was wrapped in a blue bandana and she looked around twelve years old dr overstreets downtown she said at a meeting poor dr overstreet her smile seemed less carefree than usual any of dr dobbss people been by i said no but someone else has she put her finger in her mouth and made a gagme gesture who she told me where probably one of the classrooms your guess is as good as mine i didnt have to guess i heard the music as i walked down the hall awkward attempts at blues riffs tooted on a harmonica with warped reeds i pushed open the classroom door and found a dozen or so fifthgraders looking quieter than id ever seen them gordon latch was sitting on the desk legs folded yogistyle jacket off tie loosened sleeves rolled to his wrists a chromatic mouth organ was in one hand the other caressed his graybrown mop of hair behind him stood bud ahlward wearing a charcoalcolored sack suit back to the chalkboard arms across his bulky chest expressionless he was the first to notice me then latch turned smiled and said dr delaware come on in and join the party the teacher was sitting at the back of the room pretending to grade papers one of the younger ones just out of training quiet with a tendency to be underassertive she looked up at me and shrugged the room had gone silent the kids were staring at me latch said hey guys put the harmonica to his lips and blew a few bars of oh susanna ahlward tapped one wingtipped foot concentrating as if keeping rhythm required great effort latch closed his eyes and blew harder then he stopped gave the kids a wide smile a few of them squirmed i walked toward the desk latch lowered the harmonica and said bud and i thought it would be useful to drop by give these guys a chance to ask questions halfwink lowered voice visàvis our prior discussion i see brought ld too he said hefting the harmonica turning back to the kids he gave a cheerleader flourish with the harmonica hand whats ld stand for guys rustling from the seats childish mumbles right said latch little dylan toot inhale toot old ld here had him since berkeley thats a college up north near san francisco guys any of you know where san francisco is nothing latch said they had a giant earthquake there a long time ago big fire too theyve got a great big chinatown there and the golden gate bridge any of you hear of the golden gate bridge no volunteers anyway old ld here is my little trusted musical buddy he helped me get through some long days days with lots of homework you know about homework dont you a few nods ahlward lifted one foot and inspected the bottom of his shoe latch said so anything you guys want to hear silence ahlward uncrossed his arms and let them dangle latch said nothing at all a boy in the back said bon jovi living on a prayer latch clicked his tongue a couple of times tried a few notes on the harmonica and moved it away from his lips shaking his head sorry amigo thats not in my repertoire i said councilman could i talk to you for a moment privately privately huh mugging for the kids he lowered his voice to a stage whisper sounds pretty mysterious huh a few children responded with shaky smiles most remained stolid up at the chalkboard ahlward had crossed his arms again and was alternating his gaze between the view out the window and a spot on the rear wall over the heads of the children bored and watchful at the same time i cleared my throat latch checked his wristwatch and slipped the harmonica into his shirt pocket sure dr delaware lets talk full wink hang in there guys he got off the desk flipped his jacket over one shoulder and came my way i held the door open for him and we stepped out into the hall ahlward followed us silently but remained in the doorway of the classroom latch gave him a short nod and the redheaded man closed the door resumed the foldedarms secret service stance and looked up and down the corridor a reflexive watchdog latch pressed his back flush against the wall and bent one leg the harmonica sagged in his pocket the lenses of his welfare glasses were crystalclear the eyes behind them restless good group of kids he said yes they are they seem to be handling things pretty well thats true too though it seems to me he said that theyre a bit understimulated not to know where san francisco is the golden gate bridge the systems failing them has a long way to go before it does right by them i said nothing he said so whats on your mind alex i said with all due respect to your intentions councilman it would be best to let me know the next time youre planning to drop in he seemed puzzled whys that important to you not me them to keep things predictable how so they need consistency need to feel a stronger sense of control over their environment not have any more surprises thrown at them he lifted his glasses with one hand and rubbed the bridge of his nose with the other i noticed that the skin behind the freckles was ruddy tinged with bronze since the sniping hed taken some sun when the spectacles were back in place he said maybe we got our signals crossed alex but i thought this was exactly what you wanted exactly what you said you wanted that first time we met accurate information firsthand information bypassing the red tape bud and i have been cleared by the cops in terms of informational flow so i figured why not what i had in mind was something a little more organized i said he smiled going through channels thats not always a bad idea no of course not the thing is alex this wasnt really planned believe it or not we public servants do get spontaneous once in a while grinning he waited until i smiled back then said what happened was bud and i were literally in the neighborhood driving down sunset on our way from a meeting in the palisades keeping the developers in check give those boys a free rein and the whole coastline will be a strip mall inside of a month it was a hellacious couple of hours but we came out of it better than when we went in and i was feeling pretty good about my job thats not always the case so when bud mentioned that we were coming up on ocean heights i said to myself why not it had been on my mind to get back here soon as the police cleared us but id been too caught up with backlog dealing with the investigation set me back a couple of days things really piled up but i felt badly about not keeping my word so i told him to turn off use the time we did have profitably i understand councilman gordon i appreciate what you wanted to do gordon but with all these kids have been through its best to coordinate things coordinate huh his blue eyes stopped moving and got hard why do i feel all of a sudden as if im back in school myself being called into the principals office thats not what i intend coordinate he said looking away from me and giving a short hard laugh that percussed in his chest and died before it got to his throat go through channels thats exactly the kind of thing we tell taxpayers when they come up to the mike in council chambers and ask us for something we dont intend to give them i said what exactly is your plan gordon he turned back to me my plan i just told you there was none your intention then in terms of the kids my intention he said was to break the ice with a little help from ld then field their questions give them a chance to throw stuff at me anything they want give them a chance to find out the system can work for them once in a while give them the opportunity to learn from bud what it feels like to be a hero my intention was to listen to their feelings and share mine what it felt like to be under fire the fact that were all in this together wed better pull together or the planets in trouble i was just about to get into that when you came in sidestepping the reproach i said were you planning to do that in every class sure why not to do it thoroughly might take quite a bit of time several days the media are bound to find out youre here once they do we run the risk of more commotion the media can be handled he said quickly my only goal is to protect the little guys from what not what alex whom the users people whod think nothing of exploiting them for personal gain he emphasized the last three words and paused shot a knowing look over at ahlward who remained stoic the sad thing is he said with what theyve experienced here what theyve seen of the political process they run a heavy risk of growing up cynical uninvolved which doesnt bode well for us as a society does it were talking stagnation alex to the extent that that kind of thing takes over on a large scale were really in trouble so i guess what i want is for them to see that there can be another side to politics that theres no need to stagnate or give up from erosion to stagnation my second dose of political rhetoric in as many days i said another side as opposed to the one represented by assemblyman massengil he smiled i wont kid you my opinions on assemblyman massengil are public record the mans a dinosaur part of an era that should be longforgotten and the fact that hes involved has made me take a special look at this situation this citys changing the entire state is the world is theres a new age of transworld intimacy that wont be stopped were inexorably linked to latin america to the pacific rim cowboy days are gone but sam massengil hasnt the vision to conceive of that pause has he been causing any more problems for you no youre sure dont be shy about letting me know alex ill ensure youre not caught in the middle i appreciate that gordon his flipped his jacket forward and slipped it on patted his hair so he said smiling this must be fulfilling work it is i notice theres this other psychologist doing a lot of speechifying to the media fellow with a beard lance dobbs so far hes limited his involvement to talk you mean he hasnt actually been here indignation mock or otherwise no he hasnt gordon one of his assistants came by but i convinced dr dobbs that too many cooks would spoil the broth and she hasnt been back since i see he said thats certainly true too many cooks true in lots of other regards i didnt respond he said so you feel you have it worked out with dr dobbs so far so good excellent good for you he paused touched his harmonica pocket well good luck and more power to you the old twohanded grip and a nod at ahlward the redheaded man moved away from the door and smoothed his lapels from inside the classroom came shouts and laughter the young teachers voice tight with frustration trying to be heard over the tumult latch turned his back on me the two of them began walking away i said planning on coming back gordon he stopped and lowered his eyebrows as if pondering a question of cosmic proportions youve given me food for thought alex i really heard you about doing it right coordinating so let me bounce it around check my calendar and get back to you i waited until the corridor was empty then followed at a discreet distance made it to the door and watched them crossing the yard ignoring the children playing there they then left the grounds got into a black chrysler new yorker ahlward driving and rode away no other vehicles pulled out behind them no retinue of young scrubs no sign of the media so perhaps the intheneighborhood story was genuine but i had trouble buying it latchs eager response to my question about massengil his questions about dobbs convinced me his agenda had been other than altruistic and the timing was too cute coming so soon after my summons to massengils office not that yesterdays visit had been public knowledge but latch had already displayed access to massengils itinerary the day of the sniping ready to do battle on camera now the two of them were wouldbe heroes a couple of sharks vying for a toothhold in the underbelly of tragedy i wondered how long it would go on politics as usual i supposed it reminded me of why id dropped out of academic medicine i left the school and tried to put all thoughts of politics out of my mind long enough to get some dinner down driving quasirandomly i ended up on santa monica boulevard and stopped at the first place i spotted that offered easy parking a coffee shop near twentyfourth street someone had begun holiday decorations plastic poinsettia on each table windows frosted and painted with mistletoe spavined bucktoothed reindeer and a few babyblue menorahs the good cheer hadnt spread to the food and i left most of my roast beef sandwich on the plate paid and left it was dark i got into the seville and pulled out of the lot traffic was too heavy for a left turn so i headed west another cars headlights filled my rearview mirror i didnt think much of it until a few blocks later when i turned right again and the lights stayed with me i drove to sunset still the headlights i could tell because the left one flickered narrowly spaced beams small car compact car too dark to determine the color or make i joined the eastbound flow on the boulevard each time i looked into the mirror the headlights stared back at me like a pair of yellow pupilless eyes i caught a red light at bundy the headlights edged up closer a filling station was at the nearest corner the preembargo type expansive lot fullserve pumps pay phone i rolled forward the headlights followed suit when the amber light flashed for the northsouth traffic i rolled for two seconds then made a sharp turn up the driveway kept going until i reached the pay phone the car with the flickering headlight started up and drove across the intersection i followed it taking in as many details as i could brown toyota two people in front female passenger i thought i couldnt see the driver the passengers head turned facing the driver talking to each other not even a glance in my direction i scolded myself for being paranoid got back on sunset and drove home the operator at my service gave me an earful of messages one from milo the rest all business i put in return calls reaching one lateworking attorney a bunch of answering machines and the desk sergeant at robberyhomicide who told me detective sturgis was out and no he had no idea what the call had been about i took the mail in changed into shorts running shoes and a tshirt and went for a night jog the santa anas had returned gentler i ran with the wind felt airborne i came back an hour later and sat by the fishpond unable to make out the koi as anything more than bubbles on the black surface of the water but hearing them hearing the song of the waterfall my mind started to clear i stayed there a while longer then went back up to the house ready for the present tense i thought of phoning linda tried to convince myself my motives were purely professional then realized i didnt have her home number neither did information i viewed it as an omen settled in for another night alone nine oclock evening news on the local station i was becoming a tragedy junkie i cracked a grolsch settled back and clicked the remote the broadcast began with a regurgitation of the usual international mess followed by a machinegun spatter of local crime stories an armoredvan robbery at a savings and loan in van nuys one guard killed the other in critical condition a pacoima cracksmoker whod gone berserk and stabbed his eightyearold son to death with a butcher knife a fiveyearold girl snatched out of her front yard up in santa cruz tough competition nothing on the hale sniping i sat through ten minutes of the feathery stuff that passes for human interest journalism in la tonights main feature was a millionaire newport beach urologist whod won the lottery and vowed his lifestyle wouldnt change next came shots of the new rose queen opening a shopping mall in altadena happy talk between the anchors weather and sports the doorbell rang probably milo here to tell me in person what hed called about i opened the door directing my eyes upward toward milos sixfootthree level but the eyes that stared back were a good nine inches lower bloodshot grayblue eyes behind eyeglasses in clear plastic frames bloodshot but so bright and focused they seemed to pierce the glass dominating a smallish triangular face pasty complexion rendered sallow by the buglight over the door mouth tightly set small thin nose with narrow nostrils flanking an incongruous bulbtip wispy browngray hair blowing in the night wind a nondescript face above a tan windbreaker zipped to the neck my gaze fell to his hands pale and longfingered wringing each other dr delaware i presume nasal voice not a trace of levity the hackneyed line rehearsed no more contrived than that programmed i looked over his shoulder down in the carport was a silvergray honda with blackened windows i was suddenly certain hed been standing out there for a while my neck hairs prickled and i put one hand on the door and took a step backward who are you and what do you want my name is burden he said making it sound like an apology my daughters theres been some trouble with her she im sure you know yes i do mr burden he extended both hands in front of him knitted together as if containing something precious or lethal what i id like to talk to you dr delaware if you could spare the time i stepped back and let him in he looked around still wringing his hands eyes bouncing around the living room like a billiard trick shot you have a very nice home he said then he started to weep i let him in and sat him down on the leather sofa he sobbed tearlessly for a while making dry choking noises hid his face in his hands then looked up and said doctor then nothing i waited his glasses had slid down his nose he righted them i may i please use your facilities i pointed him down the hallway to the bathroom went into the kitchen made strong coffee and brought it back along with cups and a bottle of irish whisky i heard the toilet flush a few minutes later he came back sat down folded his hands in his lap and stared at the floor as if memorizing the pattern on my bukhara i put a cup of coffee into his hands and offered the whisky bottle he shook his head i spiked my own drink took a long hot swallow and sat back he said this is thank you for allowing me into your home his voice was nasal oboelike im sorry for your loss mr burden he shielded his face with one hand and moved it from side to side as if trying to shake off a bad dream the hand holding the cup trembled badly and coffee sloshed over the sides and onto the rug he uncovered his face put the cup down rattling it against the glass top snatched a napkin and scrambled to mop up i touched his elbow and said dont worry about it he backed away from the contact but allowed me to take the sodden napkin from his hand im sorry it i dont mean to intrude i took the napkin into the kitchen in order to give him more time to compose himself he got up and paced the room i could hear his footsteps from the kitchen rapid arrhythmic when i returned his hands were back in his lap his eyes back on the rug a minute passed slowly then another i drank coffee he just sat there when he made no attempt to speak i said what can i do for you mr burden he answered before the last word was out of my mouth analyze her learn the truth and tell them theyre wrong tell who them the police the press all of them theyre delusional saying she shot at children was some kind of homicidal monster mr burden he shook his head violently listen to me believe me there was no earthly way she would could do anything like that no way she would use a gun she hated my she was pacifistic idealistic and never children she loved children i imagined the final scene in the storage shed her lair black clothing a rifle a cup of urine he shook his head said impossible why come to me mr burden for analysis he said with just a trace of impatience psychoanalysis thats your specialty isnt it childhood motivation thought processes of the developing organism and despite her age holly was a child psychologically believe me i should know that would put her within your professional purview wouldnt it am i correct when i didnt respond right away he said please doctor youre a scholar an indepth man this should be right up your alley i know ive chosen right he began reciting the titles of studies id published in scientific journals tenyearold articles in perfect chronological order when he was finished he said i do my research doctor im thorough when things count its the only way the sorrow gone from his face replaced by a haughty smile an a student expecting praise howd you find me mr burden after i spoke to the police it became clear to me they werent after the truth had preconceived notions just plain lazy concerned with wrapping things up so i began observing the school hoping to learn something anything because nothing they told me made sense i recorded the license plates of anyone going in and out of the school grounds and checked them against my files yours crosschecked with several of my lists your lists the oboe played a couple of long notes close to laughter dont be alarmed its nothing ominous lists are my business i should have mentioned that in the beginning mailing lists direct mail advertising applied demography data that can be called up with regard to occupation zip code marital status any number of variables you were on the mental health specialist list subclass b phd clinical psychologists yet you werent the psychologist whos been talking to the media claiming hes been treating the children it made me curious i investigated you further what i learned gave me hope my journal articles gave you hope your articles were good scientifically sound relatively hard methodology for a very soft science that showed me youre a thorough thinker not some civil servant just coasting but what really heartened me were the data i obtained from the lay press newspaper articles the casa de los niños case the cadmus scandal youre obviously a man who seeks the truth singlemindedly doesnt run from challenges im a good judge of character i know youre the man for me more astudent hubris and something else a hunters smile where had the grief gone a spooky little man i said speaking of the truth how about showing some identification just to be thorough certainly it always pays to be thorough he produced a cheap wallet and from it plucked a drivers license social security card and several credit cards the photo on the license had a furtive sullen look that reminded me of a dead girl i glanced at the credit cards all gold all in the name of mahlon m burden returned to the license photo and stared at it some more i know what youre thinking he said but for the most part she resembled her mother i gave him back his id she had her mothers innate goodness as well he said compassion for all living things this whole thing is a travesty youve got to help me mr burden what is it exactly you think i can do for you conduct a psychobiography the life and times of holly lynn burden mention of her name made his gaze waver for an instant then it hardened with intent apply the same tools of scholarship you apply to your research and become the resident expert on my little girl on what made her tick delve as deep as you like be unsparing with your questions do whatever it takes to get to the root of this mess learn the truth dr delaware i took my time answering his eyes never left me sounds like youre talking about two separate things mr burden reconstructing your daughters life whats known as a psychological autopsy and vindicating her one may not lead to the other i waited for the explosion what i got was more of the hunters smile oh it will dr delaware it will a father knows a father knows a mother knows how many times had i heard that before theres something you should know i said youre obviously not happy with the way the police are handling things but it was the police who called me in unless youd lie to make them happy that doesnt bother me something else i cant promise you confidentiality on the contrary my first allegiance is to the children at hale my main goal is helping them cope with what happened and i cant let anything distract me from that if i found out something negative about holly and disclosing it would serve a therapeutic purpose id disclose unpleasant things could become public knowledge im not frightened of the truth dr delaware solid data never scare me boasting i thought of him surveilling me from behind blackened windows using his files to invade my privacy using tears to gain entry into my lovely home assuming the patient role so that id play therapist no matter what his motivation id been manipulated i took another sip of spiked coffee and experienced a wave of lightheadedness alcohol or the strangeness of the moment i put the cup down sat back crossed my legs and studied him tried to regain objectivity pull out of the sorrowsympathy circuit that hed instigated on my doorstep i absolutely accept your contingencies he said will you help me he leaned forward on the sofa dryeyed one part of me the invaded householder wanted him out of there but i found myself considering his proposition because what he was offering me was exactly what id been telling everyone i wanted a chance to understand the bogeywoman the opportunity to mine some bit of information that might speed up the healing of the kids at hale delve as deep as you like be unsparing with your questions given the recency of his tragedy his inability at this point to confront what had really happened in the storage shed that pledge meant little he might start out by answering my questions and end up seeing me as the enemy but somewhere in between i might very well learn something at what price i said give me some time to think about it that didnt please him he tugged at the zipperpull of his windbreaker opened and closed the jacket and kept staring at me as if waiting for me to change my mind finally he said thats all i can ask doctor he stood out came the cheap wallet he handed me a white business card new frontiers technology ltd mahlon m burden pres a phone number with a pacific palisades exchange had been penciled beneath his name he said thats a private line very few people have it call me twentyfour hours a day chances are ill be out of the office most of tomorrow downtown at parker center trying to get the police to release the her body but ill be picking up messages his chin quivered and his face started to sag trying not to look at him i saw him out the door i was still thinking about him when milo called got a fix on your honda he said new frontiers tech is burdens fathers company i know i told him about the visit he dropped in on you just like that just like that traced you by running your plates thats what he said you get any sense he was dangerous not really just odd odd in what way calculating manipulative but maybe im being too hard on him the guys been through hell lord knows im not seeing him at his best sounds to me like he piqued your professional curiosity somewhat somewhat that mean youre gonna take him up on his proposition im thinking about it any problem if i do doesnt bother me personally alex but are you sure you want to get in any deeper if i can learn something that would help the kids i do i made it clear to him that my first allegiance was to them no confidentiality he accepted it he accepts it for now but look at the guys state of mind heavy denial hes still claiming shes innocent what happens when reality hits him what happens after you go in and do your thing and come out concluding his little girl was a wacko with blood on the brain how do you think hell accept that i raised that possibility with him and he said he was willing to take his chances right he also tell you it was his rifle she took to that shed apparently the guys a gun collector and she lifted one of his collectibles what do you think that does to his ability to think straight about this she hated my when did you learn this extremely recently pause sources at the ballistics lab he cursed i couldnt tell how much of his resentment came from having to get facts on the investigation secondhand how much from the possibility i might work with mahlon burden so i said youre saying i should turn him down me telling you what to do perish the thought i just want you to think carefully about it thats exactly what im doing milo while you had him there did you ask him about the boyfriend i didnt ask him about anything didnt want to engage him until i was sure which way i was going to take it sounds like youre already engaged pal only question is whens the wedding whats bugging you milo nothing oh hell i dont know maybe its the idea of you working for the other side not for with same difference what puts him on the other side anyway good guys and bad guys know of a more meaningful distinction he didnt pull the trigger milo all he did was sire her she was nutso where did it come from what guilt by procreation a long uncomfortable silence yeah yeah i know he said wheres my milk of human compassion for him hes a victim too its just that i called you in to help the kids trying to do something positive in the middle of all this crap i guess i dont want to see you used to whitewash what she did that would be impossible what she did is indelible milo yeah okay sorry dont mean to ride you its just been a terrific day just got back from another crime scene toddler murder oh shit pure shit twoyearold victim moms boyfriend gets loaded on ice and dust and god knows what else uses the baby for punching practice neighbors heard the kid wailing all day called protective services two weeks ago social workers came down last week evaluated wrote it up as high risk recommended removal from the home but they hadnt gotten around to processing it yet jesus processing he said dont you just love that like sausage shit into the grinder out the other end tagged and wrapped cant wait to see what tomorrow brings what new load of garbage will need to be processed i mulled over burdens offer without coming to any conclusion woke up friday morning still thinking about it i put it aside and drove to the school to work with the ones i was sure were the good guys i could tell i was making progress the children seemed bored and a good part of each session was spent in free play most of the afternoon was spent working individually with the highrisk youngsters a few were still experiencing sleep problems but even they seemed more settled doing remarkably well but what would the longterm effects be by four i was sitting in an empty classroom thinking about that realizing how poorly my training had prepared me for the work i was doing how few insights standard psychology had to offer about the effects upon children of traumatic violence perhaps my experiences could be useful to others other victims and healers certain to materialize soon in a world grown increasingly psychopathic i decided to keep detailed clinical records was still writing at five when a custodian lugging a mop and bucket stuck his head into the room and asked how long i was planning to be there i collected my stuff and left passing lindas office carlas work space was dark but the light was on in the inner office i knocked come in she was at her desk reading slightly stooped looking intense i said cramming she put her book down swiveled around and motioned toward the lshaped couch she had on an offwhite knit dress thin gold chain white stockings with a subtle wave pattern running through them vertically and mediumheeled white pumps i was wondering if youd drop by she said heard we had visitors yesterday oh yeah i said a veritable bath in the milk of human kindness lord and it just keeps on coming she turned back toward the desk and took something out of a drawer white cassette three more boxes of these showed up this morning via registered mail carla didnt know what it was she signed for the whole shebang just tapes no people just tapes but dobbss office did call to confirm the delivery carla was out delivering memos to the classrooms and i took the call buttcovering i said the mail registration is proof for any state auditors that he fulfilled his contract and is entitled to every penny massengil paid him thats what i figured i asked to speak to him directly and they put him on the yahoo was all sweetness and light wanting to know how the poor little things were doing things he probably sees them as things assuring me he was on twentyfourhour call in case of emergencies ill sleep so much better knowing that and no doubt the phone call will be logged as professional consultation and billed for he made sure to let me know you and he had conferred she said that the two of you were of one mind with regard to clinical issues he approves of your methods doctor doesnt that make your day sounds like he wants to compromise i said we dont expose his little scam let him make a few bucks on the tapes and he backs off how does that sit with you i thought about it i can live with it if it means he stays out of the picture so can i she said what does that make us realists ugh she waved her hand i refuse to waste any more time on sleaze how do the kids look to you very good actually i gave her a progress report she nodded ive been hearing the same kind of thing from the parents weve spoken to on the phone definitely less anxiety its helped me to convince quite a few of them to send their kids back so youve done a real good deed im glad at first mind you they were skeptical confused by what the kids were doing drawing pictures of the sniper tearing her up getting mad theres always that impulse to protect try to hush things up but results talk loudly ive lined up at least a couple of dozen mothers for your monday meeting theres something else you should know about i said another visit i told her about mahlon burden how weird out of the blue like that it was but hes pretty stressed hes convinced hollys innocent wants me to conduct a psychological autopsy show the world what made her tick somehow thats going to lead to proving her innocence without hesitation she said i think you should do it its a great opportunity opportunity for what learning understanding what went wrong what did make her tick i cant be sure ill come up with anything significant linda whatever you come up with itll be more than weve got now right and the more ive been thinking about it now that the shocks worn off the weirder the whole thing is a girl alex what in the world could lead her to do something like that who was she shooting at the media have basically dropped it the police havent told us a thing if her fathers willing to talk to you why not take him up on it maybe you can learn something about her some warning sign that can help prevent something like this happening again i said his willingness to have me exhume her psychologically is being influenced by heavy denial linda once his defenses break down hes likely to change his mind if i start coming up with stuff he doesnt approve of hell probably end the whole thing so in the meantime you learn what you can i didnt reply she said whats the problem my first allegiance is to the kids i dont want to be perceived as being aligned with the bad guys i wouldnt worry about that youve earned your stripes around here milo detective sturgis has reservations about it sure he does typical copthink bunker mentality before i could answer she said well no matter what anyone thinks in the end its got to be your decision so do what you feel is best she looked away put the tape down and began straightening the papers on her desk the chill i said im leaning toward telling him yes i plan to let him know over the weekend ah the weekend she said still straightening cant believe this weeks actually ending got a busy one lined up just the usual scut chores tcb time i said how about forgetting about business for a while she arched her eyebrows but didnt look at me let me be more explicit i said an early dinner lets say in half an hour somewhere quiet with a wellstocked bar all shoptalk forbidden bring a little elegance into our otherwise humdrum lives she looked down at her dress touched one knee im not exactly dressed for elegance sure you are hand me the phone and ill make a reservation right now the eyebrows arched higher she gave a small laugh and turned to me a takecharge guy when somethings worth taking charge of it came out sounding like a line i said hey babe whats your sign she laughed harder and gave me the phone it took her a while to organize her things write memos and reminders i used the time to go into carlas office and call in for messages two people whod started college at sixteen unable to let go of the compliantkid role finally we left the building she still looked tense but she slipped her arm through mine the custodian was eager to lock up the school grounds and begin his weekend so she drove the escort onto the street and parked just outside the gate we took the seville and headed west the restaurant id chosen was on a busy stretch of ocean avenue across from the bluffs that look down on the birth of pacific coast highway french but friendly a clean white decor and canvastopped front porch with a waisthigh brick wall that allowed alfresco dining while segregating the sidewalk throng we got there by sixfifteen several homeless people were competing with the parking valets for turf i gave away a few dollars and got dirty looks from the valets we were seated at the bar for another twenty minutes before being escorted to a spot under the canvas by eightthirty the bigdealpending folks would be tooling up in rented mercedes and designer jeeps that would have intimidated patton but at this hour we were opening the place across the street a grove of coco palms crowned the bluffs through the crosshatched trunks of the big trees the sky was trapezoids of bloodred streaked with aqua diluting to hammered copper near the horizon as we sipped our drinks it deepened to indigo i watched the play of light and shadow on lindas face shed pinned her hair up a few fine golden strands had come loose near the nape of her neck they caught the last hints of daylight and glowed like electric filament i said isnt this better than tcbing she nodded rested her chin in her hand and looked out at the sunset long graceful neck grace kelly profile the waiter came lit the table candle and recited the daily specials the kitchen must have overstocked on rabbit because he kept pushing some kind of hare stew provençale she smiled up at him said sorry but i just couldnt eat bugs and chose grilled white sea bass i ordered steak in peppercorn sauce and a bottle of beaujolais nouveau we drank and didnt say much it took a long time to get served when the food came she ate with the same gusto shed shown the first time first time our second dinner despite that despite all those chats in her office i knew little about her i caught her eye and smiled she smiled back but seemed preoccupied what is it i said nothing not back at work i hope no no not at all this is lovely but theres still something on your mind she ran a finger up the stem of her wineglass i guess im trying to figure out if this is a date do you want it to be she shook her finger at me now you sound like a shrink okay i said sitting up straight and clearing my throat back to takecharge guy its a date babe now be a good girl and eat your fish she saluted and put her hand down on the table long graceful fingers that i covered with mine she took a deep breath even in the dim light i could see her color deepen im really pretty full how about we skip dessert time had raced it was nearly nine by the time we got back in the car she closed her eyes put her head back and stretched her legs then more silence i said how about a drive and when she nodded headed north on ocean and turned onto the ramp that leads down to pacific coast highway i slipped pat metheny into the tape deck and drove in the slow lane all the way to western malibu just past the ventura county line mountains on one side ocean on the other past decker canyon very little evidence of human disruption i got to point mugu before beginning to feel drowsy i looked over at linda the light from the dashboard was barely strong enough for me to make out her features but i could see that her eyes were closed and she had a satisfiedchild smile on her face the car clock said it was tenfifteen the highway sign said we were nearly at oxnard i thought of the last time id driven this way to santa barbara with robin i turned the car around ejected metheny fed sonny rollins into the deck and headed back to la listening to the magic sax turn just once into something transcendental when i stopped at the light at sunset beach linda stirred and blinked i said good morning she sat up good lord did i fall asleep on you like the proverbial baby how rude im sorry nothing to be sorry for your serenity rubbed off on me what time is it ten after eleven unbelievable i just lost two hours she sat straighter and smoothed her hair i cant believe i just conked out like this i patted her wrist no sweat ill just expect total vivaciousness next time she gave a noncommittal laugh and said i guess youd better take me back to get my car the light turned green i got onto sunset reached the manicured magnolias of ocean heights just before midnight a cold thick fog had settled in esperanza drive was silent and blanketed by a crushing darkness not a soul on the street the diamond windows of the ranch houses were black as obsidian the lowvoltage glow of landscaping spotlights dulled to amber smudges only a few illuminated doorbell buttons managed to pierce the vapor orange discs that followed us a battalion of tiny cyclops eyes my windshield clouded and i turned on the wipers they scraped out a lazy fourfour and i felt my eyelids droop linda said never been here at this hour its eerie so vacant i said la but more so and drove slowly toward the school as we neared the spot where shed left her car i saw something two more eyes red irises taillights another car parked in the middle of the street the fog had grown thicker i couldnt see ten feet in front of me i put the wipers on high but the windshield kept beading with moisture and fogging up on the backbeat of the fourfour i reduced speed rolled closer saw movement through the haze a manic blur of movement trapped by my headlights then harsh music dull percussion followed by a solo of breaking glass hey said linda what the thats my car more thumping and shattering the crunch and scrape of metal against metal i gunned the engine and sped forward movement clearer but not clear human movement the pad of footsteps over the swoopswoop of the wipers then another engine revving i opened my window and screamed what the hells going on tires squealed and the taillights diminished to pinpoints before disappearing into the mist i jammed the seville into park and sat there breathing hard i could hear lindas respiration racing ahead of mine she looked terrified but made a move to get out i held her wrist and said wait oh jesus lord i turned off the wipers we endured an evil minute then another when i was convinced we were alone i got out of the car cold silent street the fog had an ozone smell beads of glass littered the street vitreous against the damp pavement like melting hail i looked up and down esperanza down the row of ranch houses still dark the silence stretched and became absurd not a hint of movement not a single window yellowing or the merest creak of curiosity despite the racket ocean heights slept soundly or pretended to linda got out of the seville we examined her escort the windshield of the little car had been punched out so had the windows on the drivers side the hood had been caved in and was riddled with fissures that were raw metal around the edges bubbles of safety glass dusted the surface and pooled in the low spots oh no she said gripping my arm and pointing another type of assault the oncewhite roof was a cyclone scrawl of red and black spray paint abstract art a coiling dripping portrait of hate abstract except for one clear bit of representation covering the drivers door sprayed and resprayed for emphasis its diagonal cruelty unmistakable even in the fog was a black swastika her hands were shaking too hard to get the key in the lock so i opened the door to the school she managed to find the corridor light and flip it on and we went to her office where i phoned milo he answered sounding groggy when i told him what had happened he said wait right there he arrived half an hour later thirty silent minutes with my arm around lindas shoulders feeling the rigidity of her body then watching her pull away pace shuffle papers fuss with her hair when milo walked in she composed herself thanked him for coming but seemed cold something about cops if milo noticed it he didnt let on he questioned her with a gentleness id seen him use with child witnesses then put away his note pad and said sorry you had to go through this so what else is new she said he stood ill use your phone and get the print boys down here but that will take some time so why dont the two of you go on home ive got all the info i need she said no prints not another media circus milo looked at me then back at her dr overstreet were in hearnoevil territory if anyone across the street saw what happened they wont let on and even if we manage to find an honest person chances are they saw nothing worthwhile cause of the fog so pulling prints from the car is really our only chance of getting anywhere they were using crowbars or something like crowbars whats the chance of pulling any prints from the car she said slim he admitted unless they slipped and touched the car but without prints weve got nothing might as well forget the whole thing thats what i want detective sturgis to forget it milo scratched his nose youre saying you dont want to file charges i said linda she said thats exactly what im saying the children have been through enough all of us have the last thing we need is another fright more attention i said linda if theres some danger dont you think the children and their parents should be aware of it theres no danger this is just more of the same garbage weve had since the beginning the sniping put us back in the spotlight and another cockroach crawled out and therell be others phoning mailing until they find someone else to pick on so what would be the point of advertising this no one would be caught and more kids would be scared into dropping out thats precisely what they want gutsy speech but by the end of it she was talking in gulps almost hyperventilating and digging her nails into the arm of the couch so hard i heard fabric scrape i looked at milo he said did you keep any of the hate mail why in the unlikely event we ever find the piece of shit who trashed your car maybe we can match a print to one of the pieces of mail and add a federal charge to his grief youd be surprised how nasty those postal inspectors can get she said i told you i dont want to go public milo sighed i understand that and i promise you therell be no official investigation and thats why i said in the unlikely eventnear impossible would be more accurate but lets say the perp returns emboldened by getting away with it and lets say someone catches him in the act youre not saying youd want us to let him go are you she stared at him threw open a desk drawer and yanked out a stack of envelopes bound with string here she said thrusting it at him my entire collection i was going to donate it to the smithsonian but its all yours happy reading who else touched the contents besides you and your secretary just us and dr delaware milo smiled i suppose we can rule him out she didnt respond got something to put it in he said always happy to oblige detective she opened another drawer found an interoffice mail envelope and dropped the stack into it milo took it i said what about some kind of protection milo increased patrol both of them turned to me then exchanged knowing glances cop and cops kid i felt like a new immigrant who didnt know the language he said i can have a patrol car drive by once each shift alex but its unlikely to make a difference she told him sorry for bringing you down here if id thought it out rationally i wouldnt have bothered you no bother he said if you change your mind or need to file a report for insurance let me know i can push some paper for you maybe speed things up meantime lets get your car towed if it still drives ill take it home myself i said youve got to be kidding why not she said the damage is probably all to the body if it rolls home it goes ill call my insurance company tomorrow and have it towed from there the district will pay for a rental one advantage of being a civil servant linda without a windshield youll freeze fresh air ill survive she searched in her purse and pulled out her keys i looked at milo his shrug said nolo contendere the three of us left the office linda walking several paces ahead no one talking outside the street was still silent and seemed more dank a sump for the haze the escort looked like a piece of junk sculpture linda got in through the passenger door when she closed it it made an unhealthy rattling sound and a few pieces of glass fell onto the street and tinkled like wind chimes milo and i stood by as she jammed the key into the ignition the little car sputtered and belched and for a moment i thought thered been mechanical damage then i remembered that it had sounded that way the first time id heard it she kept trying milo said gutsy lady i said you think this is the right way to handle it shes the victim its her choice alex thats not what i asked he ran his hand over his face matter of fact shes probably right she knows the way things work knows well never catch the assholes all shed buy would be more cameras and print space the escort started then stalled and died i said okay sorry for calling you out for nothing forget it i was restless anyway i recalled his grogginess over the phone but said nothing he took out his keychain and began swinging it like a lasso looked at the swastika then out at the row of darkened homes lovely times were living in alex national brotherhood week that reminded me of something howd your meeting with ferguson go nothing dramatic call me tomorrow and ill run it by you meanwhile go and do your civic duty whats that make sure dr blondie gets home in one piece he patted me on the shoulder and shambled to his car just as he drove away the escorts engine caught and stuck linda fed it gas i walked up to the shattered window ill follow you home linda thanks but im okay its really not necessary her face was streaked with tears but she was forcing a tough look almost comically grave the hand on the steering wheel was taut and ghostwhite i touched it she pumped the gas pedal several more times the escort made a noise like an old man clearing his throat i said you might have radiator damage something thats not obvious the last thing we need is for you to get stranded somewhere she looked up at me lots of fine pale hair had come loose her mascara had run creating sadclown streaks i touched her cheek come on what are friends for she looked at me again started to say something closed her eyes and nodded i followed her east on sunset then south past the darkened movie marquees of a deserted littered westwood village all the way beyond pico and the postmoderne excess of the westside pavilion not far from overland avenue where id lived in a dingy flat during indigent student days the escort clanged along no taillights one headlight molting bits of glass and flecks of paint the swastika made me think of a battered nazi staff car but despite its pathetic appearance the wreck moved fast enough and i had to concentrate in order to stay with her as she made a series of abrupt turns down side streets she came to a halt at an apartment complex at the end of a culdesac the building was monolithgraceless four stories of peachcolored texturecoat with aquagreen tubular iron railing and just enough landscaping to satisfy the zoning laws there was a low roar in the distance through the branches of a malnourished pepper tree the san diego freeway was a frantic light show a steep drive led down to a subterranean parking garage blocked by an aquagreen gate she put a card in a slot and the gate slid open leaving the card in place she drove through i pressed the card to keep the gate open retrieved it and followed her the garage was half empty and i found a spot next to her home sweet home she said getting out her hair was mussed her cheeks rosy she touched them ah the bracing vapors theres something to be said for openair motoring ill walk you in she said if you insist but didnt sound annoyed we walked across the garage took stairs up to the lobby which was oppressively small furnished with a single upholstered bench and a fire extinguisher and papered in green foil patterned with silver bamboo im on the third floor she said and punched the elevator button the lift was closetsized as the doors slid shut we found ourselves standing close together flanks touching smelling each others breath her perfume my aftershave all of it overlaid with the bitter hormonal essence of stress she looked at the floor some date huh just dont say i never took you anywhere interesting she laughed then broke into loud spasmodic sobs and tucked herself into a corner of the elevator i put my arm around her and drew her to me she put her head on my shoulder hiding her face i kissed the top of her head she cried some more i held her tighter she looked up mouth slightly parted i wiped her face her cheeks felt frozen the elevator stopped and the doors opened at the far end she mumbled we made our way down a greenfoiled hallway that smelled of mildew both of her arms around my waist inside the place was sweet with her perfume the living room was small and boxy with oyster walls potted plants teak and polishedcotton furniture apartmentgrade gold carpeting ruled with vacuum tracks everything neatly ordered and lemonoiled i sat her down on a couch patterned with a fleecy blueandpink stripe put her feet up on a matching ottoman and removed her shoes she covered her eyes with one arm and reclined the kitchen was tiny and opened to a sixbysix dining area that barely accommodated a stoutlegged butcherblock table a mr coffee machine a stack of filters and a can of colombian darkroast sat on the counter next to an unmarked blackboard labeled things to do i brewed a couple of cups worth and filled two la zoo mugs zebra and koala that i grabbed from an assortment hanging on an accordion rack next to the phone when i got back to the living room she was sitting up watching me looking dazed her hair still windblown i gave her the coffee made sure she had a firm grip on the cup before taking a seat across from her she lowered her lips to the rim breathed in coffee steam and drank i said anything else i can get you she looked up come closer please i sat next to her we drank drained our mugs more i said she placed her mug on the coffee table said oh lord whats next and rested her head on my shoulder again i put my arm around her she sighed i nuzzled her hair smoothed it she turned her head so that her mouth brushed against mine the merest contact then turned back the other way and pressed her lips to mine first tentatively then harder i felt them yield her tongue was hot and mocharich exploring my teeth sidling against my tongue pressing against it teasing it without breaking the kiss i put my own cup down fastened we hugged each other squeezing hard she shuddered and stroked the back of my neck i massaged her shoulders allowed my hands to dip lower run over the knobs of her spine the lean contours of her body she kissed me harder made throaty urgent sounds i touched padded hips a knee she guided me higher i felt the inside of her thigh smooth and cool and firm through nylon she lifted herself tugged down at her panty hose denuding one long white leg i touched her bare flesh softer cooler then a wave of heat she flushed shuddered harder her hands left my neck and scrambled at my fly more fumbling eyes closed then she located me her eyes opened wide she said oh god caught her breath and lowered herself she attended to me as if praying when the feelings grew too intense i pried her away kissed her mouth took her in my arms stood and carried her into the bedroom blueblack darkness just a hint of moonlight filtering through apartmentgrade windowshades a narrow brass bed covered in something that felt like satin we lay down embraced connected still partially clothed and did a horizontal slowdance kissing all the while moving together as if wed been partners for a long time she came very quickly unexpectedly crying out tugging my hair so hard the roots ached id been holding back gritting my teeth i let go and felt my toes curl she breathed hard for a long time clutching me then she said oh god i cant believe im doing this i lifted myself up on my elbows she pulled me down hard fastened her arms around my back and gripped me so tight i could barely breathe we began kissing again softer got lost in it then she pulled away gasping phew okay i need to breathe i rolled off caught my own breath i was drenched with sweat my clothing twisted and binding she sat up my eyes became accustomed to the darkness and i saw that hers were still closed she reached behind her back and unzipped her dress slipping her arms out of the sleeves and letting the fabric collapse around her i made out the curves of her shoulders white smallboned but strong delicious bumps atop each one i kissed them she gave a small cry shook the hair out of her face and leaned back on the flats of her hands i unhooked her bra freed her breasts small but heavy hefted them kissed them she had tiny nipples smooth and hard as pond pebbles we stripped and got under the covers she had a hungry mouth a line of down that bisected her belly from umbilicus to mons and those hips jutting nearly perpendicular to a small tight waist i gripped them and kneaded felt fluid movement beneath the dermal sheath heat and vitality her hands were warm again she pulled me on top of her big padded welcoming hips cradling me in a soft liquid core again she finished first waited me out with a dreamy content look on her face then dropped off to sleep when i was through holding me tight as she sank deeper and deeper into slumber she maintained her hold around my waist nestling her head in the crook of my neck snoring lightly in my ear so different from robin whod always signed off with a friendly firm kiss then rolled away yawning needing to stretch out needing space robin of the auburn curls and almond eyes firm body strong workers hands musky athletic pleasures this one this stranger soft longstemmed and white as a calla lily almost limp in repose but this one needed me held me fiercely as she dreamed one hand in my hair the other clamped around my middle holding on for dear life a soft prison i lay there not moving shifting my eyes around the room white furniture prints on the walls a couple of stuffed animals atop a dresser perfume bottles on a mirrored tray paperback books a digital clock that said am a car with a soupedup engine roared by three stories below linda jerked and her breathing stopped then quickened but she stayed fast asleep i became aware of other sounds a toilet flush somewhere in the building another car then a low hum deep and constant as a gregorian chant freeway dirge a lonely sound years ago id taught myself to perceive it as a lullaby she nuzzled in closer one of my hands was between her legs beautifully trapped the other had come to rest upon the stem of her neck i felt a pulse slow and strong i used one finger to tent the covers peeked at our bodies plastered together nearly the same length but hers so much lighter softer hairless saltandpepper still life on a narrow apartment bed i kissed her cheek she gripped me tighter dug her nails into my rib cage and threw one leg over mine i wondered what id gotten myself into i awoke the next morning alone smelling shampoo the bathroom radiated moist heat as i passed it she was sitting at the butcherblock table wearing a black kimono printed with cherry blossoms her hair was wet and combed straight back the water had darkened it to butterscotch her face was pale and scrubbed coral shells rode her ears an untouched cup of orange juice sat in front of her without any makeup at all she could have passed for a college student i said good morning teach hi her smile was cautious she drew the robe tighter the few square inches of chest i could see were white dusted with a flush i went behind her and kissed the back of her neck her skin smelled of lotion she pressed her head back against my belly and rolled it back and forth i touched her cheek sat down she said what can i get you just juice ill get it myself here take mine she handed me the glass i drank she said so so i looked toward the kitchen i notice your blackboard is blank any plans for today she shook her head looked preoccupied something the matter another shake of her head what is it linda nothing everythings fine wide smile okay i drank juice she got up and began straightening a living room that didnt need it her hair hung down her back flapping in a wet sheet against black silk her feet were bare narrow with curving toes the nails polished pink though her fingernails were unpainted secret vanity a woman who valued privacy i went to her and slipped my arms around her she didnt resist but neither did she yield i said i know so much so fast she gave a short angry laugh for a long long time ive pretended i had no needs now you come along and all of a sudden im a bundle of needs it feels too much like weakness i know exactly what you mean its been a long time for me too she turned around sharply searched my face prospecting for lies has it yes she stared some more then grabbed my face with both of her hands and kissed me so hard i felt myself spinning when we broke she said oh lord the danger signs are all flashing but she took my right hand and pressed it to her left breast over the heartbeat afterward she ran a bath for me kneeled on the mat and scrubbed my back with a loofah too subservient for my taste but she insisted after a minute or so i said why dont you get in nope she touched her stillwet hair im already waterlogged she kept scrubbing i closed my eyes she began humming something in a major key i realized her voice was something special sweet with a controlled resonance trained pipes i listened more intently she hummed louder when she paused i said youve got a really great voice oh yeah a regular diva i opened my eyes she looked cross ever sing professionally oh sure the met carnegie hall sold out the super dome but the pull of the classroom was too darned strong hand me the shampoo the strain in her voice let me know id touched another nerve how many danger zones along the pathway to knowing her tired of backing away i said how long ago was it ancient history couldnt be too ancient college days thats ancient enough i played music in college too that right played guitar at nights to put myself through guitar her mouth turned down how nice the chill i said another danger zone linda what what are you talking about when i get near certain topics cops now music the no trespassing signs start flashing dont be silly she pointed toward the shampoo bottle do you want me to do your hair or not i gave her the bottle she lathered when she was through she handed me a towel and left the bathroom i toweled off dressed and went into the bedroom she was sitting at her vanity putting on eye shadow looking miserable i said sorry forget it she began combing her hair the cops name was armando bonilla mondo san antonio pd rookie in a squad car i was just twenty when i met him a junior at ut he was twentytwo an orphan old mexican family but he barely spoke spanish one of those latin cowboy types you see in texas he wore his hair longer than the department liked spent his nights playing in a band guitar she shook her head good old guitar must be in my karma huh her laugh was bitter sixstring guitar and pedal steel flying fingers selftaught he was a natural the other three guys in the band were cops too more latin cowboys theyd known each other since sixth grade joined the department to have something stable but the band was their first love magnum four fantasies of recording contracts but none of them was ambitious or aggressive enough to pursue it and they never got out of the bar circuit its how i met them met him amateur night at a place near the alamo they were the house band daddy was a sunday fiddler used to push music on me all the time push me to sing traditional country western swing the stuff he liked i knew every bob wills song note for note by the time i was eight that night he dragged me there then made me get up and sing patsy cline i fall to pieces i was so nervous my voice cracked i sounded horrible but the competition was thin and i came in first gift certificate for a pair of boots and an invitation to join the band they were into country rock eagles rodney crowell old buddy holly stuff mondo did a mean la bamba putting on this humongous gag sombrero and this thick spanish accent even though he didnt know what all the words meant they renamed the band magnum four and lady derringer i started to get into performing you would have thought daddyd be overjoyed music plus a bunch of cops but he didnt like the fact that they were mexican though he never would come out and admit it in san antonio the big myth is that brown and white live together in harmony but that aint the way it goes down when tongues loosen at the dinner table so instead of just coming out and saying it he griped about the kind of garbage we were playing how late i was coming home from gigs stinking of booze and smoke mondo tried to relate to him on a cop level daddyd worked in the same department made sergeant before getting accepted into the rangers but that didnt make any difference he coldshouldered mondo told me the guys were noaccount punks masquerading as peace officers nothing like the upstanding buckaroos of his day the thing that made him maddest was that hed gotten me into it in the first place the more he bugged me the more resolute i got closer to mondo who was really sweet and naïve beneath all the macho posturing finally daddy and i had a big fight he slapped me across the face and i packed up and moved out of the house and into an apartment with mondo and two of the band guys dad stopped speaking to me total divorce a month later just after christmas mondo and i got engaged she stopped bit her lip got up and walked back and forth in front of the bed about a month after the engagement he got pulled out of uniform and put on some kind of undercover assignment that he couldnt talk about i assumed it was dope or vice or maybe some internal affairs thing but whatever it was it changed our lives hed work nights sleep days be gone for a week at a time the band fell apart without him it was nothing i used the extra time to study but the other guys got depressed started drinking more bad vibes mondo started drinking too and smoking dope which was something hed never done before he grew his hair even longer stopped shaving wore ratty clothes didnt shower regularly as if the criminal thing were rubbing off on him when i ragged him about it he said it was part of the job he was just playing a role but i could tell he was really getting into it and i wondered if things would ever go back to the way theyd been here i was all of twenty lonely scared about what id gotten myself into unable and unwilling to go back to daddy so i swallowed my pride put up with whatever mondo wanted which really wasnt much he was hardly ever around then early in february he traipsed in the middle of the night dirty and smelly woke me up and announced he was moving out something really big a new assignment hed be gone for at least a month maybe longer i started crying tried to get him to tell me what was going on but he said it was the job i didnt need to know for my sake i shouldnt know then he kissed my cheek a passionless kiss as if we were brother and sister and left it was the last time i saw him two days later he got caught in a dope burn and was gunned down along with another rookie the other guy survived but was a vegetable mondo was the lucky one dead before he hit the floor it was a big screwup dealers and junkies and cops dressed as dealers and junkies waging war at this dope factory out in the barrio four bad guys were killed too the papers called it a slaughterhouse made a big deal about how poorly prepared the two of them had been for the assignment lambs to the slaughter she hugged herself sat down on a corner of the bed out of reach after that i fell apart crying for days not eating or sleeping and there came good old dad to the rescue carrying me literally back home sitting me in the parlor playing his old seventyeights and fiddling for his little girl just like old times but i couldnt deal with that and i got really hostile to him snappish freshmouthed in the old days he never would have tolerated it hed have taken a switch to me even at my age but he just sat there and took it docile that scared me but mostly i was angry enraged at life insulted by god and then the question marks started bugging me why had mondo been thrown into something he wasnt equipped to handle the funeral made it worse all those gun salutes and rahrah speeches about valor i rode to the grave site in the same car as mondos commander and demanded to know what had happened the bastard was an old friend of dads still considered me a child and he patronized me but when i showed up at his office the next day and got pushy he lost patience just like a father would and told me since mondo and i had never been legally married just cohabitating i had no rights to any information or anything else shouldnt start thinking i could put in a claim on mondos pension i went home sobbing daddy listened got all indignant and protective and told me hed take care of that sob next day the commander came calling whitmans sampler tucked under his arm for me bottle of wild turkey for daddy all apologetic calling me miss linda and pretty one daddys pet name for me when i was little sitting in the parlor and going on about how the strain of the tragedy was getting to all of us what a great guy mondo had been daddy nodding as if he and mondo had been best friends then the commander handed me an envelope inside were ten onehundreddollar bills money the other cops had collected for me letting me know without saying it that even if i didnt legally have rights he was granting them to me i told him i didnt want money just the truth then he and daddy looked at each other and started talking in low soothing tones about the dangers of the job how mondod been a true hero the commander saying mondod been picked for undercover because he was topnotch had great recommendations if only there were some way to turn back the clock daddy joining in telling me about all the close calls hed had how scared and brave mama had been when she was alive how i had to be brave go on and live my life after a while it started to work i softened up thanked the commander for coming began to let my feelings out to grieve started to finally be able to lay it to rest concentrate on what i was going to do with the rest of my life everything seemed to be going as well as could be expected until about a month later i got a call from rudy one of the other guys in the band asking me to meet him at a restaurant out in the suburbs near hill country he sounded uptight wouldnt tell me what it was about just that it was important when i got there he looked terrible drained pale hed lost a lot of weight he said he was quitting the department moving the hell out of state to new mexico or arizona i asked him why he said it was too dangerous sticking around that after what had been done to mondo hed never trust anyone in the fucking department i said what the heck are you talking about he looked around he was really jumpy as if he was scared of being watched then he said i know this will blow you away linda but you were his lady youve got a right to know then he told me hed found out mondo hadnt been pulled off patrol because of his excellent performance the opposite was true he had a bad record demerits for subordination the long hair borderline probation low competence ratings hed been given dangerous assignments as a favor to someone she stopped touched her gut lord even after all these years it gets to me your dad dull nod he and his old buddy the commander they set him up put him in a situation they knew he couldnt handle like throwing a new recruit into the jungle sooner or later you know whats going to happen lamb to the slaughter damned close to premeditated murder said rudy but nothing anyone could ever prove just knowing it put him in jeopardy which was why he was getting the hell out of town he left the coffee shop looking over his shoulder all the while i drove away at about ninety per feeling out of my body numb like a player in my own nightmare when i got home daddy was sitting in the parlor fiddling grinning after one look at my face he put his bow down he knew i started screaming at him hitting him he reacted very calmly he said pretty one whats done is done no sense fretting i just looked at him as if seeing him for the first time feeling nauseated wanting to throw up but determined he wouldnt see me weak i snatched the fiddle out of his hands an old czechoslovakian one that he really loved hed been buying and trading them for years until hed found a keeper he tried to grab it but i was too fast for him i held it by the peg head and smashed it against the mantelpiece kept smashing until it was splinters then i ran from that house and never returned havent spoken to him since though a couple of years ago we started exchanging christmas cards again hes remarried one of those men who needs a woman around some bimbo from houston half his age shell get his pension and the house i grew up in and shell be the one tending his old bones she closed her eyes and rubbed her temples cops and guitars i said a long time ago she shook her head nine years god havent had much of a taste for music for a long time dont even own a phonograph and here i am humming to you and playing geisha and i barely know you before i could answer she said havent had anything to do with cops either till this mess but i remembered that shed mentioned being a rangers daughter to milo pushing the door open a crack maybe the times ripe for change linda a tear made its way down her cheek i moved closer to be able to hold her after a while she got up and said therere some things i have to take care of boring stuff shopping cleaning been putting it off for too long what are you planning to do for transportation ill manage restless embarrassed by it i said ive got some things to take care of too the glories of the single life oh yeah we left the bedroom and walked to the front door not touching i opened the door and stepped out into the green corridor weekendsilent the mildew smell seemed stronger newspapers lay in front of several doors the headline was something about afghanistan she said thanks youve been wonderful i held her chin and kissed her cheek she gave me her mouth and tongue and gripped me for a moment then pulled away and said out before i yank you back in is that a threat or a promise she smiled but so briefly it made me wonder if id imagined it you understand i just need to breathe she nodded nothing like breathing to liven things up i said would asking you out for tomorrow night lower the oxygen level she laughed and her damp hair shook stiffly no then how about tomorrow eight pm take in a couple of art galleries then dinner that would be great we squeezed hands and i left feeling a curious mixture of melancholy and relief no doubt she viewed me as mr sensitive but i was happy to have some breathing space of my own when i got home i called milo he said hows she doing coping called you an hour ago no one home must have been an extended consultation gosh you must be a detective or something hey im happy for you the two of you are cute together a regular ken and barbie thanks for your blessing dad whatd you learn at fergusons good old esme that was fun she reminded me of the kind of teachers i used to have more into what lines had to be skipped than what you actually wrote in the composition her house had this permanent lysol smell made me feel as if i was polluting it just by being there porcelain poodles on the hearth little groupings of miniature doggies in glass cases but nothing animate she had me leave my shoes at the door thank god id worn the socks without the holes but for all the spick and span she has a nasty little mind textbook bigot to boot first she tested the waters with a few sly comments about the city changing all those mexicans and asians invading and when i didnt argue really got into how the coloreds and the other outsiders have ruined things listening to her the school used to be a regular junior harvard chock full of genius white kids refined families fabulous school spirit fabulous extracurricular activities all her star pupils going on to bigger and better things she showed me a collection of dear teacher postcards the most recent one was ten years old what did she have to say about the latest illustrious alumna holly was a very dull studentwholly unmemorable a strange girl the whole family was strange clannish unfriendly no pride of ownership in their house the fact that no one really knows what burden senior does for a living bugs her she kept asking me about it didnt believe me when i told her i had no idea what new frontiers tech was all about this is a lady who mainlines conformity alex sounds like the burdens broke too many rules behavioral niggers i said he paused you always did know how to turn a phrase in what way was holly strange didnt go to school didnt work rarely left the house except to take walks at night skulking ferguson called it said she saw her a few times when she was out trimming her flowers holly was skulking along staring at the sidewalk old esme trims her flowers at night twice a day that tell you something about her did holly always skulk alone far as she knows what about the boyfriend sounds as if she was overstating calling him a boyfriend just a colored boy she saw holly talking to a few times in old esmes world view that implies fornication but since we know holly was a virgin the two of them might actually have just talked or anything in between esme said the boy had worked at the local grocery last year but she hadnt seen him in a while bag boy and deliveries she always felt nervous about letting him into her home guess why she didnt know much about him just that he was very big and black but people tend to exaggerate what theyre afraid of so i wouldnt put heavy money on big i said perceptual vigilance learned about it in social psych i learned it interviewing eyewitnesses anyway i couldnt even get a full name out of her she thought his first name was isaac or jacob but wasnt sure something jewishsounding she found it amusing that a colored boy would have a jewish name that launched her into another whatsthisworldcomingto speech i kept waiting for her to segue to faggots but she just droned on about stupid stuff until i found myself staring at the poodles sounds like a lonely lady three times divorced men are beasts she probably talks to the goddam poodles i finally got out of there and stopped by the grocers place called dinwiddies to see if i could learn anything more about the boy but the store was closed planning on going back eventually how about today sure why not not that its likely to lead to anything earthshattering but ricks out doing good works at the free clinic if i stick around ill end up doing laundry or drinking too much i said an hour lunch on me hour it is but forget lunch while were at the market i can palm an apple just like pat obrien walking the beat always wanted to do that be a real cop despite his pessimism milo arrived dressed for work gray suit white shirt red tie note pad in pocket he directed me to a street named abundancia drive which ran through the center of ocean heights and ended at a small town square built around a treeless circular patch of lawn a handlettered sign the kind you see in the small parks of mayfair in london designated the patch as ocean heights plaza the grass was bare except for a white lutyensstyle garden bench chainbolted to the ground next to a no dogs no bicycles warning ringing the patch were business establishments the most prominent was a onestory red brick bank done in retrocolonial complete with pillars pediments and limestone planters brimming with geraniums the rest of the shops were also red brick red brick and gingerbread cute enough for a theme park i found a parking spot in front of a dry cleaners goldleaf gothic lettering was de rigueur for the storefronts welcome to the home of mixed metaphors ficus trees pruned low and trimmed to look like mushrooms grew from circular metal grilles embedded in the sidewalk spaced so the plantings fronted every other store the shops were a classic village mix haberdasheries for both sexes each with a soft spot for ralph lauren ye olde gift emporium and card shoppe alvins apothecary complete with a stone mortar and pestle over dutch doors a medical building that could have passed for santas workshop arnos old world jewelerwatchmaker janeways european bakery steubens imported sausage and charcuterie the ocean café dinwiddies fine grocers and purveyors was a doublewidth enterprise with forestgreen wainscoting and a creamcolored oval sign over the entry that read est california antiquity the picture window was framed with green molding and dominated by a straw cornucopia out of which tumbled a contrived flow of gleaming oversized produce more fruit was displayed in wooden crates slathered with oldfashioned painted labels each apple pear orange and grapefruit had been polished to a high gloss and was individually cradled in damsonblue crepe looks like you picked the right place to palm i said inside the place was bustling and spotless cooled by wooden fly fans serenaded by muzak gourmet foods at the front a liquor section big enough to intoxicate the entire neighborhood foodstuffs stacked to the rafters everything neatly ordered the wide aisles marked by overhead wooden signs painted that same dark green a pair of greenaproned women worked steadily at antique brass cash registers hooked up to computerized scanners three or four shoppers waited in each line no one talked milo walked up to one of the registers and said hi wheres the owner the cashier was young chubby and fair without looking up she said in the back we made our way past pasta and breadstuffs next to the dairy case was a green wooden panel door with a brass lock dangling from an open hasp milo pushed it open and we stepped into a short dark hall cold as a refrigerator rank with an old lettuce smell and filled with generator noise at the end was another door marked employees only milo knocked and opened it revealing a small windowless office paneled in imitation knotty pine and furnished with an old mahogany desk and three red naugahyde chairs the desk was crowded with papers a brass balance scale served as a paperweight for an inchthick stack an assortment of commercial calendars hung on the walls along with a couple of faded hunting prints and a framed photo of a pleasantlooking slightly overweight brunette woman kneeling next to two whitehaired ruddy boys of preschool age a pineridged expanse of lake was in the background the boys struggled to hold on to a fishing rod from which a healthylooking trout dangled the obvious genetic source of the childrens pigmentation sat behind the desk early thirties pinkskinned with thin nearalbino hair cut short and parted on the right he had broad beefy shoulders a nub of a broken nose above a bushy mustache the color and consistency of old hay his eyes were large colored a curious tangray and had a basset droop he wore a blue broadcloth buttondown shirt and redandblue rep tie under a green apron the shirtsleeves were rolled up to the elbows his forearms were pale hairless popeyethick he put down a hand calculator looked up from a pile of invoices and gave a weary smile weights and measures we passed just last week gentlemen milo showed him his police id the blond mans smile faded and he blinked several times as if forcing himself awake oh he stood and extended his hand ted dinwiddie what can i do for you milo said were here to talk about the sniping at hale elementary mr dinwiddie oh that horrible his wince seemed involuntary and sincere he blinked a couple more times thank god no one was hurt no one except holly burden oh yes sure of course he winced again sat down and pushed aside his paperwork poor holly he said its hard to believe shed go and do something like that how well did you know her as well as anyone i guess which means not much at all she used to come in here with her dad im talking years ago when she was just a little girl just after her mom died back when my dad was alive he paused and touched the balance scale i used to bag and check after school and on saturdays holly used to stand behind her dads legs and peek out then draw back really shy she always was kind of a nervous kid quiet as if she was in her own little world id try to talk to her she never answered back once in a while shed take a free candy if her dad would let her most of the time she ignored me when i offered still there was nothing he looked up at us sorry please sit down can i get you some coffee weve got a new european roast brewing out in front in the sample pot no thanks said milo we sat in the red chairs milo said any more recent impressions of her not really said dinwiddie i didnt see much of her they were usually delivery customers the couple of times i did see her wandering around the streets she looked kind of detached detached from what her surroundings the external world not paying attention to what was going on the kind of thing you see in creative people ive got a sister whos a writer very successful screenwriter shes getting into producing emily was always like that fantasizing off in her own world we used to kid her call her space cadet holly was spacey but in her case i dont think it was creativity whys that the grocer shifted in his chair i dont want to speak ill of the dead but basically holly wasnt very bright some of the kids used to call her retarded which she probably wasnt just dull a little below average but in her family that had to be especially tough the rest of the burdens were all pretty intellectual her dads downright brilliant used to work for the government as some kind of highlevel scientist or mathematician the mom did too i think and howard her brother he was a scholastic ace sounds like you knew the family pretty well no not really mostly id just deliver the groceries or go over there for tutoring from howard he was a math whiz totally brilliant with numbers we were in the same class but he could have taught it lots of kids went to him for help everything came easy for him but he really had a thing for math he gave a wistful look he actually stuck with what he loved became some sort of statistician has a great position with an insurance firm out in the valley milo said when you say you and he were in the same class was that at nathan hale dinwiddie nodded all the kids went to hale back in those days things were different he fussed with the knot of his tie not necessarily better mind you just different i said how so he fidgeted some more and lowered his voice listen i work here live here lived here all my life its a great neighborhood in many ways great place to raise kids but the people here pretend nothing will ever change that nothing should ever change and thats not too realistic is it pause standing behind the register or making a delivery or coaching little league kind of gives you the chance to observe you hear all sorts of things ugly things from people you thought were decent people your kids play with and your wife has coffee with racial comments milo said dinwiddie gave a pained look thats not to say its any worse here than anywhere else racisms fairly endemic in our society isnt it but when its your own neighborhood youd just like it to be better fairly endemic in our society it sounded like a phrase out of a textbook milo said do you think any of that the local racial attitudes are related to the sniping no i dont dinwiddie said quickly maybe if it had been someone else you could make the connection but i cant see holly being racist i mean to be racist youd have to be political at least to some degree wouldnt you and she wasnt least as far as i knew like i said she wasnt too in touch with her surroundings what kind of political attitudes did her family have no idea if they had any he said quickly his hand flew to his tie again and he blinked several times in succession i wondered if something about the discussion was putting him on edge really gentlemen i just cant see any political connection he said i truly believe whatever holly did came from inside her her own problem something intrapsychic mental problems said milo shed have to be crazy to do something like that wouldnt you say i said besides being spacey did she ever show signs of other mental problems that i couldnt tell you said dinwiddie like i said i havent seen her in a long time i was just talking theoretically milo said when you saw her walking around the neighborhood was this at night or during the day day im only talking a couple of times id be on my way to make a delivery and shed be making her way down the street kind of a loose shuffle staring down at the sidewalk thats what i meant by spacey anything else you can tell us about the family that might relate to the shooting dinwiddie thought not really detective they were never real social marched to their own drummer but basically they were decent people you can tell a persons character when you check their groceries when he was alive my dad had a system for classifying folks grumblers skinflints nitpickers tomato squeezers a sheepish smile spread under the mustache kind of an usthem thing happens in every profession right dont let on to my customers or id be out of business milo smiled and ran his finger across his lips dinwiddie said its funny when i was younger i used to hear my dad come home and grouse and think he was being intolerant just didnt understand people i majored in sociology in college had all sorts of theories and explanations for why hed become so misanthropic how what he really needed was more intrinsic satisfaction in his work now here i am doing the same job he did and i find myself using the same labels i said which of your dads labels would you apply to the burdens none really they were easy to deal with never complained always paid their bills right away with cash mr burden always had a generous tip ready though he wasnt much for conversation he always seemed busy with something doing his own thing another spacey one said milo not like holly with him you always felt he was lost in thought thinking about something important with holly it just seemed i dont know stuporous as if she were withdrawing from reality but if this is making her sound like some dangerous psychotic thats not what i mean at all shed be the last person id expect to do anything violent on the contrary she was timid a real mouse milo said when did her mother die dinwiddie touched his mustache then tapped a fingertip absently to his tongue lets see i think holly was four or five so that would make it about fifteen years ago whatd she die of some sort of stomach condition i think tumors or ulcers or something im not sure only reason i remember it being the stomach is she used to buy a lot of antacids really stocked up on them whatever it was it wasnt supposed to be fatal but she went in for surgery and didnt come out howard was pretty freaked out all of us were it was the first time anyone in the class had lost a parent we were in high school sophomores howard had never been much of a joiner but after his mom died he really pulled away dropped out of chess club and debate club gained a whole lot of weight he kept on getting good grades that was like breathing for him but he cut himself off from everything else i said how did holly react i cant say i remember anything specific but she was just a little kid so id expect she was devastated so you cant say if her spaciness was due to her mothers death no he stopped smiled hey this sounds more like psychoanalysis than police work i didnt know you guys did this kind of thing milo hooked a thumb at me this gentlemans a noted psychologist dr alex delaware hes working with the kids at hale were trying to get a picture of what happened psychologist huh dinwiddie said i saw a psychologist being interviewed about the kids on tv heavyset fellow big white beard change of plans said milo dr delawares the one dinwiddie looked at me how are they the kids doing as well as can be expected thats real good to hear i send my own kids to private school guilty look shake of the head never thought id be doing that whys that another tug at his tie knot truth be told he said i used to be pretty much of a radical embarrassed grin for ocean heights anyway which means i voted democrat and tried to convince my dad to boycott table grapes in order to help the farm workers that was back when the last thing i wanted to do was run a grocery my actual goal was to do what you do doctor therapy or social work something along those lines i wanted to work with people dad thought that was soft work the ultimate putdown said eventually id come back to the real world i set out to prove him wrong did volunteer work with crippled kids job corps inductees adoption agencies became a big brother for a kid out in east la then dad dropped dead of a heart attack left no insurance just this place and mom was in no position to run it so i stepped in one semester short of my ba it was supposed to be temporary i never got out his brow creased and his eyes drooped lower i remembered his comment about howard burden the wistful look he actually stuck with what he loved anyway he said thats about all i can tell you about the burdens what happened over at hale was a real tragedy lord only knows mr burden didnt need any more but hopefully time will heal he looked to me for confirmation i said hopefully maybe he said people will even learn something from all of this i dont know he picked up his calculator tapped the buttons one more thing mr dinwiddie said milo theres a young man who works or used to work for you making deliveries isaac or jacob dinwiddies thick shoulders tightened and his breath caught he let it out a moment later slowly deliberately isaac ike novato what about him novato said milo hes a hispanic we were told he was black black a lightcomplected black whats that whats he got to do with any of this we were told he was friendly with holly burden friendly the shoulders hunched higher and shrugged milo said he still work for you the grocer glared at us hardly know where we can find him it would be difficult to find him anywhere detective hes dead cremated i scattered the ashes myself off the pier at malibu dinwiddies gaze was angry unyielding finally he looked away down at his desk picked up an order blank gave it an uncomprehending look and put it aside funny you shouldnt know he said that i should be telling you though i guess not considering the size of this city all the homicides you get well he was one of them gentlemen last september shot to death supposedly in a drug burn somewhere down in south central supposedly said milo you have doubts dinwiddie hesitated before answering i guess anythings possible but i seriously doubt it whys that he was a straight arrow just wasnt the dope type i know cops think all civilians are naïve but i did enough volunteer work with juvenile offenders to be a pretty good judge i tried to tell that to the police but they never bothered to come down here and talk to me about him face to face i only found out about the murder because when he hadnt showed up for work for two days running i called his landlady and she told me what had happened said the police had been by told her it was a dope thing i got the name of the detective on the case from her i called him told him i was ikes employer volunteered to come down to the station and give information his attitude wasnt exactly enthusiastic a couple of weeks later he called me back asked me if i wanted to come down and identify the body a formality his words so that he could clear it it was obvious that to him this was just a routine ghetto shooting another case number what really surprised me when i got there was that the detective himself was black he hadnt sounded black over the phone smith maurice smith southeast division know him milo nodded classical selfhatred said the grocer turning all that rage against the self all oppressed groups are at risk for it minorities in official capacities are really vulnerable but in smiths case it may be getting in the way of his doing his job whyd he need you to identify the body ike had no family anyone could locate what about the landlady dinwiddie shrugged again and stroked his mustache shes pretty old maybe she couldnt handle the stress why dont you ask smith what else can you tell us about novato topnotch kid bright charming learned fast not a lick of trouble always willing to do above and beyond the call of duty and believe me nowadays thats rare howd you hire him he answered an ad i put up on the bulletin board at the santa monica college job center he was taking courses there part time needed to work to support himself the allamerican work ethic exactly the kind of thing dad used to extol the gray eyes narrowed course dad never would have hired ike i said did you run into any problems having him work here given the attitudes you described not really people will accept blacks in relatively menial positions milo said do you still have his job application on file no remember his address venice one of the numbered streets fourth avenue or fifth i think the landladys name was gruenberg milo wrote it down what about a picture dinwiddie hesitated opened a drawer took out a color snapshot and handed it to milo i craned and got a look at it group photo dinwiddie the two cashiers out front and a tall lanky mochacolored young man posed in front of the market waving everyone wearing green aprons ike novato had lightbrown kinky hair cut short full lips almond eyes and a roman nose the stooped posture of one whod reached full height early big awkwardlooking hands shy smile this was taken last fourth of july said dinwiddie we always throw a big party for the local kids safe and sane celebration free candy and soda instead of fireworks one of the parents brought a camera and took it milo said can i borrow this dinwiddie said guess so are you saying theres some connection between ike and what happened at the school thats what were trying to find out milo said i cant see that dinwiddie said i said were there any problems with his doing deliveries having him come into peoples houses dinwiddies right hand curled into a fist mounds of muscle and sinew appeared along the massive forearm in the beginning there were a few comments i ignored them and eventually they stopped even a stone racist could see what a decent kid he was he tightened his other hand chalk up one puny point for truth and justice huh but at the time i thought i was doing something important making a stand then he goes down to watts and gets shot im sorry hut it still makes me angry the whole thing was depressing any other reason for him to be down in watts said milo that was detective smiths point the street where he was shot was a notorious crack alley why else would he be there except to make a deal but i still have my doubts ike told me more than once how much he hated drugs how drugs had destroyed his people maybe he was down there to catch a pusher his people said milo thought he had no family im speaking generically detective the black nation and your smiths the one who told me there was no family he said they ran ikes fingerprints through all the police files missing kids whatever and nothing turned up said ike had applied for his social security card only a few months before working for me they had no record of any previous address he told me it would be a potters field situation if no one came forth and claimed the body wince so i took him home what did the boy tell you about his background not much we didnt have extended discussions it was a work situation i got the impression hed had a good education because he was pretty articulate but we never went into detail the name of the game around here is hustle hustle hustle you never asked him for references he came from the college they screen them there and his landlady said he was reliable have you talked to the landlady since his death just once over the phone i asked her if she knew anything about his family she didnt either so i took care of everything did what i could i figured cremation would be i dont know cleaner ecologically thats what i want for myself he raised his hands and let them settle on the desk and thats about all i can tell you gentlemen milo said what was the relationship between him and holly relationship dinwiddie grimaced nothing romantic if thats what youre getting at he was on a completely different level than she was intellectually thered be nothing in common between the two of them weve been told he was her boyfriend then youve been misinformed dinwiddie said clipping his words ocean heights is flapjaw capital of the world too many smallminded people with too much leisure time take anything you hear around here with a container of salt iodized or otherwise milo said weve been informed that ike and holly used to talk dinwiddies hand rose to his tie and loosened it what ike did tell me he said is that when he went to deliver to her house occasionally theyd strike up a conversation he said she was lonely he felt sorry for her and took the time to make her feel good about herself he was that kind of kid she started preparing things for him milk and cookies tried to keep him there which was really unusual for holly she never wanted to talk to anyone i told ike how unusual that was and i warned him about what said milo the sexual thing her developing a crush on him you know the fantasies people have about blacks all the hypersexual nonsense put black and white together and everyone assumes its something dirty add to that the fact that holly wasnt psychologically normal and the risk of trouble was definitely something to worry about to ikes mind he was just being friendly the way youd be to a needy child but i could see her reading more into his friendliness than hed intended coming on to him getting rejected and screaming rape so i advised him to be careful for all of our sakes did he listen to you dinwiddie shook his head he thought i was worrying over nothing assured me there was no danger of anything happening holly never got seductive that all she wanted was a friend what could i say to that that he should reject her because she was white what would that have said to him neither of us answered dinwiddie kept talking in a low deliberate tone as if unaware of our presence one time i was driving home doing a delivery that took me past the burden house and saw the two of them out in front ike was holding a bunch of books and holly was looking up at him as if he were some kind of big brother she and howard had never been close ike looked more brotherly with her than howard ever had i remember thinking how strange it looked a white kid and a black kid actually communicating in ocean heights it could have been a poster for tolerance then i thought how stupid it was that something as simple as that would be strange he punched a button on his calculator studied the number that came up as if it were a puzzle they were just a couple of kids he said trying to get through life and now theyre both gone and ive got a special on asparagus he walked us out through the market business had slowed and the chubby cashier stood idle i lifted a large yellow apple from its crepe bed and handed it to her along with a dollar bill before she could open her register dinwiddie said forget it karen and removed the bill from between her fingers handing it back to me he said on the house dr delaware and heres one for you detective cant take gifts said milo thanks anyway then heres two for dr delaware smiling but intense i thanked him and took the fruit he held the door open for us and stood on the sidewalk next to a ficus mushroom gazing after us as we drove away i cruised down abundancia and came to a stop sign there was a small golden sticker on each apple milo removed his read it and said fiji hoohah watch out gauguin i said that was tahiti he said dont nitpick bit chewed swallowed a bit presumptuous but fine nose and texture these ocean heights folks sure know how to live i said lets hear it for the good life lifted my own apple like a toast glass and took a bite crisp and sweet but i kept expecting a worm to wiggle out i drove through the empty pictureperfect streets at the next stop sign milo said so whatd you think of el grocero frustrated likes to think of himself as a fish out of water but feels guilty about keeping his gills wet know the feeling said milo and i regretted the flippancy of my remark he knew what i was thinking laughed and cuffed my arm dont worry pal its a privileged position being on the outside looking in i turned onto esperanza and the conformist magnolias came into view apparently the boyfriend wasnt a boyfriend maybe maybe not if this novato kid did have a romance thing going with holly he wouldnt have told the boss true i said so all we really know about him is that he and holly talked a few times and that hes dead which in terms of pardon the expression understanding holly could be relevant if ike meant a lot to her his death could have tipped her over the edge trauma leads to rifle games sure the loss could have been especially traumatic for someone with her history the early death of her mother she closed herself off from the world withdrew ive worked with patients who lost a parent at a young age and didnt get help when you dont grieve the sorrow just sits there and festers you stop trusting learn to hate the world holly was a loner if ike was the first person who really tried to relate to her he could have become a substitute parent dinwiddie said she was looking up at him as if he were a big brother lets say he got her trusting again brought her out of her shell then he dies violently it triggers all the garbage shed been sitting on for fifteen years she explodes make sense so far as much sense as anything he said you know better than i do i drove past another block of green lawns a few people were out walking dogs washing cars i thought of lindas car remembered the fog and dread that had settled over ocean heights last night the broken glass the hooked cross what other demons hid themselves crouching and sniggering behind the diamondpaned windows milo stared out his window and munched copsurveilling force of habit pictures kept floating through my mind ugly possibilities when he turned away for a moment i said what if holly and ike did more than just chat what if they got into philosophical raps the rotten state of the world injustice poverty racism given hollys sheltered life the experiences of someone like ike would have been a real eyeopener for her could have really changed her thats what happened in the sixties when white kids from suburbia went to college and encountered minority students for the first time instant radicalization someone else might have channeled it constructively volunteer work altruism but holly was vulnerable because of all that loneliness and anger and distrust its the classic lone assassin profile milo she could have seen herself as ikes avenger vanquishing massengil a symbol of racism could have seemed noble vanquishing milo said sounds pretty medieval maybe she just wanted to shoot kids what would be her motive for that i said weve no indication she resented their presence look alex youre talking about a probable nutcase who knows what she would have had reason to do who knows what kind of crazy things actually ran through her head when you get down to it how much do you really know about her anyway not much at all i said feeling suddenly like one of the pontificating tv experts i exited ocean heights headed back on the winding canyon road toward sunset milo said dont sulk and went back to looking out the window at the boulevard i said still entertaining questions or is the copshop closed for the day questions about what novatos murder the way dinwiddie talked about him any of that intrigue you he turned and faced me what about it is supposed to intrigue me it just seemed as if dinwiddie developed a lot of passion when he discussed ike really tensed up got emotional he got really defensive when denying that holly and ike had been lovers could have been jealousy maybe there was something more than a working relationship between him and ike milo closed his eyes and gave a short weary laugh it happens he said with a wicked smile then he ran his hand over his face yeah i was thinking that myself the guy did get awfully righteous but if there was something sexual dont you think he would be careful not to let on to us i mean how many fiji apples do you think hed sell if the good folks of ocean heights suspected him of that true i said so maybe his emotionality was a result of exactly what he said it was liberal guilt still the picture he painted of novato was kind of odd dont you think black kid with a latin name comes from somewhere back east but doesnt tell anyone where settles in venice enrolls in college in santa monica gets a job in whitebread heaven performs excellently in that job inspires some kind of passion in his employer makes friends with the girl no one talks to then gets blown away in watts not too long after that girl goes for her gun and gets blown away herself milo was silent i said of course im just a rank amateur civilian theorizing the pros that guy from southeast smith didnt think it was weird at all milo said whatd i say about sulking but he looked bothered i said do you really know smith casually and not the worst investigator in the world but not the best milo moved his bulk around trying to get comfortable frowning when he couldnt maury smith is average he said like most people in most jobs putting in time and dreaming about winnebago heaven in all fairness to him a place like southeast divisionll do that to you even if you start out determined to be super cop more bodies in one hot week than we see in six months no matter what anyone says those kinds of numbers will change your attitude about the sanctity of life the same way war does naacps been saying that for a long time nah its not racism okay maybe some of it is but what it really boils down to is context one db out of a hundred thou just aint the same as one out of a hundred i dont care how pure your heart is and a db in crack alley just aint gonna merit the same care as one in stone canyon meaning smiths investigation might have been cursory meaning a black kid gets gunned down in a bad black neighborhood with a baggie of rock clutched in his hot little hands doesnt exactly shout high intrigue we dont know novato was carrying yeah well i guess i can make a few calls and find that out he folded his arms over his chest i said ready for lunch nah the goddam apple filled me complex carbohydrates who needs more i kept my mouth shut a minute later he said tell you what id really like a tall frosty livereating johnny black or reasonable facsimile in lieu of that ill make those phone calls and do the goddam laundry what do you guys call that repression sublimation sublimation yeah drop me back at your place gotta go home and sublimate i didnt like the edge in his voice but his expression warned off debate besides i had a call of my own to make mahlon burdens answering machine message was ten seconds of chamber music followed by a clipped leave your message and three short beeps i said this is alex dela click hello doctor what have you decided im willing to explore the possibilities mr burden when ive got time today doctor ive got nothing but time name the place and the time an hour your house perfect strange word considering his circumstances he gave me an address i already knew and followed it up with precisely detailed directions an hour he said looking forward to it no pride of ownership id expected something flagrantly deviant slovenly at jubilo but at first glance the house was like all the others on the block singlestory ranch the walls sided with aluminum designed to resemble wood painted the greengray of a stormy sea the window casements and front door were the same gray ah the first bit of deviance a monochrome statement when viewed alongside the neighboring houses with their carefully contrasting color schemes i parked began noticing other misdemeanors the small lawn mowed and neatly edged but a halfshade paler than the sprinklerfed emerald of all the others on the block a few thin spots in the grass that threatened to raise the offense to felony level no flower beds just a girdle of creeping juniper separating grass from house no trees either none of the dwarf citrus avocados or birch triplets that graced the lawns of the other homes the gestalt austere but hardly quirky ocean heights was easily offended the front door had been left slightly ajar i rang the bell anyway waited then walked into an entry hall carpeted with a disc of mockpersian before me was a compact square living room whitewalled flatceilinged and rimmed with an obtrusively ornate band of egganddart crown molding the carpeting was green wool spotless but thin as the lawn and looked to be about thirty years old the furniture was of similar vintage the wood stained oxblood the chairs and sofas quilted and upholstered in a chrysanthemum print that shouted spring pleatskirted and sheathed in condomsnug dear plastic everything matched every piece arranged with showroom precision an ensemble i was certain all of it had been bought at the same time i cleared my throat no one responded i waited and gave myself over to fantasy a young couple sunday shopping in some suburban department store sears or a counterpart the smell of popcorn the ding of elevator bells one child in tow a boy the parents anxious budgetconscious but intent on acquisition furniture appliances soft rolls of carpeting cookware dishes all the brandnew optimistic words it took to fill a proper s populuxe home pyrex stainless vinyl formica rayon nylon sheaves of receipts warranties more promises a shopping spree worthy of a gameshow winner all these dreams reduced to an ensemble static as a museum exhibit i said hello a whitepainted brick mantel framed a fireplace that was too clean ever to have been used no screen andirons or tools the top of the mantel was as bare as the walls white walls blank as giant sheets of virgin notepaper the tabula rasa approach to domestic life across the living room was a dining room two thirds its size crenelated molding more green carpet more notepaper walls pecanfinish china cabinet matching buffet a couple of souvenir plates on one of the cabinet shelves grand coulee dam disneyland the rest of the shelves empty an oval table surrounded by eight straightbacked plasticsheathed chairs and topped with a brown pad filled most of the floor space a passthrough with sliding wooden doors was cut into the wall behind the head of the table offering a view of a yellow kitchen i went over and peeked in thirtyyearold refrigerator and stove glazed with yellow porcelain no magnets or reminders on the fridge no cooking smells there was a doorway leading to the rear of the house a note was tacked onto the threshold dr d in the back mb beyond the note an unlit hallway lined with closed doors white space deepening to gray i stepped closer made out the sound of music a string quartet haydn i walked toward it followed the right turn of the hallway and came to a final door the music was loud and clear enough to be live i turned the knob stepped into a large peakceilinged room the planks and crossbeams painted white dark hardwood floor three walls of blond birch paneling the fourth a bank of sliding glass doors that looked out to a small backyard that was mostly cement driveway a silvergray honda sat in front of a corrugated aluminum garage door the glass gave the room an indooroutdoor look what realtors used to call a lanai back in the days when they were peddling tropical dreams what had become in this age of transience and marital fracture the family room the burden family room was big and cold and devoid of furniture devoid of nearly everything except for sixfigures worth of stereo equipment arranged in a bank against one of the birch walls blackmatte cases blackglass instrument panels dials and digital readouts bleeping green and yellow and scarlet and gasflame blue oscilloscopic sine waves fluctuating columns of liquid laser pinpoints of bouncing light amps and preamps tuners graphic equalizers bassboosters trebleclarifiers filters a reeltoreel tape player a pair of cassette decks a pair of turntables a compact disc player a laserdisc player all of it connected via a tangle of cable to a stonehenge arrangement of black fabricfaced speaker columns eight obelisks spread throughout the room big enough to project a heavy metal band into the bleachers of a baseball stadium a string quartet flowed out at medium volume three quarters of a quartet both violin parts and the viola mahlon burden sat on a backless stool in the center of the room cradling a cello playing by ear eyes closed swaying in tempo thin lips pursed as if for a kiss he had on a white shirt dark trousers black socks white canvas tennis shoes his shirt sleeves were bunched carelessly at the elbows gray stubble flecked his chin and his hair looked unkempt seemingly unaware of my presence he played on fingers assuming positions along the ebony board bearing down quivering with vibrato floating the bow across the strings in a horsehair caress controlling his volume so perfectly that the cello meshed seamlessly with the recorded sounds regurgitated by the speakers man and machine man as machine to my ears he was good symphony quality or close to it but i was put off by the sterile staginess of the whole thing i was here to exhume not to be serenaded but i heard him out kept waiting for him to make a mistake some flaw in tempo or sour tone that would justify an intrusion he kept playing perfectly i endured an entire movement when the piece was finished he kept his eyes closed but flexed his bow arm and took a deep breath before i could say anything the next movement began opening with an arpeggiated solo by the first violin burden smiled as if meeting an old friend readied his bow i said mr burden he opened his eyes i said very pretty he gave me a blank look and his face twitched the second violin joined in then the viola he glanced back at the columnar speakers as if making eye contact with their fabric faces could somehow forestall the inevitable forestall what hed initiated the moment for the cellos entry arrived the music flowed exquisite but incomplete unsettling like a beautiful woman without a conscience burden gave one last look of regret then stood put his cello in its case then the bow out of a trouser pocket came a small black remotecontrol module a single button push fade to black the silence emptied the room of more than music i noticed for the first time that the birch paneling was really some kind of photoprinted plyboard the scuffmarks on the hardwood stood out harsh as keloid scars the sliding glass door hadnt been cleaned in a while through the cloudy panes the concrete and grass view was depressing family room without a family he said i play every day without fail concentrate on the technically challenging pieces you play very well nod at one time i had ambitions of doing it for a living but its not a very good living unless one is extremely lucky i never counted on luck uttered with more pride than bitterness he walked over to the stereo bank i believe in doing things systematically dr delaware thats my main talent actually im not much in terms of innovation but i do know how to put things together to create systems and to use them optimally he fondled the equipment then began delivering a lecture on each of the components waiting out delay tactics was one of my talents i just stood there and listened so you might be asking yourself why two cassette players this one he pointed is conventional magnetic tape but this one is dat digital audio tracking state of the art the inventors hope to compete with cds though im not yet convinced still the sound quality is impressive i had a prototype a full year before it hit the market it interfaces quite well with the rest of the system sometimes thats a problem components will meet individual specifications but not blend well with other members of the system like an instrument thats been tuned to itself with no regard for the rest of the orchestra acceptable only in a very limited context the key is to approach life with a conductors perspective the whole greater than its parts he moved his hand as if wielding a baton i gave him a dose of therapists silence he stroked a black glass face and said i suppose youll want to know about our origins hollys origins that would be a good start come with me we walked down the hallway he opened the first door on the left and we entered a whitewalled room with a single window covered with gray drapes the drapes were drawn light came from a spindly chrome halogen lamp in one corner the carpeting was an extension of the green id seen in the living room from the size and placement i guessed it had once been the master bedroom hed converted it into an office one wall of sliding mirrored closet doors and against the other three white formica cabinet modules arranged in a u shelves on top cabinets on the bottom black formica work space sandwiched in between the shelves were filled with boxes of floppy disks computer manuals software manuals harddisk replacement units stationery office supplies and books mostly reference works one entire wall was given over to phone directories hundreds of them conventional business only something called the cole reverse compendia of zip codes and a handlettered volume entitled zips subanalys the walls behind the desk tops were lined with power strips a continuous stripe of electrical outlets each connected to something by stout black cable three pc workstations each with a brushedsteel and black vinyl secretary chair battery backup laser printer and phone modem an additional ten multiline phones five connected to more modems and fax machines the others to automatic answering machines a trio of automatic dialers a huge batchcopying xerox machine sunk into one of the cabinets only the top half of its bulky chassis visible a smaller desktop copier an automatic checkwriter an electronic postage meter other apparatus i couldnt identify the room buzzed and hummed and flashed phones ringing twice before answering machines kicked in fax machines excreting sheets of paper at odd intervals each sheet falling neatly into a collecting bin the computer monitors displayed amber rows of letters and numbers bunched in groups of four and five an incomprehensible series of alphanumeric codes that moved across the screen in tiny increments like cars in a traffic jam a herkyjerky electromagnetic kinesis that worked hard at simulating life burden looked proud paternally proud his clothes blended with the room blackandwhite camouflage this was where he went to disappear my nerve center he said the hub of my enterprises mailing lists he nodded as well as marketing consultations to other corporations demographic targeting give me a zip code and ill tell you worlds about a person give me a street address and ill go a good deal further predict trends its what led me to this another conductors flourish as he slid open a drawer removed a booklet and handed it to me heavy stock glossy a title in brightyellow computertype lettering new frontiers technology ltd over a jetblack banner below the title an ostentatiously muscular darkhaired man naked from the waist up and wearing yellow spandex pants straddled a meterladen exercise machine cords ran from the equipment to a yellow belt around his waist and to a matching sweatband his deltoids pecs and biceps were hypertrophied meatcarvings veins popped as if worms had burrowed under his skin every bead of perspiration stood out in vitreous basrelief his smile said pain was the ultimate high behind him a similarly hewn blond woman in a yellow body suit and a beltheadband hookup created a marathon blur on a crosscountry skiing machine not unlike the one i had at home the cords and headgear made them resemble candidates for electrocution i turned a page mailorder catalogue one of those yuppystroking affairs that seemed to arrive in the mail every day i thought i remembered throwing this one out you were on the mental health specialist list i had bought my ski machine from a catalogue but not this one burden was staring at me prouder than ever waiting i knew what i was expected to do why not all part of the job i examined the catalogue the inside cover was a twoparagraph letter above a color photo of a handsome broadshouldered man in his midthirties he had wavy hair luxuriant walrus mustaches and a clipped beard the schweppes man in his prime he wore a pink buttondown shirt with a perfect collar roll blue foulard and saddleleather braces and had been posed in a clubby atmosphere mahoganypaneled room highbacked leather chair carved leathertopped desk on the desk were an antique hourglass brass nautical instruments a blueshaded bankers lamp and a cutcrystal inkwell baronial oil portraits hung in the background i could almost smell the sealing wax under the letter was a fountain pen signature elaborate and illegible the photo caption identified him as gregory graff esq chief consulting officer of new frontiers technology limited headquartered in greenwich connecticut the letter was concise but friendly just this side of preachy extolling the virtues of vitamins exercise balanced nutrition selfdefense and meditative relaxation what graff called the new age actualization lifestyle for todays striving man and woman the second paragraph was a pitch for this months new products offered at special discount for those who ordered early the facing page was an order form complete with an number and the assurance that purchase specialists were standing by to take calls twentyfour hours a day the catalogue was divided into sections marked by bluetabbed index pages i turned to the first body and soul an assortment of ironpumping gizmos that would have done the inquisition proud demonstrated by the sculpted couple on the cover followed by nirvananostrums for the postexhaustion winddown massage oil airpurifiers wave machines whitenoise simulators little black boxes that promised to change the atmosphere in any home into one that stimulated alphawave meditation an electric tibetan harmony bell recreating one developed centuries ago in the himalayas to capture the unique harmonies and overtones of highaltitude wind currents section two was beauty and balance organic cosmetics highfiber cookies and candies little yellow bottles of betacarotene powder lecithin capsules bee pollen zinc lozenges waterpurifying crystals aminoacid combos something new called niteafter that claimed to repair physiological damage wrought by the deadly ps pollution piggingout and partying pills for sleeping soundly for waking up cheerful for enhancing personal power during business meetings and power lunches a mineral concoction that claimed to restore psychophysiological homeostasis and enhance individual tranquillity presumably during bathroom breaks next came style and substance clothing and accessories in exotic hides and brushed steel a programmable selflocking and opening briefcase with a brain pseudoantique accoutrements conceived for the st century and beyond predistressed aviator jackets megasweat personal sauna warmup suits a symphony in nylon latex teflon downfill napalamb and cashmere four was access and excel which seemed to translate to geegaws the world had done quite well without till now voiceactivated car starters selfcooling oven mitts motorized bagel slicers chamois microwave covers everything monogrammable for a modest extra charge i zipped through and was about to close the catalogue when the title of the last section caught my eye life and limb a study in styleconscious paranoia bugging devices hidden tape recorders phonetap detectors infrared cameras and binoculars for turning your adversarys night into your day privacy locks for conventional phones directlink phones in hotline red take control of ma bell talk only when you want and to whom you want polygraphic stressmeters camouflaged as

alsatian shepherd or r rottweiler ultrathin paper shredders that fit into an attaché case cameras that looked like pens radios that looked like pens packets of dehydrated survival cuisine a reprise of the waterpurifying crystals when l got to the new age graphitehandled swiss army knife with minisurgical array i closed the catalogue very interesting i held it out to burden he shook his head keep it doctor my compliments youve been receiving it for five months but havent ordered anything yet perhaps a closer look will change your mind the catalogue went into my jacket pocket i said quite an eclectic collection he responded with all the hesitation of a rodeo bull let out of the stall my brainchild i was in the army just after korea cryptography and decoding and computer technology the infancy of the computer age after discharge i went to washington dc and worked for the census bureau we were just starting to computerize the old days of clunky mainframes and ibm cards i met my wife there she was a very bright woman mathematician masters degree im selftaught never finished high school but i ended up being her mentor all those years working with statistics and demographic patterns we got a good fix on shifting population masses trends how people in different regions and social strata differ in their purchasing patterns the predictive power of residential variables when zip codes came into being it was beautiful such simplification and now the new subcodes make it even easier he sat down in one of the secretary chairs made a half whirl and spun back the beauty of it doctor of the informational age is that things can be done so simply when i left public service i adapted my knowledge to the business world given my excellent typing skills combined with programming ability im a corporation to myself dont even need a secretary just a few tollfree lines several freelance operators working from home stations and a few privately contracted printers in various locations around the country i interface with all of them by modem no inventory or warehousing costs because theres no inventory at all the consumer gets the catalogue and makes his or her choice the operators take the order communicate it immediately to the manufacturer the manufacturer sends the product directly to the consumer upon delivery confirmation the manufacturers hired for retail markup my fee for facilitating electronic middleman yes exactly the advanced state of my technology allows me to be extremely flexible i can add and delete products based on sales performance alter copy and produce highly focused mailouts within a twentyfourhour period ive even begun experimenting with an automated operator system pretaped messages combined with voiceactivated pauses the tape waits until the consumers finished talking then talks back in perfectly modulated grammatical regionless english so one day i may not need any employees at all the ultimate cottage industry whos graff a model i got him through a new york agency youll notice hes designated as chief consulting officer a title thats meaningless from a legal point of view im the president and chief executive officer i went through hundreds of photos before picking him my marketing research told me exactly what i was looking for youthful vitality combined with authority a beard works very well for the latter as long as its short and neat the mustache implies generosity the surname graff was chosen because upscale consumers respect anything teutonic regard it as efficient intelligent and reliable but only up to a point a forename like helmut or wilhelm wouldnt have done too german too foreign gregory scores high on the likability scale allamerican greg hes one of the boys with teutonic ancestry a great athlete smartest boy on the block but someone you like my research shows that many people assume he has a graduate degree usually law or an mba the buttondown shirt communicates stability the tie affluence and the suspenders provide a flair creativity hes a man you believe in instinctively aggressive and goaloriented but not hostile dependable but not stodgy and concerned humanistic humanism is important to my target consumers feeling charitable twice a year i give them the option of donating one percent of their total purchase to a selection of charities gregorys an excellent fundraiser people reach deep into their pockets im thinking of franchising him sounds very well thoughtout oh it is and very lucrative emphasizing the last word to let me know he meant megabucks a cottage industry tycoon that didnt mesh with the worn carpet the thirtyyearold furniture the dirty honda but id met other rich men who didnt care to show it or were afraid to show it and hid behind a just plain folks facade right now he was hiding something else i said lets talk about holly he looked surprised holly of course is there anything else you need to know about me the naked narcissism threw me id thought his selfabsorption was a means of delaying painful questions now i wasnt sure i said im sure ill have lots of questions about all your family members mr burden but right now id like to see hollys room her room makes sense absolutely we left the office he opened a door across the hall more notepaper walls two windows covered by venetian blinds a thin mattress lay on the floor parallel to a low wooden bedframe the mattress had been slit open in several places the ticking peeled back the foam scooped out in handfuls a crumpled ball of white bed sheet lay rolled in one corner nearby was a pillow that had also been slit and sat in a pool of foam chunks the only other furniture was a pressedwood threedrawer dresser below an oval mirror the mirror glass was fingersmudged the dresser drawers were pulled open some clothing cotton undergarments and cheap blouses remained inside other garments had been removed and piled on the floor atop the dresser sat a plastic clock radio its beaverboard back had been removed and it had been gutted parts spread across the wood compliments of the police said burden i looked past the disarray saw the sparseness that had preexisted any police intrusion what did they take with them not a thing they were after diaries any sort of written record but she never kept any i kept telling them that but they just went in and pillaged did they say you were allowed to clean it he fingered his eyeglasses i dont know i suppose they did he bent and picked a piece of foam from the floor rolled it between his fingers and drew himself up a bit holly used to do most of the cleaning twice a year id bring a professional crew in but she did it the rest of the time she liked it was very good at it i guess im still expecting her to walk right in with a dustrag and start tidying his voice broke and he walked quickly to the door please excuse me take as long as you like i let him go and turned my attention back to the room trying to conjure the place as it had been when holly had been alive not much to work with those white walls no nails or brackets not a single hole or darkened square young girls typically used their walls as plaster notebooks holly had never hung a picture never tacked a pennant never softened her life with rockposter rebellion or calendar imagery what had she dreamed about i kept searching for some sign of personal imprint but found none the room was celllike assertively barren did her father realize this wasnt right i recalled the back room barren except for his toys his own place of refuge cold as a glacier emptiness as a family style daughter as charwoman handmaiden to the cottage tycoon the room began to close in had she felt it too living here sleeping here feeling her life drift by ike anyone who cared whod taken the time to care might have been seen as a liberator prince charming what had his death done to her despite what shed become what shed done i felt for her i heard milos voice in the back of my head getting mushy on me pal but i wanted to believe that if milo were to come to this place hed feel something too the door to the closet was partially ajar i opened it and looked in the poisonperfume of camphor more clothing not much of it mostly casual knits tshirts sweaters a couple of jackets the pockets had been slit the linings shredded faded colors more heaps of clothing on the floor bargainbin quality daughter of a tycoon above the clothes pole were two shelves the lower one bore two games candy land chutes and ladders preschool amusements had she stopped playing at the age of six apart from that nothing no books no fan magazines no stuffed animals or mugs printed with fatuous phrases no clearplastic things that snowed when you turned them upside down i closed the closet door and turned back to the ravaged room tried to picture the way it had looked before the police had come the damage made it seem more human cot and a dresser blank walls a radio the word cell kept flashing but id seen jail cells that looked more inviting this was worse punitive solitary confinement i had to get out of there burden was back in his office sitting at one of the computer workstations i wheeled one of the secretary chairs into the center of the room and sat down he touchtyped rapidly for a few moments before looking up dryeyed so whats the next step doctor holly didnt seem to have many interests he smiled ah the room youre thinking i isolated her for some ulterior motive exactly what id been thinking but i said no just trying to get a picture of the way she lived the way she lived well it wasnt like that believe me though i can understand your thinking it was ive done my reading on child psychology so i know all the theories of child abuse isolating the designated victim in order to maximize control but that had nothing to do with us not even remotely thats not to say were we were social butterflies as a family or individually our pleasures have always been solitary reading good music holly loved music i always encouraged discussions of current events various cultural debates howard my firstborn took to that holly didnt but i always tried to provide the same sorts of things other children seemed to like toys games books holly never showed any interest in any of it she hated to read most of the time the toys stayed in the box what did she do for fun fun he drew out the word as if it were foreign fun for fun she talked to herself created fantasies and she was inventive ill grant her that could take a piece of string or a rock or a spoon from the kitchen and use it as a prop she had a terrific imagination genetic no doubt im highly imaginative however ive learned to channel it productively she didnt she simply fantasized went no further with it what were her fantasies about i have no idea she was a demon for privacy liked to close her door tight even when she was very young just sit on the floor or on her bed talk and mumble if i prodded her to get fresh air shed go out into the backyard and settle down on the grass and start in doing exactly the same thing i said when she was younger did she rock back and forth or try to hurt herself he smiled like a wellprepared student no doctor she wasnt autistic not remotely if you talked to her shed respond if she felt like it there was no echolalic speech nothing psychotic she was just very selfsufficient from an amusement standpoint she made her own fun i watched the constantly blinking phones and selfshifting computer images his fun and she never kept any sort of diary no she hated paper threw everything out hated clutter was a bug on neatness probably another example of genetics i plead guilty to that kind of precision he smiled not looking guilty at all i said i saw only two games in her closet what happened to all the toys and the books when she was thirteen she did a massive housecleaning took everything out of her room except for her radio and her clothing and piled it up in the hall very neatly when i asked her what she was doing she insisted i get rid of it so of course i did gave it to goodwill there was no arguing with holly when she made her mind up she didnt want anything to replace what shed gotten rid of not a thing she was quite happy with nothing nothing but chutes and ladders and candy land yes those a splitsecond flinch i snared it as if it were a moth how old was she when she got those two games five they were bought for her fifth birthday by her mother he flinched again forced a smile you see weve got an insight already what do you make of it an attempt on her part to cling to the past his tone was clinical detached the classic intellectualizer trying to turn the interview into a chat between colleagues i said im not much for interpretation lets talk about her relationship with her mother a freudian approach trying to keep any edge out of my voice i said a thorough one mr burden he didnt say anything turning slightly he tapped his fingers on the keyboard i waited watched the letters and numbers on the monitor do their freeway crawl so he finally said i guess this is what people in your field would call active listening a strategic silence holding back to get the patient to open up he smiled i read about that too i spoke with deliberate patience mr burden if this is uncomfortable for you we dont have to continue i want to continue he sat up sharply without grace and his glasses slid down his nose by the time hed righted them he was smiling again youll have to excuse my i suppose youd term it resistance this whole thing has been very difficult of course it has thats why theres no reason to cover everything at once i can come back another time no no therell be no better time he looked away from me touched the keyboard again can i offer you something juice tea nothing thanks if the things ive brought up are too hard for you to discuss right now perhaps theres some topic youd like to get into no no lets stay on track bite the bullet her mother my wife elizabeth wyman burden b d he tilted his head back gazed at the ceiling an exceptional woman deductive and intuitive and extremely talented musically talented she was very adept at the viola da gamba howard played the modern viola seemed quite promising but dropped it i helped elizabeth develop her abilities she complemented me beautifully he twisted his mouth as if searching for the right expression settled on regret holly was nothing like her really nothing like me either really both of us betty and myself are were highly intelligent thats not a boast simply a descriptive statement as a couple we were intellectually oriented as is howard i saw early that he had a gift for mathematics and tutored him intensively not remedial tutoring he was always an excellent student supplementary tutoring so that he wouldnt sink to the level of the public school system be dragged down to the lowest common denominator the school wasnt meeting his needs not by a long shot im sure your experience has shown you the entire systems oriented toward mediocrity howard thrived on what i gave him stayed on the math track hes a graduate actuary passed all ten exams the first time which is almost unheard of youngest man in the state to do so you should speak to him about holly get his point of view here ill give you his number he lives out in the valley he turned back toward his desk took a small piece of paper out of a drawer and scrawled on it i put it away he said howards exceptionally bright but holly wasnt much of a student he shook his head when she got cminuses it was because of teacher charity what was the problem he hesitated i could spin you some yarn about poor motivation being bored in class never finding her niche but the truth is she simply wasnt very intelligent an iq of eightyseven not retarded but the low end of the normal range when did you have her tested at age seven i did it myself you tested her thats correct using what test i said expecting some sort of quickandeasy questionnaire lifted from a selfhelp book the wechsler intelligence scale for children its the test of choice isnt it the most extensively validated the wechslers an excellent test mr burden but it requires quite a bit of training in order to administer and score it properly not to worry he said with sudden cheer i trained myself read the manual carefully and boned up on a number of related articles in psychology journals then i practiced on howard he took to it like a duck to water scored one fortynine top tenth of a percent i believe the wechslers not supposed to be sold to laymen howd you get hold of it sly smile not thinking of filing a complaint are you doctor i crossed my legs casually returned the smile and shook my head you must be pretty resourceful actually he said it was painfully simple i filled out an order blank at the back of one of the psychology journals sent in my money put a phd after my name enclosed a card from my business at the timedemographics incorporated applied social research it must have sounded sufficiently psychological to the company because a week later the test came parcel post flaunting his duplicity but then why would someone who made his living hawking tibetan harmony bells and personal power pills shy away from a bit of selfserving subterfuge i did a fine job of testing he said more thorough than any school psychologist would have been and i took the trouble to retest her twice at ages nine and eleven the results were almost identical eightyseven and eightyfive no outstanding deficits or marked strengths no imbalance between verbal and performance scores just a general dullness my theory is that she experienced some sort of intrauterine trauma that affected her central nervous system perhaps due to her mothers advanced age betty was thirtynine when she conceived in any event there had to be some kind of brain damage didnt there it might have been worse but for our unique situation what do you mean given average heredity she might very well have turned out truly retarded with betty and me as parents she was given a genetic boost into the dull normal range i said do you have her testing profile no i threw it all out years ago what would have been the point did you ever consult a specialist about her learning problems in the beginning i gave the school a chance to come up with something saw the usual assortment of civil service flunkies counselors special education teachers whatnot holly didnt fit into any of their classification groups too smart for educable mentally retarded too dull for a normal classroom no discipline or management problems that would have qualified her for educationally handicapped they had conferences those types love to have conferences sat there and talked down to me with their jargonthought they could hide behind jargon because i didnt have a degree after my name would there be any records of those conferences no i demanded they destroy them im in the information business i know how records can come back to haunt they tried to protest some stupid regulation but i prevailed sheer force of personality they were such a weakwilled bunch so dull themselves endless talk no action i realized early on that i was on my own any meaningful remediation would have to take place at home so i washed my hands of them its the same way i feel about that policeman frisk thats why i took the initiative to call you i know youre different the second negative reference hed made to the school i said did you discuss your feelings about the school with holly he gave me a long stare searching illuminated by unwelcome insight doctor are you trying to say i planted hatred in her mind im trying to get a picture of how she felt about the school she hated it she must have it represented failure to her all those years of incompetence and insensitivity how else could she have felt but she wasnt about to kill anyone because of that he gave a derisive laugh i said what kinds of remedial things did you do gave her my personal attention when shed accept it sat down with her every evening after dinner and walked her through her homework tried to get her to concentrate tried to bribe her what youd call operant conditioning that didnt work because she really didnt want anything eventually i did get her reading skills and math levels to a point where she could function in the real world simple instructions and computations road signs she wasnt interested in or capable of any higher abstractions how was her attention span just fine for things she was interested in cleaning and straightening listening to pop music on her radio and dancing to it when she thought no one was looking nonexistent for things she didnt care about but isnt that true of anyone dancing i said trying to picture it so her physical coordination was okay adequate which is all anyone needs for the dances they do today he flapped his arms and made a grotesque face betty and i used to dance seriously longforgotten baroque and classical terpsichore gavottes minuets steps that really required virtuosity we were quite a pair drifting back inevitably to selfcongratulation feeling as if i needed a thick rope to tug things back to holly i said did you ever consider medication ritalin or something similar not after i read up on the effects of longterm amphetamine usage stunted growth anorexia possible brain damage the last thing holly needed was more brain damage besides she wasnt hyperactive more on the lethargic side actually preferred to sleep late loll in bed im an early riser did she have periods of emotional depression he dismissed that with a wave her mood was fine she just lacked energy at first i thought it might be nutritional something to do with blood sugar or her thyroid but all her blood tests were normal blood tests halfexpecting him to answer that hed punctured her vein himself i said did your family doctor have any suggestions when he gave you the results never had a family doctor never needed one i took both of them howard and holly to the public health service for their blood work for their immunizations too told the civil servants there that i suspected some kind of contagious infection its their responsibility to check that kind of thing so they were forced to do it i figured i might as well get something back for my tax dollars genuine glee at dissembling how much of what he told me about anything could be believed who managed their childhood diseases where did you take them when they had fevers and needed antibiotics they were very healthy children rarely ran high fevers the few times they did i brought it down with aspirin fluids exactly what a doctor would tell me to do the couple of times they needed penicillin they got it from the health service measles passed them by chicken pox and mumps i managed according to the books genuine medical books the physicians desk reference i can read instructions as well as any doctor selfsufficiency i said exactly in some quarters thats still considered worthwhile trumpeting his achievements had made his mr peepers persona fade completely he looked belligerent flushed somehow bigger huskier a bantam cock swelling as he scanned the barnyard for rivals changing the subject i said theres quite an age difference between holly and howard eleven years and yes she was an unplanned child but not an unwanted one when betty learned she was pregnant she was surprised but happy and thats saying a lot because she wasnt a healthy woman bleeding ulcers irritable bowel syndrome i dont know if youre familiar with that but she suffered from problem flatulence very bad chronic pain nevertheless she carried on like a trooper nursed holly for eleven months exactly the time wed allotted to howard she was an excellent mother very patient how was holly affected by her death quite severely id assume assume assume with holly there was no way of knowing how she really felt about anything because she didnt talk didnt express herself very well did she attend the funeral yes she did i had one of the mortuary attendants watch over her in a room off the chapel during the service and when we went out to the grave afterwards i sat down with her and explained what had happened she stared at me didnt say anything cried just a bit and then walked away out to the lawn to sit spin her fantasies i let her do it for a while then took her home a couple of times i heard her crying at night but when i went in she stopped and rolled away and refused to discuss it with me how did you explain to her what had happened i told her her mother had been very sick she knew that shed seen betty take to bed i said shed gone into the hospital to be treated for her stomachaches but that the doctors had been stupid and made mistakes and theyd killed her with their stupidity and wed have to go on without her and be strong that we were still a family and would carry on as a family your wifes death was due to medical malpractice he looked at me as if i were in the dull normal range the woman had a nonfatal condition doctor she bled to death on the operating table in the presence of a full surgical team did you pursue it legally he gave a sharp mocking laugh i talked to a couple of attorneys but they wouldnt take the case supposedly it wasnt cut and dried enough given her prior medical history the truth was they had more than their share of whiplashes they didnt want to bet their contingency fees on something that required some real research i suppose i could have found some ambulance chaser to take it on but at the time i had other things on my mind two children to raise a business to run i was doing all directmailing back then still building up my lists much more laborintensive than it is today so i needed all my energy for that it must have been a difficult time for you not really i attacked it systematically kept everything organized howard stayed on the straighta track he stopped still i suppose the way holly turned out was partly my fault why do you say that i have an impressive array of intellectual skills and talents but i wasnt successful in communicating them to her in getting her going on some sort of goaloriented program she persistently shut me out and i allowed it because i didnt want to be cruel so perhaps i was too kind he shrugged of course hindsight is always twentytwenty isnt it luxuriating in bogus confession despite my aversion to snap diagnoses a diagnostic label kept creeping into my mind narcissistic personality disorder pathological egotism it fit even with the way hed chosen to make a living beauty and balance access and excel the catalogue was a paean to narcissism i was willing to bet hed put his brainchild ahead of his children put himself ahead of everyone and everything i tried to imagine what it would have been like to be one of his children and my sympathy for holly climbed another rung so he said we seem to be doing well what else can i help you with doctor how did howard and holly get along very well no fights did they have much to do with each other not much howard was busy with his activities studies extracurricular clubs and holly stayed in her room thats not to say he didnt love her he was always concerned about her if a bit baffled hows he holding up like a trooper is he married of course has a big house in encino south of the boulevard one lovely daughter sharp as a tack theyre all holding up like troopers go visit them see for yourself you really should now that i think about it do speak with howard sounding urgent go talk to my intelligent child the one that came out good i said what about friends holly no she didnt have any when she was very young i remember a few neighborhood children coming over they made noise and bothered my work and i had to shoo them outside but eventually that stopped holly wasnt much for group play when did it stop he thought about that what you want me to say is that everything changed after her mother died right but in terms of the friend situation im afraid i cant be that definite in fact im almost certain she lacked playmates well before bettys death she wasnt much of a playmate herself liked to go off on her own and leave her little guests in the lurch what about when she got older did she make any school chums none she didnt like anything related to school wanted to drop out when she was fifteen nagged me to allow her to take the equivalency test i knew shed fail it and refused to let her but she kept on me she could be quite stubborn when she set her mind on something finally when she was sixteen i agreed she took it and failed did that bother her not really neither of us was surprised i made her stick it out at pali until she graduated at least get the paper not that shed earned it but the ninnies just kept passing her through typical civil service approach take the path of least resistance what did she do after graduation stayed home listened to her radio the pop music and talk shows she could play it twentyfour hours a day i assigned her household chores straightening cleaning doing simple paperwork she enjoyed doing things for me free livein help convenient some mens idea of a wife did she make any recent acquaintances since graduation how could she she never went anywhere i said ive been told she was friendly with a delivery boy from dinwiddies market isaac novato his jaw set and he moved forward on his chair where did you hear about this supposed friendship i was told he was someone she knew they were seen talking talking well thats possible the boy delivered groceries to our home every week holly let him in and gave him his tip so i suppose they might have talked as part of the transaction what else did you hear thats about it is it well i doubt they were actually friends not that it would bother me if they had been no doubt you know hes black unlike others in this neighborhood in this country i consider race irrelevant i judge a person by his accomplishments not the concentration of melanin in his skin given that credo i wondered how hed judged his daughter he said you seem skeptical not at all novato was treated decently in this house feel free to ask him thats not possible i said hes dead dead the shock froze his face thawing gradually but not completely leaving him with a distant look in his eyes first reaction id seen out of him that i was certain was spontaneous when did he die last september september come to think of it i dont recall seeing him for a while did holly show any signs of being upset around that time upset no not that i noticed how did he die he was murdered oh my by whom its unsolved the police think it was some sort of drug deal gone bad the police do they think theres some connection to holly no it just came up when they traced her former acquaintances acquaintances he said one thing i can guarantee you is that holly had nothing to do with drugs im sure she didnt she had nothing to do with shooting at children either pause but what if she got caught up in something if novato got her into something such as some kind of corruption he closed his eyes a long silence passed and his face lost expression taking his selfabsorption under wraps one of the laser printers spewed paper some of it fell to the floor he ignored it finally opened his eyes anything else he said still sounding preoccupied the police said it was your rifle she took to the school did she know how to shoot not at all she hated weapons my firearms collection was the one part of the house she refused to clean so that whole theory is nonsense she was found with the rifle that doesnt make her a murderer she could have been lured there convinced to take the remington with her a flight of wishful thinking rapid enough to make my nose bleed i said lured how i dont know yet but this novato situation gives me something to chew on perhaps one of his gang friends had something to do with it theres no evidence he was involved with gangs in this city drugs mean gangs another long silence i said when did yon notice the rifle was missing i didnt but that means nothing i rarely looked at the collection id lost interest in it where do you keep the collection he got up and took me back out into the hall the door next to hollys room opened to a deep cedar closet lined with gun racks on three walls the racks were empty the floor had been vacuumed the space smelled of machine oil and tarnish the police took all of it he said every piece for analysis im supposed to get it back soon but you can bet it will take plenty of wrestling with red tape i counted eight slots on each of the three racks nice size collection all long guns antiques for the most part flintlocks black powder in nonfunctional condition i bought the lot as an investment when i was being discharged from the service an old army acquaintance needed quick cash theyve performed quite nicely as investments though i never bothered to sell because frankly i dont need the money thinking of hollys poor marksmanship i said what about the remington what about it was it a collectors item too no just a runofthemill remington legal and registered for hunting he shook his head used to hunt but havent since i was a boy i was an excellent shot won marksmans ribbons in the army but i had no reason to pursue it any further the rifle was for personal protection i said did you have some brush with crime that led you to arm yourself that amused him no this was an ounce of prevention where i grew up rural wisconsin guns are a part of any household just like salt and meat and butter no doubt you advocate gun control why do you say that being liberal most mental health people are liberal arent they stubborn believers in the basic goodness of humanity in any event im not apologetic about keeping arms and the suggestion that somehow im to blame for what happened is absurd besides holly never shot at anyone never would never could she didnt know how to handle firearms thats why none of what theyre saying makes sense unless she was corrupted the night before the shooting i said did you hear her leave the house no he said i go to bed early im an extremely sound sleeper does the house have an alarm system yes he said though youll notice theres no console pad in the entry hall my systems a good deal more subtle did holly know how to operate it of course she wasnt imprisoned and she switched it off before she left the alarm never went off so obviously she did but she switched it on again it was set when i woke up i had no idea shed left was that typical of her when she left at night leaving at night wasnt typical mr burden holly was seen taking walks around the neighborhood at night more genuine surprise well she may have stepped out from time to time to chase away a cat or take some air but by and large she stayed in her room she had everything she needed right here his stare was fierce he looked at his watch i suppose thats it for today a statement not a question i said sure he walked me to the door so he said howre we doing what do you think were doing fine he took hold of my sleeve she was an innocent believe me a naïf iq of eightyseven you more than anyone know what that means she lacked the intellectual capacity to plot and violence wasnt in her nature i didnt raise her that way shed have no reason to shoot anyone certainly not children would she have reason to shoot a politician he shook his head exasperated i cant help but feel doctor that youre still not grasping who she was the way she lived she never read the papers never cared a whit about politics or current affairs or the outside world she slept late listened to her radio did her dances cleaned the house scrubbed it until it sparkled at the proper time she prepared simple meals for both of us cold food i did all the cooking when cooking was called for she liked her routine she found comfort in it he removed his glasses held them up to the entry light and peered through them it wont be the same without her ill be doing those things for myself now during the time id spent there the sun had set and i walked out into darkness it enhanced the feeling of having been away for a long time having been on another planet an unsettling man the portrait hed painted of his daughter was bleak but instructive living in a cell talking to herself scrubbing everything spotless not autistic but aspects of her behavior had an autistic flavor selfabsorption to an extent that implied mental disorder creating her own world like father like daughter but hed willed his isolation channeled it lucratively the new age entrepreneur had she encased herself in a bubble only to be trapped within a victim of genetic insult environmental accident some incalculable combination of both or had she taken on her fathers lifestyle of her own free will had she been capable of free will she enjoyed doing things for me had the purveyor of gadgets manufactured himself a housecleaning robot efficient mechanical like some highpriced toy out of his catalogue adapted her inadequacies and pathology to his needs ive done my reading on child psychology know all the theories of child abuse she wasnt imprisoned a little too quick on the draw or was i just letting clinical guesswork get the better of me because he wasnt a likable man i reminded myself he was a victim wanted to feel more sympathy not the resentment that had grown within me during my incarceration in that cold empty house i realized i was thinking of him instead of holly taken in by his narcissism i forced myself back to the main subject whatever her motivations an image of holly lynn burden had emerged from the murky ground of the interview early childhood loss repressed anger mental confusion low intelligence low achievement low selfesteem social isolation a young woman with no external life and a flood of unknown fantasies swimming through her head dark fantasies stir in a parental attitude that disparaged authority disparaged all schools and one school in particular add a sprinkling of new friendship snipped cruelly by violence buried rage that buds anew and grows night walks guns in a closet mahlon burden couldnt have come up with a better profile of a mass murderer had i dictated it to him a profile of a time bomb ticking away i got home to a dark empty house over the last few months the postrobin months id worked hard at learning to consider that soothing worked hard under the tutelage of a kind strong therapist named ada small ever the conscientious pupil id applied myself gaining an appreciation for the value of solitude the healing and peace that could come from moderate doses of introspection not that long ago ada and i had agreed to cut the cord but this evening solitude seemed too much like solitary confinement i switched on plenty of lights tuned the stereo to kkgo and cranked up the volume even though the jazz that blared out was some new wave sopranosax stuff in a bloodcurdlingscreamasartform mode anything but silence i kept thinking about my meeting with burden the shifting faces hed shown during the course of the interview the shifting attitudes hed displayed toward his daughter thered been an introductory display of grief but his tears had dried quickly in the sanctuary of his computer womb only to be followed by a shallow lament ill be doing those things for myself now he might have been discussing the loss of a cleaning woman once again i told myself not to judge the man had been through hell what could be worse than the death of a child add to that the way shed died the public shame and collective guilt that even someone like milo was quick to assign and who could blame him for retreating gathering whatever psychological armaments he had at his command i let that rationalization settle for a while his behavior still bothered me the detachment when hed talked about her an iq in the dull normal range it was as if her weaknesses her failure to be brilliant had been a personal insult to him i imagined a burden family crest crossed muskets over a field of straight as a man used to having his way shed upset his sense of organization had been an affront to his system using her to clean house prepare cold food some sort of punishment or simply an efficient allocation of resources yet at the same time against all logic he was proclaiming her innocence contracting me for what a psychological whitewash something didnt fit i sat struggling with it finally told myself to stop taking my work home once upon a time id been good at following that dictum once upon a time life had seemed simpler suddenly the music was earshattering i realized id blocked it out now i could barely stand it and went to switch stations just as i touched the dial the saxophonist quit and some stanley jordan guitar wizardry came on good omen time to push all thoughts of the burden family from my mind but my mind was no different from anyone elses it abhorred a vacuum i needed something to fill the space call linda then i remembered her restlessness needing to breathe id learned the hard way not to crowd i realized i was hungry went into the kitchen and took out eggs mushrooms and an onion jordan gave way to spyro gyra doing shake her i cracked eggs chopped vegetables in tempo paying attention in order to get it just right i fried up an omelet ate read psych journals and did paperwork for an hour then stepped onto the skiing machine and pretended i was crossing some snowfilled meadow in norway midway through the fantasy gregory graffs bearded visage appeared through the sweathaze urging me to work harder reciting a list of brandnew products that could maximize my performance i told him to fuck himself and huffed away i got off a half hour later dripping and ready to sink into a hot bath the phone rang milo said so howd it go no big surprises she was a girl with lots of problems homicidal problems nothing that overt i gave him a brief rundown on what burden had told me he said sounds like she led like a great life i thought i detected sympathy in his voice thats all the father knows about novato thats what he says you learn anything new called maury smith at southeast he remembered the case said it was still unsolved one of many he wasnt working on it actively because no leads had turned up there was definitely some of that attitude dinwiddie had picked up just another dope burn he did wake up a bit when i told him it might be related to something on the west side and he agreed to meet with me tomorrow for lunch and pull the file i also got the address of the landlady sophie gruenberg he remembered her pretty vividly said she was an old commie really hostile to the police kept asking him how he could stand being a black cossack that sounded so inviting i thought id drop in on her tomorrow morning care for a ridealong i dont know he said do pinkos relate well to shrinks hell yes marx and freud bowled together every tuesday at vienna lanes freud got strikes marx fomented them he laughed besides i said what makes you think shell relate to a white cossack not just any cossack mlad this ones a member of a persecuted minority planning on wearing your lavender uniform if you put on your feather boa ill go digging in the attic what time hows about nine hows about he came by at eightforty driving an unmarked ford that id never seen before sophie gruenbergs address was on fourth avenue just north of rose a short stroll to the beach but this wasnt malibu it was a cold morning the sun lurking like a mugger behind a grimy bank of undernourished striated clouds but zincnosed pedestrians were already tramping down rose headed for the ocean the business mix on rose proclaimed changing neighborhood in venice that meant business as usual this neighborhood never stopped changing designer delis gelato parlors and cubbyhole trendtiques shared the sidewalk with laundromats checkcashing outlets seriousdrinking bars and crumbling bungalow courts that could be emptied by scrutiny from the immigration service milo turned right on fourth and drove for a block the house was a onestory sidebyside duplex on a thirtyfootwide lot the windows were covered with iron security bars that looked brandnew the walls were white stucco with redpainted wood trim under a brickcolored composition roof the front lawn was tiny but green enough to satisfy the ocean heights landscape committee and backed by a large germinating yucca plant and a nubby bed of ice plants dwarf iceberg roses lined a concrete path that forked to a pair of front stoops the two doors were also redpainted wood brass letters designated them a and b a white ceramic nameplate that said the sanders had been nailed just beneath the a unit b was marked with something else a white poster taped to the door bearing the legend missing reward in bold black letters under that a photoreproduction of an old woman chipmunk face wizened as walnut meat surrounded by a frizzy aura of white hair serious face borderline hostile large dark eyes below a paragraph in typescript sophie gruenberg last seen pm in the vicinity of the beth shalom synagogue ocean front walk wearing a blueandpurple floral dress black shoes carrying a large blue straw handbag dob ht wt approx lb mental and health status excellent foul play suspected a reward has been offered for information leading to the whereabouts of mrs sophie gruenberg anyone possessing such information should contact beth shalom synagogue the address of the synagogue was reiterated at the bottom of the page along with a phone number with a prefix i said september twentyseventh when was novato killed the twentyfourth coincidence milo frowned and rapped the door to unit b hitting it hard enough to make the wood rattle no answer he rang the bell nothing we walked over to a and tried there more silence lets try around back he said we peeked into a small yard landscaped with a fig tree and little else the garage was empty back on the sidewalk milo folded his arms across his chest then smiled at a small mexican boy across the street whod come out to stare the boy scampered away milo sighed sunday he said hell of a long time since ive spent sunday in church think i can get partial points for synagogue he took rose to pacific headed south for a couple of blocks and hooked right onto an alley that ran parallel with paloma still no sunshine but the streets and sidewalks were a moving meat market even the crosswalks were jammed the unmarked car inched through the crowd before turning into a pay parking lot on speedway the attendant was a filipino with hair down to his waist wearing a black tank top over electricblue bicycle pants and beach sandals milo paid him then showed him a badge and told him to park the ford where we could get it out fast the attendant said yessir and bowed and stared at us as we departed eyes full of curiosity fear resentment feeling the stare at my back not liking it i savored a tiny taste of what it was like to be a cop we walked toward ocean front walk making our way past street peddlers hawking sunglasses and straw hats that might last a weekend and stands selling ethnic fast food of doubtful origin the crowd was clearancesale thick multigenerational hispanic tribes shambling winos who looked as if theyd been handdipped in filth mumbling psychotics and retrohippies lost in a dope haze poloclad upscalers side by side with roostercoiffed highpunk roller skaters assorted bodybeautiful types testing the limits of the antinudity ordinance and grinning gawking tourists from europe asia and new york overjoyed at having finally found the real la a kinetic human sculpture a quilt patched together with every skin tone from alpine vanilla to bittersweet fudge the soundtrack polyglot rap i said the salad bowl what said milo talking loudly to be heard over the din just muttering salad bowl huh he eyed a couple on roller skates greased torsos zebraskin loincloth and nothing else on the man microbikini and three nose rings on the woman pass the dressing splintering park benches along the west side of the promenade were crammed with conclaves of the homeless beyond the benches was a strip of lawn planted long ago with palm trees that had grown gigantic the trunks of the trees had been whitewashed three feet up from ground level to provide protection from animals fourlegged and otherwise but no one was buying it the trunks were scarred and maimed and gouged crisscrossed with graffiti past the lawn the beach more bodies glistening halfnaked sundrunk then a dullplatinum knife blade that had to be the ocean beth shalom synagogue was a chunky single story of tan stucco centered by aquagreen double doors recessed under a wooden plaque that bore hebrew writing above the plaque was a glass circle containing a leaded star of david identical stars floated above the arched windows on either side of the doorway the windows were barred flanking the building to the north was a threestory drug rehab center to the south was a narrow brick apartment building with two shopfronts on the ground floor one space was empty and accordiongrated the other was occupied by a souvenir shop entitled cash talks the rest walks we walked to the front of the synagogue inside the entry alcove a poster identical to the one wed just seen on sophie gruenbergs door had been taped to the wall below that was a small bulletin board in a glassfronted case corrugated black surface with movable white letters informing the religiously curious of the times for weekday and sabbath services the sermon of the week was when good things happen to bad people the deliverer rabbi david sanders ma i said sanders unit a milo grunted the doors were decorated with a pair of deadbolt locks and some kind of pushbutton security affair but when milo turned the knob it yielded we entered a small linoleumfloor anteroom filled with mismatched bookcases and a single wooden end table a paper plate of cookies cans of soda pop a bottle of teachers whisky and a stack of paper cups sat atop the table a wooden panel door was marked sanctuary next to it on a metal stand stood a battered brown leather box filled with black satin skullcaps milo took a cap and placed it on his head i did the same he pushed open the door the sanctuary was the size of a master suite in a beverly hills remodel more of a chapel really lightblue walls hung with oil paintings of biblical scenes a dozen rows of blondwood bench pews bordered either side of a central linoleumed aisle layered with a threadbare persian runner the aisle culminated at a large podium faced with another sixsided star and topped by a fringed throw of blue velvet behind the podium was a pleated velvet curtain sided by two highbacked chairs upholstered in the same blue plush dangling over the podium was a cone of red glass lit a pair of tall thin windows toward the front of the room allowed in narrow beams of dusty light the rear was couched in semidarkness milo and i stood there halfhidden by it the air was warm and fusty overlaid with kitchen aromas a faircomplected bearded man in his late twenties stood behind the podium a book open before him addressing a frontrow audience of four all elderly one man three women so we see he said leaning on his elbows the true wisdom of the ethics of the fathers lies in the ability of the tanaim the rabbis of the talmud to put our lives in perspective generation after generation to teach us what is important and what isnt values who is rich the rabbis ask and they answer he who is satisfied with his portion what could be more profound without manners there is no scholarship without scholarship no manners the more meat the more worms he had a soft clear voice precise enunciation some sort of accent my guess was australian worms oh boy is that true said the sole male student using his hands for emphasis he sat in the midst of the women all i could see of him was a bald head wisped with white and topped by a yarmulke just like the one i was wearing above a short thick neck worms all the time all we got now is worms the way we let society get mutters of assent from the women the bearded man smiled looked down at his book wet his thumb with his tongue and turned a page he was broadshouldered and had a rosycheeked baby face that the dirtyblond beard had failed to season he had on a shortsleeved blueandwhite plaid shirt and a black velvet skullcap that covered most of his tight blond curls its always the same rabbi said the bald man complication making things difficult first you set up a system to do some good till then youre okay we should always be looking to do good otherwise whats the point right what separates us from the animals right but then the problem comes when too many people get involved and the system takes over and all of a sudden everyones working to do good for the system instead of viceaversa then you got worms lots of meat lots of worms the more meat the more worms sy i think what the rabbi means is something different said a plump woman on the far right she had fluffy blued hair and heavy arms that shook as she used her hands for emphasis hes talking about materialism the more foolish things we collect the more problems we get actually youre both correct said the blond man in a conciliatory tone the talmud is emphasizing the virtue of simplicity mr morgenstern is talking about procedural simplicity mrs cooper material simplicity when we complicate things we drift further away from our purpose on this planet getting closer to god thats precisely why the tal it happened with the irs rabbi said a woman with a thin birdlike voice and a cap of dyedblack hair the taxes the taxes were supposed to be for the people now its people for the taxes same with social security moishe kapoyr twist of a wrist upside down very true mrs steinberg said the young rabbi oftentimes social security too said mr morgenstern they make like social security is something were stealing the young puppies so they shouldnt have a new bmw each year how many years did i work and contribute like clockwork back before bmws were enemy airplanes now they make like i want charity bread out of their mouths who do they think baked them the bread in the first place from trees it fell the young rabbi started to comment but was drowned out by a discussion of the social security system he seemed to accept it with practiced good nature turned another page read finally looked up and saw us and stood up straight behind the podium he raised his eyebrows milo gave a small nod of acknowledgment the rabbi left the podium and walked toward us tall built like an athlete with a sure stride his students old enough to be his grandparents turned their heads and followed his path they saw us the synagogue grew silent im rabbi sanders can i help you gentlemen milo flashed the badge sanders examined it milo said excuse the interruption rabbi when youre through wed like to talk to you certainly may i ask about what sophie gruenberg the baby face braced itself as if for pain a child in a doctors office anticipating the needle do you have news for us officer milo shook his head just questions oh said sanders looking like a prisoner whod had his sentence delayed but not commuted what said one of the women at the front what is it cops said morgenstern i can always tell am i right seen front on he was thick with doughy features shaggy eyebrows and meaty workingmans hands that he waved as he talked i smiled at him he said i can always tell those yarmulkes are sitting there like theyre ready to fly off four faces stared at us a quartet of antique masks scored by time but strengthened by experience rabbi sanders said these gentlemen are indeed police officers and theyre here to ask questions about sophie questions said the plump woman mrs cooper she wore spectacles a white sweater buttoned to the neck and a string of pearls the blued hair was precisely marcelled why more questions now all weve gotten from the police is questions said the handwaving morgenstern no answers no meat lots of worms how longs it been what month and a half the women nodded you think theres a chance said mrs steinberg the blackhaired woman the hair was cut in bangs and bobbed the face below it was chalkwhite and thin and had once been beautiful i pictured her in a roaring twenties chorus line doing high kicks even a little bit of a chance that she could still be alive hush rose said mrs cooper theres always hope kayn aynhoreh poo poo poo her soft face quivered morgenstern regarded her with a look of exaggerated scorn whats with this aynhoreh business my dear the evil eye superstitionstupidstition what you got to have is rationality the rational mind dialectics hegel and kant and of course the talmud excuse me rabbi he slapped his own wrist stop joking sy this is serious said the blackhaired woman she looked at us pained could she possibly be alive officers after all this time five faces waiting for an answer milo took a step backward id like to hope so maam he said to sanders we can come back and discuss this later rabbi no thats all right said sanders we were just about to conclude if you wait a minute ill be right with you he went back behind the podium said a few more words about values and proper perspective dismissed the class and returned to us the old people lingered near the front of the synagogue huddling in discussion refreshments out in front people said sanders the huddle buzzed then broke the women hung back and mr morgenstern came forward the designated quarterback he was no more than five three blocky and firmlooking a toy truck of a man in khaki work pants and a white shirt under a gray sweater vest you got questions he said maybe we can answer them we knew her sanders looked at milo milo said sure wed appreciate any information morgenstern nodded good you agreed he said cause we voted on it the people have spoken that should be respected we reassembled near the podium milo stood in front of it sanders took a seat and pulled a briar pipe out of his pocket tsk tsk rabbi said the woman who hadnt yet spoken bigboned no makeup brushedsteel hair tied in a bun im not lighting it mrs sindowsky said the rabbi better you shouldnt do anything with it what do you need problems on the lips for more meat more worms right rabbi sanders blushed and smiled cradled the pipe in one hand and touched it longingly but didnt put it in his mouth milo said i want to be straight with you people ive got absolutely nothing new to tell you about mrs gruenberg in fact im not investigating her case and i only came here because her disappearance may be related to another case and i cant tell you anything about that one such a deal said morgenstern you must be fun at swap meets exactly said milo smiling what can we do for you officer said rabbi sanders tell me about mrs gruenberg everything you know about her disappearance we told everything to the police already said mrs cooper she was here left and that was it poof gone the heavy arms rippled after a couple days the police agreed to talk to us and they sent a detective down who asked questions he filed a missing persons report and promised to keep in touch with us so far nothing thats because said morgenstern they got nothing they had something would this man be here asking us to go over it again how they gonna give you what they dont have milo said do you remember the name of the investigating detective what investigating said morgenstern he took a report that was it mehan said the rabbi detective mehan from pacific division which division you from said morgenstern west la milo said morgenstern winked and said silk stocking detail eh lots of stolen bmws rabbi sanders said detective mehan did more than just file a report he examined her sophies house i know because i let him in we my family and i were are her tenants we live side by side kept each others keys detective mehan went into her unit and found no evidence of any crime being committed everything was in order he also checked with her bank and found out she hadnt made any large withdrawals recently and she hadnt asked the post office to withhold or forward mail so it seemed to him she hadnt planned to take a trip he thought she might have gotten lost somewhere impossible said mrs steinberg she knew venice like the palm of her hand she would never get lost right nods true but who knows said mrs cooper anything can happen vulnerable looks long silence ahh said morgenstern all guesses including the bank stuff you ask me that means nothing sophie was a crafty one she never told anyone what she was thinking or doing never trusted anyone especially the capitalist bankers so how much would she keep in bank accounts the big bucks or just narrishkeit small change maybe she kept her serious cash somewhere else where would that be said milo i dont know said morgenstern she didnt tell no one you think shed tell me im just guessing same as you maybe in the house under the bed who knows she had her ideas maybe she was saving up waiting for the next revolution so maybe she took that and left and you wouldnt know nothing from nothing by checking with any banks the old mans color had risen milo said so you dont know for a fact that she kept large amounts of cash around the house i knew what he was thinking dope no no said morgenstern i dont know nothing which puts me in the same club with everyone else she wasnt a personal person know what i mean didnt let on what she was thinking or doing so im just saying checking the banks doesnt mean nothing as far as logical rational thinking goes a person could keep cash and just decide to leave am i right milo said youve got a point he throws me a bone said morgenstern but he looked pleased mrs sindowsky said tell him about the pictures oh said the rabbi looking uneasy what pictures said milo detective mehan went to the morgue and took pictures of any senior citizens whod been any unidentified victims that matched sophie in age he brought them to me to look at he put out some bulletins called some other police departments long beach orange county and asked if they had any unidentified people none were sophie thank god four echoing thank gods sanders said in all fairness he seemed to be thorough detective mehan but after three weeks had passed without her showing up he told us there was a limit to what he could do there was no evidence of any crime being committed the choice was to wait or hire a private detective we talked about doing that the detective made a few calls to agencies its very expensive we asked the jewish federation to consider funding they wouldnt approve a detective but they did agree to the reward those skinflints to them its chump change said morgenstern milo said can you think of any reason shed just leave blank looks thats the point said mrs steinberg thered be no reason for her to leave she was happy here why would she just leave happy said mrs sindowsky you ever see her smile all im saying dora said mrs steinberg is that after all this time maybe we have to assume the worst feh said morgenstern shaking a thick fist always with the gloom and doom chicken little the smogs falling ive lived said mrs steinberg drawing herself up through plenty i know the way things are lived said morgenstern and whatve i been doing hanging on the wall like an oil painting milo looked at mrs steinberg besides the amount of time shes been gone do you have any reason to assume the worst all eyes focused on the blackhaired woman she looked uncomfortable it just doesnt make sense sophie wasnt the type to wander off she was a very regular person attached to her house to her books and she loved venice shed lived here longer than any of us where would she go what about relatives said milo she ever mention any rabbi sanders said the only family she talked about were her brothers and sisters killed by the nazis she talked a lot about the holocaust the evils of fascism mrs sindowsky said she talked a lot about politics period tell the plain truth said morgenstern she was a red so said mrs cooper thats some sort of crime in this free country sy expressing political views dont make to them like she was a criminal who says its a crime morgenstern retorted im only stating facts the plain truth what she was was what she was red as a tomato what does that make me said mrs cooper you my darling said morgenstern lets say pink smile when you get excited maybe a nice shade of fuchsia ahh said the plump woman turning her back on him and folding her arms under her bosom milo said the poster says she disappeared around here how did that happen we were having an evening social said the rabbi a couple of weeks after rosh hashanah jewish new year trying trying to rejuvenate community spirit mrs sindowsky broke in as if reciting from a lesson book get a little action going right rabbi sanders smiled at her then turned to milo mrs gruenberg showed up but left after a short while that was the last anyone saw her i assumed shed gone home when the mail started piling up at her door i got worried i used my key and let myself into her unit and saw she was gone i called the police after fortyeight hours had passed detective mehan agreed to come down and the last time you saw her at the social was around eight eight eightthirty said sanders thats only an estimate the social began at seventhirty and ended at nine she wasnt there during the last half hour we pulled up chairs and had a discussion so she left some time before eightthirty no ones really sure did she bring a car or come on foot on foot she didnt drive liked to walk its gotten kind of tough around here to be walking at night said milo good of you to notice said morgenstern days arent so wonderful either she wouldnt have worried about that she certainly should have said mrs steinberg with all the nogoodniks and lowlife hanging around taking over the neighborhood all the drugs we used to enjoy the beach you come around here during the week officer and you wont see us taking the sun like we used to all of us used to walk to swim thats why we moved here it was paradise now when we go out at night we take a car in a group park it back on speedway and walk to the shul marching like a battalion of soldiers on a nice summer night a late sunset maybe well take a longer walk still all together as a group even then we feel nervous but sophie never joined in any of that she wasnt a joiner she lived here a long time didnt want to admit things had changed you couldnt talk to her she was stubborn she walked around like she owned the neighborhood she liked to walk said sanders for exercise sometimes said morgenstern exercise isnt so healthy mrs cooper frowned at him he winked at her and smiled milo said rabbi you lived next to her what was her state of mind during the last few days before she disappeared the last few days said sanders he rolled his pipe in his palm truthfully she probably was very upset probably she wasnt one to express emotions openly she kept to herself then why do you say she was upset sanders hesitated looking first at his students then milo there was he said a crime someone she knew what crime said morgenstern say it a murder drugs and guns the whole shebang some black boy she was renting to he got shot over drugs he squinted and his eyebrows merged like mating caterpillars aha thats the big secret you cant tell us about right milo said do you know anything about that silence mrs sindowsky said just what we heard from the rabbi here she had a tenant he got shot none of you knew him shakes of heads i knew of him but not him said mrs cooper what did you know that shed taken in a boarder once i saw him on his little motorbike driving home nicelooking boy very big there was plenty of talk said morgenstern what kind of talk milo said a black kid whadya think was she putting herself in danger morgenstern looked accusingly at the women they seemed embarrassed everyones nice and liberal he said till it comes to putting the mouth where the money is but sophie was a red it was just the kind of thing shed do you think he got her into some kind of trouble the kid keeping his dope money in the housethey came to get it and got her milo said no theres no evidence of that morgenstern gave him a conspiratorial wink no evidence but youre coming around asking questions the plot thickens eh mr policeman more meat more worms milo asked a few more questions determined they had nothing else to offer and thanked them we left replacing our skullcaps in the leather box on the way out walked a ways up ocean front and had a cup of coffee at a teriyaki stand milo glared at the winos hanging around the stand and they drifted away like sloughing dead skin he sipped running his gaze up and down the walkstreet letting it settle on the synagogue after a few moments all four old people came out of the building and walked off together morgenstern in the lead an elderly battalion when they were out of view milo tossed his coffee cup in the trash and said come on the dead bolts on the synagogues doors were locked milos knock brought sanders to the door the rabbi had put a gray suit jacket over his shirt had his pipe in his mouth still unlit and was holding an oversized maroon book with marbled pageends a little more of your time rabbi sanders held the door open and we stepped into the anteroom most of the cookies were gone and only two cans of soda remained can i offer you anything said sanders he slid the book into one of the cases no thanks rabbi shall we go back in the sanctuary this is fine thanks i was just wondering if there was anything you hadnt felt comfortable discussing in front of your students students sanders smiled theyve taught me a good deal more than ive taught them this is only a parttime job weekdays i teach at an elementary school in the fairfax district i conduct services here on weekends give classes sundays run an occasional social evening sounds like a full schedule sanders shrugged and adjusted his yarmulke five children los angeles is an expensive city thats how i came to know sophie mrs gruenberg finding affordable housings impossible especially with children people in this city dont seem to like children mrs gruenberg didnt mind at all even though she wasnt very grandmotherly and she was very reasonable about the rent she said it was because we my wife and i had ideals she respected us for them even though she herself had no use for religion marxism was her faith she really was an unregenerate communist she generally pretty vocal about her political views if one asked her shed speak her mind but she didnt go about volunteering them she wasnt a gregarious woman quite the opposite kept to herself not a joiner sanders nodded i tried to get her more involved in the synagogue but she had no interest in religion wasnt at all sociable truthfully she wasnt the most popular person but the others do care about her they all look out for one another wanted to dip into their own pockets in order to hire the private detective but none of them can afford it theyre all on pension detective mehan told me it would probably be a waste of money so i discouraged it promised to bring it to the federation again her vanishing has really frightened them theyre slapped in the face by their own helplessness thats why im glad you returned when they were gone talking about ike could only upset them more that is what you want to talk about isnt it whyd detective mehan feel it was a waste of time sanders lowered his gaze and bit his lip he told me and this is something i havent told them that it didnt look good the fact that she hadnt made plans to leave meant there was a good chance shed met up with foul play the fact that her apartment was in order meant it had taken place on the street as she walked home he said that if shed gotten lost and wandered away or had a stroke she would have turned up by three weeks one way or the other he said private detectives could find people but werent much use discovering bodies he looked up blue eyes still jamming the pipe in his mouth he bit down so hard his jaws bunched and the board bristled milo said shes your landlady is there a mortgage on the building sanders shook his head no she owns it free and clear has for several years detective mehan found that out when he checked into her finances what about other bills that come in who pays them i do it doesnt come out to much just utilities ive also been collecting all her mail what looks like a bill i open and pay i know its not perfectly legal to do that but detective mehan assured me it would be all right what about your rent cheek ive opened an interestearning account deposited the october and november checks in there it seemed the best thing to do until we learn something where do you keep her mail rabbi right here in the synagogue under lock and key id like to see it he said certainly put his pipe in his jacket pocket and went into the sanctuary we watched him unlock a cabinet in back of the podium and draw out two manila envelopes which he brought back and handed to milo one was marked septoct the other nov milo said this is all of it this is it sad look milo opened the envelopes removed the contents and spread them out on the ledge of the bookcase he inspected each piece of mail mostly flyers and computeraddressed bulk mail occupant appearing more frequently than her name a few utility bills that had been opened and marked paid followed by dates of payments sanders said i was hoping thered be something personal to give us a clue but she wasnt very connected to the outside world his baby face had grown sad stuffing one hand in his pocket he groped until he found his pipe milo slid the mail back in the manila envelopes is there anything else you want to tell me rabbi sanders rubbed the bowl of the pipe against his nose just one thing he said and detective mehan filed a report on it so you should have a record of it somewhere the old people dont know this either i didnt see any point in telling them a few days after she disappeared that was a tuesday this happened sometime over the weekend burglars broke into the house into both our places my family and i were out of town at a school retreat in the city detective mehan said it was probably a drug addict looking for things to sell a coward hed watched the house staked us out waited until we were gone and moved in what was taken as far as i could tell what he took from sophie was a television a radio a silverplated samovar and some inexpensive jewelry from us even less we dont have a television all he got from us was some flatware a ritual spice box and candleholder and a tape recorder i use for teaching hebrew but he made a mess both units were in a shambles food taken out of the refrigerator and thrown around drawers opened papers scattered detective mehan said it showed signs of a disorganized mind immaturity teenagers or someone on drugs what was the point of entry through the back doors ive since had new locks put on and bars on the windows now my children look out through bars he shook his head the material loss was trivial he said but the feeling of violation and hatred the way the food was strewn about seemed so spiteful and something else that made it seem personal whats that rabbi he the addict or whoever wrote on the walls in red paint that he took from the garage the same red paint id just used a week before to paint the windows it resembled blood hateful stuff antisemitism profanities i had to cover my childrens eyes and something else that i found very strange remember john kennedy several exclamation points after the word kennedy which doesnt make any logical sense does it kennedy was antiracist but detective mehan said if hed been crazy on drugs he couldnt be expected to make sense so i suppose that would explain it he frowned chewed on the pipe some more milo said you dont like that explanation its not that said sanders its nothing tangible just a feeling my wife and i have had since ike since sophie as if were in jeopardy someones out there intending to harm us despite the locks and the bars not that there ever is anyone when i actually look so i suppose its nerves i tell myself this is simply the way america is learn to get used to it but my wife wants us to move back to auckland thats new zealand things were different there how long have you been in la just since july before that we lived in lakewood new jersey i studied at a seminary there did have occasion to visit new york city so i guess i should have been prepared for urban life but in california i expected things to be more relaxed the term is laid back rabbi unfortunately for the most part its a facade seems to be since the breakin have you and your family had any other problems nothing thank god milo reached into a coat pocket drew out the photo hed taken from dinwiddie and held it in front of the rabbis baby face yes thats ike said sanders did his death have anything to do with sophie nothing as far as we know rabbi what can you tell me about him not much at all i barely knew him we passed each other a few times that was all how long had he been living here before he was killed sanders shook his head i dont know my feeling was it had been for a while whys that they he and sophie had a comfortable relationship as if theyd settled in with each other they get along pretty well seemed to sanders put his pipe in his mouth then removed it actually they debated quite a bit we could hear it through the walls to be frank she was a cantankerous old lady but she and ike did seem to have a certain not rapport id call it ease he did chores for her gardening brought her groceries i believe he worked at a grocery store and the fact that she had him living with her right in the apartment would imply a great deal of trust wouldnt it any reason for her not to trust him sanders shook his head no i didnt mean that at all the racial thing has no personal relevance for me but it is unusual the old people have had bad experiences with black men they tend to fear them not that there was any reason to fear ike from the few contacts i had with him he seemed a very good chap polite pleasant the only thing i did find unusual about him was his interest in the holocaust unusual in what way the fact that he was interested in it at all someone his age not jewish its not a common interest dont you agree though i suppose living with sophie made it not that unusual it was a favorite topic of hers she may have passed it along to ike how do you know he was interested in it because of an occurrence last summer about a week after wed moved in i ran into him in the garage i was unpacking boxes and hed just driven in on his motor scooter he was carrying a huge armful of books and he dropped them i helped him pick them up i noticed a title something about the origins of the nazi party i opened it and saw from the bookplate that it had come from the holocaust center over on pico in west la so had the others i picked up i asked him if he was doing a school paper and he smiled and said no it was a personal research project i offered to help him if he needed it but he just smiled again and said he had everything he needed i thought it unusual but i was pleased that someone his age would take an interest most people his age have no idea what happened fifty years ago what did he and mrs gruenberg used to argue about not arguments in the sense of quarreling when i said debates i meant discussions loud discussions lively discussions but we couldnt make out the words we werent listening knowing sophie though my assumption would be politics any idea what novatos political views were none whatsoever sanders thought for a moment officer do you suspect a political connection to what happened no evidence of that either rabbi how was mrs gruenberg affected by novatos death as i said before i assumed she was upset but i didnt see much of her reaction because she stayed in her unit and didnt come out much after it happened in retrospect i realize that was odd she used to be out in the yard hanging laundry or taking her walks around the neighborhood i only found out about the murder because another policeman a black man whose name i dont remember came by the house and asked me a few questions about ike did he use drugs i told him not to my knowledge who did he hang around with id never seen anyone then he asked me about sophie did she use drugs did she buy expensive things that she couldnt seem to afford that i laughed at but when he the black detective told me why hed come i stopped laughing after he left i went over to sophies unit and knocked on the door she didnt answer i didnt want to violate her privacy so i left her alone i tried the next day but she still didnt answer i started to worry with an old person anything can happen but i decided to wait a while before using my key shortly after i saw her come out walking toward rose avenue looking angry very grim i went after her tried to talk to her but she just shook her head and kept walking the next time i saw her was here at the synagogue she came to the social given her state of mind that surprised me but she kept to herself avoiding people walking around the room looking all around touching the walls the seats almost as if she were seeing it all for the first time or the last said milo sanderss eyes widened he held the pipe with two hands as if it had suddenly grown heavy yes youre right he said that could have been it seeing it for the last time saying goodbye when we got back to the pay lot the ford was in easyexit position the filipino attendant stopped traffic on speedway to let us out milo didnt acknowledge the courtesy i said swastikas on cars hate messages on walls what do you think he said i think the worlds a kind and compassionate place and nudged the car through the pedestrian jumble the pedestrians werent feeling cooperative today milo cursed as he inched forward but his heart wasnt in it i said remember kennedy it doesnt make much sense unless it was a warning not a tribute as in remember what happened to kennedy well get you too whos warning who i said i dont know and grew silent he smiled starting to see evil everywhere sounds like a peace officers perspective speaking of peace officers this mehan a good cop very good think he and smith ever compared notes he gave me a sharp look what is this the police review board just wondering wondering what if one arm of the octopus knows what the others doing usually not but what if mehan and smith did put their heads together what would they have ended up with double dead ends i said the dope thing might have led them somewhere smith was thinking in that direction the rabbi said he was asking if gruenberg had been involved in drugs not that that seems likely why not little old dope granny she sure wasnt living the lifestyle alex most likely smith was just fishing working with what he had which in this case was close to zero but the way things have turned you cant eliminate anyone all the money to be made its loony tunes out there were getting old ladies packing their supphose with the stuff people cuddling sweet little babies the buntings crammed full of white powder cripples using false limbs and gruenbergs profile doesnt contradict a dope granny she had radical political views which means she might not have been so reluctant to buck the establishment she keeps to herself doesnt like company and has novato bunking in with her some kid out of nowhere with no id no past and shes got him living in the same unit with her a black kid even for venice thats strange you saw how the other oldsters thought so then just a few days after hes snuffed shes gone maybe he was a commie too that was the connection between them maybe the two of them had some political thing going hell maybe thats where the dough went cash for the cause you want to speculate ill speculate i thought about it as he wrestled with the steering wheel and finally got back on pacific milo if gruenberg was involved in the dope scene she could have made someone mad and run out of fear or maybe the people she was afraid of got to her first what if shed ended up with a cashflow or a dopeflow problem and the breakin at her place was someone looking to collect maybe he said but the other thing youve got to consider is that junkies are prime opportunists the posters could have tipped them off that she was gone her place was vacant a perfect target the bottom line is all of this is just headtripping we dont know shit a block later i said could holly have been involved with them gruenberg and novatos cabal cabal an old lady a bag boy and a retarded kid who isnt on anyones subversive list not much of a cabal she wasnt retarded okay just stupid same difference i didnt say it was a competent cabal two of them are dead and ones missing but maybe hollys shooting at massengil was politically motivated if it was massengil she was shooting at if milo came to a short stop at washington boulevard too weird alex got a headache he drove into a selfserve gas station with a minimart at the back of the lot i waited in the ford as he purchased a packet of aspirin before he returned to the car he went to the pay phone and stayed there for a while popping tablets feeding quarters and talking the receiver tucked up under his chin making two calls when he came back he said mehans out of town two weeks vacation no one knows where any of his files are theyll get back to me who was the second call to he looked at me what a sleuth i tried the holocaust center wanted to leave a message for someone i know there got a tape theyre closed sundays thats right i said they know you you helped them trace that nazi scientist the one the army protected good old werner kaltenblud president of the poison gas club bastards still alive in syria living like royalty unrepentant ive got a more recent connection to the center last year someone painted swastikas on the side of the museum building theyre putting up not my usual thing but they called me because of kaltenblud then it hit the news and the brass took over atd frisk no the asshole who preceded him but same old story tv crews and politicos making speeches gordon latch in fact how about massengil nope not his district maybe not his area of interest either could be it was a real circus alex atd playing i spy asking lots of clever questions filing lots of paper but they never bothered to surveill next week there were broken windows and an arson fire in one of the trailers out back in the construction site we never found out who did any of it so much for my credibility but maybe ive still got enough goodwill residue for them to think back and try to remember something about this novato kid something more than his library card he turned left on washington driving parallel with the marina a different kind of crowd here white slacks and deep tans and aggressive little foreign ears the boulevard was lined with new construction mostly lowrise designer office buildings festooned with reminders of an architectural heritage that had never existed and nautical theme restaurants draped with brunch and happy hour banners pretty huh said milo the good life reigns he drove a couple of blocks turned off on a street that deadended a block later small houses in varying stages of gentrification cars lining the street no people he parked in front of a hydrant left the motor running got out and opened the trunk he came back carrying a shotgun clamped it to the dashboard barrelup and pulled the car out onto the street i said where to somewhere not so pretty he got back on washington took it to the marina freeway switched to the wrestled with the airport jam for a while and got off on imperial highway heading east bordering the offramp were the broad gray lots of shipping terminals importexport companies and customs brokers and a fourstory selfstorage facility that looked like the box an office building would come in a red light halted us at the intersection of la cienega and imperial and we waited it out staring at the colossal truncated bulk of the unfinished century freeway hundredfoot concrete dinosaur legs supporting a sixlane slab that ended in midair and was fringed with curling steel veins a messy amputation the green arrow appeared and milo turned the terrain deteriorated rudely to a block of scabrous onestory buildings on a drydust lot a pool hall a liquor store and a bar advertising nude table dancers all plywoodboarded and choked with graffiti even sin couldnt flourish here but a block later there were signs of revitalization weeklyrate motels auto shops car dealerships wig stores and rundown apartments several beautifully kept churches a couple of shopping centers the sprawling campus of southwestern college and for color the golden arches and its rainbowhued clones modular fastfood setups so clean and unscarred they might have been dropped into the neighborhood just minutes before by some clumsy franchise stork milo said taking the scenic route i said long time since ive been down here didnt know youd ever been down here most folks of the fairpigment persuasion never find the opportunity grad school i said first year i was a research assistant on a head start program trying to increase the reading skills of ghetto kids i took an interest in one of the children a very bright little boy named eric i visited him a couple of times at home i can still picture the place he lived on budlong near rd nicelooking building not at all what i expected for the area widowed mother the father had been shot in vietnam grandma helping out place was neat as a pin lots of pressure from both mom and grandma for eric to get as become a doctor or a lawyer how old was he five milo whistled long ways to med school fortunately he had the brains for it what happened to him i followed him for a couple of years phone calls christmas cards he was still getting as and starting to develop bad stomachaches i was going up to san francisco for my internship referred the mother to a good pediatrician and a community mental health center after that we just kind of lost touch hed be college age by now amazing i have no idea what happened to him guess that makes me your typical superficial dogooder huh milo didnt say anything i noticed he was driving faster than usual two hands on the wheel as we zipped eastward the business establishments grew smaller sadder rattier and i noticed a certain consistency to their distribution checkcashing outlets rib joints nail palaces liquor stores lots of liquor stores thin dark men lounged against filthy stucco walls holding paper bags smoking staring off into space a few women in shorts and rollers sashayed by and caught whistles but for the most part the streets were deserted that much south central and beverly hills had in common a quarter mile farther even the liquor stores couldnt make it plywood storefronts became as common as glass movie theaters converted to churches converted to garbage dumps vacant lots impromptu auto graveyards entire blocks of dead buildings shadowing the occasional ragpicker or stray child more young men glutted with time starved of hope not a white face in sight milo turned left on broadway drove until th and made a right we passed an enormous windowless brown brick fortress southeast division he said but were not meeting him there he drove for another few miles through silent residential blocks of tiny characterless bungalows ocher and pink and turquoise texturecoat competed with the angry blackanddayglo tangle of gang scrawl dirt lawns were surrounded by sheets of chain link undernourished dogs scrounged through the trash that lined the curbs a quick turn took us to th another led us into a crackedasphalt alley lined with an alternating band of garage doors and more chain link a group of black men in their early twenties loitered midway down the alley when they saw the ford cruising toward them they stared defiantly then sauntered away and disappeared into one of the garages milo said strictly speaking this isnt watts thats farther east but same difference he turned off the engine and pocketed the keys then unclasped the shotgun this is where it happened he said novato you want to stay in the car feel free he got out i did the same place used to be a major crack alley he said looking up and down holding the shotgun in one hand then it got cleaned up one of those neighborhood group things then it got bad again depends what week youre here his eyes kept moving to each end of the alley to the garage doors i followed his gaze and saw the pock and splinter of bullet holes in stucco and wood malignant blackheads among the graffiti blemish the ground was struggling clumps of weeds garbage used condoms cellophane packets empty matchbooks the cheapjewelry glitter of foil scraps the air stank of dog shit and decomposed food you tell me said milo can you think of any reason for him to come down here except for dope the sound of a car engine from the north end of the alley made both of us turn milo lifted the shotgun and held it with both hands what looked like another unmarked a matador sagegreen milo relaxed the car nosed up next to the ford the man who got out was about my age mediumsized and trim very dark cleanshaven with a medium afro he wore a bankers pinstriped gray suit white buttondown shirt red silk tie and glossy black wingtips squarejawed and straightbacked and very handsome but despite the good posture tiredlooking milo said maury milo congratulations on the promotion thanks the two of them shook hands smith looked at me his face was beautifully shaved and fragrant with good cologne but his eyes were weary and bloodshot under long thick lashes milo said this is dr alex delaware hes a shrink called in to work with the kids at hale school he was the one who discovered the connection between the burden girl and your guy been a department consultant for years but had never done a ridealong i thought southeast might be instructive doctor said smith his grip was very firm very dry to milo if you wanted to be instructive how come you didnt give him his own shotgun milo smiled smith took out a pack of marlboros lit one and said anyway milo said where exactly did it go down far as i can remember said smith just about exactly where youre parked hard to recall with all the shootings we get around here i brought the file hold on he went back to his ear opened the passenger door leaned in and pulled out a folder handing it to milo he said dont show the pictures to the doctor here unless you want to lose yourself a consultant that bad shotgun from up close you know what that does he must have put his hands up in a defensive reflex because they got shredded to pieces im talking confetti the face was shotgun stuff barely enough blood left in him by the time the crimescene boys arrived but he was dopepositive all right coke and booze and downers regular walking pharmacy milo thumbed through the folder his face impassive i moved closer and looked down sheets of paper lots of typewritten police prose a couple of photos taped to the top living color longview crimescene shots and closeups of something lying faceup on the filthy asphalt something ragged and wet that had once been human my stomach churned i looked away but struggled to remain outwardly calm smith had been watching me he said i guess you guys see that stuff medical school and all that hes a phd said milo phd said smith philosophy doctor he stretched his arm down the alley any ideas about the philosophy of a place like this i shook my head and smiled as milo read smith kept checking the alley i was struck by the silence of the place a sickly contrived silence like that of a mortuary devoid of birdsong or traffic the hum of commerce or conversation i entertained postnuclear fantasies then all at once noise intruded with all the shock and harshness of an armed robber the scream and wobble of an ambulance siren from afar followed by highpitched human screams an ugly duet of domestic violence from somewhere close smith gave a distasteful look glanced at milos shotgun opened his suit jacket and touched the butt of the revolver that lay nestled in his shoulder holster then silence again okay lets see ah heres the toxicology said milo flipping pages yeah the guy was definitely fried deepfried said smith sniffing why else would he be down here milo said one thing i wonder about maury the kid lives in venice ocean fronts a pharmacy in its own right why bother coming down here smith thought for a moment and said maybe he didnt like the brand they were selling locally people do that now get picky the businessmen were dealing with nowadays are into packaging and labeling dry ice sweet dreams medellin mouton choose your poison or maybe he was a businessman himself selling not buying came here to collect something the boys over in venice werent providing maybe said milo why else said smith anyway dont lose too much sleep over it if i wasted my time trying to secondguess junkies and wetheads might as well nail my foot to the floor and run in circles all day he puffed on his cigarette milo said yeah saw your stats on the last report grim said smith wholly uncivilized he smoked and nodded tapped one wingtip and kept looking up and down the alley the silence had returned milo returned the file to him not much in the way of background on him no priors no history no family phantom of the opera said smith sucker came right out of nowhere no files on him anywhere which fits if he was an amateur businessman theyre getting crafty organized buying phony paper moving around a lot hiding behind layers just like the corporations do theyve even got subsidiaries in other cities other states novato told his landlady he was from somewhere back east thats as specific as i got she forgot exactly where or didnt want to remember think she was lying maybe she was something that one flaming commie didnt like cops wasnt shy about telling you being with her was like being back in the sixties when we were the enemies before miami vice made it hip to oink smith laughed at his own wit smoked and said nice to be hip right milo take it to the bank try to get a loan milo said she tell you anything diddly it was all i could do to get her to let me in her house she was real uppity actually called me a cossack asked me how did it feel to be a black cossack like i was some kind of traitor to the race you get anything out of her couldnt said milo shes gone disappeared four days after novato got hit no ones seen or heard from her since surprise widened smiths weary eyes he said whos on the case hal mehan out of pacific hes on vacation back in two weeks from what i can gather he did the usual missingpersons stuff found out she hadnt packed or taken money out of the bank followed it for a couple of weeks and told her friends to hire a pi or forget about it told her neighbor it looked like foul play out on the streets smiths foot tapped faster mehan know about novato the friends say they told him smith said hmm his eyes halfclosed milo said yeah i know he coulda told you shoulda but the bottom line is you didnt lose anything he deadended moved on to greener pastures the nextdoor neighbor saved her mail i just had a look at it not much of it just junk and a few bills smith continued to look perturbed who are these friends of hers no one in the neighborhood seemed to know much about her only one who knew anything at all was the guy next door some kind of english rabbi he the one who saved the mail milo nodded just spoke to him the friends were a few old folk she knew from temple acquaintances more than friends according to them she wasnt sociable kept to herself thats true said smith man that was some little old battleax they also said she didnt have any family same as novato smith said think that means anything who knows said milo coulda been misery loving company two loners finding each other smith said black kid and an old white woman some company or maybe the two of them were up to something huh when i went around there on the novato thing saw how hostile and radical she was how she didnt even want me to come inside i asked around about her being involved in a dope thing asked the neighbors about people coming in and out at weird hours fancy cars parked outside the usual thing no one knew anything no one still does said milo theres one other thing you should know a few days after she was gone someone burglarized her place the rabbis too took small stuff trashed everything wrote nasty stuff on the walls what kind of nasty stuff antisemitic and something about remembering john kennedy in red paint theyd stolen from the garage that jibe with any of the gang stuff youve been seeing smith said kennedy no theres some punk band the dead kennedys thats all that comes to mind he thought if they got the paint right there doesnt sound like they came to paint could have been just an opportunist junkie said milo asshole got caught up in the intruder high and got artistically inspired smith nodded like a shitter to me therere these guys break into houses steal stuff and dump a load on the floor or the bed what do you think of that psychologically or philosophically power trip i said forbidden fruit leave a signature someonell remember same as the ones who ejaculate or eat all the food in the fridge smith nodded anyway said milo just thought you should know about all this thanks said smith in terms of a dope thing i ran novato through ncic the moniker files dea called every smart narc in the department as well as the sheriffs guys nothing the kid had no name in the business maybe he was a newcomer said milo trying to move in on someone and it got him dead a newcomer i said novato im pretty sure thats spanish for novice both of them looked at me i said latin name on a black kid it could be an alias el novato huh said smith well its not a moniker least not one of the ones weve got on file guess it could be an alias he enunciated and put on a spanish accent el novato kind of like el vato loco sounds like something out of boyle heights but this bro was black anything left of the fingers to print said milo smith shook his head you saw the pictures howd you id him wallet in pocket he had a drivers license thats it and a business card from the place he worked at some grocery i called his boss asked him about any family to notify he said he didnt know of any later after no one had claimed the body i called the boss again told him if he wanted he could claim it give it a decent burial spoke to him too said milo he cremated it guess thats a decent burial said smith doesnt make much difference one way or the other when youre that way does it more screams from down the alley the same two people tearing at each other with words smith said ill probably be back in the near future pick up one of their bodies anything more you want to know about novato milo said thats all that comes to mind maury thanks far as im concerned milo good riddance if he was a businessman on top of doping and getting hit slowed his business im even happier one less piece of shit to keep track of smith dropped his cigarette and ground it out with his heel how well did the burden girl know novato they were seen talking to each other probably means nothing im just following the chain wherever it leads if there turns out to be a connection ill call you in yeah said smith thatd be real nice meantime how about you remember me when the west la roster opens up i put in an application last year no vacancies wouldnt mind getting over to civilized territory catch a little breathing time between homicidal incidents your promotion you could have some say in it right that kind of thing gets handled higher said milo but ill do my best appreciate it could use some civilization so he was a doper i said after smith had driven away so much for dinwiddies expertise wishful thinking said milo does strange things to the old judgment quotient he avoided the streets on the way back getting on the harbor freeway and taking it through the downtown interchange into the west side of town neither of us said much milo seemed eager to get away i got to lindas apartment at eight she came to the door wearing a black silk blouse gray jeans and black western boots her hair had been done up fastened by a silver comb she had on large silver hoop earrings blush that accented her cheekbones more eye shadow than id seen before and a look of reserve that forced its way through her smile i was feeling it too a reticence almost a shyness as if this were a first date everything that had happened two nights ago had been a fantasy and we needed to start from scratch she said hi right on time took my hand and led me inside there was a bottle of chablis and two glasses on the coffee table along with dishes of sliced raw vegetables crackers dip and cubes of cheese she said just a nip before dinner looks great i sat down she took a place beside me poured wine and said how about a toast lets see things have been pretty nuts lately so how about to boredom hear hear we touched glasses and drank she said so whats new there was plenty to tell her mahlon burden in his natural habitat novato and gruenberg savaged cars neonazis in suburbia a crack alley i said lets honor the toast for a little while she laughed and said sure we munched vegetables drank some more got something to show you she said got up and crossed the room toward her bedroom the jeans showed off her shape the boots had very high heels and they did something to her walk that convinced me two nights ago had been real she came back with a boom box amazing the sound you can get from one of these she set it up on the coffee table next to the food takes cassettes and compact discs looking like a kid on christmas morning she set the control on battery pressed eject and handed me the compact disc that slid out kenny g silhouette she said i know you like jazz saxophone so i thought this might be right is it i smiled its great that was really nice of you i popped the disc back in and pressed play sweet soprano sounds filled the small apartment she said umm thats pretty and sat back down we listened after a while i put my arm around her during the brief dead time between the first and second cuts on the disc we kissed gently with restraint a deliberate holding back that was mutual she pulled away said its good to see you good to see you too i touched her face traced her jawline she closed her eyes and sat back we stayed locked in a lovely inertia kenny g did his thing it seemed a personal serenade after the fourth cut we forced ourselves up and left we went to the galleries taking in the newer places on la brea looking at lots of bad art a few experiments that succeeded the last gallery we visited was brandnew and a surprise older stuff by la standards early twentiethcentury works on paper i found something i wanted and could afford a george bellows boxing print one of the minor ones id missed getting one from the same edition at an auction last year after some deliberation i bought it and had it wrapped to go like the fights she said as we left the gallery not in the flesh but on paper it makes for good composition daddy used to take me when i was little i hated it all the grunting and the blood but i was too afraid to tell him she smoothed her hair closed her eyes i called him today howd it go easier than i thought his wife answered she was kind of cool but he actually sounded happy to hear from me agreeable almost too agreeable old i dont know if its because its been such a long time or hes really aged that much he asked me when i was coming back for a visit i beat around the bush didnt give him a straight answer even if i wanted to go back so much else is going on right now by the way i confirmed your parents group for tomorrow should be a good turnout she stopped herself ah the toast viva boredom forget the toast if you feel like it i dont feel like it she said and put her arm around my waist we got to the car i put the print in the trunk and drove to a place on melrose northern italian food seating inside and out on the patio the night breeze was kind the sort of caressing warmth that keeps people moving to la despite the phoniness and the madness and we chose outside small lacy trees in strawcovered pots separated the patio from the sidewalk white lattice partitions had been set up around groupings of tables affording the illusion of privacy the waiter was a ponytailed recent actingclass graduate playing the part of solicitous server and he recited what seemed like an endless list of specials with the hubris of a memory course graduate the lighting was so dim just a single covered candle on each table that we had to lean forward to make out the menus we were hungry by now and ordered an antipasto seafood salads two kinds of veal and a bottle of pellegrino water conversation came easily but we stayed faithful to the toast when the food came we concentrated on eating solicitous wheeled the dessert cart tableside and linda chose a monumental cream and hazelnut thing that looked as if baking it required a building permit i ordered a lemon ice when she was halfway through the pastry she wiped cream from her lips and said i think i can handle reality okay if we ditch the boredom pledge sure then tell me about the burden girls home what was the father like can you talk about it in terms of confidentiality yes one of the conditions i gave him was that anything i learned could be passed on to you to the kids or to the police but i didnt learn anything earthshattering just confirmed what i suspected how so i gave her a synopsis of my visit she said god he sounds like a real jerk hes different thats for sure different she smiled yes thats much more professional than jerk i laughed she said see why i wouldnt make a good therapist too judgmental how do you do it keeping your feelings from getting in the way its not always easy i said especially with someone like him while interviewing him i realized i didnt like him resolved to keep that in the forefront of my mind which is what you do be aware of your own feelings stay aware put the patients welfare first keeping yourself in the background like an accompanist you consider him your patient no hes more of a consulting client the way the court would be in a custody evaluation not that im going to be able to tell him what he wants to hear that she was innocent if anything she fits the profile of a mass murderer pretty closely so my hunch is ill probably get fired fairly soon its happened before she put half a hazelnut in her mouth and chewed some tension the intensity had returned to her face i said what is it nothing oh heck i just keep thinking about my car it was the first thing i bought myself when i had money it looked so sad when they towed it away they say itll live but surgery will take at least a month meanwhile ive got a rental if im lucky the district wont hassle me when it comes time to divvy up she pushed her fork around on her dessert plate the thing that keeps bugging me is why my little clunker it was parked on the street with all the others howd they know who it belonged to someone probably saw you in it meaning someone was watching me stalking me no i said quickly i doubt were talking about anything that sophisticated more likely someone spotted you knew you were associated with the school and decided to strike out opportunism i knew why the word had leaped into my mind all this exposure to politics ugliness so you think it was someone local she said who knows stupid punks she said i wont let them dominate my life a moment later she said so whats my next step start toting a gun she smiled maybe not such a bad idea after all like i told you im a crack shot hope i stay on your good side she laughed looked down at what remained of her dessert want any of this im full i declined called for the check and paid solicitous as we got up from the table i noticed simultaneous movement from a table on the other side of the lattice as if we were sitting next to a mirror the synchrony was so strong that it actually gave a second look to make sure we werent but it was two other people the vague outlines of a man and a woman i thought nothing of it as we headed toward the car but as i drove away from the curb another car pulled out right behind us and stayed on our tail i felt my chest tighten then remembered the similar fantasy id had just a few days ago the paranoia that had caused me to pull off sunset into the service station brown toyota what appeared to be two people a couple absorbed with each other now another couple right behind us but from the spacing of the headlights this car was larger a midsized sedan no flicker okay definitely not the same car nothing odd about two couples leaving a restaurant at the same time and heading this way on melrose was the logical route for anyone living west of hancock park ease up delaware i looked in the rearview mirror headlights same ones the glare prevented me from seeing who was inside ridiculous i was letting all the talk of plots and counterplots go to my head whats wrong said linda wrong nothing all of a sudden youre all tensed up your shoulders are all crunched the last thing i wanted to do was feed her anxiety i consciously relaxed tried to look more casual than i felt snuck another glance in the rearview mirror different set of headlights i was pretty sure a caravan of headlights stretching for blocks typical weekend jamup on melrose what is it alex nothing really i turned off melrose onto spaulding and pulled a therapist switcheroo how about yourself still thinking about the car got to admit im a little edgy she said maybe we should have stuck to the boredom pledge dont worry i said i can get you bored again really quick i cleared my throat and put on a whiny pedagogical tone lets talk educational theory the topic of the day is ahem curriculum adjustment macro and microvariables of a variety of contemporary text offerings that contribute to greater ahem student participation while holding constant class size budgetary factors and the ahem cementasphalt ratio of the surrounding play areas in a suburban school prototype as defined by all right i believe you the harrumphpshaw educational coercion act of enough she was laughing hard i looked in the mirror no headlights stretched my arm across the seat and touched her shoulder she scooted closer rested a hand on my knee then removed it i put it back she laughed and said now what tired more like wired want to help me hang the print that kind of like come up and see my etchings same general idea hmm hmm what hmm yes i squeezed her shoulder drove home feeling relaxed except for the two dozen times i checked my rearview mirror i love everything about this place she said stretching out on the leather sofa and undoing her hair the view the pond its simple but youve done a lot with it feels bigger than it is how long have you been living here almost seven years out here that just about makes you a homesteader got the wagon train out in back i said holding up the bellows how does this look little to the left she got up here ill hold it you take a look for yourself we exchanged places she said what do you think perfect i measured hammered the nail hung the print straightened the frame we returned to the sofa and looked at it nice she said thats a good place for it i kissed her without restraint her arms went around me we clinched till we lost breath her hand settled on my fly gently squeezing i began unbuttoning her blouse got two buttons loose before she said whoa and lifted her hand something the matter she was flushed and her eyes were shiny no nothing its just every time we get together we just do it bam not if you dont want to the white lashes fluttered like down she took my face in her hands you really that chivalrous not really but all that talk about your being a crack shot has me worried she laughed turned serious just as quickly i just dont want it to be easy come easy go like everything else in this town thats not for me either she looked uncertain but kissed me again deeply i got into it she squirmed i backed off she pulled me closer held me to her my heart was racing or maybe it was hers you want me she said as if amazed at her own power oh yeah a moment passed i could barely hear the gurgle of the pond oh what the heck she said and put her hand back i heard her get up the next morning at six she had dressed and was drinking coffee at the kitchen table when i came in half an hour later blue monday she said feeling down actually not one bit she gazed out the window really love this view i filled a cup and sat down she looked at her watch when youre ready ill take a ride back to my place i want to get to school early set up your parents for todays group how many do you expect about twenty quite a few are spanishspeaking i can be your translator but it means ive got to clear my desk first sounds good do you think youll need more than one session probably not ill be available for individual followups great both of us talking shop skirting the personal as if it were a dead animal in the middle of the road i drank a little more coffee she said want any breakfast nope you she shook her head how about a rain check then im a pretty good breakfast cook nothing cordon bleu just downhome integrity and high quantity i look forward to making you prove it her smile was sudden white dazzling we touched hands i drove her home during the drive she looked out the window a lot and i sensed more pulling away a reaffirmation of her ability to take care of herself so i dropped her off in front of her building told her id see her at eleven put gas in the seville and used a pay phone at the station to call my service for the messages id neglected to pick up yesterday just one from mahlon burden reminding me to call his son and reiterating howard burdens business number just after nine i called encino a female voice said pierce sloan and marder howard burden please her tone became guarded one moment another female voice louder and nasal howard burdens office id like to speak with mr burden whom shall i say is calling dr delaware may i ask what this is about doctor a personal matter i was referred by mr burdens father hesitation one moment she was gone for what seemed like a long time then im sorry mr burdens in a meeting any idea when hell be free no i dont ill give you my number please ask him to call me ill deliver the message frosty tone letting me know a callback was about as likely as world peace i thought i understood her protectiveness im not with the press i said his father is pretty eager for me to talk with him you can call mr burden senior and confirm that ill give him the message sir another roadblock at the entrance to ocean heights when i saw the pair of squad cars my hands went clammy but this was a smaller police presence than on the day of the sniping just two blackandwhites an equal number of uniformed cops standing in the middle of the street chatting with each other looking relaxed they refused to answer my questions and had a few of their own i spent a long time explaining who i was waiting for them to call the school and verify it with linda she couldnt be reached finally after showing them my psych license and med school faculty card and tossing in milos name i was allowed through before i walked back to my car i tried again so whats going on the cops looked amused and annoyed at the same time one of them said show time sir the other hooked his thumb toward the seville and said better be getting going i drove off speeding up esperanza the school was ringed with vehicles and i had to park more than a block away more cop cars along with blandlooking sedans that might have been unmarkeds media vans at least three white ultrastretch mercedes and spectators a few of the locals standing in front of their homes some looked sour the putupon resignation of picnickers invaded by ants but others seemed pleased as if waiting for a parade i walked on wondering what had brought them out what show time meant then i heard it as i got closer to the school grounds a relentless drumbeat synthesizer trills over a walking bass run carnival sounds a rockandroll carnival i wondered why linda hadnt mentioned anything to me directly across from the school entrance a local stood blocking the sidewalk thickset older man in plaid madras pants and white banlon golf shirt smoking a cigarette and flicking ashes onto the sidewalk flicking in the direction of the school as i approached he stopped and stared dryice squint rawpork complexion morning i said whats all the hubbub he peered at me flicked and said some singer his tone of voice said he placed that one rung above pimp on the occupational ladder which one who knows he took a drag first they force themselves on us then they bring in their jungle music he gave me a challenging look i walked around him and crossed the street his cigarette flew by me landed on the macadam throwing off sparks the fence around the schoolyard was laced with orange and silver streamers hung so densely i couldnt see inside the gate was locked a school policeman was at the front door to the school building along with a husky black man with rasta dreadlocks and a patchy blemishlike beard the black man wore white sweat pants and an orange tshirt that said the chiller tour megaplatinum in metallic letters he held a clipboard in one hand a set of goldplated keys in the other as i got closer the school cop retreated dreadlocks said name dr delaware alex delaware i work at the school he looked at the clipboard ran his finger down a page how do you spell thot mon his enunciation was precise i told him he turned a page and his brows compressed pulling forward several twists of hair delaware as in the state exactly sorry mon i dont see anything like thot before i could reply the door swung open linda stormed out shed changed into a cheerfullooking yellow dress but didnt look happy stop hassling this man the school cop and dread turned to stare at her she came down the steps took my arm pulled me past them dread said moom she held up a warning finger uhuh dont say a word this man works here hes a famous doctor he has a job to do and youre getting in the way dread pulled at a lock and grinned sorry moom i was just looking for his name no offense intended no offense i gave your people his name they promised me thered be no hassle dread smiled again and shrugged sorry what the heck do you think this is anyway some disco club she glared at the school cop and what about you what the heck are you here for just here to keep him company before either of them could answer we were inside she slammed the door behind us jesus i just knew that was going to happen she was still gripping my arm as we speedwalked down the corridor i said whats going on dejon jonson is whats going on hes chosen to honor us with a personal appearance for the sake of the poor victimized children the chiller himself in all his spangled glory and his entourage groupies roadies press agents an army of bodyguards clones of mr reggae out there and a whole bunch of unclassifieds who look as if they should be shipped off to drug rehab not to mention every tv radio and newspaper hack in town and a dozen pencilpushers from the board who havent seen the inside of a schoolyard since eisenhower she stopped straightened her dress patted her hair and of course our dear councilman latch it was he who arranged the whole thing latch she nodded wifeypoos show biz connections no doubt shes here too patting the kids heads and wearing a rock that could pay for all our school lunches for a year diamonds on a revolutionary california revolutionary what my dad used to call cadillac commies lord save me from monday morning surprises no one told you nope so much for his hearing me whats that latch the time he dropped in to play his harmonica i talked to him about keeping things predictable he told me hed heard me id given him food for thought oh he heard it all right he just chose to disregard it when did you actually find out we resumed walking she said one of the pencilpushers left a message on my machine last night at ten i had the poor manners to be out with you didnt pick up until this morning which gave me a heck of a lot of time to prepare right i managed to get to latch just a while ago told him this could be disruptive he didnt process that at all said getting a star of dejons caliber wasnt something that came up every day this was a coup for the kids i said coup for him tape a few thousand feet of happyface video for the next campaign she made a taut throaty sound like a mama bobcat warning hunters away from the lair you know what gets me the most is that sunday call from downtown thats got to be a historical first ordinarily i cant even get them to take a message during working hours ordering textbooks begging for funds for field trips everything takes forever molasses standard time but for this they can move like rockets i said rock and roll never dies you even got your guard back she gave a disgusted look you should see the production theyve put together crew from the record company arrived at seven along with carpenters from the district they set up a big stage out on the yard in one hour flat pa system all those streamers the works they even printed up a schedule do you believe that orange print on silver satin paper must have cost a fortune everything laid out by the minute latch makes a speech then dejon does his thing throws paper flowers at the kids and is whisked off to a waiting limo it actually says thatwhisked off to waiting limo the whole darned thing gets filmed for the evening news and probably used on dejons next rock video his flunkies came into the classrooms and distributed release forms for the kids to take home i said megaplatinum and the nobel peace prize too with all this excitement whats the status of the parent group the parents are all here though i had a heck of a time getting jonsons yahoos to understand they needed to be let through without a body search i had to watch the door all morning course once latchs people realized who they were they laid out the red carpet snapped their pictures with latch gave them frontrow seats for the show howd the mothers react to that confused at first but they got into it pretty quickly celebrities for an hour whether theyll be in a receptive state for talking about problems i dont know im sorry i smiled not receptive even for a famous doctor she colored hey to me youre famous the kind of fame that matters we reached her office as she unlocked it she said alex i know its the same old question but whats the psychological effect of something like this on the kids lets hope theyll have some fun get back to their routine in a day or so and move on the main risk you run is that theyll get so overstimulated that they experience a case of the morningafter blues once the hoopla dies down i used to see it a lot when i worked at the hospital celebrities would blow in for photoop visits with poor little sick kids then disappear just as suddenly and the kids would be left with their pain and disease and a sudden silence on the wards that was really harsh it was due to the shift in arousal decompression i started to think of it as the psychological bends i know what you mean she said we see the same kind of thing after an allday field trip theyre supposed to be having fun but they fall apart exactly i said its why so many birthday parties end up in tears another thing to consider is that all this excitement and strangers politicians the press could cause them to remember the last time things got so excited around here the sniping oh boy some of them may flash back to it get anxious all over terrific she said what do i do keep an eye out for anxiety reactions especially among the younger ones when things quiet down try to get them back to a routine maintain discipline but be flexible they may need to talk about the concert talk out the excitement and any fear theyre experiencing if any persistent reactions develop you know where to find me youre becoming a fixture here doc i smiled ulterior motives she smiled back but looked low what is it i said im supposed to be in charge but i feel irrelevant this is a oneshot deal linda by tomorrow youll be back in control but yeah it stinks they should have told you she gave another sad smile thanks for the support ulterior motives this time her smile was untarnished she took my hand and led me inside the office locked the door behind us threw her arms around me and kissed me hard and long there she said my own contribution to overstimulation acknowledged i said catching my breath and appreciated she kissed me again we went into her inner office the music from the schoolyard pounded through the walls heres the list of parents she said handing me a sheet of paper i took it the music stopped an amplified reverberating voice took its place she said let the games begin we stood at the back of the yard looking out over hundreds of heads watching gordon latch he stood behind a lectern at the center of the stage brandishing his harmonica the lectern was polished walnut embossed with the city seal the stage was heavy lumber elevated and backed with a thirtyfoot wall of black silk that looked like a patch on the clear blue eye of the sky lots of sound equipment but no instruments no musicians either just the press crowding around on all sides filming talking into tape recorders jotting and a small army of hulking types in orange tshirts patrolling with walkietalkies some of the beef brigade stood on stage others down at spectator level from the way they glared and scanned the crowd they could have been guarding the crown jewels latch grinned and waved puffed a couple of high notes into the mike and said something about celebrating life his words echoed across the schoolyard and died somewhere out on the spotless streets of ocean heights a row of ten folding chairs had been set up to the left of the podium eight of them were occupied by middleaged men and women in business suits except for the sound gear and the orange men lurking behind them it could have been a middlemanagement seminar sitting in the two seats closest to the podium were bud ahlward in the same brown suit hed worn the day hed shot holly burden and a thin attractive woman with taffycolored wedgecut hair a deeply tanned face and a jawline so tight it looked like a seam mrs latch the former miranda brundage looking at her attire reminded me the sixties were ancient history or maybe theyd never happened at all she had on a twopiece black leather outfit with padded shoulders and gold lamé appliqué diamond earrings and the rock linda had mentioned a solitaire on a chain that even at this distance reflected enough light to brighten a ballroom her legs were well shaped sheathed in gray silk crossed at the ankles her feet encased in spikeheel thonged affairs that had to be handmade italian she alternated between gazing out at the audience and looking up at her husband even at this distance she looked bored almost defiantly jaded i thought i remembered that shed once wanted to be an actress either she had no talent or wasnt bothering to fake it latch held forth in echoplex eloquence so i told dejon jon jon jon youre someone everyone looks up to to to to your message is positive a message for today and the kids at hale need you applause line latch stopped and waited the kids didnt get it but the suits and the orange gorillas did the sound of twenty pairs of hands clapping was feeble latch beamed as if it had been an ovation at the national convention removed his welfare glasses and loosened his tie his wifes affection for high style hadnt rubbed off he had on a rumpled tan corduroy suit blue chambray shirt and navy knit tie dejon said yes upraised fist the school board said yes punching air so we put it together for you both hands raised dual victory vs so here he is boys and girls of all ages the chiller the ultimate crowdthriller dejoon jonson power chords tumbled out of the speakers like avalanche boulders rumbling deafening threatening finally picking up melodic content and terminating as a sustaining organ tone a fugue performed by an e power biggs on acid a hailstorm of guitar chords shattered the silence thunderous drums hissing cymbals the suits on stage looked stricken but kept their places the orange tshirts marched toward them and touched the backs of their chairs as if choreographed the bureaucrats in the suits got up and filed off the stage miranda latch and ahlward hung back she applauding with aerobic fervor that seemed disconnected to the ennui in her eyes latch left the podium and took her hand waving to the audience the two of them walked off the stage ahlward trailed looking bored one hand inside his jacket the three of them took seats in the front row amid a group of plainly dressed women my group the mothers were all applauding i couldnt see their faces the music got louder linda grimaced i said one sec and made my way toward the front of the assembly weaving past news crews and camera gear finally i got close enough to see hundreds of faces some blank some puzzled some burnished with excitement i glanced over at the front row the mothers looked intimidated but not unhappy instant celebrity latch noticed me smiled and continued snapping his fingers in time with the beat bud ahlward followed his bosss glance let his eyes settle on me then looked away miranda was snapping her fingers too for all the fun she was having it might have been physical therapy i returned my attention to the kids the volume of the music continued to climb i saw one little girl a first grader slap her hands over her ears i moved forward to get a better look the little girls eyes were squeezed shut and her mouth was trembling a blast from the speakers and she burst into an openmouthed wail rendered silent by the din no one noticed all eyes including those of her teacher were fixed upon the stage i went back to linda and managed with gestures and shouts in her ear to communicate what was happening she looked over at the little girl who was crying harder then she nudged me and pointed a couple of other kids in the lower grades were looking unsteady holding their ears too more tears linda gave a furious look and stomped forward elbowing cameramen and orange bruisers until she reached the little girls teacher she talked behind her hand pointed discreetly the teachers mouth formed an o looking chastened he turned his attention back to his class i counted about six or seven children crying by now four of them kids i recognized easily because they were in the highrisk group linda saw them too she went over to each of them bending low patting heads talking in their ears taking their hands and offering them the choice of leaving four headshakes three nods she removed the nodders from the group herded them past the press clutch back into the school building i followed her it took me a while to get into the building linda was halfway down the main corridor sitting on the floor in a circle with the three children smiling talking holding a hand puppet and making it talk in a highpitched voice the children were smiling no distress that i could see i took a few steps forward she looked up look kids its dr delaware hi i said shy waves anything you guys want to ask dr delaware silence looks like everythings under control dr delaware i said great dr overstreet and went back outside though the music was louder the stage was uninhabited not a musician in sight not even a synthesizer wizard i realized this was going to be a lipsync exhibition prefab passion nothing happened for several seconds then what appeared to be a huge orange flame burned its way through the black backdrop gasps from the audience as the flame got closer it turned into an oversized sheet of heavy satin trailing along the stage beneath the satin was movement a swelling and pulsating as the sheet shimmered forward like a gag horse minus head or tail cheap trick but eerie the sheet bumped and grinded its way center stage organ crescendo cymbal crash and the sheet dropped revealing six more huge men barechested and wearing orange tights and silver jackboots three blacks on the left scowling under broombristles of straightened yellow hair on the right a trio of nordic types in royalblue afros the six of them spread their legs and assumed wristgripping ironpumper poses between them appeared a very tall very skinny man in his midtwenties with skin the color of india ink asian eyes and orange jhericurled pasttheshoulders hair that looked as if it had been braised with axle grease wide shoulders the hips of a prepubescent boy rubbery limbs a modigliani neck and the terminalillness cheekbones of a vogue model he wore electricblue goggles in tigerhide plastic frames that were wider than his face a tight silver silk jumpsuit embroidered with orange thread and festooned with costume sapphires in baroque patterns his hands were encased in fingerless blue satin weightlifters gloves his feet shod in silver hightops with orange laces he snapped his fingers the musclemen retreated satin sheet in hand the music picked up pace jonson pranced knees high like a drum majorette did a nijinsky leap shot off a flurry of tapdance pyrotechnics and ended with a split that transformed him into an inverted silver t and made my groin hurt vicariously then sudden quiet topped by a highpitched hum from the speakers a few of the older kids were out of their seats bouncing and clapping and calling out dejon dejon do chiller chiller dejon dejon the orangehaired man scissored himself upright and smiled feverishly went pigeontoed and knockkneed shimmied squatted did a backwards double somersault followed by a headstand and some rapid handwalking then jumped back to his feet flexed each bicep and bared his teeth the music resumed a modified reggae beat supercharged by a stringpopping funk riff his teeth parted and his mouth opened wide enough for a tonsil display a very whispery tenor oozed out of the speakers when the night moves in and creepies crawl and thingies creep over castle walls gasp hand to mouth look of exaggerated fear thats when im real thats when i live im your party man got so much to give cause im a chiller love your chiller baby im your chiller got to love your chiller sweet kind of chiller got to kiss your chiller seductive leer change of tempo to a manic twofour almost drowned out by shouts and applause jonson bellydanced jumped back raced forward skidded to a stop at the edge of the stage rolled his eyes when he lipsynced again his whisper had turned into a raspy baritone and when the snakes of wrath meet the toads of fire and scorpions waltz across the pyre thats when i breathe that makes me whole im here to love your mortal soul cause im a chiller love your chiller charming i searched for signs of anxiety among the children many of them were rocking and bopping singing along shouting out jonsons name taking it the way it was meant to be taken as a soundwave gestalt the lyrics irrelevant it went on for another minute then a rain of orange and silver flowers appeared out of nowhere butterflydelicate the musclemen reappeared with the orange sheet and jonson was whisked offstage the whole thing had taken less than two minutes latch got back onstage and mouthed inaudible thankyous over the cheers the press surged past him taking off in the direction of the sheet latch stood there abandoned and i saw something a spoiled peevish look creep onto his face just for a second then it was gone and he was grinning again and waving his wife and ahlward by his side things had gotten wild out in the cheap seats the kids were pelting each other with flowers teachers struggled to line them up i looked back at the front row and saw my mothers standing alone confused the latches and ahlward stood nearby surrounded by youngscrubbeds like the ones id seen the day of the sniping lots of congratulations from the troops latch getting what he needed soaking it up while maintaining a tv face no one made any attempt to talk to the mothers i started making my way over waiting for whole classes to pass getting my insteps trampled by tiny feet camera crews were pulling up cable creating tripwires and i had to watch where i stepped when i was a few feet away latch saw me grinned and waved his wife waved too pavlov would have given her an a ahlward remained stolid one hand in his jacket latch said something to him the redheaded man walked over to me and said dr delaware the councilman would like to speak with you gee whiz i said if he heard me he didnt let on i followed him but at the last moment i veered away and went to the mothers latchs face took on that same deprivedbrat look i wondered how long it had been since he had been told no the women looked deprived too of their bearings a few held paper flowers seemed afraid to throw them away i walked up to them and introduced myself before they could reply a voice behind me said dr delaware alex no choice but to turn the councilman had regained his camera happyface but his wife had gotten tired of wearing hers shed put on sunglasses copperandgold designer originals with a lavenderblue tint the two of them were standing together but seemed far apart ahlward and the dressforsuccess bunch hung back several yards latch held out his hand good to see you again alex councilman please gordon the inevitable pressing of flesh he pumped hard enough to draw water i turned back to the mothers smiled and said one minute please in my basic spanish they smiled back still confused latch said alex id like you to meet my first wife miranda chuckling her smile was murderous randy this is dr alex delaware the psychologist i told you about pleased to meet you doctor she gave me four fingertips and retracted them quickly her formality seemed defiant latch gave her a quick nervous look which she ignored up close she seemed smaller brittle of voice and bone and older her husbands senior by a good five years betrayed by her skin the rich tan and wellapplied makeup failed to mask the fine wrinkles and liverish blotches her mouth was wide and had a nice sensual curve to it but had started to pucker her nose was skinny and short with large nostrils probably rhinoplasty her chin was marred by a sprinkle of pocks her diamonds were flawless but made her look washedout in contrast latch said randys always had an interest in psych we both have he put his arm around her she tensed and smiled at the same time she said thats true doctor im a people person were organizing gordie and i a mental health committee for the district concerned citizens reaching out to help the mentally ill id be privileged if youd join our advisory committee i said im flattered mrs latch but my times pretty committed right now her smiled evaporated and her lower lip curled another spoiled child a little girl used to guilttripping daddy but she replaced it almost immediately with an inch of charmschool toothflash im sure it is she said airily but if you change your mind let us know alex said latch he spread his arms over the yard pretty fantastic wasnt it the kids really got into it i said he puts on quite a show its more than a show alex hes a phenomenon a natural resource one of a kind like the last golden eagle we were lucky to get him it was a coup we owe it all to randy squeezing his wifes shoulder again and jostling her she dredged up yet another smile the healing power of music said latch we should have more shows at other schools make it a regular thing give the kids a positive message to raise their selfesteem snakes of wrath toads of fire i said the show was pretty intense gordon some of the children were frightened frightened i didnt notice a handful mostly younger ones all the noise the stimulation dr overstreet took them inside a handful he said as if calculating electoral impact well thats not too bad considering put enough kids together anywhere and a few are bound to get uptight right before i could answer he said guess that means another lecture on coordination huh how about letting me off dr overstreet already read me the riot act before the concert i looked back at the mothers and said its been good talking to you gordon but ive really got to be going now ah your parents group yes i know about it because when i saw how uncomfortable they looked i went up to them found out who they were we made sure to see they felt at home slightly different from the way linda had told it i said great he stepped closer and put his hand on my shoulder listen i think what youre doing is great i didnt have a chance to tell you that last time looking at the whole family as a unit bringing your treatment to the community we used to do that up at berkeley it was called street psychiatry back then and we were constantly being accused by the psychiatric establishment of being subversive what it boiled down to of course was that they were threatened by challenges to the medical model no doubt youve experienced that somewhere along the line too being put down by mds i said i try to stay out of politics gordon good to meet you mrs latch i turned to leave he kept his hand on my shoulder and held me back a cameraman strolled by latch smiled and held it i saw my reflection in his glasses twin reflections a pair of unfriendly curlyhaired guys eager to be rid of him you know he said i never did get around to coming back to talk to the kids not necessary i said id say youve done enough he tried to read my face said thanks it was quite an experience putting it together on such short notice dr overstreets gripes notwithstanding i stared at him the twins in the glass looked mean which suited me just fine i said ah the tortured life of a modernday saint which network did you call first he paled and his freckles stood out his expression was that of a guy with new white bucks whos just stepped in fresh dog shit but he kept smiling looking out for cameras put his arm around me and drew me away from his wife to an observer we might have been buddies sharing a smutty joke over his shoulder i saw ahlward motionless watching when we were out of earshot latch lowered his voice we live in a cold world alex adding to the cynicism level isnt a virtue i shrugged out of his grip what can i say gordon sometimes it just comes with the territory i turned my back on him and went to do my job i led the mothers into the building realizing i had no idea where the group session was going to be held nothing like a few minutes of wandering the building to engender confidence in the therapist but just as we approached lindas office she stepped out and took us to the end of the hall and through a set of double doors id never been through before inside was a woodfloored halfgym i realized it was the room id seen that first day on tv children huddled together on the hardwood floor the cameras moving in with surgical cruelty in real life the room looked smaller tv had the ability to do that inflate reality or crush it to insignificance plastic folding chairs had been arranged in a circle in the middle was a low table covered with paper and set up with cookies and punch okay said linda perfect not the coziest environment but with jonsons people taking over all the empty classrooms it was all we had we seated the women then ourselves the mothers still looked frightened i spent the first few minutes passing out cookies and filling cups making the kind of small talk that i hoped would let them know i had a personal interest in their children wasnt just another authority figure pulling rank after explaining who i was i talked about their children what good kids they were how strong how well they were coping implying without being patronizing that children that robust had to have loving caring parents for the most part they seemed to understand when i got blank looks i had linda translate her spanish was fluent and unaccented i called for questions they had none of course sometimes i said no matter how strong a child is the memory of something frightening can come back in bad dreams or wanting to hold on to mama more not wanting to go to school nods and looks of comprehension if any of that has happened it doesnt mean theres anything wrong with your child that kind of thing is normal a couple of sighs of relief but bad memories can be helped cured using the cword theyd tried to drum out of me in grad school linda said mejor curado several of the women leaned forward mothers i said are a childs best helpers the best teachers of their children better than doctors better than anyone else because a mother knows her child better than anyone thats why the best way to cure a bad memory is for the mother to help the child what can we do said a girlishlooking woman with thick black eyebrows and long coarse black hair she wore a pink dress and sandals her english was barely accented you can let your children know its okay to talk about being afraid she said gilberto when he talks he gets more afraid yes thats true in the beginning fear is like a wave the longhaired woman translated puzzled looks all around i said at first when a child meets something that scares him the fear grows like a wave but when he goes into the water and swims gets used to the water the wave grows small if we pull the child away when the wave is high he never sees that never learns how to swim and remains afraid if he gets a chance to feel strong in control thats called coping when he copes he feels better more translation of course i said we have to protect our children we never throw them right into the water we stay with them hold them wait until they are ready teach them to conquer the wave to be stronger than the wave with love and talk and playing games giving permission to the child to swim teaching him to swim first in the small waves then the bigger ones moving slowly so the child is not frightened sometimes said the longhaired woman its not good to swim its dangerous to the others muy peligroso sometimes you can drown thats true the thing is el mundo es peligroso said another woman the world is dangerous yes it can be i said but do we want our children afraid all the time never swimming a few headshakes doubtful looks how said a woman who looked old enough to be a grandmother how can we make it not be dangerous all of them looking at me waiting for my next words of wisdom a cure fighting back feelings of impotence i said the things id planned to say offered small remedies situational tinkering baby steps across a vast cruel wasteland afterward when linda and i were alone in her office i said what do you think i think it went fine i was sitting on the lshaped sofa and she was picking dead leaves off a potted devil ivy the thing that bugs me i said is that basically theyre right the world they live in is dangerous what could i tell them pretend its dickandjane territory and go merrily skipping along you do what you can alex sometimes that doesnt seem like much hey she said what is this role reversal when i told you the same thing you gave me a nice little speech about making a difference on an individual level i shrugged she said cmon doctor moping doesnt become you she came around behind me and placed her hand on the back of my neck her touch was cool and soothing why so low all of a sudden anyway i dont know probably a combination of things things that seemed out of context but had stuck in my mind snapshots in a homicide file a little boy whod be collegeage by now things i didnt want to talk about i said one thing that gets to me is knowing latch will come out of this smelling sweet he buttonholed me after the show trying to play mr sensitive guy in front of his wife i let it ride for a while tried to get through to him that this impulsiveness isnt what the kids need that some of them had actually gotten scared by the concert he couldnt have cared less i halfexpected him to rip open his shirt and have on one of those youveobviouslymistakenmeforsomeonewhogiveashit tshirts underneath so i lost my cool let on that i knew all he cared about was making political points that got a rise out of him so now im a bipartisan loudmouth ive made fast friends on both sides she began massaging my neck so youre not a politician good for you hes slime he deserved it his wife just might agree with you i got the distinct impression theirs isnt the ultimate love match know what you mean she said he introduced me to her and i did pick up on a certain lack of warmth on her part maybe shes got on one of those tshirts herself under the designer duds did you see that rock power to the people i said serves him right if she hates him for marrying money serves both of them right darned cadillac commies she laughed i just hate it when daddys correct a moment of silence while her fingers kneaded my neck then she said daddy hes my wave you know im still figuring out what to do about him can i ever forgive him can there ever be anything good again any family youll figure it out youre pretty sure about that huh sure im sure youre a smart kid your instincts are good smart kid that so she put her face next to mine my instinct right now is to do something lewd in this office like i said however she said standing my better judgment my superego reminds me ive got work to do and a faculty meeting in twenty minutes i said aw shucks and got up she pulled me to her and we embraced youre a sweet sweet man she said and im glad you let me see you in a down mood that you trusted me enough not to be mr perfect i kissed her neck she said whatshername was crazy to let you go then she tightened in my arms god what a stupid thing to say my mouth is really running i silenced her with another kiss when we broke apart i said i want to see you tonight ive got homework skip it ill write you a note bad influence i certainly hope so i was home by four and picked up three messages none from howard burden one from his father inquiring whether howard and i had connected yet and a couple of throwaways from people wanting to sell me things i didnt need i put those aside and returned the last one from a superior court judge named steve hupp with whom id worked on several childcustody cases i reached him in chambers he wanted me to consult on a custody battle between a famous entrepreneur and a famous actress i do all the famous ones alex he said particularly wonderful people these two she claims hes a psychopathic cokesniffing pederast he claims shes a psychopathic cokesniffing nymphomaniac for all i know theyre both right shes got the kid in switzerland theyll pay your expenses to fly over there and evaluate you can work in some skiing while youre over there dont ski buy a watch then or start a bank account youll earn plenty on this one attorneys on retainer both sides its been going on for over a year sounds like a real mess truthfully it is thanks but ill pass your honor thought you would but if you have a change of heart let me know you can change the names write a screenplay and get rich so can you steve im doing it he said got a script making the rounds right now at universal noble jurist takes on the system perfect for michael douglas things turn out right ill be off the bench and on the set he laughed right meanwhile onward to stem the everrising tide of marital discord you should see our dockets how come people are so screwed up anyway alex how should i know we sent you to school to know that kind of stuff maybe its poor water quality steve or not enough dietary fiber at i called mahlon burden his machine answered and i told it i was still trying to reach howard then i phoned pierce sloan and marder and waited as the receptionist put me through to howard burdens office a mans voice answered lowpitched and sluggish burden speak mr burden yeah what is it this is dr alex delaware i called before yeah i know who you are is this a bad time its always a bad time your father suggested i talk to you about hol i know what its about lets set up an appointment then how much is he paying you we havent discussed that uhhuh doing the charity circuit you a schweitzer protégé i know youve been through a lot and cut he said dump the script and be straight you want to talk about holly im gonna be here all night anyway you might as well be my coffee break you show up anytime before say tenthirty you can have ten minutes not much but i sensed that ten minutes with this one would be interesting where are you located he rattled off an address in the sixteenthousand block of ventura boulevard heart of eucino at this time of day getting over the glen into the valley would take at least half an hour add another twenty minutes braving the slog on ventura and i figured id be able to make it within an hour returning to the city would be faster my date with linda was for eightthirty ample time i said ill be there within the hour like i said tenthirty ten minutes encino had been built up since the last time id been there it always seemed that way with encino pierce sloan and marder consulting actuaries benefits and pension specialists occupied the top floor of a narrow sevenstory pink limestone and mirroredglass rectangle squeezed between a medical building with a thai restaurant on the ground floor and a rollsroycejaguarland rover dealer the lobby was layered with rustcolored granite there were two elevators on the south wall both of them open i rode up alone stepped into a long hallway carpeted in gray plush and papered in white vinyl textured to look like troweled plaster track lights shone overhead mapplethorpe flower photos in lucite frames lined the walls looking disturbingly visceral in such a passionless place the main entrance was at the north end of the corridor through a floortoceiling wall of glass lettered in gilt that listed the partners of the actuarial firm and informed the uninitiated that pierce sloan and marder had branches in san francisco chicago atlanta and baltimore i counted twentytwo partners in the la office howard burdens name was fourth from the top not bad for a thirtyyearold with poor manners watch those value judgments delaware maybe but for grief he was the prince of charm on the other side of the glass the reception area was brightly lit and empty the door was bolted by a heavy slab of polished brass i knocked felt the glass tremble waited knocked again waited some more knocked harder so much for my ten minutes nothing like a drive into the valley at rush hour to get the old juices flowing just as i turned to leave one of the elevator doors opened and a man stepped out he was corpulent and walked with a flatfooted waddle fortyish fiveeleven totally bald on top thin brown hair fringing the sides florid skin a bushy brown mustache carelessly trimmed sixty extra pounds all of it soft most of it hanging over his belt gold buckle on the belt that glinted as he approached longsleeved white shirt doublepleated navy slacks black loafers a blue tie patterned with lavender squares and loosened at the neck all of it expensivelooking but it seemed as much a costume as dejon jonsons getup as if someone had dressed him up he huffed toward me using his arms the way racewalkers do carrying a ring of keys in one hand a wetlooking sandwich wrapped in cellophane in the other under the cellophane a wilted pickle clung to the sandwich for dear life you delaware his voice was deep slightly hoarse he rattled his keys the chain had a mercedesbenz logo his neck was furrowed and sweaty there was a grease spot on the pocket of his shirt just under the hjb monogram id been expecting someone who looked ten years younger trying to hide my surprise i said hello mr burden you said an hour its only been he raised the sandwich hand and flashed a gold rolex oysterfortyeight minutes he walked past me and unlocked the brass bolt letting the glass door fly back at me i caught it followed him to the right of the reception desk and around the walnut wall behind it was another ten yards of gray carpet he stopped at double doors gold letters on the left one said howard j burden ab ma fellow society of actuaries he pushed it open racewalked through an outer office and into a large walnutpaneled room not much wood showed through the walls were blanketed with diplomas certificates and photographs the desk was heavylooking very shiny and inlaid with elm burl bordered in ebony the desk top was shaped like the letter p and piled high with books magazines mail interoffice envelopes tilting piles of papers behind it was a highbacked blue leather chair behind that a credenza in the center of the credenza was an ibm pc on either side of the computer more clutter above the credenza a plateglass window offered a northern view the highrise profile of ventura boulevard dipping past housing tracts and minimalls and the stonecolored ribbon of the freeway vibrating like an enervated nerve fiber then onward toward the brown expanse past sylmar that stretched to the base of the santa susana mountains the mountaintops had begun to fade into evening wisps of cinnabar and silver from the west alluded to a glorious sunset that had never quite made it smog pigments pollution art howard burden saw me looking drew the drapes and sat down behind the desk shoving papers aside he began unwrapping his sandwich corned beef and sauerkraut on rye the bread halfsodden i looked for somewhere to sit the two chairs opposite his desk were filled with documents so was a long blue leather chesterfield couch running perpendicular to the window some of the stacks looked ready to topple the muddle and disarray lent the room a frantic but human energy so different from his fathers sterile sanctum i permitted myself some sidewalk psychoanalysis burden liberated the sandwich and took a big bite not bothering to swallow before saying just throw some of that shit on the floor i cleared one of the chairs and sat down he continued to eat using a paper napkin to dab at the sauerkraut juice that trailed down his chin i glanced over at the photos on the wall burden and a pleasantlooking blond woman with a penchant for sleeveless knit tops white slacks and topsiders she appeared to be around thirty in some of the shots he looked like her father about half the photos also featured a little girl of around five darkhaired eyeglasses on her too something familiar happy family poses smiles that seemed genuine disneyland sea world universal studios a water park miniature golf the three of them in frog hats both parents hugging the little girl she clutching an allday sucker eating ice cream cones together the little girl in a school play dressed as an elf graduating from kindergarten in a miniature cap and gown i realized what had struck me about her she resembled the drivers license picture milo had shown me a young holly with something to smile about i said you have a lovely family he put down his sandwich and crumpled his napkin in a pudgy fist look he said let me lay my cards on the table right now im doing this under duress my father is a complete and total asshole i dont like him okay any bullshit he may have handed you about him and me having anything in common is bullshit okay so the fact that youre working for him puts you immediately on my shit list youve got to work your way off which i doubt is possible because youre high on the list the only reason i agreed to see you is because he was calling the fucking office ten times a day bugging the shit out of my secretary and when she wouldnt put him through hounding gwen my wife at home i knew if i didnt give him his way hed drop in the way he did before making an ass out of himself embarrassing me six years ive been here three promotion parties plus an open house and he never showed up we havent goddam talked in five years amy hasnt seen a birthday gift from the bastard now all of a sudden he wants something here he is when was this his showing up about a month ago i was in a meeting he waltzed right past the secretary came in here sat and waited and played his goddam chamber music on a cassette deck for an hour anyone else she would have called security and had him thrown out on his ass which would have been okay with me but she didnt know that all she knew was that hes her bosss father what the fuck can she do so she let him stay and when i got here he made like it was nothing he fucking invades me and its nothing what did he want had i seen holly recently did holly seem upset to me as if he gave a shit ever cared about how anyone felt i told him i had no idea he tried to press me i told him i had no idea doing the old brokenrecord routine finally he got the point but he just kept hanging around trying to make conversation wasting my time pretending we were just buddybuddy good old dad so now when he calls ten fucking times here and at my house tells me youre gonna call i should meet with you give my insights about hollyinsights whats my choice say no and have another visit hes a fucking badger never listens never gives an inch my blood pressures no good under the best of circumstances so i opt to see you okay so lets do our ten minutes say we did it and get it the hell over with okay he opened his mouth wide and clamped it shut on the sandwich tore off a piece like a lion working at raw meat the other thing you need to understand he said is that i dont like psychiatrists or psychologists in the first place i think what you people do is total bullshit taking money from neurotic suckers and pretending to be their friends as if youd continue to smile and say uhhuh if the checks stopped coming pretending its science pretending you know something i read tons of psychiatric reports all the time insurance bullshit i consult to major corporations advising them on the costrisk patterns of setting up different kinds of healthcare systems three guesses who the biggest abusers are he pointed at me the grand inquisitor hundredandfiftybuckanhour bills for adjustment reactions stress syndrome all kinds of ambiguous crap workers comp ripoffs my standard advice to companies is stay away from mental health benefits corruptions the name of the game company plan pays for inpatient care tons of employees get hospitalized switch over to outpatient benefits and all of a sudden every local shrink becomes a big fan of office therapy funny thing about that huh real scientific youre right i said that kind of thing goes on all the time and it stinks he pulled the sandwich away from his mouth and hefted it like a football for a moment i thought he was going to throw it at me that supposed to disarm me convince me youre a righteous guy im not trying to convince you of anything i said fact is i dont even know what im doing here youre here because mahlon burden manipulated you here guess that makes two of us who have trouble telling him no his fingers tightened around the sandwich turning it into something misshapen and doughy sauerkraut and juice leaked out and plopped onto the desk he picked up a shred of pickled cabbage and put it in his mouth chewed absently and licked the edges of his mustache and suddenly looked lost a sad soft fat kid left out of the game once again im sorry i said i know this is a shitty time for you and i dont want to make it worse weve both been manipulated theres no need to go on i blame him he said for holly for holly for everything for this pinching a roll of fat for my mother she should have been taken to the hospital as soon as she started bleeding and shitting blood the toilet bowl was white and she turned it red i still remember that ill never forget it everything was coming out of her she was in pain any idiot could have seen she needed medical attention but as usual he knew best told her all she needed was bed rest to take it easy he didnt take her in until she passed out why he doesnt like doctors doesnt trust them can always do better himself can do anything better than anyone his face was heated greasy with sweat scowling and squinting like that of a prizefighter taking punishment punished by his rage as far as im concerned he said he fucking killed her i was sixteen should have had a drivers license should have been able to drive her to the hospital myself but he wouldnt let me learn to drive until i was eighteen said i wasnt mature enough he kept holly waiting until she was nineteen his eyes bulged and his soft belly shook his fists were big and meaty and the sandwich was no more than a doughball he looked at it and dropped it in the trash i said he told me a different story about your mother routine surgery gone wrong medical malpractice the only malpractice was his spousal malpractice too bad you cant sue for that by the time they got her to the operating room shed lost too much blood and her electrolytes were all screwed up she went into shock and never came out i know because i used my connections a couple of years ago to pull her chart he slammed his fist down on the desk sure he told you a different story he lies without blinking tells you one thing one minute then denies he said it a minute later or maybe to him its not a lie maybe he really believes the bullshit he spins for himself i dont know even after all these years i dont know and i dont give a fuck what i do know is that hes a selfish asshole who cares only for himself and is into power trips total control he has to control everyone and everything call the shots when i lived at home i was a prisoner the way i dressed what i ate everything had to pass his fucking muster moving out was like being reborn what about holly my sister was the worst kind of prisoner solitary confinement he looked startled i said its the phrase that came to me when i saw her room his eyes moistened yeah a fucking life sentence at least i had the ability to get myself out of there she didnt no skills sheswas one step above retarded which was perfect for him soon as she finished high school he fired the maid used holly to clean the house did holly object holly didnt object to anything was he ever inappropriate with her his eyebrows rose what do you mean sexually inappropriate overtly abusive he shook his head you guys have that on the brain then his face tensed with anger why do you know something no i said quickly nothing at all then whyd you ask that i phrased my words carefully they lived an isolated life which is consistent in abuse situations he used her as a cleaning woman it seemed almost marital dont go smearing us burden said weve been through enough i wasnt planning to let me make one thing clear if my name or the name of anyone in my family shows up in any report you write for him or anyone else ill fucking sue you with the full weight of this corporation behind me and if you mention anything to him that gets him hassling me about anything ill personally take it out of your hide i may look like some fat fuck but i can benchpress two hundred okay he raised his shoulders and pounded the desk for emphasis that clear i said im not writing anything up and i came here to talk about your sister not you that shook him he rolled his knuckles on the desk gorillalike then sank low in his chair several moments passed before he spoke before you showed up i told myself i was going to give you diddly maintain my dignity and here i go pushing the mebuttons he gave a sick smile god im turning into him i doubt it i said looking pointedly at the photos on the wall what youve created for yourself looks a hell of a lot different from what you grew up with he covered his eyes with one hand theyre the best he said in a choked voice i cant let this affect them i understand do you do you know what its like for a sixyearold to walk out of her house and have reporters scream at her to have kids at school taunt her about her aunt shooting at children i had to move both of them out of town i was just thinking about bringing them back i cant let this change them cant let him into our lives of course not i said the narcissism would be destructive he nodded thats exactly what my therapist called him narcissistic personality disorder sees himself as the center of the world like a threeyearold whos never grown up incurable i shouldnt expect him ever to change my choice was either learn to accept him or stay away from him at first i thought i could learn get some kind of casually friendly thing going but after i met gwen and her family saw the way families should be it made me realize what hed done to all of us how truly fucked hed been it made me hate him more i listened to all of it but two words rang in my ear my therapist burden saw my incredulous look smiled and shrugged mines different he said one of the good ones straight shooter i started seeing him back in college the counseling center i was having stomachaches thought i was going to die the way my mother did he was doing volunteer work never earned a cent took him two years to fix me up then he booted me out into the real world hes retired now lives down in del mar plays golf once in a while i get down there dr george goldberg i didnt recognize the name he didnt know you either i called him and asked him about you he asked around looked you up said your credentials were good you seemed to have a decent reputation otherwise i wouldnt have agreed to see you blood pressure or no blood pressure did dr goldberg ever meet your father no the bastard never knew i was seeing anyone otherwise he would have done something to stop it or take it over now hes hired you pretty funny huh sweet fucking ironies of life i dont know what he told you i said but im not working for him havent taken a penny from him and dont intend to i got involved because the police asked me to help the kids at the school cope with the aftermath of the sniping he said yeah the kids howre they doing theyre doing all right but the idea of a total stranger a girl shooting at them is still baffling to them so when your father offered me the chance to learn something about holly i took it holly he said he stared at his desk and shook his head i know what she did was evil if my kid had been out in that yard id have wanted to kill her myself but i still feel sorry for her i cant help it thats understandable do you have any idea why she did it he shook his head ive been racking my brain gwen and i both have i mean holly was weird she was always weird but never violent not that i knew her well so many years between us we never had a damn thing in common never had any kind of a relationship she didnt cling the way other little sisters do she always went her own way doing her own thing and he was always comparing us holding me up to her as an example driving a wedge between us what was her own thing sitting in her room listening to the goddam radio and dancing in circles crazylooking i used to be embarrassed about her she was dull i didnt want anyone to know she was my sister he gave a sick smile now its out huh i smiled and nodded he said gwen has four brothers shes very close to all of them she couldnt understand how a brother and sister could be total strangers then when she met him she understood how he kept us separate always had to control us the hell of it is that recently we were trying to change things gwen initiated it she invited holly over tried to get to know her better also to get holly away from him gradually out of her shell she was willing to put the time into holly in some ways whats happened has been harder on her than me you had holly over to your house yes just a few times maybe three or four when was this this summer august september we made sure to invite her when he was gone he travels a lot visiting his suppliers the business is his fucking life his real kid that fucking asshole graff he created his own personal frankenstein doll we knew if he found out hed try to fuck it up and on top of that gwen refuses to have him anywhere near amy we didnt even want to call because for all we know hes got the phones tapped hes a real gadget freak loves all that paranoid hightech stuff still reliving his spook days in the army he was a spy some sort of intelligence work supposedly hed hint around at it then if i asked him refuse to talk about it i cant get into that howard sadistic always on a fucking power trip he told me he was in cryptography demographics like i said he lies maybe he made all of it up was a fucking latrine cleaner anyway gwen drove by the house until she caught holly out in front taking out the garbage she tried to strike up a conversation told holly to call us next time he was out of town a few weeks went by we didnt think shed follow through but then she did we had her over for sunday dinner turkey chestnut stuffing one thing i did remember is shed always loved turkey howd it go it wasnt a bundle of laughs if thats what you mean not much conversation holly mostly sat and listened to the three of us talk watched amy play with her dolls never joined in much then we put on music and she danced a little she wasnt very graceful but then she and amy started to do it together and they danced the next few times she came over amys very bright she was the one leading holly the two of them actually seemed to be getting along well like peers amys a very kind child shed never make fun she knew holly was strange but she never said anything about it just danced with her gwen and i both thought we were making some progress but then holly stopped calling just like that we couldnt figure out why said to hell with him and tried phoning got his fucking machine so gwen started driving by again waited for a time when his car was gone and knocked on the door holly answered gwen said she looked terrible haggard as if someone had died gwen tried to talk to her but she shut her out kept wringing her hands and talking nonsense what kind of nonsense saying stuff over and over again gibberish wanna see or wanna say wanna see too too or maybe it was two who gives a fuck doesnt make much sense either way does it gwen tried to get her to explain but holly got agitated and ran back inside the house gwen followed her in holly had gone to the gun closet pulled out a rifle that freaked gwen out she left in a hurry and called me we talked about it figured holly had had some kind of breakdown her grabbing the gun really had us worried shed always hated his guns never went near them we called the police anonymously told them a disturbed person had access to firearms and gave them the address they asked if the disturbed person had either been certified disturbed or had actually threatened someone with the gun we said no they said then they couldnt do anything unless we went to recognizance court and convinced the judge she was a danger to herself and others even then all we could get would be a seventytwohour hold and he was sure to fight that so we ended up doing nothing because of amy we didnt want her exposed to any craziness to courts and shrinks and him and we stopped trying to get closer to holly when did this happen grabbing the gun last month a couple of weeks before he hung his head so what happened is no big surprise is it she was obviously having violent thoughts and no one took them seriously i keep wondering if i could have prevented it not likely i said did you tell the police any of this what the hell for drag my family into more shit get my name in the papers again besides the guy they sent down looked like a fucking actor couldnt have cared less lieutenant frisk yeah that was him i remember thinking what an asshole trying to stare me down obviously considered himself hot shit kept harping on was she a member of any subversive groups thats a laugh huh holly joining the fucking red brigade he shook his head no we havent talked about it the guns to anyone gwen still cant talk about it any of it shes convinced its her fault here she is the kindest person who ever walked this earth and shes blaming herself i said the kind ones always do maybe you and she should take a trip down to del mar risking his anger by giving advice but he said maybe in a defeated voice i wish there was some way to turn back the clock i know its a fucking cliché but it would make life a helluva lot easier wouldnt it he covered his face again gave a loud sigh i said do you remember when it was that holly stopped calling september late september right after ike novatos murder terrible haggard as if someone had died i said did she have any friends none that i ever saw did she ever mention the name novato he moved his hand from his face no whos that someone who may have been a friend he delivered groceries for dinwiddies market we know he and holly had at least a few casual conversations is that what he says he doesnt say anything hes dead how murdered last september just around the time holly started pulling away from you murd oh jesus you think thats what tipped her over its possible youre saying this novato meant something to her maybe your father says no what he says means fucking diddlysquat who is was this novato what kind of person people who knew him say he was a nice kid smart black ted dinwiddie thought highly of him he was dinwiddies delivery boy he smiled black that makes sense back in high school ted dinwiddie used to be our local flaming radical now hes a businessman probably feeling guilty about it hiring a black kid is something he would have done and felt nervous about the anxiety would have assuaged his guilt he was silent for several moments seemed to be lost in memories before the silence could curdle i said what are your fathers political views i dont know that he has any hes a fucking mahlonicrat worships himself fuck everyone else when holly came over did she ever talk politics nothing like i told you she barely said anything at all why whats this all about who killed novato its unsolved howd it happen i considered how much to tell him when i didnt answer right away he moved forward and said look ive opened myself up to you maybe ill feel better for it tomorrow maybe not but the point is i didnt hold back and i dont really know you from shit so if youve got something to tell me something i can bring home to gwen help her make sense of it i need to know it i fucking deserve it i told him about novatos death in the alley and sophie gruenbergs disappearance mentioned nothing of smiths suspicion that the two of them had been involved in dope talked about gruenbergs radical politics and resurrected my theory that holly had been motivated by some sort of twisted political impulse aiming at massengil i had nothing to back that up but the therapist in me had taken over i wanted to make burden feel better it worked he thought for a long time then said it makes it a little easier to take that she wasnt going for the kids that in some crazy fuckedup way she had a goal friends people who cared about her he turned away looked at the images of his wife and his daughter we wanted to be her friends that was the whole point to get to know her reconnect make up for lost time salvage something but you cant do that can you it just doesnt fucking work that way does it ten minutes had stretched to more than an hour when i got up to leave burden was so subdued he looked drowsy and the hand that i shook was wet and limp i left him at his desk and walked to the elevator outside the air had stayed warm and though it reeked of exhaust i was happy to draw it into my lungs happy to get away from the hatred and rage that had filled his office like swamp gas i thought i understood now why mahlon burden had been so eager for me to speak with his son howard had shut him out the two of them had no communication but if howard talked to me i could pass along what i learned to the old man shrink as modem thats my main talent i do know how to put things together and howard had talked id learned a lot more than id expected but nothing i was going to report to burden i reviewed it as i drove holly had deteriorated psychologically shortly after ike novatos death handled the rifle shed ultimately taken to the storage shed wanna see wanna say wanna see or say too or was it two see two what probably just gibberish not worth interpreting what relationship if any was there to novatos death gruenbergs disappearance i began to doubt if id ever really understand what had led holly to that shed nothing like that feeling of competence as i turned back onto the glen i was determined to put all of it out of my mind think good thoughts think about linda about kissing her i got home at sevenforty she arrived an hour later wearing a pink dress and sandals her hair loose and sungold the first kiss was long and deep and i felt as if i was giving myself over to it completely but when it ended she said you feel tense everything okay just a little tired and hungry still up for mexican you bet my treat not necessary dont worry she rubbed my shoulder when we do spago youll pay just as we made it to the door the phone rang she said go ahead i took it in the living room alex its me robins voice oh hi hi you all right sure fine how about you fine im just waiting for some glue to set thought id call and touch base i appreciate that howre you great real busy as usual as usual linda had taken out her compact and was looking in the mirror robin said so so linda looked up i smiled at her and she smiled back alex is this a bad time no i was just on my way out anywhere special dinner hey she said feel like picking up a pizza and dropping by for old times sake that would be difficult oh she said going out going out uhhuh oh sorry ill let you go bye i said wait is everything really okay with you great really and theres someone round these quarters too nothing cosmic at this point but the indicators are good im glad okay she said i just wanted to touch base glad youre okay be well take care of yourself you too bye bye linda said nothing as we walked out to the car i drove to sunset cruised past the freeway onramp listening to miles davis a few moments later she turned down the radio and said her i nodded you didnt have to rush things for my benefit no sense in dragging it out okay i said its over but were still dealing with some of the friendship residue sure makes sense a moment later shes beautiful what do you mean i found a picture of her this morning in your library face down on one of the bookshelves oh dont be mad she said i wasnt snooping im not mad what happened is i woke up early thought id get something to read and found it while i was looking through your books at least i assume its her long curly hair kind of rustycolored really good figure beautiful wide dark eyes the two of you standing in front of some kind of lake the lagoon at uc santa cruz i remembered the trip the motel wed stayed at rumpled sheets walks in the mountains its an old picture i said i didnt know i still had it nothing wrong if you had kept it on purpose im not one for souvenirs i am she said ive still got pictures of mondo in one of my scrapbooks before everything went bad what does that say about me psychologically uhuh i shook my head off duty no outoftheoffice interpretations you dont have a proper office need i say more she smiled anyway she is beautiful she is and its over you said that already got in the habit of saying it i said trying to convince myself it eventually worked would you hate me if i asked how and why how is she went on a trial separation that stretched to something permanent i fought it tried to persuade her to come back by the time shed changed her mind id changed mine why is she felt i was smothering her overpowering her shed grown up with an overpowering father needed to stretch her wings try things out by herself im not trying to make it sound corny or clichéd there was validity to it and now she wants you back no like i said its just the friendship residue linda didnt answer we drove for a while smothering she said i dont see you that way at all im not the same guy i was a year ago the whole thing made me take a good look at myself not that id like that myself she said being smothered somehow i dont see you as smotherable oh you fought for your stripes a long time ago linda no ones going to take them away from you think im pretty tough do you in a good way i think you can handle yourself she put her hand on the back of my neck ooh even tighter sorry for making you talk about it what a nosy nancy i am nosy nancy its a regionalism from what region my apartment there i got you to smile but this neck its like hardwood she moved closer began kneading i felt her warmth and her strength coming from those soft hands the ones id thought passive when i first met her she said hows that fantastic id trade dinner for about an hour of it tell you what she said first we pig out on mexican food then we return to either your place or mine i give you a real texas massage and then you can smother me you just forget about all the ugliness and the complications and you smother me to your little hearts content it ended up being my place we were in bed when the phone rang lying naked in the darkness listening to gershwins own rendition of rhapsody in blue holding hands i said jesus what time is it twenty after eleven i picked up the receiver milo said hi whats up from the nuance of irritation in your voice might i infer that this is a bad time i said you just keep getting better and better at the old detecting game someone with you uhhuh blondie i hope none of your good its her i want to talk to put her on puzzled i handed the receiver to linda its milo for you she said for me and took it hello detective sturgis what is it oh youre sure thats great how did you oh that was lucky you think so okay sounds interesting i guess if you really think so okay ill be there thanks she reached across me and hung up the phone her breasts grazed my lips reflexively i nibbled she pulled away and said want to go for a ride a street named fiesta drive no fog tonight in the moonlight the magnolias looked like paper cutout trees the house was tidylooking no different from any of the others on the block an oldsmobile cutlass was parked in the driveway behind it the low black cigar of a firebird trans am on the firebirds rear bumper was a sticker with the call letters of a heavymetal radio station and another that said life is a beach the front door smelled of fresh paint the bell chimed out the first seven notes of battle hymn of the republic a worried looking heavyset woman in her fifties opened the door on the fifth note she had on mossgreen slacks and a white blouse and was barefoot her round face was pale under a crown of babyblue hair rollers her jawline had lost the battle with gravity linda said im dr overstreet the woman trembled and said im theyre wont you come in please we stepped into a living room identical in size and trim and layout to the one in the burden house this one was painted buttercupyellow with contrasting white moldings and furnished with a skirted floral chintz sofa and matching chairs a brown corduroy recliner goldenmaple end tables and shiny white ceramic lamps prints of pleinair landscapes and still lifes favoring fruit and fish hung on the walls along with a bronze zodiac wheel and an old christmas wreath the fireplace had been bricked up and painted white a model schooner fashioned of roughedged copper sheeting and brass wire sat on the hearth a darkcomplected man with sharp features sat on the recliner but he wasnt relaxed he had thinning black hair whitening at the temples a drawn lanternjawed face that sagged orienting downward as surely as a dowsing rod he wore a tshirt and gray slacks under a plaid pendleton robe terrycloth slippers on white blueveined feet his arms rested on the sides of the recliner the hands clenching and unclenching milo stood across from him to the left of the sofa a boy of around sixteen or seventeen sat right below him the boy was big in a soft bulky way with thick formless white arms extending from the rolled sleeves of a peagreen patchpocketed tshirt around his pudgy wrists were nailheadstudded leather bands his black jeans were tucked into chainheeled wellington boots a massive stainlesssteel deathshead ring dominated his left hand his right hand shielded his face what little i could see of his countenance was puffy not yet fully formed under dark hair cut close to the scalp fuzzy approximations of sideburns ran down cheeks speckled with pimples and dipped an inch below his earlobes he didnt look up at our entrance just continued to do what hed obviously been doing for a while crying milo said evening dr overstreet and dr delaware these are the buchanans mr and mrs the man and woman gave miserable nods and this is matthew he did the artwork on your car the boy cried louder his father said cut that the hell out at least face up to it and dont be a coward goddammit the boy continued to cry buchanan shot up and walked to the couch a big soft man he took hold of the boys wrists and yanked them away the boy bent low tried to bury his face between his knees his father reached under and forced his head upward gripping him by the jaw you look at them goddammit face up to it or itll be even worse for you i promise the boys face was pasty and snotsmeared his mouth lopsided and grotesque in his fathers grasp he clenched his eyes shut buchanan swore mrs buchanan took a step toward her son her husbands eyes warned her off his hand tightened the boy yelped in pain easy said milo he touched buchanans arm the man stared at him furiously then backed off sit down sir said milo gently buchanan returned to the recliner drawing his robe around him and looking away from the rest of us milo said matt this is dr overstreet principal of the hale school but you probably know that dont you the boy stared at linda terrified then clamped his eyes shut linda said hello matthew the boy buried his face again his father whipped around and said say it the boy mumbled something buchanan was up in a flash his right arm shot out and the boys head snapped back mrs buchanan cried out milo said thats enough sit down buchanan put his hands on his hips and stared at milo i want him to say it pete said his wife her husband pointed a finger at her you keep the hell out of this mr buchanan said milo lets not make things worse than they are why dont you just sit down ida been listened to in the first place buchanan said thereda been no trouble he did it hes got to face up to it no more coddling he tried to stare down milo gave up and glowered at his wife milo said youre absolutely right sir face up is exactly what he needs to do so lets give him a chance to do that buchanan looked at his son say it the boy choked out a sorry between sobs sorry maam barked his father sorry maam he really is said mrs buchanan looking at linda hes never done anything like this before and never

never had to take any goddam responsibility for himself pete please dont pete please me said buchanan just stop getting in the way and let me handle this the way it should have been handled a long time ago he extended a pair of big white hairy fists his wife bit her lip and turned away the boy had stopped crying long enough to follow the parental skirmish buchanan senior turned his back on him and approached linda his lip was quivering and i noticed that one eye drooped lower than the other maam ive got a presidents last name i believe in this country a deep belief weve got soldiers in our family going way back generations i did my time in korea active duty got the papers to prove it so we sure dont encourage any nazi talk around here he musta picked it up on that crap he plays all the time rock videos which is long gone from this house thats for sure an angry look over his shoulder the boy covered his face again dont you dare when im talking to you shouted his father face up goddammit he turned and moved toward his son milo got between them im going to have to insist that you sit sir now buchanan tightened then let out breath milos face was a police mask buchanan muttered then returned to the recliner picked up the previous days newspaper from an end table and pretended to be interested in the sports section his wifes heavy face was ripe with humiliation milo said dr overstreet if you want to press charges ill have matt arrested and taken in the boy started crying again his mother followed suit mr buchanan looked at both of them with revulsion linda walked over to the sofa and studied the boy he tried to avoid her gaze sniffled and wiped his nose with his sleeve she said why matt fidget shrug thats important for me to know before i decide what to do whyd you do

her mouth oh christ said her husband blanching you goddam little moron people have opinions this is america for christs sake you express an opinion youre supposed to speak your mind thats what

adult to matt were talking heavy jail time son hell cooperate said his mother ill see that he linda said matt you understand whats going on yeah yes maam i will i im really sorry it was dumb then im willing to give you a chance mrs buchanan poured out copious thanks mr buchanan seemed to sag in his chair looking older smaller the strain of macho pretense lifted from tired shoulders he said youre one lucky camper mister and you havent heard from me yet outside at the curb milo said i had nothing to do tonight went driving saw his car circle the block real slowly about ninethirty slow down further when he reached the school third time he came around i decided to put the cherry on my roof and stop him he had the crowbar right there on the seat dumb kid he nearly browned his pants when he saw me linda said you heard the mother all those school problems just like holly i said but they didnt know each other milo said i worked him over on that with extreme thoroughness he has no record no membership in any gangs or groups so it looks like this is the only mischief hes been into or caught at lindas back was to him he raised an eyebrow wanting to know how much id told her i gave a tiny shake of my head said maybe you nipped a criminal career in the bud his career wouldnt have lasted long the dumb ones are the ones we catch anyway time to be shoving off sorry for waking you but i thought youd want to know i did she said im glad you called do you think i did the right thing seems as good an option as any the juvenile system takes over on something like this were talking stern lecture maybe if you got a real kickass judge a week at the honor farm and exposure to some people he doesnt need to be exposed to but if he screws up again let me know i can always pull a few fast ones procedurally speaking and scare the bejesus out of him linda said okay and thanks again he said bon soir saluted and walked off good man said linda no argument there we went back to my place and found we were too wound up to sleep i located a deck of cards in a kitchen drawer and we bored ourselves with a few hands of poorattentionspan gin finally turned off the lights and dozed lying close to each other the next morning i drove her back to her apartment and went up with her she changed into a lilaccolored suit picked up her rental car in the subterranean garage and drove to school i ran a few errands then drove there myself bits of streamers still clung to the chain link otherwise the grounds were quiet almost ghostly morningafter blues i waited in lindas office while she checked to see if any adjustment problems had cropped up in the aftermath of the concert a few teachers reported some unruliness but nothing they couldnt handle at noon i stopped in with those teachers and having convinced myself everything was going smoothly left at pm mahlon burden called any progress dr delaware i met with your son last night excellent and he had nothing new to offer about holly but he did say you visited him about a month ago you were concerned about her pause yes thats true i knew howard had been sneaking her over to his house he and his wife thought i didnt know but of course i did since they were spending more time together i thought he might be able to tell me why shed been looking sad sad withdrawn uncommunicative more than usual when did that start let me think back late september or the beginning of october i remember because my fall catalogue had just gone out excuse me for not mentioning it when you were at the house but with everything thats been going on the memories it slipped by i havent been functioning at full capacity did you suspect her contact with howard was causing the withdrawal i didnt suspect anything doctor i was simply trying to develop hypotheses now of course youve provided me with one the death of the black boy that occurred late september he and holly may have been closer than i thought what else do you know about him other than that he was a drug user some people who knew him doubt he was a drug user people ted dinwiddie ted dinwiddie burden gave a small laugh not exactly an einstein that one howard used to do his homework for him where was novato killed south la south la before the riot we used to call it watts never could understand that people burning down their own homes fouling their own nests did your detective friend mention which gang he belonged to theres no evidence he belonged to any gang in this city drugs means gangs he said or at least thats what they say what else can you tell me about him thats it all right then whats next on our agenda mr burden i havent learned anything that would vindicate holly and to be honest i dont see myself moving in that direction pause thats very disappointing doctor but he didnt sound disappointed or surprised have you considered talking to members of novatos family delving into his background he was from back east didnt have family out here and frankly mr burden i dont see that as being helpful in terms of what you want whys that doctor there just doesnt seem to be any connection to holly silence on the other end im sorry i said i dont see anywhere to take the evaluation that would fulfill your needs he said im sorry you feel that way why dont you come over again the two of us can put our heads together develop some hypotheses maybe in a while i said im a little tied up now i see he said but youre not closing the door no i said the doors never closed good pause quite a ruckus down by the school yesterday papers said councilman latch brought in a rock singer to entertain the children making political hay bales of it why not he said seize the moment next thing you know theyll be dancing on my daughters grave an hour later milo called and i told him of my meeting with howard burden described the mental deterioration howard had seen in his sister after novatos death her holding the rifle wanna see two he said whatd she wanna see two of no idea hmm he said how bout wanna see two people dead massengil and someone else latch could be he said two shitbirds with one stone talk about your civic responsibility or maybe she was planning to do massengil at the school head off somewhere else for victim number two its not unusual for these nutcases to have elaborate plans delusions but i dont have to tell you that do i anyway all this does is firm up the loneassassin picture puts her hands on the weapon a good two weeks before the shooting shows premeditation she was mentally shaky to begin with got stressed out by novatos death became unglued spent a month and a half building up anger going to the gun rack getting the feel of the thing then boom howm i doing psychologically good enough its not gonna sound too good to daddy i just spoke to him put him on hold till when indefinite didnt have the heart to cut him off ive got nothing to offer him i said but for all i know his defenses are about to come tumbling down i wanted to go easy thought you didnt like the guy i dont but that doesnt alter my responsibility besides the guys pathetic got nothing left in the way of family his son hates him its obvious he just wanted me to talk to him because theres no communication between them so i went easy interesting said milo what is having a job where youve got to be watching yourself all the time caring about peoples feelings part of your job too sometimes he said but mostly the people i care about are dead speaking of which i got in touch with santa monica college novato did register for summer session but he dropped out after a week long enough to get his name listed at the employment center thats what i thought too probably why he registered in the first place no id no references would have been hard to find a job dinwiddie would have liked the student thing he yearns for school days my question milo said is why novato would want a lowpaying job if he was selling dope a cover smith said they were getting sophisticated maybe be that as it may i dont know that any of it is worth pursuing my source at the holocaust center flies in from chicago this afternoon got an appointment down there at five thats the last thing im gonna do on it ever been there no you should see it everyone should im free at five you drive scaffolding and an enclosed wooden perimeter marked a construction zone next to a twostory building made of white brick and black marble thats the museum said milo house of tolerance they just broke ground last month traffic was congested for a halfblock radius around the site motors groaned clay dust billowed hammer thuds and saw whines rose above the combustive groan of idling engines a hard hat in an orange vest stood in the middle of pico directing a crane as it backed up onto the boulevard a female traffic cop whistled and whitegloved a steadily building herd of autos into submission milo leaned toward the center of the seville and looked in the rearview mirror a moment later he looked again i said what is it nothing his eyes swept back and forth come on milo its nothing he said a while back i thought someone might be on our tail its probably nothing probably dont get in an uproar he sat back whered you see it just before motor near fox studios probably my imagination there doesnt seem to be anyone back there now but its too stacked up to be sure maybe it wasnt your imagination ive had the same feeling a couple of times the last week that so i also put it down to imagination probably was probably like i said alex dont get in an uproar even if there was someone most likely it was the department why do you say that the car plymouth sedan flat gray blackwall tires radio antennae except for the narcs and all their confiscated hot rods the department hasnt discovered special effects why would the department be following us not us me maybe i stepped on someones toes got big feet he wiggled his brogans i said frisk he shrugged yeah i suppose its kennys type of game but it could be anyone my personas never that grata but what about the ones who followed me guilt by association ones how many were there two both times first in a brown toyota then some kind of sedan male and female the second time i think sounds kind of imaginative for the department when and whered it happen both times were at night coming out of restaurants the first time i was by myself in santa monica the second was this past sunday night with linda melrose near labrea how long did they stay with you not long i told him about driving into the gas station to avoid the brown toyota he smiled flashy move doubleseven they show any signs of noticing you after you pulled into the station no just drove right by what about the second time i shook my head i pulled off onto a side street and they were gone doesnt sound like much of a tail he said and no similarities to the one i just saw this was one guy male cauc standard issue and he didnt just stay right on our tail he hung back the way they teach you in cop school thats what caught my eye the spacing professionalism a civilian would have missed it i could have easily missed it even now im not sure it wasnt some guy just happening to be driving by if the department was bothering to run a twoman tail chances are the second guy would have been in another car doing an ab your guys on the other hand were obvious as hell you saw em didnt you which leads me to believe they werent tailing yon so all in all id vote for imagination alex yours is real mines baloney just keeping a sane perspective he said mines probably baloney too he sat back made a show of stretching his legs and yawning the crane was finally gone and we advanced as i turned the corner milo checked out the cars that sped by nothing he said forget the whole thing we parked in the visitors lot in back of the center and walked around to the front entrance after passing through a metal detector we signed in with a plainclothes guard in an open booth he was young sharpfeatured with cropped black hair a strong chin and hard eyes milo showed id and said were here to see judy baumgartner wait please said the guard some kind of accent he stepped back several feet and made a call israeli said milo since the swastikas they use exsecretservice guys as security very stubborn they can be a real pain in the ass to deal with but they get the job done the guard returned to the counter shell be a few minutes you can wait up there he pointed to a short open flight of stairs above it was a landing backed with a blackandwhite mural of wideeyed faces frightened faces it reminded me of the tv broadcast the day of the sniping milo said how about we look at the exhibit the guard shrugged sure we took the open stairs clown to the basement level dark hallway the sounds of typing and ringing phones a few people traveled the corridor purposeful busy to the right of the stairs was a black door marked exhibit in small steel letters temporary he said until the museums done he opened the door to a room about thirty feet square paneled gallerywhite graycarpeted and very cool photo blowups lined the walls milo began walking i followed the first picture storm troopers kicking and beating elderly jews on the streets of munich the second stolidlooking citizens marching with placards raus mit euch dreckige juden i stopped caught my breath went on a jackbooted peakcapped soldier not more than nineteen or twenty using tin snips to cut the beard of a terrified grandfather as other soldiers look on in glee the shattered and defaced storefronts of postkristallnacht berlin swastikas posters in crude gothic lettering gutted buildings shattered faces a triptych midway down the first wall made me stop even as milo kept walking a winter scene forest of monumental conifers atop gently rolling snow dunes in the foreground a row of naked men and women huddled in front of trench graves some still held shovels dozens of emaciated physiques cavedin chests shriveled genitals victims obscenely bare amid the frosty beauty of the bavarian countryside behind the prisoners a dozen ss men armed with carbines next photo the troopers raise weapons to shoulder an officer holds a baton most of the diggers keep their backs turned but one woman has shifted to face the soldiers screaming openmouthed a darkeyed blackhaired woman her breasts shrunken her pubic thatch a dark wound in white flesh then bodies heaps of them filling the trenches merging with the snow one soldier bayonets a corpse i forced myself to move on closeups of barbed wire iron fangs a sign in german a shred of something clinging to the fangs snarling dogs a blowup of a document columns of numbers straight margins beautifully printed neat as an accountants ledger opposite each column handscripted words bergenbelsen gotha buchenwald dachau dortmund auschwitz landsberg maidanek treblinka opposite each name a number code body count so many digits a horrific arithmetic more snowywhite images bleached bones piles of them femurs and tibias and finger bones white as piano keys pelvic cradles stripped raw yawning rib cages scraps and fragments rendered unidentifiable a mountain of bones sitting on a base of dust and grit an incomprehensible everest of bones landscaped with jawless skulls my stomach lurched another enlarged document multisyllabic german words a translating caption processing procedures the final solution compulsively detailed lists of those bound for the refuse heap jews gypsies subversives homosexuals i looked over at milo he was across the room his back to me hands in pockets hunched and bulky and predatory as a bear out on a night forage i kept walking looking a display case of zyldon b poisongas canisters another containing a shredded striped uniform of coarse cloth little children in cloth caps and braids herded onto trains bewildered tearstreaked tiny hands reaching out for mother love faces pressed against a train window another group of children in spotless school uniforms marching beneath a swastika banner giving a straightarmed salute black gallows against a cloudy sky bodies dangling from them their feet barely touching the ground a caption explaining that the scaffolding had been specially constructed with short drops so that death from slow strangulation was prolonged guard towers more barbed wire spooling miles of it brick ovens pallets of charred caked matter fat complacent cats licking at a pile of it tiled laboratories that resembled autopsy rooms sinks full of glassware humanoid things on tables a paragraph describing the science of the third reich icewater experiments eyecolor experiments artificialinsemination experiments crossspecies breeding experiments benzine injections to harden the arteries surgery without anesthesia to study the limits of pain tolerance twin studies dwarf studies authoritativelooking men in white coats bearing scalpels like weapons rows of graves outside a sanitarium milo and i had come face to face when i saw the moisture in his eyes i realized mine were wet too my throat felt as if it had been stuffed with dirt i wanted to say something but the thought of speaking hurt my chest i turned away from him and dried my eyes the gallery door opened a woman came in and said hi milo sorry to keep you waiting cheer in her voice it jolted me like an icewater bath she was in her mid to late forties tall and slim with a long neck and a smallish oval face her hair was short gray and feathered she had on a silk print dress in mauves and blues and mauve suede shoes her badge said j baumgartner senior researcher milo shook her hand thanks for seeing me on short notice judy for you anything milo if i look a wreck its from sitting at ohare for four hours waiting to take off place is a zoo she looked perfectly put together milo said this is alex delaware alex judy baumgartner she smiled good to meet you alex mile said hes never been here before well then a special welcome any impressions im glad i saw it my voice was strained she nodded we left the gallery and followed her down the hall to a small room furnished with four gray metal desks arranged in a square three of them were occupied by young people two females and a male of college age poring over manuscripts and notating she greeted them and they said hi and went back to work the walls were filled with bookcases of the same gray metal a cardboard box sat atop the unoccupied desk judy baumgartner said theres a meeting going on in my office so this will have to do she sat behind the desk with the box milo and i pulled up chairs she pointed to the box ikes stuff i had my secretary go into the library card catalogue and pull everything hed checked out this is it thanks said milo ive got to tell you she said im still pretty shaken when i got the message in chicago that you needed to see me i thought it was going to be something about hate crimes or maybe even some progress on kaltenblud then when i got back and janie told me what you wanted she shook her head he was such a nice kid milo friendly dependablereally dependable thats why when he stopped showing up for work i was really surprised tried to find the number hed given me when he applied to volunteer but it was gone must have gotten thrown out space is at a premium stuff gets thrown out all the time im sorry milo said he worked here yes didnt janie tell you no all i knew was hed checked out books done some research he did research for me milo for over two months never missed a day he was one of my steadiest ones really dedicated his suddenly dropping out bothered me it wasnt like him i asked the other volunteers if they knew what had happened to him but they didnt he hadnt made friends kept to himself i tried to get a number for him but he wasnt listed finally after a couple of weeks of his not showing up i put it down to impetuous youth figured id overrated his maturity i never expected never knew howd it happen milo milo told her about the shooting told her it had taken place in a dope alley but left out the toxicology report she frowned he sure didnt seem like a druggie to me if any kid was lucid and straight it was ike unusually straight almost too serious for his age he had a really crisp mind still people can maintain cant they when did he start volunteering late april walked in off the street and announced he wanted to help goodlooking kid fire in his eyes passion he reminded me of the way students used to be during the sixties not that i greeted him with open arms i wanted to make sure he was stable not just caught up in some impulsive thing and frankly i was taken by surprise we dont get much interest from nonjewish kids and with all the blackjewish tension lately the last thing i expected was a black kid wanting to do holocaust research but he was really sincere on top of being smart a very quick study and thats hard to find nowadays the gifted ones all seem to stay on the career track get rich quick the ones like those three she pointed to the other desks are the exception did they know ike no they just started fall interns the summer group consisted of three students from yeshiva university in new york one each from brown and nyu and ike from santa monica college all the others went back for fall semester ike didnt hang out with them kind of a loner really you said he was friendly yes thats odd isnt it now that you mention it he was friendly smiled a lot courteous but he definitely kept to himself when janie told me what had happened i thought back realized how little hed told me about himself during the interview hed arrived a few months earlier from back east was working and going to school he told me he loved history wanted to be a lawyer or a historian he kept steering the conversation away from personal things and toward substancehistory politics mans inhumanity to man i was so taken by his enthusiasm that i went along with it didnt ask very many personal questions do you think he was hiding something who knows said milo theres no record at all of his application no sorry we dump tons anything to avoid the paperglut wish i had the luxury he said by now i dream in triplicate she smiled be thankful you dont deal with the federal government after years of haggling the justice departments finally started turning over names of old nazis whore still living here they all lied on their visa applications and were processing to beat the band meeting with federal prosecutors in the various cities filling out mountains of forms trying to persuade them to move faster on drawing up deportation papers thats what i was doing in chicago trying to sock it to a kindly old geezer who runs a bakery on the south side best pastry in town free samples to all the local kiddies only problem is fortyfive years ago that geezer was responsible for gassing eighteen hundred kiddies milos face got hard gonna nail him gonna try actually this particular case looks good of course therell be the usual outcry from his family and friends weve got the wrong guy this ones a saint wouldnt hurt a fly were only persecuting him because of his noble anticommunist background moscows behind all of it you see as if the russians would give us the time of day not to mention a whole bunch of mewling from the nonconfrontational wimps who think human natures basically pure and bygones should be bygones and of course straightout antisemitic garbage from the revisionist morons the itneverhappenedinthefirstplacebutifitdidtheydeservedit crowd your basic neobundists neowho bundists she smiled sorry for being esoteric i was referring to the germanamerican bund it was a big movement in this country before world war ii passed itself off as a germanamerican pride society but that was just a cover for american nazism bundists were big in the isolationist movement agitated against us involvement in the war used the america first cover to press for mandatory sterilization of all refugees that kind of thing but they werent just a tiny fringe group they held rallies at madison square garden for thousands of people complete with swastika banners brown shirt marches the horst wessel song ran paramilitary training camps two dozen of them with bunkhouses for storm troopers their goal was to set up a germanspeaking colony a sudetenland in new york state first step toward an aryan america their leaders were paid agents of the third reich they published newspapers had a press service a book publishing company called flanders hall got support from charles lindbergh and henry ford the bundesführer a man called fritz kuhn was a ford motors chemist and plenty of politicians too they interfaced with father coughlin gerald lk smith lots of other loonies but after pearl harbor their leaders were rounded up for espionage and sedition and sent to prison it put a damper on the movement but didnt kill it extremisms like that a recurrent cancer you need to be always looking out for it cutting it away nowadays its skinheads revisionists the holocaust never happened they thrive on economic hardship tried to exploit the farmers problems a few years back the latest thing is odinism some sort of ancient norse religion they reject christianity because it evolved out of judaism then theres this other group that claims to be the real hebrews we jews are subhuman the spawn of eve and the snake farrakhan says the same kind of thing white separatists showed up at one of his rallies and donated money nutso said milo but dangerous were working overtime keeping an eye on them all was novato involved in investigating any of them no we keep the volunteers away from that kind of thing too dangerous im up to two death threats a week he did library work reshelving working on the index catalogue id call down with a list of references and ask him to get them for me sometimes id send him to outside libraries ucla or hebrew union college or over to the federal building to pick up some documents he had a motorcycle which made him perfect for that mostly what he did was read on his own time sat in the library until closing time then took stuff home with him she looked down at the box i glanced through it seems to be mostly holocaust history the origins and structure of the nazi party and neonazi groups at least thats what he checked out weve got a very comprehensive civil rights collection and we put together an entire section on black slavery but he didnt check out any of that i was surprised which just reminds me how easy it is to stereotype youve got to fight it constantly still its the first time i can remember a black kid focusing exclusively on the holocaust there was something about him milo a naïveté an optimistic sincerity that was really touching you just knew that in a couple of years he was going to get disillusioned and lose some of that maybe even all of it but in the meantime it was nice to see why would anyone want to kill him she stopped pretty dumb question coming from me its always a good question milo said its the answers that stink did he ever mention any family or friends no the only time he got even remotely personal was toward the end of his must have been early september he came into my office to deliver some books and after he put them down he kept hanging around i didnt even notice at first i was up to my elbows in something finally i realized he was still there and glanced up he looked nervous upset about something i asked him what was on his mind he started talking about some pictures hed come across while cataloguing dead babies out of the crematoria mengeles experiments he was really affected sometimes it just hits you out of the clear blue even after youve seen thousands of other pictures one will set you off i encouraged him to talk get it all out let him go on about why if there was a god he could let those things happen why did terrible things happen to good people why couldnt people be kind to one another why were people always betraying one anotherbrutalizing one another when he was through i told him those were questions humanity had been asking itself since the beginning of time that i had no answers but the fact that he was asking them showed he was one cut above the crowd had some depth to him the wisdom to question that the key to making the world a better place was to constantly question never accept the brutality then he said something strange he said jewish people question all the time jewish people are deep he said it almost with a longing in his voice a reverence i said thanks for the compliment but we jews dont have a monopoly on either suffering or insight that wed swallowed more than our share of persecution and that kind of thing did tend to lead to introspection but that when you got down to it jews were like everyone else good and bad some deep some shallow he listened and got this strange smile on his face kind of sad kind of dreamy as if he were thinking about something else then he turned to me and asked me if id like him better if he were jewish that really threw me i said i liked him just fine the way he was but he wouldnt let go of it wanted to know how id feel if he were jewish i told him we could always use another bright penny in the tribe was he thinking of converting and he just gave me another strange smile and said i should be flexible in my criteria then he left we never talked about it again what did he mean criteria the only thing i can think of was that he was considering a reform or conservative conversion im orthodox he knew that and the orthodox have more stringent criteria so maybe he was asking for my approval asking me to be flexible in my criteria for conversion it was a strange conversation milo i made a mental note to follow up on it try to get to know him better but with the workload it just never happened right after that he stopped showing up for a while i wondered if id said the wrong thing failed him in some way she stopped laced her hands opened a desk drawer pulled out a pack of cigarettes lit one and blew out smoke so much for quitting my first all week talking about this isnt good for my willpower since i got your message ive been wondering if there was something he was asking from me that i didnt give some way i could have come on judy said milo deadend thinking she held the cigarette at arms length yes i know milo took it and ground it out in an ashtray she said been talking to my husband its my job he said protect and serve got a few more questions for you hate groups anything new on the local scene not particularly just the usual fringies maybe a slight upswing in incidents that seems to be related to the situation in israel a lot of the printed material weve been seeing lately has been emphasizing antizionist rhetoric jews are oppressors stand up for palestinian rights a new hook for them since the un passed the zionismisracism thing basically a way for them to sanitize their message and some of the funding for the worst antisemitic literature is coming from saudi arabia kuwait and syria so im sure thats got something to do with it whod be breaking into houses and painting antisemitic slogans on the walls that sounds kind of adolescent she said why are you getting a lot of that if you are we should know about it just one incident at the place ike used to live and the apartment next door his landlady was jewish and the nextdoor neighbors a rabbi so it probably has nothing to do with ike milo she said you dont think he was killed because of his work here nothing points to that judy but youre not ruling it out youre here because you have at least some suspicion he might have been killed because of his race no judy he said im a long way from that kennedy i said softly it was the first time id spoken since we entered the room both of them stared at me yeah said milo there is something else along with the antisemitic stuff they wrote remember john kennedy that make any sense to you could she said depending on which john kennedy youre talking about what do you mean if they scrawled john f kennedy that wouldnt make much sense but there was another john kennedy confederate veteran lived in pulaski tennessee and started a social club for other confederate veterans called the ku klux klan i said punks who know history milo didnt say anything we left taking along the carton of books ike novato had checked out i said what do you think milo said who the hell knows seems to me its starting to smell more like politics than drugs both novato and gruenberg have a strong interest in nazis both get killed someone breaks into their apartment and paints racist slogans milo frowned rubbed his face then his beeper went off i said want me to find a phone nah ill call from your place he did and put down the phone gotta go fresh db dont worry nothing to do with nazis paraplegic in a rest home on palm looks like natural causes how come the dthree goes out on something like that one of the attendants pulled my guy aside and told him the paraplegic had been pretty healthy the day before and this wasnt the first funny death theyd had there place was full of health code violations patients getting beaten sitting in their own shit not getting their medicine owner of the home is politically connected my guy got nervous wanted to know procedure procedure is i go out there and play nursemaid he walked to the door got any plans for tonight nothing he pointed at the carton of books got time for some reading sure theres a lot of stuff there you might wanna check first for notes in margins underlining that kind of thing barring that maybe a trend in the kind of books he chose a subpattern something more specific than just an interest in nazis depending on how complicated it gets over in palms ill try to get back tonight see if youve come up with anything am i being graded nah its passfail just like real life mahlon burden had left a message at four he said to tell you the operator said that hes free to pick up where the two of you left off any time thanks he sounded kind of eager she said burden whys that name familiar i told her i had no idea hung up finished a longoverdue report then sat down with the carton of books at seven oclock the first volume i picked up was an english translation of mein kampf i flipped the pages found no notes in the margins or underlining the second book was entitled this must not happen again the black book of fascist horror by clark kinnaird large print small press publication date of flipping through these pages revealed a note in the margin of page the adjoining text read unless it is understood that the germans made their heinousities as well as their war profitable they are incomprehensible what followed was a description of the financial benefits the nazis had reaped from the racial laws that allowed them to confiscate jewish property next to it someone had neatly printed in pencil same old story power and money no matter what wing i turned more pages found no more notes just a clearly written chronology of world war ii and lots of pictures the same kinds id seen in the exhibit room i got caught up in the horrors and was still reading at ninefifteen when milo returned he said anything not yet how was the rest home nothing overly weird homicidewise despite what the attendant said the patient did have a history of respiratory problems have to wait on the coroner for a definite cause of death he gave a disgusted look place was a real disneyland all those empty eyes remind me to amend my will first signs of infirmity have me taken out to the desert and shot you hungry not really i held up the book hey he said if i only took nutrition when life was pretty id goddam starve to death we drove to a sushi bar on wilshire near yale it had been a while since wed been there and the place had undergone a redecoration pine bar and shoji screens and samisen music thrown over for purple and black velvet walls smoked mirrors laserart rock posters and a sound system that would have done dejon jonson proud same chefs but new costumes black pajamas and headbands they brandished their knives and shouted greetings over the disco beat milo looked at them and said reminds me of the fucking cong wanna try someplace else he scanned the array of raw fish at the bar and shook his head comestibles still look good im too tired to go hunting we took a table as far away from the noise as possible ordered hot sake and ice water and lots of food he finished quickly called the waitress back and ordered more shrimp and yellowtail just as it arrived he said oh shit what beeper just went off i didnt hear it thats cause it didnt make a sound ive got it on silentvibrate i can feel it buzzing in my pocket rick insisted on it same one hes got so when we go to the theater we wont be offensive to the other theatergoers course the last time we went to the theater was back in i said sounds like something out of burdens catalogue pretty hightech for the department what department rick bought it promotion gift he wiped his mouth and got up be back in a sec dont touch my shrimp but he was gone for a lot longer than a sec and when he came back he looked very grim what is it two more dbs double homicide he stuffed a piece of shrimp in his mouth threw money on the table and loped away fast i caught up with him whats the rush thought you were off duty not for these we were out on the sidewalk he ran faster passersby stared what is it milo more nursemaiding oh yeah he said nursemaiding like crazy one of the dbs used to be samuel massengil the address was on sherbourne just south of olympic a block from beverly hills a maplelined street of wellkept older twostory duplexes and newer apartments quiet neighborhood solidly middle class the blinking lights of police cars were visible a block away a vulgar intrusion milos id got us through fast a uniformed officer directed us to one of the duplexes on the west side of the street white spanish style wroughtiron grillwork tasteful landscaping a yellow fiat spider was parked in the driveway under an arched portecochere it had reflector vanity plates that read cheri t crimescene tape had been stretched across the stucco arch that led to the duplexs groundlevel entry next to the arch was a large oleander pruned to tree shape in full pink bloom a young black cop with a long bony face came out of the house when he saw milo he touched his hat and said burdette sir im the one you spoke to milo said what do we know burdette burdette looked at me his eyes filled with questions but he kept them there two bodies out in back both male cauc possible gunshot wounds to the head definitely db but we called the ambulance anyway quiet no siren just like you said ones the assemblyman the other i dont know id may be in the pockets but we havent touched them probable gunshot wounds thats what it looks like the lights not real great out there and we didnt want to get too close mess up the scene theres copious pooling blood near both heads and i didnt see any slash marks or bludgeon wounds also the witness the party reporting heard gunshots youre sure its him yes sir id know that face anywhere and the pr confirmed it where is the pr inside ground floor name burdette pulled out a pad and shined a flashlight the name on her license is cheryl jane nuveen female black black and brown five six one fifteen dob foureightfiftythree this address no wants or warrants but some or all of it might not be righteous whys that shes a pro a hooker burdette nodded highpriced but its fairly obvious once you see the setup shes shook up but streetwise after she answered the first few questions and confirmed that db one was him she refused to talk until she could call her lawyer she put in that call yet not yet i told her to wait wanted to keep things as quiet as possible just like you said we mirandized her but didnt pump her good said milo before she clammed up you get any story from her on what happened she called it in on nineoneone said she thought thered been shots fired in her backyard thought she saw two guys down the dispatcher gave it to us as a possible adw shots fired code two high we expected a prowler situation but when we got here whos we ziegler and me burdette crooked a thumb at a stocky white officer standing guard at the curb whend the call come in tenohfour we were over at patricia and pico on a traffic stop possible deuce dropped that and got here at tentwelve did a careful search saw who db one was the way both of them were dressed it was obvious this was no prowler situation then when we went inside and saw her setup and her demeanor we put two and two together also the fact that the assemblymans car was parked back there and hers was in the driveway meant he was probably visiting her i figure he wanted to keep his car off the street just in case someone recogoized it when i laid that out for her she admitted hed been up there he was a john thats when she shut up and asked to change her clothes we didnt let her wanted to preserve the scene whyd she want to change all she had on was a robe over probably nothing why didnt she change before you got here good question sir maybe she was shook up she actually looked pretty shook up despite being streetwise yes sir anyone else live with her no sir its her place she owns the whole building upstairs is rented to an artist but she says hes in europe hooker as landlady said milo the highpriced spread blood wouldnt be routine for her the way it would for a street gal okay i can see her shook up what else we mirandized her like i said called you then called in for assistance in order to be able to secure the crime scene like you instructed we used a restricted band to keep it quiet no mention of db ones identity eightl fivecodesixed us thats martinez and pelletier pelletiers in there with her now we figured a woman might keep her calmer no allegations of sexual stuff maybe even get something out of her informationwise but we agreed no one would pump her until you got here eightohtwentythree got here just a few minutes after thats who you saw blocking the street any indication she was more than the pr no sir nothing obvious any intuition on that intuition burdette chewed on the word well sir she did call it in right away bodies were still warm when we got here so if shes the shooter shes not a very bright one we didnt see any gun in the house but we havent really searched i guess anythings possible whats her demeanor id call it upset sir pretty scared not shifty or guilty if thats what you mean you did good said milo techs and coroners on their way okay lets take a look back there burdette glanced at me again milo said this is dr delaware hes a psychologist consulting to the department the schoolyard sniping we were having a meeting on that when your call came in thats his caddy out in front have someone move it to a less conspicuous spot okay to me give him your keys doc you come with me i handed the keys to burdette he said just straight past the car and through the driveway we taped off a radius gimme your flashlight said milo burdette gave it to him and left swinging my key ring we walked under the portecochere and into the backyard which was small and square and backed by a flatroofed double garage with oldfashioned wooden hinge doors most of the ground area had been paved with concrete a narrow strip of lawn on the north side sported a peach tree and a tshaped metal pole designed to hold a clothesline there was no outdoor lighting but light from a shaded rear window and a floodlight on the roof of the duplex next door combined to pour a tallowy wash over the southern part of the property some of the light flowed onto a latemodel chrysler new yorker next to the car were two bodies lying belly down limbs splayed heads twisted to the side a tape line had been run around them theyd fallen close together on the concrete perhaps two feet separated them their legs overlapped creating a human v and had the loose but contorted posture unique to prerigor corpses and rag dolls both were dressed in suits one gray one that appeared tan in the night light the left trouserleg of the one in tan had ridden up revealing a thick white slab of hairless calf that shone like polished ivory rorschach splotches extended from both heads keeping his distance milo swept the flashlight over the yard focused it on the faces him all right puffy from hemorrhaging bullet probably danced around in there looks like an entry back here top of the neck straight to the medulla oblongata it was probably fast same shot on number two a little higher also clean someone came from there back of the car side of the garage caught em by surprise and bang bang close range looks very pro hey alex look at this this who i think it is his beam had rested on the face of the tansuited body corpulent white bearded suety cheeks compressed against the cement santa claus with glassy sightless eyes under swollen lids dobbs i said well he said you figured they had some kind of extraprofessional relationship now we have an idea what it was he retracted the flashlight shook his head talk about your house calls maintaining his distance milo diagrammed took notes measured searched for footprints and thought he saw some on the other side of the chrysler near the northern corner of the garage wet grass there he said and dirt low fence to the neighbors yard easy escape route we might be able to get a cast good hiding spot too i said he nodded like a goddam duck blind the light from next door doesnt carry this far they walk out to the car feeling nice and mellow pop pop he continued examining the yard the coroner ambulance and crimescene van showed up within seconds of one another and the area was engulfed in frantic activity i retreated to the portecochere and waited as milo gave orders asked questions pointed and scribbled when he finally walked away from the action i stepped out he looked at me as if hed forgotten i was there getting plainclothes out to both their offices make sure this isnt related to some kind of watergate situation ive gotta talk to ms nuveen why dont you go home ill catch a ride to your place i said the press will be showing up soon dont you think id be less obtrusive if i stayed with you if you leave right now youll be real unobtrusive i said promise to behave good mr policeman he hesitated all right come with me and as long as youre there keep your eyes open and make yourself useful the living room had maroonlacquered walls and creamcolored marbleized molding a darkbeamed vaulted ceiling and a thermostat set at eighty the decor was african safari transposed upon someones idea of a paris salon zebra and tiger skins layered over highgloss herringbone hardwood elephantleg occasional table lots of cut crystal porcelain and cloisonné overstuffed chairs upholstered in a blackandmaroon floral chintz a pair of carved ivory tusks sharing space on the quasiquatorze coffee table with a stack of art books art nouveau lamps with beaded shades heavy brocade drapes with gold hems tied back from black wooden shutters a green marble mantel bearing a collection of millefleurs and linenfold paperweights and everywhere the smell of musk she sat in one of the chairs looking younger than indicated by her drivers license birthdate late twenties would have been my guess her skin was the color of mocha ice cream her eye shadow iridescent peacockblue the eyes below them were wideset and active she had long slim brown legs narrow feet ending in pearlypink toenails full lips glossed a soft pink a tight jaw and straightened hair the color of red clay that hung past her shoulder blades her kimono was royalpurple thai silk patterned with jadegreen dragons buttonless and very short held together with a green sash no matter how many times she tightened the sash the robe kept coming loose and revealing a healthy mocha chest she crossed and uncrossed her legs a lot smoked an ultrakingsize sherman tinted to match the robe and fought to keep from trembling okay cheri said milo handing her a faux malachite phone go ahead call your lawyer tell him to meet you downtown at central booking she bit her lip smoked looked at the floor downtown her voice was soft slightly nasal havent seen that place in a long time bet you havent cheri come a long way since imperial highway or was it sunset and western she didnt answer he said got to hand it to you this is some place selfmade woman he put the phone down and picked up a lladro figurine victorian lady with a parasol he spun the parasol and said spain right for the first time she looked at him with fear wondering how long something that delicate could survive between those thick fingers he put down the figurine whos your decorator me i did it myself defiance and pride made her sit up a bit straighter creative cheri she pointed to the art books i read lots of stuff architectural digest he lifted the phone again and held it out to her she made no effort to take it call him cheri then well take you down hey your hands are shaking babe tell you what give me the number and ill dial it for you hows that for personal service she took a deep drag on the purple cigarette why why what whyre you leaning on me talking about downtown its not just talk cheri its real real she dragged again coughed touched her bosom tugged the sash real this is what i get for doing my civic duty moment i saw it i called he said i appreciate that except now instead of acting civic youre clamming up and demanding your lawyer which is more like perp behavior so now im wondering what you have to hide and now i have to take you downtown to be extra careful to cover my butt she hugged herself rocked smoked crossed her legs they treated me like a perp right off read me miranda thats for your sake cheri yeah everyones out to do me a favor she waved the cigarette created sinuous smoke streams milo cut through the smoke with his finger sherms usually when we see those theyre in evidence bags spiked with dust not my thing she said i live healthy course you do he said but let me ask you whats the chance once we start going over this place and we are going to go over it that we dont find something roach under the bed little speck of hash maybe some ludes or poppers to make a party go smoother something one of your guests accidentally dropped and the cleaning woman just happened to miss you do have a cleaning woman twice a week she said twice a week huh things do have a way of accumulating between cleanings listen she said all there is is pills valium legal prescription fact i could use one right now not now cheri we need you lucid clear i know what lucid means dont think im no woodhead perish the thought woodheads dont usually end up owning the building he jiggled the phone the clapper hit the bell and gave off a dull ring she said you find anything funny in there i dont know a single thing about it its your responsibility cheri you own the whole building she muttered something milo said whats that no answer go on make the call or give me the number so i can call she was silent anyway he said the dope were gonna find might keep you in lockup for a while but its the least of your problems lets not forget those two gentlemen out back she shook her head nuhuh i dont know a thing about them about what happened you knew them professionally thats all professionally said milo he lifted a satinized purple business card from a cloisonné holder cheryl jane nuveen recreational counselor recreation huh sounds like shuffleboard on deck the cigarette dangled from her fingers dripping ashes onto the zebra skin milo said enough small talk whats the lawyers number got to be a fivefive exchange right beverly hills or century city two hundred twofifty an hour i figure the initial tabs gonna

a month meanwhile youre in storage with girls from the old neighborhood theyre gonna be real happy to see someone made good owns the whole building theyre gonna relate very friendly to that she raised her voice book me on what my turn to ask questions your turn to shut up or answer she stabbed a crystal ashtray with her cigarette kept stabbing after the glow had died nothing to answer about two bodies in your backyard and nothing to answer about she rolled her eyes i told you i dont know about that you knew them professionally who else besides you knew they were coming here tonight to play no one no one thats right im discreet my business is based on it no one said milo except the guy you called tonight in order to set em up her mouth dropped open oh no oh no no way youre gonna cute

was some king hoohah and im some little sister whos stepped out of line its his job to knock me down and the other one shes nothing but a diesel dyke staring at my attributes whenever she got the chance you guys shouldnt be hiring perverts attributes said milo yeah she bent low in illustration threw back her shoulders suddenly confident again she smiled at milo received a blank stare in return and switched her attention to me her smile was inviting and though i knew it was artifice i had to look away to keep from reciprocating when i did she cursed under her breath milo said okay well take you downtown you make the call from there get ready for a little nostalgia cheri sucking in aids breath in a holding cage full of fivedollar strawberries while getting your attributes checked out she looked at me again spread her legs slightly while keeping them crossed at the ankles confirming burdettes assessment of what was or wasnt under the kimono i looked away again she said okay fuck the lawyer i didnt do a thing wrong dont need to buy him another mercedes give me one of those polygraphs crank it up ive got nothing to hide milo said polygraphs cant stand up to smooth criminals anyone comfortable with lying can pass anger mottled her face like a rash so what the fuck do you want just straight talk cheri how you hooked up with massengil and dobbs in the first place how long its been

capitol doing your bit for good government you bet more of them would a took more of what i gave thered be less strife believe me where you from originally here inglewood howd you get up to sacramento i was in san francisco first three years moved cause i wanted things more quiet and something i could do myself someone told me politicians were always wanting it you had a sellers market recreation she smiled yeah being close to the action meant they could make their speeches in the morning drop by for a lunchtime party and go back to their speeches with a smile on their faces they said milo how many others besides massengil lots chief its a company town not that fearless leaders was all i did you had your doctors and your bankers like any other place but being there in that place you did see lots of political types aides lobbyists administrative assistants all that shit you learn to talk like them after a while fun bunch she grimaced not hardly i mean they were free with the buck expense accounts but as a group they had inclinations if you know what im saying i dont kinky she said as if talking to an idiot mostly for tyingup bondage always wanting to be tied up or tying me up nearly every one of them got so when i took one on that i knew was political i had the neckties and the ropes all ready a few of them even wanted to be embarrassed dirty stuff never seen so many people wanting to tie or to be tied all horny about who was in charge then youd turn on the tv see those same faces you just saw all wrinkled up or wearing a leather mask crying and pleading not to spank em even though thats what they really wanted youd see em giving speeches on the tv going on about law and order the american way all that shit meanwhile youre knowing their idea of law and order is being hogtrussed she laughed filled her lungs with smoke dont it just make you want to run out and vote milo smiled massengil a tyer or a tyee tyee liked to have his arms and legs all bound up so tight the blood was cut off then hed stretch out and make me do all the work then afterwards which was quick with most of them its real quick she snapped her fingersi had to snuggle next to him like i was his mama and hed latch onto my bubbies and talk like some little kid baby talk oogum snoogums for mr law and order she laughed again but looked uneasy real disillusioning she said isnt it high and mighty types running things and what they really are is whining bubbysucking babies then of course theres cops he ever get racial what do you mean make racist comments want to set up some racist fantasy nope she said just the tying and the oogum talk howd you meet him through the other one dobbs uhhuh hes a doctor psychiatrist liked to pretend this was all medical sex therapy i should think of myself as his therapy assistant whend you first meet dobbs my last year in frisco how had this girlfriend of mine who got into the therapy thing took a course or something and got this piece of paper saying she was legal a surrogate dobbs taught the course offered her a job used to send her people patients have her kick back some of the money to him she made good but he made better then when she moved out of town because her ex was threatening her she gave him my name i moved down to sacramento and he started sending the people to me even though youre not legal she smiled but im good chief i can be real patient real therapeutic when i have to ill just bet you can cheri what other politicians did dobbs send you besides assemblyman massengil just him she said its like they were special buddies what kind of special buddies not fags or anything sometimes a couple of closet fags will use me to get into theirselves doing a double and then accidentally one of their things brushes up against the other thing and we got a brandnew picture but not them they just used to show up together like sam needed fatso to lead the way and fatso got off on setting things up he never sent anyone else to you not down here what about sacramento okay a couple but after i did a little business with him i didnt want to do any more why not he was a pig is why not with lorraine hed taken fiftyfive percent with me he was wanting sixty finders fee he said i needed him his being involved made it legal threatening me she shook her head and rubbed one knee i went indy to get greedy pigs off my back told him bullshit my being involved made it illegal for him and he had a lot more to lose than i did if the shit hit the fan so we settled on twenty percent couple of months later i had enough of my own business going anyway taking a hundred percent didnt want none of his even with twenty percent and told him so howd he react to that made a face but didnt argue and kept seeing me with sam sam had a thing for me was he ever a client himself once in a while tyer or tyee she shook her head all he wanted was whambam oh jesus oh jesus roll his fat butt off and fall asleep mostly he was a watcher couple of times i caught him peeking through the door when i was with sam that gave me the creeps but i didnt say a thing didnt cost me anything wheres your trick book no trick book she tapped her coiffure everythings in here how about your calendar no calendar either each day passes i tear it up in little pieces and flush it down were gonna tear the place apart cheri tear all you want theres no book and dont ask me to give you names otherwise i will go downtown and suck aids breath who knew massengil was coming here no one knew no one knew about anybody thats my specialty discreetness and with him i was extracareful cause he was so nervous about being caught wouldnt even leave his car out on the street when he had an appointment i cleared my calendar all day so they wouldnt be running into anyone considerate fuck considerate she said i charged em for time lost speaking of that what kind of tariff are we talking about four hundred an hour wide smile more than my lawyer makes and i didnt have to pass any bar tests cash nothing but how often did massengil see you three or four times a month what was the schedule what i told you tying up nuzzling bubbies sometimes id feed them dinner then theyd leave and i had the whole night to myself watch johnny carson milo said thats not what i meant by schedule cheri which days of the week did they show up what routine no routine id get a call from sam or from fatso day or two before clear the calendar and theyd come by and wed have a little party always the two of them always she turned thoughtful maybe they were fags really wanting to do a little dickrubbing i dont know i just know they never got into that here no schedule said milo no so howd anyone know they were here beats me maybe somebody followed em followed em here and just waited huh she shrugged milo said howd the shooter know to wait for them to come out know that the two of them wouldnt be spending the night not my thing she said spending the night no one spends the night whod know that besides you and your tricks she was silent he said youre gonna have to give us that book cheri i keep telling you there is no book milo sat back and crossed his legs she smoked touched her hair rocked her foot finally she said i give you that im finished he said cmon cheri two bodies out in back one of them a public figure youre finished anyway she smoked in silence some more pulled something out of an eyelash books in the bank safe deposit box which bank i give it to you you gonna help me move get me outa here safe help me get my equity out of the building plus keep my kid safe wheres the kid inglewood with my mom how old nine real smart gotta great voice sings in church whats his name andré andré ill do what i can for you and andré do what you can huh thats politician talk chief just another way of saying fuck you got a place to move somewhere conservative uptight conservative folks get the horniest need an outlet like the folks up in sacramento just like whyd you move from there to la were back asking questions thats right why the move cheri it was his idea dobbss or massengils sam the assemblyman he really had a thing for me a taste for me get a taste for something sweet and its like drugs you never get enough three or four times a month isnt much of a fix hes he was old what i gave him lasted he really got off on it whyd he want you to move down here said he didnt like having me so close to his workplace sacramento was a small town loved gossip someone might find out he found this place for me some kind of special deal the person died left no will probate she nodded he knew all about probates had all these land records because of his job said i should jump on this one it was a bargain all i had to do was put up some cash did he help you with the down payment not a penny he would have but i didnt need him had plenty of my own i flew down here saw the place saw what i could do with it and figured why not my place up there had appreciated built up equity now i got at least a hundred and sixty equity on this one maybe more what did he want in return me when he wanted me clearing my calendar so he didnt bump into no one no one would know no one except dobbs thats right was massengil aware that dobbs was a peeper dont think so usually he had his eyes closed all screwed up but who knows maybe they had a little buddygame going i dont try to get into their heads im somewhere else when im doing it four hundred an hour said milo three four times a month nice chunk of cashoutlay he never complained management consulting i said she looked at me consulting yeah i like that thats class maybe ill use that instead of recreational counselor milo said tell me about tonight exactly the way it happened she chainlit another cigarette what happened is that they came here at ninethirty did their things both of them this time yeah piggy took sloppy seconds he liked it that way wouldnt let me wash and then i gave them something to eat the colonel legs and breasts and cole slaw and biscuits leftovers from the night before but they ate it like it was fancy french cooking standing up in the kitchen drank two cans each of my diet pepsi then they paid me and split moneys in my undies drawer go check twelve hundred twelve ones new bills i said to sam whatd you do honey just print it he liked that laughed and said thats my job im on the finance committee after they were gone and i put the money away i went into the bathroom turned on the shower to clean off get them outa me while the water was running i heard it almost didnt hear it cause of the water but i did bang bang i know that sound like a fool i looked out the window saw them lying there him running away like a fool i called and did my civic duty and now im sitting here talking to you chief milo said whos him the shooter one guy ones all i saw whatd he look like all i saw was his back running behind the garage theres a low fence behind there he probably got in that way got out too rotten wood i been meaning to put in a new one you check youll probably find some kind of footprint theres gotta be footprints cause its muddy back there got a leaky sprinkler the water settles someone had to leave footprints you go on and check and see if im telling it straight tell me more about the shooter nothing more to tell dark clothes i think it was dark i dunno age dont know probably young he moved like he was young not like an old fart i seen plenty of old farts move believe me height not too tall or too short that i noticed i mean nothing hit me as being one way or the other it was dark weight same story chief there was nothing special about him just a guy i saw his back its too far to see good go look for yourself through that window and dark i keep it that way so people can park and get out without no one seeing em what did his face look like never saw a face cant even tell you if he was black or white what color were his hands she thought dont recall dont know if i even saw hands average height and weight said milo reading from his notes probably young thats it if i could tell you more why wouldnt i black clothing dark clothing what i mean is nothing shined out like a lightcolored shirt or anything so it was probably dark what else thats it doesnt add up to much cheri you think im gonna chase after him to get a closer look i was stupid to look in the first place soon as my brain cleared and i realized what was happening i dropped to the floor only reason i looked in the first place was i got caught by surprise i mean this was not what i expected to happen she closed her eyes held the cigarette with one hand her elbow with the other the robe came loose exposing heavy blacknippled breasts between them an inch of mocha sternum milo said how do i know for sure you didnt finger them for the guy cheri her eyes opened very wide cause i didnt why would i do that and get myself all involved do it in my backyard for the money got enough money no such thing she laughed true but i didnt give me the poly im not that smooth she let the robe open wider milo reached over and closed it placed her hand on the outer flap and said anything else you want to tell me cheri just get me outa here outa la with andré well be checking everything out and if youre being righteous ill be righteous with you meanwhile i do want you to call your attorney and tell him to meet you over at west la division youll be driven over there and wait for me itll take me a while to get over there when i do youll repeat the statement you just gave me in front of a video camera tv he nodded tonight youre a star she said the names ill give you whats in the book but i wont do that on tape fair enough long as youre straight i will be bet on it i dont bet much on anything anymore cheri this time you can i swear it she crossed her heart he said whats your attorneys name gittelman harvey m gittelman even though you gave this of your own free will in front of a witness i want mr gittelman with you when we tape he can shoot his mouth off all he wants raise twohundredbuckanhour objections i get paid overtime and i got nothing to go home to after were finished youll be released in his custody and asked to stay in town for as long as we need you if you make any attempt to leave town ill put you in sybil brand as a material witness and andré will miss his mama youre not gonna want to stay in this place what with the way the lab boys are going to tear it apart and the way your neighbors are gonna relate to you after the shit hits the fan which it will soon so its okay for you to stay somewhere else long as i know where it is and long as its in the county you want to do business in the new place keep up the mortgage thats fine with me too got it got it i swear it but no business business means people and people are problems i need a vacation up to you he stood she said when can i sell this place get my equity out if it turns out youre not involved in the shooting i can clear it for you pretty soon a month or so if youre fucking with me ill tie it up for years not that itll matter where youd end up she crossed her heart again im not fucking with you gods truth all i want is my equity she started to get up he said sit there dont move im gonna call officer pelletier back and shes gonna watch you while you get dressed well want that kimono to analyze shell also put bags on your hands until one of the techs comes in and does a paraffin test thatll tell us if youve fired a gun lately or worked with industrialstrength fertilizer been working with plenty of shit she said but not that kind and no gun bet on it youll also be printed so we can run you through ncic any outstanding wants or warrants better to tell me now nothing bet on that too one thing i will bet on he said youve got half a dozen monikers not that many and i havent used them in a long time give em to me anyway she ticked off her fingers sherry nuveen with an s like the wine sherry jackson cherry jackson with a c cherry burgundy cherry gomez thats when i had a spic on my back he made me take his name like we were married nuveen your given name she shook her head moms second husbands name i took it when i was seven then he left whats the name on your birth certificate jackson sheryl jane jackson with an s dob four eightfiftythree just like the license says i look younger dont you think you look great he said she beamed clean living he said whats the license plate stand for on the fiat cheri t she smiled again batted her lashes and laid down a few more mascara tracks vamping in order to maintain composure t is for tart she said cherry tart cause thats what i am sweet and juicy and filling when we were just outside the front door i said think shes innocent innocent he smiled you should see the way shes got the guest bedroom set up its a bondage museum marquis de sade would feel right comfy but of the shooting itself probably shes right why would she set them up on her home territory then phone it in thats in terms of setting it up in terms of her being the shooter herself whats the motive sometimes in a whore situation passions do get out of hand and someone gets hurt but its usually the whore whos the victim and its usually messy this was neat planned very cold also i had the tech look alongside the garage and he says it does look like fresh footprints his educated guess is a mans running shoe medium size none of which will mean shit if she flunks the paraffin test and we find the gun in her undie drawer ill be putting her through her paces all night and most of the morning see if i can get anything more out of her dark clothes i said its also the way holly was dressed when she camped out in the storage shed so whatre you saying back to the cabal roving bands of teenage ninja assassins i said anythings possible he didnt argue he got my keys back from burdette and found out where the seville was parked then he told pelletier a fivefoot blonde with a pixie chin to bag sheryl jacksons hands and take her back to the station as we left the duplex a couple of other west la detectives showed up he told me to stay put went over to them and filled them in giving them instructions about searching jacksons apartment and ordering them not to talk to the press until hed finished reinterviewing her a few spectators had come out on the sidewalk uniforms kept them at a distance several vans with tv station logos had pulled up to the barricade reporters and camera crews were milling around setting up lights milo said after me the deluge we began walking to the seville a sportscar rumble sounded down the block and a peacockblue pontiac fiero with three antennas sprouting from the roof sped to the barricade backed up at a noisy twenty miles per and parked at the curb lieutenant frisk got out took in the scene spotted us then came forward in a smooth loose stride he was wearing a shawlcollar black tuxedo with a pleatfronted wingcollared shirt scarlet tie and matching handkerchief as he came toward us i saw a woman get out of the fiero young tall fashionmodel figure covergirl face long dark frizzed hair her black taffeta cocktail dress showed off gleaming shoulders she looked around glanced in the little blue cars side mirror and glossed her lips one of the uniforms waved to her she didnt see it or else ignored it primped some more and got back in the car sergeant said frisk evening on the town ken said milo frisk frowned is the victims identity verified detective yeah its him the other ones dobbs the psychologist who looks like santa frisk turned his attention to me whats he doing here detective he was with me when the call came in no time to drop him off frisk looked as if he were struggling to bring up gas cmere sergeant the two of them walked a few yards away the beam of a streetlamp allowed me to see them clearly frisk pointed at milo and said something milo answered frisk pulled out a pad and pen and began writing milo said something else frisk kept writing milo ran his hand over his face and spoke again frisk looked irritated but continued writing milo talked rubbed his face bounced on the balls of his feet frisk put the pad away and said something that made milos face darken he kept talking wagged a finger milo wagged back their body language grew progressively combative hands fisted faces thrust forward chins extended like bayonets it reminded me of my boxing print milo used his size to advantage looming over frisk frisk defended by rising on the balls of his feet doing lots of tight jabbing things with his hands they began talking simultaneously talking over each other competing for air space other policemen were starting to notice shifting their attention from the crime scene to what was happening under the lamppost i could see frisks neck muscles straining milos arms were down now stiff at his side his hands still rolled into fists frisk made a conscious effort to relax smiled and gave a dismissive wave milo shouted something he must have sprayed frisk with spit because the younger man stepped back several paces yanked his red handkerchief from his pocket and wiped his face frisk smiled again and spoke milo flinched as if hed been slapped his fingers opened curled and tightened frisks turn to rock on the balls of his feet subtly but eagerly like a hungry welterweight for a moment i was certain they were going to come to blows then frisk turned heel and stomped away milo watched him go knuckling his chin frisk called a uniformed cop over talked rapidly began pointing at the murder duplex the cop nodded and crossed the street to the building the darkhaired young woman stepped out of the fiero again frisk whipped his head in her direction and gave her a hard look she got back in the car i looked over at milo he was staring at the growing hubbub near the barricade a frightful look on his face i stayed in place catching curious glances from cops finally milo saw me and waved me over get me the hell outa here alex the seville was parked facing south i drove away from the crime scene got on olympic heading west we didnt talk all the way to beverly glen as i turned off he said the slick fuck whatd he do take over oh yeah he can do that just like that just like that that mean he suspects its political he doesnt suspect shit no one knows shit its too early to know shit goddammit what it means is that he sees it as a goddam juicy one more tv time chance to wear another fancy suit kenny do love his press conferences kenny i said out on the town with barbie theres a real kenny and barbie thats mrs kenny the adorable spoiled kathy assistant chiefs favorite daughter oh oh i drove quickly up the glen reached the bridle path that leads to the house and turned onto it though the view out the passenger window was solid black milo was staring at it rubbing his face i said did he do anything else to piss you off to piss me off nah just implied that you and i had a romantic thing going gave a dirty little smile and told me i should think twice before bringing my friends to crime scenes when i asked him to clarify that he said i knew what he meant i kept bugging him finally he let it out people of my ilk were illsuited for security cases illsuited for guarding the public safety i blew out air okay so its the same old limited thinking not the first time wont be the last but i couldnt help thinking it was the same thing he and i had suspected about dinwiddie and ike he grunted i said is it safe to ask you what you think about what massengil whodunit think theres any relationship to holly or novato and gruenberg who the hell knows alex whatre you trying to do make me feel downright impotent i said nothing pulled up in front of the house he said all right whats on your mind maybe someone avenged her who daddy i wasnt thinking of him why do you suspect him i dont suspect anything alex havent had time to suspect its not even my fucking case anymore so why should i bother to suspect but if youre talking revenge revenge is usually a family thing and you told me burdens a nut not a nut narcissistic revenge is pretty narcissistic isnt it playing god power over life and death you told me yourself hes a control freak bragged about being good with guns i thought about that planning to talk to him im not talking to anybody per the slick fuck you cant challenge him he didnt answer and i regretted asking i said permit me a bit more theorizing stop asking permission as if im some sort of prima donna and just spit it out when i mentioned revenge i was thinking of something else the cabal other members setting out to avenge her and carry out the assignment that she failed to complete assignment alex if you were serious about political assassination would you assign someone like her to do it granted were talking the amateur hour i said but competence isnt always the rule of thumb for those kinds of groups is it look at the symbionese liberation army ye olde crispy critters he said yeah those guys werent too swift but they got famous didnt they which is what amateurs are after high profile and a romantic death if death is romantic im a fucking poet holly had a dreary life milo no present no future belonging to a fringe group could have given her purpose going out in a blaze of glory might not have looked bad at all youre saying she was on a suicide mission no but she might not have worried about the risks a group thing huh he said back to the ninjas so who killed novato and disappeared gruenberg maybe that was a dope thing or maybe it was the opposition rightwing radicals two groups of assholes why not now that you mention it it brings to mind something i just read scribbled in one of novatos books same old story power and money no matter what wing maybe what he was referring to was political extremism and he was becoming disillusioned milo said kkk assholes versus commie scumbags very colorful but before you get carried away dont forget that what happened tonight could have had nothing to do with politics just some jealous john this could all be related to cheri guys get attached to these girls it happens more than youd imagine or maybe it was political but had nothing to do with holly or novato or gruenberg massengil was not mr charm could be one of his disgruntled constituents set out to vote with his trigger finger not mr charm i said but popular enough to last twentyeight years so much for the incumbency advantage a moment later i dont know alex whats been going on is so weird i dont even want to apply logic because when i do i start doubting the value of logic one thing you can take comfort in your hunch about there being something funny between massengil and dobbs was right on i said sloppy seconds management consulting great way to launder cheris fees what do you think about what she said politicos and bondage makes sense psychologically like you once said politicians mainline power for some of them sex would be just another dominance game what would be interesting to find out is who else either here or in sacramento was aware of massengils kinks who besides dobbs knew massengil was carrying on with cheri and maybe there were other cheris the guy massengil slugged in the assembly dimarco would be someone to talk to what if he found out about it and leaked it another kind of revenge or took a more direct route shot them himself burr shot hamilton white shot milk and moscone shit he said all sorts of ways to go thats why i wanted to get her down to the station and lean on her some more i tried to tell frisk about it tell him what needed to be done to keep the investigation clean but he just cut me off said thank you detective everythings under control as in fuck you i dont need your faggot ideas milo shook his head fuck it its not my problem i wash my hands of it hate press conferences anyway saying it too loud and too fast i wasnt sure i believed him that he believed it himself but this was no time to argue linda had phoned and left a message at ten just called to say hi be up until eleven thirty it was close to one and though i wanted to talk to her i decided to do it in the morning i was wound up sensory overload not ready to tackle the kind of stuff ike novato had chosen to read about tv would be reruns of movies that shouldnt have been produced in the first place and hucksters pitching cellulite cures and eternal salvation i did a half hour on the skiing machine showered then hobbled into bed and fell asleep i woke up thinking about the kids at hale and called linda at seventhirty she had already heard about massengils murder on the early morning newscast the newscaster hadnt mentioned anything about a woman being involved i told her about sheryl jackson my god whats happening alex i wish i knew could there be some connection with the sniping the way things are going we may never find out i recounted how frisk had kicked milo off the case another politician i said this must be our year for them she said year of the rat what should i do about the kids alex in terms of massengil the main thing to look out for is their attributing massengils death to something they did or something they thought children and the younger they are the truer this is sometimes equate thinking with doing they have to be aware of massengils attitude toward them they may have seen him on tv or heard their parents discussing what a bad person he was if they wished him harm or even death they may get it in their heads that those wishes are what killed him step on a crack break mamas back exactly also over the next few days the media will probably turn massengil into some kind of hero hes not going to seem like a bad guy anymore that could be confusing a hero she said even with the hooker the fact that they havent yet gone public with the hooker may mean they intend to keep that part of it under wraps frisk trades in secrets hed make a deal like that if it was in his best interests she paused then said okay so i should make sure to disconnect their thoughts about massengil from what happened to him and from the sniping should i do it as an assembly or have the teachers handle it class by class class by class to accommodate the different developmental levels i can come over right now if youd like no she said thanks anyway but id like to try this myself in the long run im the one wholl have to deal with it makes sense i said but she said i wouldnt mind seeing you after school how about seven your place how about i made very strong coffee and squeezed grapefruit for juice no doubt mahlon burden had a gadget that did it faster and cleaner and so fortified turned on the eight oclock news i tuned in midway through a filmclip retrospective of massengils career terms like aggressive campaigner and veteran lawmaker predominated sheryl jackson remained unnamed dr lance dobbs was described as a prominent psychologist management consultant and adviser to the assemblyman the lesser corpse for all the public knew he and massengil had been playing poker the police were offering no theories as to the identity of the assassins but were investigating several leads that from the police chief himself a reporters question about the sniping at hale prompted a quick at this time we see no connection but as i said gentlemen all aspects of this tragedy are being looked into frisk stood in back of the chief projecting the faithfulservant solemnity of a vice presidential candidate cut to massengils tearful widow a stout grandmotherly woman with wounded eyes under a bubble of white hair sitting on a velvet divan being comforted by two of the assemblymans four grown sons the other two were flying in from colorado and florida on the wall behind the divan were framed pictures the camera closed in on one of them massengil throwing a grandchild up in the air the baby looked terrified and delighted at the same time massengils smile was ferocious i turned off the set postponing my next history lesson i did chores and paperwork for a couple of hours netted leaves out of the pond and showered but by eleven i was at the dining room table facing ikes books turning pages searching for more marginal notes to what end at the very least youll have your consciousness raised pal a week ago i would have claimed a sterling consciousness in no need of raising i was no stranger to suffering id spent half my life as a receptacle for the misery of others walking the terminal wards dispensing words nods empathic looks strategic silences the meager kindnesses endowed by my training ending too many bleak nights mired in the unanswerable why is life so cruel ruminations that come with that territory the kind of questions with which you stop torturing yourself only when you realize there are no answers but the horror of these books was different the cruelty so calculated institutionalized and efficient homicide in service of the state psychopathy elevated to patriotic duty children shoved into boxcars under the approving eyes of soldiers not much older than children themselves assemblyline tattooing the processing of humans as ore id intended to skim but found myself reading found the time slipping away until it was noon then past at twothirty i began a book on the eichmann trial a chapter toward the end presented trial documents proving a deliberate plan to exterminate the jews nazi records chronicling a conference at german interpol headquarters in berlin convened by one reinhard heydrich on january in accordance with a letter from hermann goering charging heydrich with arranging a final solution a secret conference attended by learned men dr meyer dr leibrandt dr nenmann dr freisler the plan had been well thoughtout making use of data already collected by the previous mass murder operations of aktion squads detailed statistics on the demographics of eleven million jews the first stage would be mass evacuation under the guise of arbeitseinsatz the labor effort those evacuees not liquidated by natural causes would be treated suitably the whole thing had the arrogant detachment of an academic conference the participants conducting scholarly highminded discussions of optimal killing techniques a secret conference revealed to posterity only because herr eichmann compulsive clerk that he was had taken copious notes a conference held in the berlin district known as wannsee wannsee wanna see wanna see wanna see too two my breath grew short and the ache in my jaw reminded me id been clenching my teeth i returned my gaze to the book the pages before me were well thumbed foxed to fuzz at the corners in the right margin the words had been penciled in the neat measured printing id come to know as ike novatos wannsee ii possible several inches below that crevolin again maybe then a phone number with a prefix the fairfax district wannsee ii crevolin it sounded like a hairreplacement tonic or something made from petrochemicals some kind of code or maybe a name i dialed the fairfax number a receptionist recited the call letters of one of the tv networks surprise slowed my response and before i could answer she repeated the triad of consonants and said may i help you yes id like to speak with mr crevolin fifty percent chance of getting the gender right she said one moment click terry crevolins office mr crevolin please hes out of the office when do you expect him back who is this please not knowing how to answer that i said a friend ill call back later and hung up i dialed the holocaust center and asked for judy baumgartner she came to the phone sounding cheerful yes alex what can i do for you milo asked me to look through ike novatos books i just came across something ike wrote in one of the margins and thought you might be able to explain it to me what is it wannsee two he wrote it in the margin of a chapter on the original wannsee conference wannsee two she said pronouncing it vahnsay he never mentioned that to me strange that he should even know about that whys that wannsee twos pretty esoteric just a rumor really that circulated years ago back in the seventies supposedly there was a secret meeting between elements of the radical right and those of the radical left white leftists whod broken with the black militants and turned heavily racist the alleged goal was to set up a national socialist confederation plant the roots of a neonazi party in this country sounds like the bund reborn more like the hitlerstalin pact she said the extremes crushing the middle we checked it out never found any evidence it had happened the prevailing wisdom is that its apocryphal one of those urban folk myths like alligators in the sewer system but chances are this particular myth got a little special help the rumor began circulating just around the time of cointelpro the counterintelligence program the nixon administration set up to sabotage radical movements where was this conference supposed to have taken place ive heard different versions ranging from germany to right here in the us ive even heard claims that it took place on a military base the confederation was supposed to have lots of members in the armed forces and in various police forces around the country hows that for something to feed your paranoia pause wannsee two this is the first ive heard of it in a very long time i wonder how ike knew about it his landlady was an old radical with an interest in the holocaust i said the two of them used to talk politics she may have told him about wannsee two and he may have decided to research it well given that i can see why hed pursue it blacks were a prime target of wannsee two the way the story goes one of the intentions of the confederation was to foment hatred between the minorities pit the blacks against the jews have the blacks kill the jews which would be easy because the jews were passive wimps ready to march into the ovens again once the blacks had served their purpose they would be annihilated also a snap because they were so gullible and stupid and of course when the cowardly hispanics and asians saw what was going on theyd leave the country of their own accord go back where they came from and the borders of white america would be hermetically sealed sounds pretty nuts so did hitler at the beginning thats why we investigated the wannsee two thing as thoroughly as weve ever investigated anything but we never came up with anything to support it i said there was something else in the margin crevolin and a phone number i called it and got the office of someone named terry crevolin at one of the tv networks i know terry she said he works in development screening scripts he worked with us last year on our warcriminal specialthe hidden we won an emmy i remember did ike know him not as far as i know but im starting to see there were lots of things i didnt know about ike could they have met at the center no terry was just here a couple of times for meetings and that was last year months before ike showed up though i suppose there could have been a chance meeting if terry dropped in without my knowing it what exactly did ike write in that book wannsee twothe two in roman numerals followed by the word possible then crevolin again maybe and crevolins number it could mean he tried to talk to crevolin once about wannsee two hadnt been able to reach him and was thinking of trying it again any idea why the only thing that comes to mind is that terry used to be involved with the new left even wrote a book about it i recall his mentioning that he seemed kind of embarrassed and proud at the same time i guess ike could have seen him as a source though how ike would know that i have no idea a source on the new left maybe certainly not on the holocaust terry wasnt especially knowledgeable about that until we educated him youve really got my curiosity piqued if you find out anything useful please let me know i called the network again and got patched through to crevolins office he was still out this time i left my name and said it was about ike novato then i phoned milo at the west la station planning to play show and tell he wasnt in either i called his home number got ricks recorded voice on a machine and recited what id learned about wannsee ii saying it out loud made me realize it wasnt much a dead boys exploration of an urban myth i searched through the rest of ikes books found no more marginal notes or wannsee references and repacked them it was close to six by the third time i called the network this time no one answered crevolin again instead of implying ike had been unsuccessful in reaching the network man it might mean theyd talked and crevolin hadnt given him what he wanted but why had ike believed crevolin would he helpful a new left veteran and author perhaps ike had gotten hold of crevolins book and found something interesting i looked at my watch an hour until i was supposed to pick up linda i called a bookstore in westwood village the clerk checked books in print and told me no book by anyone named crevolin was current and the store had no record of ever having stocked it any idea where i might get hold of it whats it about the new left the sixties vagabond books has a big sixties section i knew vagabond westwood boulevard just above olympic right on the way to lindas a warm cluttered place with the dusty easybrowsing feel of a campusarea bookstore the kind of place la campuses rarely have id bought a few chandler and macdonald and leonard first editions there some art and psych and poetry books i looked up the number called waited ten rings and was about to hang up when a man answered vagabond i told him what i was looking for yup we have it great ill come by right now and pick it up sorry were closed what time do you open tomorrow eleven okay see you at eleven its pretty important to you yes it is you a writer researcher tell you what come around through the back ill give it to you for ten bucks i thanked him did a quick change and left picking up westwood boulevard at wilshire and taking it south i reached the back entrance to the bookstore by the door was bolted after a couple of hard raps i heard the bolt slide back a tall lean man in his thirties with a boyishly handsome face framed by long wavy hair parted in the middle stood holding a grimylooking paperback book in one hand the books cover was gray and unmarked the man wore sneakers and cords and a harvard sweat shirt a tenor sax hung from a string around his neck he gave a warm smile and said i looked for a cleaner one but this was all we had i said no problem i appreciate your doing this he handed me the book happy research i held out a ten make it five he said reaching into his pocket and giving me change i recognize you now youre a good customer and its a ratty copy besides its not exactly one of our fastmovers bad writing he laughed and fingered some buttons on the sax that doesnt start to describe it its selfpublished dreck downright turgid would be flattery also the guy sold out i opened the book the title was lies by t crevolin i turned a page looked at the name of the publisher rev press as in olution pretty clever huh he raised the sax to his lips expelled a few blue notes and bent them i thanked him again he continued to play blowing harder raised his eyebrows and closed the door i tossed the book into the trunk of the seville and drove to lindas we went to a place in the los feliz district that id gotten to know during my days at western pediatric small italian deli case in front tables in back ripe with romano cheese and garlic sausage olive loaf and prosciutto a beautiful brine smell wafting up from open vats of olives i ordered a bottle of chianti classico that cost more than our dinners combined each of us finished a glass before the food came i asked how the children were handling massengils murder she said pretty well actually most of them didnt seem to have that clear a picture of who he was it seems like a pretty remote experience for them i dealt with the cause and effect thing thanks for getting me on the right track she filled my glass then hers catch the six oclock news no you were right about massengil theyre turning him into a saint and latchs best friend latch oh yeah center stage delivering a eulogy in council chambers going on about how he and sam had enjoyed their differences but through it all thered been a mutual respect an appreciation for the process of giveandtake whatever then condolences to the widow a formal proposal to make it a day of official mourning for the beloved leader the whole thing sounded like a campaign speech beloved leader i said everyone loves him now even the guy massengil punched out dimarco had nice things to say nothing like death to enhance the old public image if his corpse were up for reelection hed probably win i raised my glass what a concept suicide as a campaign tactic the possibilities are fascinating like adding the post of official exhumer to the cabinet both of us laughed she said lord this is grisly but im sorry i just cant start liking him because hes dead i remember how he used us and what he liked to do with that call girl ugh i said any mention of dobbs through all of this respected psychologist consultant et cetera no mention of his working at the school she nodded that was the respected psychologist part they made it sound as if hed been treating the kids all along so much for an informed press there were also a few questions about a possible connection to the sniping but frisk brushed them off with doubletalk every contingency being investigated top secret et cetera et cetera not that any copsve been down to talk to us she licked her lips then latch goes out in front of city hall rolls up his sleeves and lowers the flag to halfmast himself looking real solemn twenty years ago he was probably burning it people have short memories i said he proved that by getting elected hes gotten his foothold now hes angling for respectability the great conciliator combine that with the dejon concert and the fact that it was his man who saved the day and hell probably go down as the hero in this whole thing she shook her head all the stuff they dont teach you in civics class when you get down to it theyre all the same arent they one big power trip no matter what they claim they stand for no matter what wing she said what is it alex whats what all of a sudden you got this look on your face as if the wine was bad no im fine i said you didnt look fine her voice was soft but insistent i felt pressure around my fingers shed taken my hand was squeezing it i said okay beady for more weirdness i told her about ike novatos research wannsee ii the new confederation she said crazies on both ends putting their heads together what a lovely thought the expert at the holocaust center doubts it actually took place and if anyone would know she would thats good she said because that is too weird we both drank wine i said hows matt the car basher working out no troubles so far ive got him doing scut stuff wanted to show him who was boss right at the outset hes really a meek little kid in an overgrown body pretty docile no social skills a real follower sounds like holly sure does she said wonder how many of them like that are out there she let go of my hand touched her wineglass but didnt raise it to her lips silence enveloped us i heard other couples talking laughing move your chair she said sit next to me i want to feel you right next to me i did the table was narrow and our shoulders touched she rested her fingers on my knee i put my arm around her and drew her closer her body was taut resistant a tremulous highfrequency hum seemed to course through it she said lets get out of here just be by ourselves i threw money on the table was up in a flash as far as i could tell no one followed us home we fell asleep holding each other by sixthirty the next morning wed shifted to opposite sides of the bed she opened one eye rolled back to me put her leg over my hip fit me to her eager for union but when it was over she was quick to get out of bed i said everything all right dandy she bent kissed me full on the lips pulled away and went into the shower by the time i got there she was out toweling off i reached out to hold her she let me but just for a moment then danced away saying busy day she left without eating breakfast i sensed a reserve a trace of the old chill as if the nougliness rule had sheltered us for a few hours but at the expense of intimacy i showered alone made coffee and sat down with terry crevolins book downright turgid would be flattery the book was full of typos and grammatical errors if editing had taken place i couldnt see it crevolin had a fondness for twohundredword sentences random italics creative capitalization frequent references to ottoman manipulation mercantile demonics the new statemanagement bank and quotations from chairman mao in wars of national liberation patriotism is applied internationalism a sample sentence read none of the existent forms of conscious revolutionary rhetoric or transcultural revolutionary activity thus devised by the labor discipline and related labor vanguards as means of eliminating commodityism and mercantile demonics seem so far able to selfdefend against a steadily diminishing proletarian consciousness fermented by an anarchic carnivalous mirrorgratifying and ultimately dissipated pseudoideology concurrently nurtured by the power structure all that and pictures too photosnippets culled from textbooks and magazines some of them sloppily handcolored in crayon headshots of marx engels lenin trotsky and for reasons i couldnt comprehend buddha shakespeare and a rhesus monkey clothcapped workers waiting in bread lines byzantine icons greek statuary dustbowl migrants with faces out of a woody guthrie song the egyptian pyramids butterflies two pages of ancient weapons maces halberds long swords a sherman tank i tried to make some sense of it but the words passed through me without being digested literary fiber my eyes blurred and my head began to hurt i flipped to the last chapter in hopes of finding a summation some central message i could make sense of something that would tell me why ike novato had sought out the author what i found was a twopage spread of a crayoned mushroom cloud captioned bear lodge rip the greats on the next page was a photoreproduction of a newspaper story from the new york times april the word lies in large red letters had been handprinted diagonally over the copy the red letters were grainy i read through them idaho blast the result of radical bomb factory accident says fbi bear lodge idaho federal and local law enforcement authorities in this rural logging community report that an enormous explosion that took place during the early morning hours was the result of the accidental detonation of a cache of high explosives stockpiled by leftwing radicals conspiring to carry out a program of domestic terrorism and violent political protest the explosion described by witnesses as a firestorm occurred at am and totally demolished a former lumber warehouse and several vacant outbuildings a half mile outside bear lodge in addition to setting off fires in surrounding heavily forested areas that took six hours to suppress structures within the town of bear lodge experienced shattered windows and minor wood and masonry damage no bear lodge residents reported injuries but ten people in the warehouse are believed to have perished the ground just started shaking it felt like an earthquake said nellie barthel owner of the maybe drop inn tavern and truck stop in bear lodge as she swept up broken bottles and glasses or one of those sonic booms but a lot louder then we saw the fire and smoke pouring into the sky from the east and we knew something had happened out there with those people at the old log depository tax documents obtained in twin falls reveal that the titled owner of the warehouse mountain properties had leased the hundredyearold clapboard building the previous august for a sixmonth period to an m bakunin believed to be an alias alluding to th century russian anarchist mikhail aleksandrovich bakunin bakunins stated purpose on the lease agreement was storage of agricultural materials and food employees and officers of mountain properties were not available for comment however residents of bear lodge pop report increased activity in the vicinity of the warehouse during recent weeks the outsiders hauling truckloads of fertilizer sawdust sugar and other materials along the quartermile service road leading to the fourstory storage building they must have bought the stuff somewhere else because they never came into town to shop said dayton auhagen a buckskinclad trapper who sometimes camped in the nowcharred forests surrounding the warehouse auhagen described the warehouse tenants as not from anywhere around these parts but they minded their own business and we minded ours thats the way it is out here were all individualists southern idaho regional fbi agentincharge morrison stowe had another view of the blast victims they were political radicals suspected of acts of urban terrorism or conspiracy to commit terrorism the substances they were stockpiling are all potential nitrating agents and thus have a potential role in the manufacture of nitroglycerinebased explosives although he declined to specify the precise process of bomb manufacture stowe did say its not all that difficult during the last couple of years there have been several manuals circulating among the subversive underground bomb cookbooks that make doityourselfing sound easy what they dont emphasize sufficiently is that nitroglycerine is an extremely unstable compound no matter how you cook it up minute variations in heat or humidity can set it off we believe thats what happened here these individuals were manufacturing bombs an accidental detonation occurred and they blew themselves up stowe added that while the force of the blast was so great as to render identification of bodies virtually impossible eyewitness accounts combined with a careful and longstanding investigation led the bureau to believe that at least ten individuals perished in the blast including two young children and that no members of the group escaped he listed the blast victims as thomas harrison mader bruckner of darien connecticut a columbia university graduate teaching assistant in sociology at the university of california berkeley and founding member of the violent weathermen offshoot of students for a democratic society sds bruckner was scion of an old colonial family whose members have included several congressmen and a signer of the declaration of

fidel frantz rodriguezsantana months of the bronx new york the son of rodriguez and santana asked why members of groups such as the black revolutionary armed forces and the weathermen which had been known to have experienced significant ideological differences in the past had cooperated in assembling the explosives cache agent stowe said our information is that they were trying a unityisstrength approach all the major subversive groups have fallen upon hard times successful prosecution and imprisonment of leaders and exposure of their true goals have decimated their ranks and new recruits are rare the only ones left tend to be hardcore violent radicals this appears to have been a lastditch effort to establish a radical confederation in order to disrupt society and damage lives and property

revolutionaries have to party arms around shoulders smiling faces the joy of camaraderie a few pairs of marijuana eyes several heads had been haloed in black crayon five men three women handwritten names above each thomas bruckner and catherine lockerby stood together in the center of the front row he pearshaped and stooped in a faded work shirt and jeans with limp brown shoulderlength hair and a thick drooping mustache that obscured the bottom half of his face she big heavilybuilt barefooted wearing a batik muumuu with her blond hair drawn back severely thin lips yielded reluctantly to mirth piercing eyes strong jaw in another place another time she might have matured to a horsey society woman next to her stood tonio rodriguez mediumsized and clean shaven surprisingly cleancut his

to the far right side of the second row were the haloed visages of norman and melba green next to melba was an unhaloed face that i recognized roundish freckled an unruly mop of dark hair pinched features round tortoiseshell eyeglasses the kind the british welfare department used to distribute for free a skimpy mustache and feathery vandyke that had the pastedon look of theatrical costumery but take away the facial hair add a few years and it was the same man id run into in a classroom playing a harmonica same man id seen introducing a rock star even back then gordon latch had worn a politicians smile i stared at his picture for a while creating hypotheses running with them hitting brick walls trying again finally turning my attention back to the greens norman green had been very tall from the way he towered over the others at least six three or four he had coarse dark hair parted in the middle and held in place with a leather thong roman nose thick dark eyebrows long handsome face rendered lincolnesque by a bushy mustacheless beard something about the face familiar his wife was of medium height which brought the top of her head to his bicep black and pretty but severelooking as if preoccupied she wore a collarless white blouse ebony bead necklaces and huge ebony hoop earrings haughty smile fluffy afro above a fineboned oval face the carvedmask good looks of an african princess her face familiar too black woman white man it made me think of something i turned back pages to the newspaper clipping malcolm isaac green of oakland california seventeen years ago seventeen plus two the timeframe fit hispanic name on a black kid i went into the library scrounged until i found my spanishenglish dictionary page novatom novice beginner flip to the englishspanish side page greenadj verde novato inexperto i put the book down and got on the phone still unable to reach milo unable to get a bored desk officer at the west side station to tell me where he was where were the cops when you needed them i remembered judy baumgartners account of her cryptic conversation with lke relax your standards if i was interpreting my dictionary correctly that made sense i phoned her again at the holocaust center her secretary informed me she was out of the office and was cagey about saying more remembering what judy had said about death threats i didnt push but finally managed to convince the secretary that i was legitimate then she told me judy had flown back to chicago wasnt expected back for three days did i want to leave a message thinking about what kind of message i could leave i declined and thanked her as i hung up i thought of someone else whod be able to firm up my theory i looked up the number of the beth shalom synagogue and dialed it no one answered the directory yielded three sanders d only one with no address listed and a venice exchange i called it a woman with an accent similar to the rabbis answered childrens voices filled the background along with what sounded like recorded music rabbi sanders please who may i say is calling alex delaware i met him at the synagogue the other day along with detective sturgis one moment sanders came on saying yes detective delaware any progress on sophie still an ongoing investigation i said amazing how easy that came yes of course what can i do for you ive got a theological question for you rabbi what are orthodox judaisms criteria for determining if someones jewish basically there are two he said one must either be born to a jewish mother or undergo a proper conversion conversion is predicated upon a course of study having a jewish father wouldnt be enough no only the reform jews have accepted patrilineal descent thank you babbi is that all yes youve been very helpful have i does your question have anything to do with sophie i hedged repeated the open investigation line thanked him for his time and hung up tried milo again beth at the station and at home at the former the desk officers boredom had progressed to torpor answering machine at the latter i told it what id learned then i tried the network again mr crevolins in a meeting when will he be free i cant say sir i called yesterday dr alex delaware regarding ike novato im sure he got your message sir then how about we try to get his attention with a new message i dont really tell him bear lodge claimed nine victims not ten barry lodge bear as in the animal lodge as in henry cab as in hunting lodge bear lodge its a place it claimed nine victims not ten one second she said im still writing you can also tell him that apathy claimed the tenth just a few months ago apathy and indifference apathy and indifference she said is this some kind of concept for a script cause if it is i know for a fact the seasons completely programmed and its really not worth pitching anything until they clear the board for the next sweeps not a concept i said a true story and it would never play on prime time she called me back an hour later to say hell see you at four unable to keep the surprise out of her voice at five to four i walked across a network parking lot crammed with german and swedish cars i was wearing a tan gabardine suit and carrying my briefcase a roving security guard in his seventies took down my name and directed me to a flight of metal stairs that led up to the second floor of the bulky deco building on the way i passed a canopied waiting area filled with hundreds of people lined up for tickets to the latest latenight talk show a few of them rotated their heads to inspect me decided i was nobody to be concerned with and turned their attention elsewhere at the top of the stairs were double plateglass doors the reception area was big as a barn thirty feet high walls bare except for a giant reproduction of the network logo on the south side and just below it a door marked private the floor was travertine tile over which a surprisingly shabby maroon area rug had been laid in the precise center of the rug was a rectangular glass coffee table hard black leather sling chairs ran along both sides on the far side of the room a young black security guard sat behind a white counter to his left a white actionvision monitor played some sort of game show the sound was off i gave him my name he opened a ledger ran his finger down a page turned to the next page did more fingerwalking stopped made a call on a white phone listened and said uhhuh okay yeah to me be a couple of minutes whyncha have a seat i tried to get comfortable in the sling chair the glass table was empty no magazines not even an ashtray i said nothing to read that supposed to be a philosophical statement the guard looked over as if noticing that for the first time chuckled and returned his attention to the monitor a hefty woman in a print dress was bouncing up and down embracing a male host who was trying hard to maintain a blowdried smile as the woman continued to hug him the smile finally faded the host tried to get loose she held tight colored lights flashed in the background the guard saw me looking they turn off the sound dont ask me why i just started thats some kind of new showfair fight i think it is still trying to figure out exactly what its all about what i think it is is that you got to insult your friends give away their secrets in order to answer questions and win the big money the host finally pried himself free of the hefty woman she started bouncing again the name tag on her bosom fluttered despite her bulk she was firm as a canned ham the host smiled again and pointed and said something in the background a beautycontest runnerup in a black minidress spun something that resembled a bingo bin the camera closed in on numbers incandescing along a giant roulette wheel rimmed with flashing light bulbs the guard studied the screen squinting tough to know what theyre saying he said i figure a couple of more weeks on the job and ill be able to read lips i settled back and closed my eyes at fourten the private door opened and a young woman with strawberryblond hair stepped out she wore a sequined red tshirt over black jeans and had a reluctant tired smile dr delaware terry can see you now she gave the door a shove and walked through leaving me to catch it treating walking as if it were an athletic event she took me past a halfempty secretarial area to a short bright hallway marked by six or seven doors the third door was open she said here waited until i went in and left no one was in the office it was a mediumsized room with an eastern view of more parking lot tarpaper rooftops intestinal twists of hammered metal ductwork and the smogsoftened contours of central la the walls were gray grass cloth the carpeting tightnap industrial tinted the dull aqua of a poorly serviced swimming pool floating in the center was a clearplastic desk with matching chair perpendicular to the desk was an anorexic couch upholstered in slateblue tweed facing the desk were two blue chairs with chrome legs warm and comfy as an operating room three of the gray walls were unadorned the one behind the desk was filled with color animation celluloids cinderella pinocchio fantasia given what judy had told me i hadnt expected political posters but disney took me by surprise my gaze lingered on snow white about to accept a poisoned apple from a gleeful crone a man came in cupping his hand to his mouth and coughing forty or close to it short with a pallid softfeatured face under a saltandpepper newwave crew cut stiff with butch wax one of the faces that had been in the group photo younger thinner long hair second row right i thought shadowed by norman greens towering height he stared at me there were sooty bags under his eyes a gold stud sparkled in his left ear he wore a baggy black bomber jacket over a gray silk tshirt gray sharkskin trousers with pegged cuffs black hightop reeboks he sat down the height of the apple in the snow white cel was such that it appeared to sit atop his head william tell in melrose avenue duds he said terry crevolin incongruous bass voice alex delaware so ive been told sit as i did he got up and locked the door two silk tshirts exactly like the one he was wearing hung on drycleaners hangers from a hook on the back he returned to the desk sifted through papers for a few moments then said yeah you look like a doctor what kind of doctor are you psychologist psychologist but you know about what plays in prime time i said i know bear lodge sure wouldnt too long ago and times have changed no one cares much about a hunch of radical freaks blowing themselves up one of his eyes twitched he looked at my briefcase we had ourselves a little staring contest he was pretty good at it plenty of practice no doubt with desperate writers pitching concepts but id sat through tens of thousands of hours of therapy on the doctors side of the couch waited out every evasion known to mankind finally he said i was given the impression you had something for me a concept if you do lets hear it if not shrug sure i said heres a concept adolescent search for identit its been done not like this my protagonist is a bright young kid orphaned at a very young age goodlooking idealistic halfblack halfjewish his parents are political radicals who die under suspicious circumstances seventeen years later he tries to find out how and why and ends up getting murdered for his efforts set up in a phony drug bust lots of good stuff in between but probably too downbeat huh something that could have been pain scuttled across his face he said youve lost me ike novato novato as in spanish for novice novice as in green the little boy who once belonged to norman and melba green crevolin inspected his nails i said he tried to see you this past summer couldnt get through lots of people try to see me not about bear lodge he peered at a cuticle do lots of them get murdered mr crevolin some color came into his face boy this sounds pretty dramatic he was murdered check it out for yourself last september drug deal gone wrong down in watts funny thing is though people who know him say he never used drugs had no reason to go to watts people he said theres no way to know someone to really know what goes on in someones head especially a kid right the whole kick about being young is keeping secrets right creating your own private world and keeping everyone else out of it if youre really a shrink you should know that ike novatos secrets were dangerous i said they may have killed him and his grandmother too an old woman who lived in venice named sophie gruenberg his mouth opened then closed i said she disappeared a few days after he was killed the police think someone disappeared her theyve got no leads cant seem to connect any of it think maybe theres a dope connection but ill just bet theyd love to talk to you he said oh shit i said gruenberg to green green to novato the family had a thing for name changes but they kept the hue consistent when did norman green change his he didnt his old man did for business the father was bourgeois the mother didnt approve of the name change after the old man died she changed it back but norm didnt no he liked the old man politically he saw eye to eye with his mother but she was hard to get along with abrasive emotionally she and norm werent close his nostrils flared and closed he rolled his lips over his teeth chewed on a pinkie listen im sorry to hear all this whats it got to do with me bad bluffer pinocchio would have laughed and lent him his nose i said i think you know one family destroyed three generations exterminated because the wrong people got asked the wrong questions asking you might have been safer but ike couldnt get through he waved a hand frantically dont lay that on me youre laying it on yourself youve never forgotten bear lodge thats why you agreed to see me he slumped ran his fingers through his spiky hair checked the time on a wristwatch thin enough to fit through a coin slot i said getting his message last summer brought back those memories full force you probably considered seeing him your idealism may be longburied under a heap of game shows but he sat up i dont do game shows youre still a person of principles or so its been suggested yeah by who judy baumgartner at the holocaust center she says you helped them get that documentary produced shes the one who told me about your book his expression turned sour he pulled something out of his jacket pocket an orange lollipop that he unwrapped with stealth and haste as if it were a forbidden pleasure he jammed it in his mouth sat back hands folded across his belly pacified principles huh whyd you turn him down i said too painful opening old wounds or was it just inertia all those meetings you take every day you simply didnt have the energy to handle another one he yanked out the lollipop started to say something gagged on it and stood up turning his back to me he faced the rear wall taking in his cartoon buddies i said fairy godmothers and glass slippers would that life were so simple you with the government he said no show me some id i took my drivers license psychology license and medical school affiliation out of my wallet and handed them to him got major credit cards too if you want to see them he turned around examined them gave them back doesnt really mean anything does it you could be who the papers say you are and still be government i could but im not he shrugged and what if you are like you said times have changed no one cares anymore whats my crime shifting gears into a survival mode whats the penalty gonna be working at another network i smiled how about working with game shows he leaned forward come on level with me whats this really about its about what i told you i want to ask you some of the questions ike novato never got to ask why whats your connection to him were you his shrink no i never met him but ive been looking into the death of one of his friends a young girl named holly burden i waited for a sign of recognition got none i said her family asked me to do a psychological autopsy to try to understand why she died that led me to ike he was one of the few friends shed had a confidant i traced him back to the holocaust center some books he checked out on racism hed written your name and number in a margin judy was certain he hadnt met you there thought he might have tried to reach you because of your previous life i opened the briefcase and pulled out his book i bought this today read the bear lodge story and saw the berkeley picture figured out who ike really was he sat down put the lollipop back in his mouth and withdrew it quickly as if it had lost its flavor some literary masterpiece huh i was coming down from acid and mushrooms and methedrine chasers when i wrote that flashing back and seeing god one superstoked weekend no revisions i didnt even come up for air pulitzer prize stuff it aint dont sell yourself short i said it had a certain raw energy passion the kind you probably dont experience much anymore look he said stiffening if you think youre going to come in here and lay all this guilt on me for surviving forget it ive worked that through with my own psychologist im happy for you terry too bad ike wont be working anything through we locked eyes again again he broke first a cave he said thats where i ended up thats where i wrote the damned thing in a cave okay you understand thats how i was living after bear lodge like some neanderthal because i had no rich daddy like so many of the others in the movement no trust fund nothing to fall back on when the dream ended i couldnt get a serious job because id dropped out to fight the good fight after one semester i had a d average no skills to do anything other than march around and chant and the market for chanters wasnt too hot after the dream died unless you felt like doing some hare krishna freelancing i even tried that but their bullshit got to me their scams and their stinking incense all i knew was picking fruit digging ditches stoop work thats the kind of stuff i grew up doing on a scrub lot that never went anywhere because my daddy couldnt compete with the big growers and died with more debts than good sense i headed up the coast picking my hands bloody bunking with the illegals i was in yuba city when they started digging up all the braceros corona had hacked up the guy whod bunked next to me had disappeared victim number twentythree that scared me outa there up to oregon my cave picking plums by day playing neanderthal by night scared me into a clear head too no acid no pills not even hash or grass no betty ford clinic just me and the long nights and the creepycrawlies to help get through it i started writing the ultimate therapy right abby had done it jerry had done it why not me the end result was that piece of stupidity youre holding in your hot little hands the first draft was dull pencil on sheets of ledger paper i ripped off from the shift boss at night using a flashlight later when i had a couple of bucks i bought a notebook and some bics i wrote other stuff too poetry that sucked short stories that sucked a tv script that sucked comedy lots of comedy in order to laugh myself out of suicide same plot line over and over revolutionaries who work for ibm but cant quite hack the straight life ha ha funny right i convinced myself it was profound convinced myself no one was out to kill me anymore and hitched down to la showered shaved at the union station bought a suit at the salvation army walked all the way to this center of spiritual purity and tried to get my script read couldnt get a foot in the door but downstairs there was a sign saying they were hiring pages i faked a wholesome attitude got the job first money i earned was used to publish the piece of crap first printing of three hundred copies never went into a second i peddled it to head shops on consignment never saw a dime learned hippie entrepreneurs were the worst learned i wasnt going to be mr bestseller time to shift to another tack so i worked every scut job the network offered me worked my way up to this i wont bore you with the details sounds like the american dream hey its a free country really is i learned that the hard way testing the system starting at rock bottom and taking it to the limits which is more than most people ever do thats not to say there isnt plenty thats rotten in the system hut whats better the ayatollah the chinese so im here for the long haul trying to get through each day paying my mortgage i know what i do every day isnt feeding starving orphans it isnt heart surgery but i try to get some quality through when i can okay its no better or worse than anyone elses gig right which is what i want now to be like anyone else blend in concentrate on terry learn to be selfcentered drive a car with leather seats sit in the jacuzzi at night listen to compact discs and get philosophical just get through each day he pointed a finger at me i paid more dues longer than anyone else i know so forget your guilt i said your guilt isnt my concern other people paid dues too the ultimate dues norm and melba green the rest of the gang at bear lodge im sure any of them would be happy to trade places with you he closed his eyes rubbed his eyelids oh boy everything comes back like a wheel doesnt it i said you were part of the group werent you what made you decide not to show up the day of the big blast decide eye twitch who decided it was an accidenttwist of fate if i read it in a script id call it hokey howd you escape i was babysitting taking the kid to the doctor which kid malcolm isaac he was sick why didnt his parents take him because they were sick too all of them were puking their guts out some kind of intestinal thing diarrhea fever something they ate bad meat id just come up the day before there were two groups you see two cadres i was part of the second brought communications from the second to the first we were all supposed to get together in a week or so i was a vegetarian back then didnt eat the meat that saved me me and the other kid rodriguez and santanas son fidel fidelito he said he was just a baby too young for meat on formula because teresa couldnt nurse so he was healthy too crawling around the warehouse fat and happy but malcolm isaac had it bad really high fever diarrhea crying in pain melba was worried about dehydration wanted him to see a doctor but she and norm were too sick to take him themselves so they asked me and i did public health clinic in twin falls me and him and a bunch of loggers and indians in the waiting room they had a countrywestern station on and he was wailing over it in pain that didnt impress the nurses they turned up the volume made us wait porter wagoner and dolly parton funny the things you remember huh i was holding him wiping his forehead with alcohol pads when i heard it beep beep news bulletin breaking into the country music his own brow had broken out in sweat he wiped it with the back of his sleeve big explosion at a warehouse in bear lodge no one else in the waiting room was even listening they could care less but to me it was like everything was caving in like a big hole in the earth everything just being vacuumed into it then the fbi guy comes on and starts talking about some bomb factory lying through his governmentissue teeth and i knew someone had shafted them knew i had to run there was no bomb factory he gave me a disgusted look right lard and sugar and horse manure and sawdust we were making a produce nuke right if it was that easy half the farms in america wouldve blown up before ronnie raygun screwed them over half the farms in america dont have igniting devices neither did we the fbi stooge either made that up or planted it the supplies wed stockpiled were for growing not destroying seeds fertilizer organic fertilizer the sawdust was for compost the lard was for cooking and making tortillas teresa loved to make tortillas the plan was to stockpile enough stuff to put together a decentsized collective farm big enough to be viable a new walden we were gonna move in on government land that was going to waste just a few miles south land that was ripped off from the indians in the first place the plan was to squat on it liberate it homestead it plow sow then invite the indians to join us in the establishment of a new collective state we knew it wouldnt last tricky dickys nazis would move in and overrun us all we wanted was to last long enough to create something viable for the press the publicity would put us in a good light the government destroying crops whats more allamerican than farming right so wed be the good guys black and white and brown and red working together the establishment would be seen as putting out all the negative energy too threatening so they destroyed it whos they the government or some freelance running dogs working for the government someone had to have poisoned the meat planted charges waited until all of us were in that warehouse puking weakened then blew it to kingdomcome some sort of remotecontrol detonator death knell for the dream collective farming i said its not exactly what comes to mind when you think of the weathermen faln the black army people like mark grossman and skitch dupree thats cause youve been programmed to think that way everyone in that warehouse everyone in new walden was a fugitive from violence we were sick of violence sick of the way things had turned tonio and teresa had just quit faln skitch had taken a lot of crap for renouncing violence even got shot at by black revo army dudes because he changed his tune norm and melba were the architects of the plan theyd turned their heads totally away from violence he shook his head bomb factory do you think norm and melba and tonio and teresa would have brought their kids into some bomb factory people had brought their babies to jim jones sacrificed countless other innocents to other molochs i didnt say anything he said i sat in that clinic waiting room and i knew everything was over i wanted to run but malcolm was hot as a skillet needed to see the doctor so i sat and waited and hoped no one could see i was ready to burst out of my skin finally we got seen by a nurse after all that time she gave me medicine told me hed probably be okay once the fever broke to give him lots of fluids come back in a couple of days i left walked around the corner carrying him kept walking until i found a car with the keys left in the ignition got in laid him across the front seat started it up drove all the way through nevada into california stopped to buy apple juice and diapers driving while holding a bottle to his lips hundreds of miles of nightmares roads with no one else on them him screaming for his mama me constantly thinking someone was gonna get on my tail gun us down made it all the way to la before dawn to venice i said he nodded like i said theyd never gotten along she and norm but where else could i take him i left him on the doorstep and split i opened his book turned to the berkeley picture and showed it to him the other people they were the second cadre another nod they were a hundred miles up the snake river negotiating for building materials the plan was to build log cabins they had bought the stuff from a logging contractor but got delayed trying to find some way to haul it down teamsters gave em grief didnt want to deal with a bunch of goddam hippies whatd they do after the explosion disappeared mostly up to canada he took the book gazed at it closed his eyes i said what happened to them he opened his eyes and sighed these two he jabbed a finger harry and debbie delage they stayed up there they were french canadian i think theyre teachers in montreal but im not sure havent had contact with them with any of them the finger drifted ed maher and julie bendix went to morocco moved around and then came back got married had a bunch of kids i heard she died of breast cancer a couple of years ago hes probably back east his family had money lyle stokes got involved in this new age crap crystals and past lives hes making a fortune sandy porter i dont know gordy latch married that fascists daughter and became a scumbag politician jack parduccis a lawyer in pittsburgh joined the gop he stared at the picture a while longer closed the book and gave it back fuck nostalgia i said who determined which cadre someone went into it wasnt anything formal just kind of natural selection the first cadre were the leaders thinkers theorists i said the second cadre fared a hell of a lot better than the first what are you getting at nothing you havent wondered about yourself for seventeen years youre wrong he said i dont wonder about anything wonderings a deadend street i said whyd you choose bear lodge randy latch owned the property her father had left it to her she was mountain properties behind a bunch of dummy corporations trust fund stuff tax shelters her old man set it up for her thats why we pretended to lease it so it would look businesslike no one would dig into it with those connections i said didnt latch aspire to firstcadre status he might have but that wasnt a serious possibility he was lots of noise no substance not well respected one of the reasons they kept him around was her money after bear lodge the two of them dropped out reappeared as jack and mrs armstrong still lots of noise no substance the american public eats that up right no surprise he ended up doing what hes doing tell me about wannsee two he sat up straight where the hell did that come from ike novato left some notes indicating he was researching it he wrote it right above your name he wondered about it crevolin gave a sick look thats what he wanted to talk to me about hell that would have been easy easy in what way easy to answer i could have told him the truth wannsee two is governmentissue drivel tricky dicky evil empire cointelpro disinformation tailormade for john q gullible the government wanted to discredit us so they planted bogus news items in the establishment press about us getting together with the neonazi fringe the old crapola about extremists on both ends being equivalent hitler and stalin tarring us with the same brush as the kkk in order to isolate us make us look bad but in the end i guess it was just easier to blow us up notice how you dont hear about wannsee two anymore and there are plenty of rightwing racist assholes running around he shook his head rubbed his temples wannsee two i could have handled that in two minutes i thought he wanted to get into personal stuff his parents raking up old memories could sophie gruenberg have been interested in wannsee two doubt it that old lady was too sophisticated to be taken in by that kind of crap you knew her well his headshake was vehement i only met her once with norm but he talked about her said she was a revolutionary of the old stripe wellread intellectual even though he didnt get along with her he respected her intellect you only met her once he was silent i caught his eye he said twice when i returned to la doing my little network page gig i checked in with her to see how things were going with ike with the world he twisted his lip between thumb and forefinger i said did you really just leave him on the step you bet i did it was all i could do to hide and wait until she took him in going there in the first place was a risk i was totally freakedout wanted to get the hell out of town before the men in the gray suits came calling i figured eventually someone would figure out i hadnt been blown up and try to finish the job he laughed no one bothered all these years i said you mentioned the feds running dogs any suspects sure he said there were these weird trapper types skulking around in the forest mountain men long hair beards homemade buckskins eating grubs and whatever living off the land like redford in jeremiah johnson we kind of did a mutual ignoring thing with them but later when i had time to think i started to wonder because using them would have been a perfect government setup we were naïve we trusted anyone who looked counterculture crewcut types sneaking around would have gotten us immediately paranoid but those hairy fuckers we ignored theyd been there before we got there didnt seem to have any real interest in us also we respected the way they were doing their own thing thought of them as hippies with guns and bowie knives macho freaks we were jazzed by the whole liveofftheland bit thats what we were aiming for so it would have been easy for one of them to sneak in plant the bombs and sneak out they were probably gmen or agents provocateurs probably pushing paper in toledo today which is punishment enough right the bitterness in his voice put the lie to his last statement i said did you discuss any of these suspicions with sophie gruenberg the time you dropped by didnt have to moment she closed the door she sat me down and started lecturing to me about how the explosion had been a government plot norm and melba and the others were martyrs no tears she was very tough just anger this hot rage that made it seem as if she was vibrating he smiled she was a tough old lady i could see her running a guillotine back in bastille days whered she send ike to be raised what makes you think she sent him anywhere hed just moved to la a few months before his death told people hed been living back east that makes sense someone as suspicious as sophie might be nervous keeping the son of martyrs around in plain view i dont know the details he said when i asked about him she said shed sent him away to relatives said government people had come snooping around pretty soon after the blast asking questions of the neighbors she called them goddam cossacks said if they found out she had him with her theyd kidnap him or something claim she was unfit and take him away she said he needed to be in a safe place for a while i took that to mean temporary she was planning to bring him back but i guess she could have kept him away the whole time any idea where these relatives lived she didnt say and i didnt ask i kind of assumed it was philadelphia because norm was born there the family used to live there you only dropped in on her once thats it she was part of what id put behind me so was malcolm isaac thats why i didnt see him it wasnt just apathy what would have been the point his tension had lifted him out of his chair and his skin had turned waxy his eyes kept moving up and down side to side back at the cartoon characters everywhere but at me i said i understand do you to understand youve got to know what its like to be a hunted animal mainlining adrenaline looking over your shoulder hearing things seeing things peeing your pants afraid to move afraid not to move convinced every tree is a storm trooper not knowing whats real and whats not when that bullets gonna come flying by or the blade or the time bomb turning you into instant smog by the time i dropped in on her id finally managed to pull myself out of that insanity working at my page gig renting a little bachelor apartment going to the supermarket the laundromat the filling station eating swanson tv dinners and hot dogs no more macrobiotics i was ready for some nitritecramming like a real american doing regularperson stuff so happy and grateful to be alive i mean i couldnt believe they werent coming after me couldnt believe they were letting me live and work and eat hot dogs and do my thing and no one was trying to blow me up he tugged at his cheeks created a sad mask it took me a long time to get there to realize no one cared about any of it anymore the war was over nixon had gone down eldridge was marketing codpiecepants jerry and abby were doing wall street the talkshow circuit leary was asshole buddy with g gordon liddy fascists were wearing long hair and beards hippies going for crewcuts boundaries blurring all the old myths dead live and let live bygones were bygones it was my turn to live i worked at living malcolm isaacs call came at a bad time id just gotten engaged to be married was planning to go away with my lady real vacation bring a little romance into my life better late than never right weve since broken up but at the time it looked liked forever rice and flowers i had my tickets in my hand when he called out the door last thing i wanted to deal with was the past what would have been the point no point i said gotta keep moving forward he said no point in looking back right right but a plain truth filled the space between us unseen but corrosive no one had cared because hed been second cadre all the way too unimportant to kill i pulled out of the network lot this time someone followed me at first i wasnt sure wondered if the time spent immersed in crevolins fugitive memories had made me paranoid the first hint of suspicion came at olympic and la cienega just east of beverly hills as i squinted into a platinum sunset glare that ate through my shades a tan car two lengths behind me changed lanes the moment my eyes hit the mirror for the twentieth time i slowed the tan car slowed i looked back trying to make out the driver saw only a vague outline two outlines i slowed some more received an angry honk for my efforts i picked up speed the tan car held back stretching the distance between us we cruised that way for a while then hit a red light at la peer when things got moving again i eased into the fast lane and put on as much speed as the crush would allow the tan car continued to hold back retreated into vehicular anonymity by doheny drive i couldnt see it anymore so much for high intrigue i tried to relax but kept drifting back to exploding warehouses my imagination gorged itself on conspiracy theories until my head started to hurt then i noticed it again center lane two lengths behind i managed to get into the center lane the tan car moved out of it into the fast lane coming up on my left wanting a better view making sure not to move my head i snuck a peek in the mirror still there traffic in the right lane was dragging a bit now i squeezed into it settled into the slower pace hoping for a view of my own the vehicles that had been in back of me whizzed by i kept an eye to the left waiting for the tan car to pass nothing rearview peek gone another light at beverly behind me again two lengths it took until roxbury for me to get back into the fast lane the tan car stayed with me all the way to century city the sun was nearly down headlights came on the tan car became a pair of yellow spots indistinguishable from hundreds of others the loss of visibility made me feel violated though i knew i was also less easy to spot anger took the place of fear felt a whole lot better than fear practicewhatyoupreach time doc bestdefenseisagoodoffense time doc just before overland i made a sudden move into the center lane then the right drove a block and made a quick turn onto a side street just past a ralphs market speeding a hundred yards i doused my lights pulled over to the side and waited the engine still running residential street small nicely kept houses tall trees no foot traffic lots of parked cars on both sides my turn to blend in the first set of headlights from olympic belonged to a gray porsche that zipped by at fifty per and pulled into a driveway at the end of the block i made out the shape of a man with a briefcase he disappeared into one of the bungalows soon after came a dodge ram van with the logo of a plumbing company on the side driving at moderate speed it stopped at the next corner and turned right then nothing for several minutes i waited almost ready to concede the afternoon to paranoia when i heard an automotive hum coming from olympic heard but didnt see the side mirror revealed a faintly resolving image just a hint of chrome under streetlight a car with its headlights off making its way slowly toward me the hum grew louder i slumped low the tan car cruised by at ten per plymouth sedan not unlike the unmarked milo used not unlike the car hed thought had been following us on our way to the holocaust center ten miles per slow cruise the way cops cruise when theyre looking for trouble my engine suddenly sounded deafening they had to hear i should have turned it off but the tan car kept going turned right and disappeared i pulled out keeping my lights off and went after it caught up just as it made another right turn tried to read the license plate couldnt got closer not close enough to make out any details of the two people inside i nudged the accelerator came just short of tailgating switched on my lights nonreflector plates a number two letters four more numbers i shot a mental snapshot developed it just as the passenger swiveled sharply and looked back the tan sedan came to a sudden stop i jammed on the brakes to avoid rearending it for a moment i thought thered be a confrontation was prepared to back away but the tan car peeled rubber and took off i let it go preserving letters and numbers in my head until i got home still no luck reaching milo where the hell was he i called his house and got the machine again phoned the cedarssinai emergency room and asked for dr silverman kick was in the middle of surgery unable to come to the phone i called the machine again and recited the tan cars license number explained why it was important to trace it as quickly as possible and gave a summary of what id learned from terry crevolin talking to the damned thing as if it were corporeal an old pal mahlon burden would have been proud of me when i was through i phoned linda at home hi she said have you seen it yet seen what the massengil stuff hitting the fan right now the six oclock news call me back when youve had your fill of it the newscast was featuring the second assassination of the late assemblyman this one not nearly as quick and clean as the ambush in sheryl jane jacksons backyard a photo of massengil that could have been a mug shot an old one of cheri t in a corkscrew hairdo and white eye shadow that was the jail photographer had preserved her looking like the holloweyed switchbladeinpurse streetwalker shed once been the gloating anchorwoman went on in a sultry voice about sex for hire the exact relationship between the two victims and jackson still being unclear sex scandal sex sex sex massengils reputation as a lawandorder politician whod campaigned against pornography twentyeight years in the state legislature advocating sex psychological adviser sex she neednt have bothered talking pictures were still worth millions of words massengil openmouthed and snarling dobbss wellfed sanctimoniousness cheris eyes full of corruption and defiance now an action shot ocean heights the widow massengil walking out of her front door to a waiting car blackgarbed face and snowy bouffant hidden by veil and hands hobbling hunched in the protective grip of all four sons flashbulbs popping microphones thrusting the bereaved family fleeing with all the dignity of war criminals hustled to the tribunal the stations resident political commentator came on wondering who was going to fill massengils unexpired term apparently a political technicality was operative since massengils death had occurred after the nominating period for his next term there would be no special election and the remaining eight months of the term would go fallow in accordance with tradition the widow had been considered the most probable replacement but todays disclosures made her an unlikely contender faces of possible candidates flashed on the screen a deputy mayor id never heard of a former tv anchorman with an obsession about separating paper trash from the rest of the garbage who surfaced every few years to play smalltime harold stassen and was regarded as a municipal joke then gordon latch the resident commentator reported inside rumors that latch was considering running for the vacated seat next came footage showing him at his desk fending off questions and letting the viewing public know that during difficult times such as these weve all got to pull together and not stoop to careerism my heartfelt thoughts are with hattie massengil and the boys i urge all of you to refrain from unnecessary cruelty i turned off the set and called linda back had my fill she said i was no fan of his but i hate the way his poor familys being dragged through the muck yesterdays hero todays wet spot she said why now a day after the police knew right away i thought about that frisk snatched the case away from milo because of the glory potential but maybe he had time to think about it examine the facts and realized it would be slow going a glory case can be a doubleedged sword if he develops no suspects he runs the risk of looking incompetent in the public eye shifting focus to a sex scandal buys him time notice how there was no mention of the progress of the investigation true she said just the s word over and over and over also if massengil was scum the urgency to learn who killed him dims a bit doesnt it maybe buys frisk a little more public patience of course another possibility is that it wasnt frisk who leaked latch makes sense doesnt it ive seen at least two instances where he seems to have been in touch with massengils itinerary so maybe hes even got a mole on massengils staff and found out about massengils extracurricular activities not that hes the only candidate massengil had plenty of enemies up in sacramento no shortage of people who might have hated him enough to spit on his grave could be latch just used the information seized the opportunity and went from conciliator to contender it fits his pattern a talent for surviving and thriving on the misfortunes of others sounds like a scavenger she said a vulture or a maggot dung beetle came to my mind i said she laughed well now that were into such appetizing images have you had dinner yet im in a cooking mood love to but its not a good night oh she sounded hurt i said i want to see you but but what alex i took a deep breath listen i dont want to scare you but im pretty sure someone followed me this evening and i dont think its the first time what are you talking about the night we had dinner on melrose i thought someone left the same time we did followed us for a while at the time i brushed it off but now i dont think so youre serious unfortunately why didnt you tell me that night when you first suspected it i really thought i was letting my imagination get the better of methere just didnt seem to be any point then milo told me hed spotted a tail when we were driving together he thinks it was frisk or someone else in the police department one arm of the lapd hydra trying to find out what another was doing milos not the most popular guy in the department she said cops love doing that going after one another paramilitary thinking destroy the individual daddy had all sorts of stories about officers hed caught with their pants down his eyes used to light up when he told them pause why would they be following you guilt by association and dont worry about it ill have an answer soon i got the license number of the car that followed me today as soon as i reach milo hell be able to trace it dont worry about it huh but youre afraid to be with me tonight its i just dont want to put you in any jeopardy from the police why would i be in jeopardy from them all my parking tickets are paid up i said nothing she said alex i sucked in my breath again mentally phrased my words while letting it out and told her about all of it novato gruenberg crevolin bear lodge when i was through she said why didnt you tell me sooner the chill i guess i was being protective and what made you think i needed protecting it wasnt that i said it had nothing to do with you we were having good times together i didnt want to pollute them so you kept me in the dark not out of any base motives okay have a good evening linda no she said dont throw any more words at me ive had enough of that and dont worry about me im a big girl i dont need protecting she hung up when i tried to call back the line was busy i checked with the operator and was informed that the phone was off the hook alone my thoughts drifted from misery to misery bomb factories cadres political conversions the common thread running through all of it latch i thought of the sanitation process that had transformed him from hanoi harry to public servant those years of seclusion with miranda somewhere in the northwest years of seclusion after bear lodge time and money and an easy smile what else did a politician need in the eighties but what would happen to the smile if the money stopped flowing remembering miranda latchs demeanor at the concert i wondered how long the spigot would stay open thought of someone who might be able to tell me superior court had been closed for hours but i was pretty sure i had steve hupps home number in my rolodex i went into the library and found it a pasadena exchange a very young very breathy female voice with a scandinavian accent answered judge hupps residence id like to speak with the judge please who may i say is calling alex delaware one moment a heartbeat later steve came on hey alex change your mind about switzerland sorry no judge hupp hows the residence thats brigitta our au pair just brought her over from sweden shes not much on housework but she does like answering the phone proud of her english and her legs julie hates her guts so if you havent had a change of heart to what do i owe the pleasure id like a little favor some information what kind of information whether or not a certain party has filed for dissolution recently does that violate any canons of ethics no its all public record unless we seal the records on an individual and were reluctant to seal theres really got to be a good reason for it not that we go around just giving out information why do you want to know it relates to a case im working on meaning you cant tell me well he laughed alex alex havent you learned yet that oneway streets dont usually go very far okay for you ill do it i remember all the nasty ones you helped me clear whats the partys name i told him youre involved with them i didnt know it had gotten that far didnt even know they had kids what do you mean that far her attorney did a preliminary filing a couple of weeks ago theyve got a long way to go before custody comes up i dont expect to see them in court for half a year think itll be a dirty one could be lots of money involved all hers but i dont see him asking for alimony wouldnt do much for the old public image would it young man on the rise living off his wifes dole he is on the rise oh yeah the talk around city hall is hes bored with things there got his eye on the seat massengil had the good manners to vacate then onward to something congressional as in dc anyway im glad youre involved maybe we can keep the shrapnel to a minimum hope so steve thanks sure any time see you in court i felt edgy staying at home and decided to leave until i was able to reach milo and find out whod been in the tan car another drive up the coast seemed like a good idea just as i was out the door my service called dr delaware tsk tsk said an operator whose voice i didnt recognize you havent called in for your messages since noon and theres a whole bunch of them any emergencies let me see hmm no it doesnt look that way but detective spurgis sturgis oh is that a t im new here flo took it cant read her handwriting okay detective sturgis left a real long one you want me to put it away or read it to you read it please okay lets see he said to tell you things have climbed higher dash capital f capital e capital d i guess that spells fed at least thats the way flo wrote it capital f capital e capital d or maybe its a t things have climbed higher fed or ted but your names not ted so i guess its fed anyway things have climbed higher dash fed youll be contacted sit tight got all that got it what time did he call lets see it says here fivethirty on the slip thanks you sure do get some good ones dr delaware you must have an interesting life i sat tight the knock on the door came at a double rap followed by a single punch of the doorbell who is it fbi dr delaware could i see some identification please certainly doctor ill hold it up to your peephole i looked through the hole couldnt see much even after switching on the landing light how about dropping it through the mail slot hesitation voices conferring in low tones sorry doctor we cant do that keeping the chain on i opened the door a couple of inches here you go doctor a hand holding a small leather case came forward gold badge on one side picture id on the other the picture was of a man in his late twenties lightbrown hair cut short with a righthand side part full face sharp features hoyt henry blanchard special agent federal bureau of investigation us dept of justice i undid the chain and opened the door all the way the lifesized version of the picture stood on the landing wearing a gray suit white buttondown shirt and blue tie with a silver stripe six feet tall narrow frame at odds with the heavy face squarelensed steelframed glasses that made his eyes look indistinct behind him was a woman about his age dirtyblond pageboy capuchinmonkey face goldrimmed eyeglasses blanchard said this is special agent crisp he and i shook hands crisp didnt smile or extend her hand she was short and longwaisted with chunky calves her outfit said no time for small talk navyblue twopiece suit with a highnecked white blouse black leatherette purse big enough to hold a days worth of groceries behind her glasses she had a tax auditors eyes both she and blanchard had the compulsive suspicious look of accountants whove done time on the streets was the bureau still actively recruiting cpas blanchard said youre careful doctor thats wise i said with all thats been going on absolutely sorry for the hour i was up he nodded so you got the message i did what can i do for you wed like to interview you about what he permitted himself a brief smile everything thats been going on i stood back come on in actually said blanchard wed prefer if you came with us where to crisp bristled at the question at the fact that i was questioning them the two of them looked at each other another bland smile from blanchard sorry doctor were really not authorized to say where until you agree to come withi know its kind of a catch twentytwo but thats the way it is information transfer regulations sir said crisp her voice was husky in a security matter were not authorized to discuss it outside of the approved locus blanchard glanced at her as if shed talked out of turn gave me the kind of look common to goodnatured parents of illbehaved children were not talking summons or a warrant or anything like that doctor meaning youre not obligated to accompany us but it would be a big help to our task force we can get a summons easily enough said crisp as if to herself good cop bad cop a reason for it or just force of habit i said is detective sturgis part of the task force blanchard cleared his throat like agent crisp said were really not authorized to give out any information outside the approved locus meaning a certain specific site which is where we want to take you then we can clear everything up but lets just say that your expectations visàvis detective sturgis have a high probability of being met crisp shifted her giant purse to the other shoulder i hesitated crisp looked at her watch and glared blanchard said not to worry doctor were the good guys no offense i said but sometimes its hard to tell his expression said hed taken offense but he stuck another smile on his face and said guess it is crisp tapped her watch and said lets just come back tomorrow morning with paper hoyt blanchard ignored her and said tell you what doctor how about we give you a number to call verify the task force how about if i talk to detective sturgis myself thats fine in principle but the problem is hes unavailable by phone on radio alert restricted band he put his finger to his mouth and thought tell you what i can probably get him on the unit in our car to crisp okay audrey she gave a bored shrug blanchard turned back to me okay well try but headquarters may not okay the communication the lines have got to be kept clear at all times high intrigue i said you bet smile crisp was unamused okay lets go down to the car said blanchard no even better ill go to the car and bring the unit up fine he turned and took a step down crisps purse slid off her shoulder and thumped on the landing i bent picked it up and gave it to her up close she smelled of cinnamon gum had gravelly skin under pancake makeup thanks she said finally a smile from those disapproving lips she used one hand to take the purse drew back the other and touched her forehead fixing hair that didnt need fixing then she lowered it and lunged forward suddenly hitting me very hard in the solar plexus using a stifffingered karate punch that turned her hand into a dagger electric pain i lost breath sucked air clutched at my belly and doubled over before i could straighten someone behind me it had to be the smiling blanchard shoved a hand in the small of my back rattling my kidneys and slung an arm around my neck a blur of gray sleeve gray noose under the fabric hard muscle pressing against my carotid my mind knew the right moves heel on instep elbows back but my oxygenstarved body wouldnt obey all i could do was flail and gasp the gray arm pushed upward keeping the pressure on and rolling against my neck as if it were dough forcing its way under my chin shoving my head back so hard it whiplashed clamping harder against the carotid relentless consciousness faded i saw crisp watching amused blanchard kept squeezing i wanted to tell him what i thought of him how unfair hed been pretending to be the good cop my legs gave out a heavy oily blackness oozed up all around me total eclipse of i came to in the back seat of a car lying across it my wrists bound behind me i wiggled my finger felt something hard warm not metal not handcuffs i touched it again some kind of plastic tie the kind the police use for quick trussing the kind that had always reminded me of garbagebag fasteners i managed to sit up my head felt as if it had been squeezed for juice my throat was raw as tartare an insideoftheseashell noise roared in my head and my eyes were out of focus i blinked several times to clear them to catch a view of passing terrain establish bearings blanchard was driving crisp up front next to him the car made a quick turn i rolled twisted my body fighting to stay upright and lost i hit my head against the door panel sharp sting then nausea ate its way into my gut a reprise of the sucker punch my eyes slammed shut and i gave an involuntary groan it awakens said crisp blanchard laughed crisp laughed back no internecine conflict now two bad cops it felt as if we were moving very fast but that could have been my head spinning i fought down the queasiness managed to pull myself up again i mouthed words produced sound wha who my tonsils ached it talks said crisp if it knows whats best for it it will shut the fuck up said blanchard i pressed my face against the window glass cold and soothing outside more greasy black endless black blindfrombirth black i felt a stab of vertigo had to concentrate on not rolling back down clawed at the seat with my bound hands and felt a fingernail rip i looked out the window again barely able to keep my eyes open my pupils felt as if theyd been dipped in glue and breaded with grit i closed them the same flat black ladies and gentlemen tonight the part of hell will be played by absolute darkness i bit my lip with frustration flopped like a beached seal rubbed my face against the door panel happy to be chafed metal nubs where the handles should have been low conversation from the front more laughter i blinked some more opened my eyes and waited for them to accommodate to the darkness finally but everything was still blurred it hurt to focus i looked anyway searched for context black turned to gray grays lots of them contours shading perspective amazing how many grays there were when you just took the time to look dead streets it observes said crisp she turned and looked down at me her monkey face reminded me of a stephen king book cover want to know where we are cutie she said the valley feel like being a valley boy tonight bound but no blindfold they didnt care what i saw garbage didnt fight back i shoved that out of consciousness worked at staying lucid ignoring weak bowels hammering heart the drainpipe noise in my head blanchard fed the car more gas and it surged forward my eyes finally cleared a darkened shopping center a lazy streetlight casting a urinecolored glow over boardedup businesses cracked and missing signs texturecoat walls sprayed with gang wisdom an empty parking lot shot through with weeds bad part of the valley blanchard made another series of quick turns that my eyes couldnt make out a sprinkling of signs cuidado con el perro bonded premises element depository keep out that means you then a reflective orange diamond gembright pavement ends blanchard kept going onto a dirt strip that rocked the car traveled for another few minutes before making a short stop at a padlocked sheetmetal gate crisp got out letting in more gas stink i heard fiddling rattling rasp and creak she got back in and said okay the petrol smell lingered as if it had saturated her clothing blanchard drove through the gate crisp got out again locked it and returned the car moved forward across empty space past several vehicles parked diagonally vw bugs i thought of charlie mansons apocalyptic dream veedubs converted to armored dune buggies heavy artillery for the race war helter skelter was going to foment blanchard slowed and pulled up in front of a bank of concrete i made out metalrailed stairs a platform a loading dock behind it the outlines of a blocky flatfaced structure fifty feet of bulk unrelieved by architectural detail light from the left a lowwattage bulb surfacescratching the darkness like crayon relief dribbling illumination down on the top half of a grated door to the right a bigger door triplegarage width corrugated steel the smaller door opened three figures came out shadow people blanchard turned off the engine crisp bounced out like a kid going to a birthday party the scuff of footsteps the right rear car door opened before i could see their faces my ankles were gripped and i was pulled down slid out of the car as i emerged hands took hold of my body at the belt under my armpits fingers digging in grunts of effort i went limp make the bastards work as they carried me away i caught a glimpse of the car tan i thought but i couldnt be sure in the darkness i was swung up and forward sagging butt scraping the ground carried with all the care of a sack of spoiled meat time to take out the garbage it took a while for them to get the small door open i heard tumblers and clicks and machine whirrs some kind of electronically driven combination lock no one spoke i was held fast by the limbs trunk dangling joints aching staring at trouser legs and shoes click inside floor level cement floor cold conditioned air or maybe i was shivering for another reason i was carried by silent pallbearers through an aisle sided with high tan walls cardboard tan partitions plywood doors a warehouse sectioned into cubbies unevenly lit patches of illuminated cement flooring followed by intervals of darkness that made me feel as if id disappeared now into a larger area my captors footsteps echoing other footsteps now softer distant i had a sense of vast open space cold space hell was a warehouse was this how lab animals felt readied for airfreight then other sounds typewriter pecks computer bleeps scraping soles more cardboard boxes stacks of them i made out lettering blackstenciled printed material special rate lots of those then a few that said machinery fragile a flash of yellow i twisted to see what it was a forklift and another several smaller vehicles that looked like sitdown lawn mowers but no gas stink here just the yeasty respectable fragrance of fresh paper lots of huffing and puffing from my bearers my eyes raced past trouser legs a few pairs of stockinged female calves i began counting feet two four six eight ten i craned upward hurting my spine wasnt able to make out faces the aisle angled to the left my journey as hunting trophy continued for another twenty paces before coming to a sudden stop heavy breathing lockerroom sweat the hands holding me lifted and twisted all at once i was upright arms still fastened behind me coming face to face with them blanchard trying to smile while huffing others ten of them younger cleancut i knew them without knowing them had seen them at a school attending a shooting enjoying a concert brighteyed then deadeyed tonight faces set in the mire of obedience as if the internal light in each of them had been switched off conservation of personality the other times theyd dressed for success they were dressed for something else tonight black turtlenecks over black jeans and sneakers the proper attire for an allnight wait in a storage shed or a backyard killing i said hello boys and girls take me to your leader it shook a couple of them out of their zombie reverie they held on to me but retracted their heads as if id just given off a bad smell it talks blanchard stepped forward and backhanded me hard across the face my head twanged from the blow i focused away from the pain from the fear looked past all of them narrow passageway created by tenfoothigh stacks of printed material cartons directly in front of me was a black wooden door something painted on it a red circle containing a spearhead someone stepped out from behind one of the cartons someone wigglewalked toward me beth bramble in a longsleeved black dress her hair was drawn back tight chromium thunderbolt earrings dangled from her earlobes i struggled to clear my throat and said mourning period over for the beloved leader it hurt to talk blanchard hit me again bramble said aw the laughter back in her voice she came closer making kissypoo movements with her lips shed eaten something with a lot of garlic in it it folded into her perfume floral pizza she chucked me under the chin pinched me by the cheek blanchard had slapped pinched it again harder twisted and smiled through the agony i said secret agent time beth nothing like getting an inside track on the opposition she smiled said fuck you darling pinched me again let her fingers drop down my shirtfront then my fly she lingered there gave me a playful honk someone snickered bramble winked at the young ones turned and disappeared behind the cartons blanchard knocked on the black door a muffled reply came from the other side blanchard opened it put his head in and said hes here df everything smooth as silk another muffled answer i was shoved in and the door slammed behind me the room wasnt much maybe fifteen feet square poorly lit maroon linoleum floor worn through to the concrete slab in several spots block walls painted institutional white warped acoustical ceiling browned by moisture sheetmetal ceiling vent that dumped out stale frigid air in the center was a sevenfoot olivedrab desk that had to be army surplus two green metal chairs sat in front of it extra chairs stood folded in one corner on top of the desk was a black multiline phone and a short stack of papers weighted down by a tarnished artillery shell running against the left wall was a brown couch that looked thirdhand bunkernouveau all that fieldcommand drabness provided a nice sense of contrast with what covered the wall behind the desk a flag big enough for city hall black muslin bordered in red satin in the center a red spearinacircle motif gordon latch sat on the couch wearing doublepleated anklepegged black slacks with narrow cuffs black snakeskin boots with riding heels and an oversized black silk shirt buttoned at the collar in the pseudonerd style favored by actors and dope dealers the shirt had twin breast pockets with flaps pearl buttons and ostentatious epaulets chrome spears glistened from the lapel tips his legs were crossed his posture relaxed the casual but calculated slump of an old favorite guest on a latenight talk show he tossed me a victory smile the smile flickered his triumph marred by something i looked over at the green desk and understood behind it sat darryl bud ahlward in a highbacked green leather swivel chair his uniform was identical to latchs but for rainbow splashes of battle ribbons over each breast pocket and a black leather shoulder holster from which a black gun butt protruded gold spears on his lapels despite the generous tailoring of the shirt his shoulders stretched the arm seams he sat very straight and very still eyes static and changeless i turned back to latch and said nifty little role reversal still second cadre huh gordon latch sat up straighter and started to speak ahlward shoved the words back down his throat with a quick look latch turned away from both of us recrossing his legs and making a show of boredom i said so this is what the welldressed storm troopers wearing this season whats the official greeting sieg heil ciao ahlward reached across his chest and took the gun out of his holster a big black affair with a long barrel and a hightech profile he caressed it then pointed it at me sit down i said or is it haberdashery über alles latch said asshole i feigned puzzlement lets see now which one are you gordie goebbels or goering must be goering cause it looks like youve got a little paunch sprouting under those baggies and what about the charming ms crisp is she doing eva braun in tonights pageant or is that beth brambles role ahlward sighted down the barrel of the big black pistol his left eye closed i fought to keep my eyes open staring straight ahead behind him concentrating on the spear logo glowing scarlet and ugly thinking of photos at an exhibit a wintry day in bavaria bodies collapsing into a ditch youre a puzzling piece of turd said ahlward ive researched you always getting into things that arent your business for the last time said latch ahlward said show and tell time turd gestured with the gun i said why should i bother ahlward smiled because he said every seconds precious everyone thinks theyre immortal amazing the things creatures will do how low theyll sink to buy seconds i said is that a fact scientific fact toss a kikecreature in freezing water and watch him prolong his agony just to buy seconds toss a penny in the pool and hell dive in voluntarily latch added ahlward smiled and said they gasped like fish and screamed in yiddish for mercy even though they knew it was no use just kept going until they turned into popsicles scientists are using it today hotshot research on hypothermia who knows maybe youll end up benefiting mankind too an entire new area of inquiry said latch pain tolerance so said ahlward youll cooperate whats the alternative the alternative is i say fuck you ahlward put his gun away and pushed a button on the phone his reward was a single short ring he picked up the receiver and said now he sat back and folded his arms across his chest same stance id seen a few days ago in a classroom a single knock sounded on the door ahlward said in two cleancuts came in grasping something big and white and limp under the arms both of them were husky very young one was blond and had bad acne the other darkhaired with a wispy mustache twenty years old tops they should have been beerbashing trolling for cheap thrills they stood at attention grim pithed of soul the white thing between them was milo head lolling heels dragging dead weight my heart did a high jump and landed in my gullet choking off air i moved forward ahlward snatched up the gun and said stay buy seconds i remained in place and looked at my friend he was barefoot and had been stripped down to his undershirt and trousers the shirt was ripped and splotched with blood his eyes were swollen shut his lip split in a couple of places and bloodengorged worms of dried blood crawled all over his face trailed down his chin and onto the shirt one of his shoulders was exposed through a rent in the undershirt scraped raw and still weeping bluemaroon cabbageshaped bruises blossomed along his arms despite his bulk he looked small his head sank lower and bobbed i saw more blood at the crown crusting his hair where it hadnt been damaged his skin always pale had the dirtyporcelain cast of the terminal ward but faint pumping movement under the shirt respiration he passed wind a raw growl latch chuckled the boys in black grinned i said milo louder than id intended it made me sound desperate his face didnt change but something passed through the rawliver lips half sigh half retch i couldnt tell if it was voluntary he sank again the blackshirts tightened their grip eagle scouts helping a drunk across the street whether he wanted to cross or not ahlward said to me heres the way its going to be youre going to sit down right now and not give me any shit or im going to walk up to your asshole buddy and hurt him while you watch when hes no longer of any use ill blow his brains out making sure lots of wet gray stuff lands right on your shirt then ill cut the stuff with a fork and knife and feed it to you vomit it up youll eat vomit for dessert one way or the other youre going to get it all down after that ill hurt you take you apart surgery and make you watch it happen turn you into a fucking cartoon youll be the only one not laughing shrugging with my arms behind me was painful i sat down well if you put it that way df df lets see gotta be der führer right you guys have a thing for initials df ld wheres the harmonica gordon still playing requests how about the old horst wessel song or isnt that in your repertoire talking fast to keep from shaking ahlward gave his hand an impatient wave the gestaposcouts began dragging milo out of the room i said no i want him here surprised at the assertiveness in my voice good clear sound finally shooting out of my aching throat buy seconds i halfexpected to die but ahlward looked amused he held up a hand and the blackshirts stood still you want you want what ive got df what i want in return is seconds just like you said for both of us you want he got up and put his hands on his hips he wore a narrow tooled black belt with a gold spear buckle hanging from the left side of his belt was a black leather sheath that dangled like an offcenter codpiece he slid something out of it a hunting knife with a black haft and gold crosspiece wide tapering footlong blade big enough for butchering large game outdoorsmans knife he turned it examined the blade then lowered it and held it parallel to his right leg then he came from around the desk with remarkable speed and stood in front of me you want he said smiling was as easy as chewing ground glass got to play the few cards ive got df his pink eyebrows arched you think you have cards i know i do the only reason you brought me here is because i have something you want information you need to find out how much i know who ive talked to about bear lodge wannsee two three said latch a silencing look from ahlward i said were talking damage control df you worked on milo and he didnt tell you much maybe he just didnt know or maybe he was tougher than you thought in either event you figure ill be a softer touch and maybe i will but not if youre going to kill him anyway you and he have something going do you its called friendship right he smiled lifted his right arm and brought the knife up to my chin and under its your kind of decadence that brings a society down he said softness putting it and taking it up the ass probing with the knife all soft he whispered every inch of you a tiny flick of his wrist and the blade came away redtipped and wet he turned again holding it so that it caught the light and stared at the candyapple glint no pain for a moment then a throbbing pang just above my adams apple wet heat like a wasp sting this is you this is all you are bloodentranced i wondered how many animals hed tortured as a kid how many people i said what can i do df sure youve got most of the cards but ive still got to use what i have survival just like you said his blunt face was motionless then amused once more then something else dark and empty he raised the knife high stabbed down hard i stumbled back away from the slashing blade anticipating agony but less afraid than a moment before less afraid than i imagined id be nerves deadened anesthetized the same kind of anesthesia they say overtakes gazelles just before the hyenas rip them apart i was on the floor curled head tucked trying to be tiny but still alive hed stabbed air from the look on his face i knew it had been intentional he began laughing latch laughed too the gestaposcouts joined in a regular blackshirt gigglefest through the gaiety ahlwards voice soft and boyish get up the laughter died he nudged my butt with his boot tip shiny black cowhide no lizard for him gold chain dangling from instep to ankle deprived of armbalance it took me a while to get to my feet i didnt want to see his face concentrated on his clothes the battle ribbons looked phony homemade yes he was saying well keep the faggot here for efficiencys sake ill want both of you together anyway the grand climax smile frown to the junior ss dump it there he crooked a thumb at the couch latch gave an uneasy look the gestaposcouts dragged milo over and dropped him next to latch the big bruised body landed on its belly head on the armrest of the couch mouth gaping cabbagearms flaccid grubby feet brushing against latchs slacks latch wrinkled his nose and scooted to the far end the scouts waited at attention until ahlward nodded then they were gone and the door closed behind them milo groaned rolled his head stretched and was touching latch again latch looked as if hed been ordered to drink a cup of spit he shoved milos foot away wiped his hands on the arm of the couch and squeezed himself farther into the corner dont you think we should tie him ahlwards heavy jaw tightened and the hand holding the knife blanched whys that just in ca do you feel hes a threat to you latch pushed his glasses up his nose no not at all i just wanted to be if theres no threat then theres no need to worry is there said ahlward lets keep things logical and as for this one he put the knife in its sheath and used his right hand to take hold of my nosehes not going to be any problem is he finger pressure cutting off my air hes whitecollar all the way he gave latch an amused look the talking class right gordon latch gave a weak smile absolutely led by the nose i was pushed down in one of the folding chairs ahlward said wet and gray all over your shirt maybe infected wet and gray stuff all those little fagviruses just waiting to squirm out and swandive into your blood system if youre not already infected you like to eat men turd youll be eating men i said better give your knife a thorough cleaning afterward df keep yourself healthy for the revolution he went back behind the desk sat picked up the black gun and used a fingernail to scrape something off its barrel start he said i pushed through my fear of him concentrated on the tacky ribbons the costumes the banner the paramilitary bullshit df play to his ego i said well one thing ive figured out is your previous identity dayton auhagen darryl ahlward which ones real when you ask questions he said my mind wanders okay lets go back to fashion then your taste in clothes a few years ago buckskins long hair a beard too perfect image for roaming the wilderness for surviving in places like the forests of southern idaho surrounding bear lodge you trapped hunted lived off the land using all those survivalist skills you figured would come in handy when the brown stuff hit the armageddon fan nifty stuff selfreliance whered you learn it from latch said its in the blood like a child reciting a lesson ahlward flashed him another sharp look but it lacked energy he liked the attention all those years of charade executive assistant waiting to be center stage i said in the blood huh that mean youre a secondgeneration storm trooper got roots in the fatherland df i expected him to brush that off but he gave a slow measured headshake im allamerican more american than you or that soft sorry piece of shit over there could ever conceive allamerican i said ah was your father in the bund itself or one of the splinter groups the amber eyes opened a bit you know about the bund just what ive read in the establishment press i nodded then you dont know shit the bund was the most effective citizens lobby this countrys ever known the only patriots with the foresight to warn against getting involved in the kikewar so instead of heeding the warning and rewarding them for their foresight rosenvelt hunted them down like criminal scum so hed be free to send our boys over to europe to die for the kikes and the commiemaggots and the popefuckers and faggotscum like you latch said major blunder sociologically as well as politically world war kike was the first step toward mass mongrelization opened the sluices for all the asian and semitic sewage europe had no use for i ignored him concentrated on ahlward like i said df all i know about the bund is what ive read which no doubt is biased but you can see the establishments point a war going on the public being told day after day who the enemy is swastikas and sieg heils in madison square garden wouldnt go over great ahlward gave a petulant impatient look and slapped the desk hard thats because the establishment was too stupid to know who the real enemy was mass stupidity fed by the zionistoccupier media mass weakness due to drugs and toxins developed in secret labs by the zionistinfiltrated rosenvelt army the zionistoccupier doles out drugs and toxins like candy thats why they all become doctors to poison the goyim thats what kosher foods really about the little u they put on cans you know what goyim means in serpenttongue sheep were fucking sheep to them to be shorn and slaughtered you know what the u stands for some yidword that means poison they use toxins and tranquilizers that their bodies can tolerate because theyre constructed of toxic cells but we cant and it gradually weakens us physiological hypnosis its been scientifically proven been that way for centuries in every society the zionistoccupier infiltrates gradual mass passivity decadence then inevitable destruction every liberation movement has to overcome it by wielding the cleansing spear it reminded me of stuff id heard during internship on the back wards of state hospitals he reeled it off in the flat tones of a high school thespian i said cleansing spear and looked at the banner behind him latch said the spear of woden the ultimate cleansing machine once again i ignored him and asked ahlward what about crisp and blanchard and the rest of them they secondgeneration bundists too his eyes narrowed something like that no skinheads for you huh df latch laughed and said punks rankamateur clowns we prize discipline i said so am i right about the mountainman bit df ahlward sat back in the swivel chair and put his hands behind his head okay i said so youre living off the land and hiding from the government just like some of your former enemies on the left your movements in trouble so is the left cointelpro nixon j edgar divide and conquer and its working it gets you thinking by squaring off against the left youre giving the establishment exactly what it wants some people on the left realize it too and you all come to realize that when you stop to think about it the radical right and the radical left have lots in common you both believe society has to be torn down in order to totally restructure it that democracy is weak and inefficient controlled by the international bankers and runningdog pressby the talking class a new populism is called for empowering the working man and the main issue that used to separate you race is no longer that big of a stumbling block because there are white leftists enraged at the uppity blacks whod tried to kick them out of their own movement white leftists getting in touch with their own racism a beacon of wisdom said latch shining through the shit pile i said i dont know who thought of it first df but somehow you communicated and a new concept was conceived wannsee two pressing inward from the outermost edges in order to squeeze the center and crush it to death which is how you got together with old gordie here a quick look at latch then back to ahlward though to tell the truth df i really cant see the appeal youre clearly a man of action hes nothing more than a hotair purveyor living off his wifes money latch swore and waited for ahlward to defend him when the redheaded man didnt speak i went on hes the proverbial empty barrel making lots and lots of noise a lap dog the ultimate example of the talking class do you really think hell be able to cut it when the time comes latch jumped to his feet the impact jostled milo his body rolled to the edge of the sofa then rolled back his mouth gaped as i searched the battered face for signs of consciousness i felt another waspsting on my cheek a new layer of pain veneering a threeyearold jaw injury memories of wires and putty my head shot back another layer latch was standing over me spittle collecting in the corners of his mouth a lap dog gone rabid he raised his arm to hit me again and starring as the punching bag in tonights school pageant is little alex delaware he struck out and the rattling in my head reverberated like acid rock pumped through a cheap amplifier after the knife petty annoyance i looked up at him and said temper temper gordie he ground his teeth and drew back his fist just before impact i feinted to one side his hand grazed me he was caught off balance and stumbled ahlward looked disgusted he said sit down gordon latch righted himself stood there panting his hands bunched high color in the freckled cheeks the welfare glasses askew my head hurt but not that badly my arms were numb gazelleanesthesia or loss of circulation i said why dont you sit down and toot your harmonica gordie he balled his hand started to retract it ahlwards voice froze it midmotion like a blast of liquid nitrogen later gordon latch looked back and forth between the two of us spat in my face and returned to the couch but no more casual legcross he sat on the edge hands on knees huffing with rage a gob of his saliva had landed on my cheek i lowered my head wiped it as well as i could on my shoulder i said how impolitic councilman latch said hes mine bud when the time comes i said im touched councilman ahlward turned to me and said that all you have to say turd oh no theres plenty more back to wannsee two the meeting no one believes ever took place but it did somewhere rural and secluded away from the untermenschinfested cities where the police and the feds had control maybe somewhere like southern idaho the ranch that miranda inherited from her father how many people were involved ahlwards eyelids drooped he touched his gun i said a redux of the hitlerstalin buddy bit you even came up with a new insignia that said it all red for the left the spear for the right a circle signifying the union i turned to latch if the folks on telegraph avenue only knew he said youre an idiot it started up in berkeley back in the days when i was still brainwashed and toxified i did hypnotic things without knowing why i was doing them taking african history native american studies all sorts of contrived useless bullshit the jewprofs shoved down my throat but even then i was starting to see through it it wasnt working for me i went searching for my own source material learned facts no one had the guts to come out and say in class like the fact that there wasnt a single written language in africa before the white man came no real music except for stupid chants a retardate could master no fine cuisine no literature no fine arts were talking an ape culture malaria promiscuity dungeating mau mau cannibals theyre nothing but a bunch of dungeating baboons brought to america by the zionistoccupier in order to pick zionist cotton trained by the zionists to wear human clothes and mouth human words and masquerade as human peers id dealt with them i knew how impossible it was to get through to them using logic all of a sudden it made sense you cant use logic with an ape apes with rhythm like dejon he laughed that was fun the irony he and his fucking gorillas monkeys riding in limousines thinking theyre even a halfstep above the dung heap he actually thanked me for giving him the opportunity to serve you have a taste for irony dont you gordie i said making speeches at the holocaust center after the building was defaced serving on their board knowing all the time that it was dfs storm troopers who did the defacing he laughed harder theyre so gullible all of them the inferior classes poor selfesteem on a bioethnic level its coded genetically on a cellular level they know theyre inferior which is why when the white man asserts himself properly theres no competition no resistance they march straight into the ovens shimmy right up to the lynching tree all you have to do is pretend to like them ahlward nodded in assent but i thought i spotted a hint of annoyance deprived once again of the limelight i shifted my attention back to him wannsee two went better than youd imagined you drew up a plan but there were obstacles people who stood in the way whod fight you to the death if they found out people with charisma and drive and no compunctions about working outside of the system themselves norm and melba green skitch dupree the rodriguezes grossman lockerby and bruckner time for some more damage control and here gordie came in handy again your inside track to the first cadre privy to their plan new walden black and white farming side by side inviting the indians back everything you despised gordie and randy lured them up to bear lodge with tales of clean air and pure water and free rent randys inheritance i looked around the room guess she likes warehouses didnt know they were such a good investment a flicker of impatience crossed ahlwards eyes i said the walden folks traveled up to bear lodge with stars in their eyes and you were waiting for them dayton auhagen macho hippie communer with nature the kind of stranger who could skulk around without arousing their suspicions you watched them surveilled them getting a fix on their habits their routine same way youd track any prey getting into that warehouse when they were gone and hiding explosive charges among all that combustible produce ahlward was smiling remembering i said only some of the group was settled in bear lodge the others were farther north negotiating for lumber but that other group was strictly second cadre without their leaders they were likely to cut and run and if they did prove threatening sometime in the future you could always pick them off at your pleasure small game so you fixed a date before the second cadre was scheduled to arrive got into the warehouse again poisoned their dinner meat returned to the forest waited until they were all inside incapacitated pressed a button and boom the fbi dovetailed beautifully into your plans by jumping on the bombfactory explanation and feeding it to the press no doubt you helped them along with an anonymous tip smug smile on the blunt face nostalgia had never looked so ugly i said that was a good touch no one mourned a bunch of urban terrorists blowing themselves up with their own nitro only one minor glitch one of the second cadre people terry crevolin arrived early a vegetarian to boot he didnt eat the meat was spared and escaped the blast but once again no big threat he had personal problems drugs a weak will likely to sap his political energies and his hatred and distrust of the establishment led him to believe the explosion was governmentsponsored to this day he doesnt believe in wannsee two so it was a nifty plan df as far as it went but my question for you is why bother why go to all that trouble for the first cadre when there were other radical leaders just as charismatic latch said they were scum fucking snobs spoiledbrat rage notinvitedtotheparty rage i knew then that the idea of the blast had originated with him that for him it had been personal not political all those lives lost the horror because theyd been smarter than he was shut him out his idea more of an idea man than id thought their relationship was complex made the one between dobbs and massengil look wholesome ahlward was sitting up straighter i decided to keep the insight to myself after bear lodge i said time to move forward pick a front man sanitize him and get him into public office no matter how humble an office youre a patient man df know your history all those years it took the first führer to progress from a jail cell to the reichstag i sat forward the only thing is the first führer was his own front man he didnt need a dummy on his lap latch said fuck you you piece of shit i thought i saw ahlward smile times have changed he said this is the media age image is everything i said thought the zionists controlled the media they do said ahlward more irony huh he yawned i said okay granted got to consider images but is he the best you can do imagewise furious mutters from the sofa a hint of movement that ahlward stilled with a sharp look as if to compensate he said hes doing just fine mechanically his gaze floated around the room not much of an attention span i wondered how many classes hed flunked in school i said gordie and miranda retreat to the ranch for a few years confess their vietnam sins reemerge as environmental activists meanwhile the ranch is also used for meetings other conferences recruiting the sons and daughters of your dads old buddies just like the summer camps the bund used to run you also get a little publishing business going all those boxes outside printed material probably hate stuff shipped at discount rate courtesy of uncle sam right another smug smile arent you worried someones going to trace it back to one of mirandas dummy corporations he shook his head still smug we write it here print it somewhere else then bring it back here then truck it to other places no way to trace layers of cover i said and the other boxes machinery what is that hardware for the revolution latch said guns and butter ahlward coughed latch shut up the redheaded man played with his gun some more i said you picked la for gordies renaissance because miranda had connections here show biz the whole radical chic thing lovetheearth rhetoric went over big with that crowd so gordie became mr environment scrubbing pelicans while dreaming of cleansing the world and got elected so far so good the fact that crevolin had also settled in la was a bit of an annoyance but all those years of silence meant he didnt suspect a damn thing what was a shock was learning that someone else had escaped bear lodge and resurfaced in la norman and melba greens son the fbi had declared him deadassumed him dead rather than proving it with a body because you assured them two little kids had been part of the group now here he was seventeen years later returning to live with normans mother his grandmother a suspicious unapologetic old leftist who had no trouble believing a new holocaust was just around the corner no trouble suspecting her son and daughterinlaw had been murdered though like crevolin she thought the government had been behind it she fired up her grandson with nazi history and conspiracy theories he started doing his own research he was a smart kid and took to it latch snorted and said smart baboon i said book research wasnt enough for him he tried to meet his rescuer couldnt get through to crevolin and went to the nextbest source someone whod also been a comrade of his parents another second cadre guy but one whod climbed a public man i turned to latch what a bummer gordie the timing i mean here you are having bought all that respectability sure youre only a sandwich sign for dfs dreams but sometimes you allow yourself to pretend its real and youre the boss and that feels really good doesnt it and sure city council is relatively pennyante but its a giant step forward for someone who committed sedition on national television youre moving up the rhythm is there things are finally fitting together and along comes this mixedrace mongrel black jewish kid knocking on your headquarters door using his parents names as passwords to get through the front office names you thought youd never hear again coming face to face with you and asking questions about the bad old days wannsee two you try to put him off play the old game youve learned so well and answer his questions without really answering them but hes persistent pushy full of the kind of youthful fire that just might be able to incinerate you thats how it always starts isnt it small fry nipping at the big fish a night watchman got nixon so its time for a quick stall and an emergency meeting with df df instructs you to handle it in a timehonored manner lull the prey into complacency with phony friendship feed him carefully measured bits of disinformation then move in for the kill when the times right so you play compassionate liberal for ike spin him a tale about wannsee two in which the story remains intact but the characters are altered making someone else the chief bad guy it wasnt exactly casting against type massengil had rightwing sensibilities hed been tooting his quasiracist horn for some time you probably made up some yarn about his having been a government agent with your resources your own printing press its no problem furnishing ike with some impressivelooking bogus documents and the beauty of it was that it served a double purpose ocean heights is part of your district getting massengil out of a job hes had a lock on for almost three decades will allow you to run for his seat still pennyante compared to your ultimate goal but state assemblymen have been known to go to washington how many councilmen have ever gotten out of city hall youd had your sights on him for some time planted bramble on his staff your inside track so when ike showed up asking questions everything clicked you took him into your confidence swore him to secrecy fed him lies fed his revenge fantasies and tried to work him up to the point of violent retribution you figured that wouldnt be much of a challenge because he was black and blacks are inherently violent arent they latch said sounds like the turd has some capacity to learn ahlward didnt even bother to fake interest when you ask questions my mind wanders i said first choice was for ike to assassinate massengil and get himself killed in the process second choice was for one of your junior ss boys to bump off massengil frame ike for it and kill him too same result slightly less efficient the only problem was ike resisted despite that kinky hair and all that melanin in his skin he just wasnt the violent type fifty percent kikeblood said ahlward programmed for cowardice or maybe gordie just screwed up pushed too hard and got ike suspicious made him wonder why a city councilman was so eager to get involved in murder in any event he refused to go along and turned himself into a serious liability so you lured him to that alley with the promise of something probably some new information about his parents from another source a black source what better place to do it than watts must have been fun making the call putting on the patois yowza massuh said latch we sho good at talkin that nigra talk ceptin we po culluhds have such a bayad tahm luynin to dial that phone turning to ahlward for approval the redheaded mans smile was obligatory he fingered the black guns barrel and yawned i said ike walked into the ambush and one of your sskateers shotgunned him injected him with a dope cocktail and set it up as a drug burn because after all blacks are all dope fiends right whos going to get suspicious about a junkie getting snuffed in south central and by golly you succeeded again it went down that way in the books now there was only grandma to deal with despite ikes pledge not to talk you figured hed confided in her you plucked her off the street and left her body where no one will ever find it just for the record where was that blank stares from both of them i said considering youve got all the cards you guys are pretty stingy ahlward said sounds like youre running out of material i said perish the thought theres plenty more after you dispose of sophie you break into her place and look for any evidence she might have left behind notebooks diaries doing the neighbors place too to make it look like a burglary but why the stuff on the walls the kennedy message latch couldnt resist answering that one dessert for the troopers who performed the mission reward for a job well done even revolutionaries have to party i said and caught movement from milo an eyeblink volitional neither of them saw it milos back was to latch and ahlward was preoccupied with his gun another blink or had i just imagined it i kept talking with both ike and sophie gruenberg gone your immediate problems finally seemed over but there was still the matter of massengil youd already started thinking of him as a dead man so it was annoying to have to change that mindset and if the deed was going to be done the timing was important he was well into his current term had already been nominated for the next one so it was to your advantage for him to be eliminated before the next election too late for the governor to appoint someone else the seat would lie fallow for a few months giving you time to build up political steam and enter yet another imagestage great conciliator mature statesman sure the widow would get first dibs and if she didnt want the job some hack or crony would move in but you had plans to take care of that per the lovely ms bramble latch said i do believe ocean heights and i will reach our own rapprochement i said better do it soon before randy pulls the purse strings closed or were you intending to ask for alimony sudden panic in his eyes ahlwards eyebrows were hotpink crescents of surprise i said oops sorry i thought you knew df ahlward looked at latch latch said hes full of shi i said little bandy definitely wants out df shes filed papers check for yourself its public record ahlward swiveled slowly in his chair and stared at latch latch said it just went down bud i was going to bring it up had it on the agenda oops again i said not quite true gordie pordie she filed two weeks ago not the greatest thing to happen at a time like this is it df visàvis public relations and moneywise to latch what happened gordie did her political enthusiasm wane or is it just you shes tired of guess all that discipline and bondage stuff wears thin after a latch said shut your filthy mouth ahlward cleared his throat latch said its not a problem bud she can be taken care of shes on so much fucking seconal nobodyll ahlwards turn to say shut up you know gordon its real pleasant hearing it this way cmon bud you can see what hes and youre giving him exactly what he wants latch sank back down and played with one of his cuffs milo winked this time i was sure i said were talking thick coats of tarnish on your rising star df you might start thinking about a replacement ahlward raised the gun and sighted down it again to my surprise i felt no fear only weariness at his little dictator routine he said ive heard enough two winks from the couch milos big body remained motionless i said you mean you dont want to hear the rest the part you took charge of personally he lowered the gun go on shortly after ike and grandma were taken care of another unpleasant surprise came your way someone else ike had confided in so much for pledges of secrecy guess gordie wasnt very convincing a mentally dull shutin who welcomed the cheer and conversation ike brought with him when he delivered the groceries who appreciated the time he took to get to know her and as he got to know her better he lapsed into his favorite topic politics not that she had more than a hazy idea of what he was talking about social justice the evils of capitalism but she was able to pick out the juicy parts conspiracies murder wannsee two she sat there and listened the perfect soundboard because ikes visits filled the emptiness in her life she didnt want them to stop then one day they did stop forever she found out he was dead murdered people were saying he died buying dope but she knew that was a lie became he didnt take dope he hated dope she knew something was wrong probably one of those conspiracies ike had talked about she withdrew further confused just like when her mother died but this time she came out of it angry wanting to understand why bad things happen to good people to talk to someone who could explain it to her not her father they never talk he treats her like a servant and she barely knows her brother but she does recall a name ike mentioned consulting a former comrade of his parents whos gotten famous even been on tv someone ike had suspicions about but didnt share with holly because he didnt want to put her in jeopardy would someone like that talk to her she was afraid but she couldnt forget ike his death so she built up her courage and called the famous guys headquarters one of the famous guys staff answers and hears her babbling about stuff no ones supposed to know about and knows this is a job for the high command i looked at latch whatd you tell her he smirked that shed done the right thing by getting in touch with me that i was investigating ikes death and she had to promise to keep everything secret until i got back to her he laughed she ate that up like cornflakes i glanced at ahlward hed put the gun down on the desk had taken the knife out again and was cleaning his nails proud of yourself huh i said to latch but df here wasnt too proud he figured youd fucked up decided to handle this one personally to the redheaded man you met with her as gordies assistant debriefed her to find out exactly what she knew found out it was just enough to make her a threat and realized she was custommade for another try at massengil a better dupe than ike because she lacked the intellect to think critically she was ripe to obey so you went to work on her building rapport gaining her confidence putting on the old paramilitary thing secret meetings in outoftheway places when her father was out of town night walks youd pick her up and drive her away she had no job no schedule no one to miss her no one else to confide in you fed her secret codes high intrigue giving her a sense of purpose for the first time in her life resurrecting the old massengilassatan fantasy massengil as the vicious murderer of her friend feeding her rage nursing it bringing it to bloom making her sense of selfesteem contingent upon carrying out her mission and she did eat it up snow white gobbling a poisoned apple she was so eager to act she told you she even had her own weapons a closetful of guns you got into her house when her father was away and took a look most of them were antiques unusable except the remington but in her hands it might as well have been a flintlock more winks from milo keep going pal you spelled out her assignment went over it with her putting her through dry runs until you were sure she had it down her sisterinlaw saw her holding the gun weeks before muttering about wannsee two which she thought was gibberish as would anyone else hearing it the worst that could happen was shed freak out before the big day and start rambling on about conspiracies whod believe her as it turned out she didnt talk to anyone never saw anyone and the big day drew near you notified her with a coded call monday morning perfect time and place for a hit bramble had informed you of massengils plans to use the school for a press conference you knew exactly what time hed show up precisely where hed be standing but getting holly out of the house was a problem her father was an early riser so sneaking out early on monday was out of the question you had her do it sunday night while he was still asleep told her to take the remington out of the closet and wrap it in something close the door to her bedroom so hed think she was still asleep then sneak out really quietly sure to close her bedroom door disengaging the alarm resetting it and slipping out of the house with the wrapped rifle though ocean heights is so deserted at night she could have carried it out in the open you picked her up a couple of blocks away brought her a change of clothes a paper cup for elimination the two of you drove toward the school parked a few blocks away and walked over hand signals high adventure she must have loved it ahlward gave a disgusted look she was a pain to work with took a long time to learn everything pure mengele fodder destined to live and die as shit i gave her the gift of immortality more than she could ever hope for real act of kindness i said sometimes he said stroking his gun its cruel to be kind i said you popped the lock on the storage shed and camped out for the night she with her rifle you with your pistol waiting stalking just like bear lodge telling her to go to sleep youd take first watch and wake her when her turn came letting her sleep until sunrise and then letting her know thered been a change in plans you were going to do all the shooting just to make certain everything went smoothly not to worry shed still be a hero your assistant maybe she accepted that or maybe she put up a fuss wanting personal revenge you thought you had her convinced but when the time actually came to shoot when massengil and gordie and the kids poured out on the yard she pulled a fast one on you grabbed the rifle second cadre wasnt good enough for her i gave latch a smile turned back to ahlward before i see his reaction her shot went wild of course the recoil knocked her down and she dropped the rifle you got hold of it had to think fast consider your options the optimal choice would have been taking aim squeezing off a good one at massengil and then doing her but looking out the window you could see the moment of opportunity had been lost panic everyone screaming running for cover no clear shot not that youd have minded a few dead kids but that would have complicated matters visàvis pr so you took your pistol and shot holly in the face kept shooting her eight times shot three rounds from the remington all of it together sounded like war to those out on the yard then you walked back to the yard carrying your smoking gun ready to play savior no one had seen you actually enter the storage shed but the panic took care of that no one remembered anything but their own fear and the press hadnt arrived yet with their cameras and their recorders besides if anyone asked gordie and the troops could always be counted on to step forward as eyewitnesses to your heroic dash to the shed quick reflexes and calm under fire df job well done wink from the couch i said to ahlward it must have been nice being the star for a change getting the credit you deserved instead of standing in his shadow such a puny shadow at that but after all your planning you still hadnt managed to get rid of massengil the guy was turning out to be a goddammed rasputin another assassination attempt soon after would look funny raise all sorts of questions your instinct was to wait let him live out another term bide your time but gordie didnt like that he pushed you and now you know why he knew hed be losing his hope chest soon fortunately for him the productive ms bramble had gleaned another bit of inside info on massengil kinky sex with cheri nuveen on a regular basis dobbs looking on bramble even knew when the next appointment was given that the rest was easy a simple hit dobbs as dessert no apparent connection to the schoolyard first day gordie comforts the widow and plays mr compassion next day you leak the hooker stuff to the press and knock off the widow as a viable candidate along with any of massengils cronies guilt by association the voters would have to wonder if theyd attended any of massengils parties leaving guess who i leaned forward its fine as far as it goes df but what do you really think its going to accomplish lets say he gets elected even manages not to screw up for a term or two and goes on to washington theres no substance to him nothing to build an empire on it would be like constructing a palace over a sump hole latch swore ahlward smiled you think hes the only one ive got placements all over he used the knife as a pointer serious talent each of them young photogenic courageously liberal until the time comes wannsee three and four and five and six anger and impatience in the amber eyes the knife stabbed air whatever it takes to get the job done like you said im a patient man longterm planner willing to wait until the times right and the cleansing blood flows washing away all the anthropretenders and putting together a new age thats genetically honest and beautifully cruel how poetic who else knows what you know he said how about the police for starts i sent them tapes he smiled and shook his head bullshit you believed our fbi scam if youd been in contact with the police theyd have called in the feds and the feds would have interviewed you already weve been watching you know who youve met with try again turd i said youre assuming greater efficiency on the part of the authorities than they deserve bureaucratic wheels turn slowly the cops know i was waiting for the fbi thats why i opened the door for blanchard and crisp and i didnt buy the scam they had to suckerpunch me to get me here i said try again thats it df just the cops theres no way youre going to pull this off negative thinking he said time for a little preliminary scrub he stood holding the gun in one hand the knife in the other running his eyes over milo he said despicable how can you live with yourselves the things you do he rotated the knife heres the way its going to go down you and him doing filthy stuff your filthy friendship things get out of hand you beat him up badly trash him to death then start feeling so guilty that you write a little note and blow your own faggot brains out i said shame to dirty up your warehouse randy might not like that when it comes time to give it back to her not to mention the health hazard from faggot blood he smiled not to worry turd weve got a nice little place all set up for you cocksucky motel over in pacoima another of her realestate tidbits he said cmon time for a butthole party up you go i remained seated the gun waved the pink eyebrows climbed i said move it he said wink wink wink i ignored him all at once the blunt face was transformed into something livid and howling i said get the fuck up i stood very slowly latch rose brushed off his trousers and smiled at me thought you might want to know weve also got something planned for little miss principal the snotty cunt does she know you swing both ways that youve been infecting her i said she doesnt know anything i could tell from the way his face creased in a kewpiedoll smile that id allowed my terror to show hey he said you were balling her which means pillow talk shes a liability and its all your fault shell be having a wild time tonight he clicked his tongue really wild shocking example of the burgeoning rise in crime on the west side perfect timing for my campaign ill be showing up at the crime scene pledging my troth to law and order thats the way we work you fucking piece of shit nothing ever goes to waste not even the squeal and boy will she squeal he giggled i strained against my bonds a wild time he said were sending someone to do her who really enjoys that kind of thing knows how to bring out the best in a woman try to get that image out of your mind the look on her face when it actually happens and she realizes whats going on the sounds shell make wink wink wink from the couch i said bring out the best in a woman huh then it sure wouldnt be a job for you whens the last time randy saw anything stiffer than her own upper lip the kewpie doll turned malignant he began coming at me arms up boxerstyle aldward said not now in a jaded tone latch didnt seem to hear kept coming wink i backed away danced on fearladen legs my turn to leer sure gordie nothing like a fair fight but whos going to protect you when df finally realizes that without randys big bucks youre not very useful just a wimpy little piece of limpdicked shit second cadre all the way latch said give me the knife df ive had enough ahlward raised the blade holding it out of reach dont be an idiot it has to be done the right way latch backed off i said roll over gordon say bowwow gordon stuck out my tongue and dogpanted latch charged me swinging i moved to meet him faked a shoulder butt faded back suddenly just short of impact and caught him off guard again he grunted in anger regained his balance and charged again ahlward put the gun down reached out and restrained him with one hand the other held on to the knife gun on the desk but no free hands i kept talking bouncing on my feet play dead gordon eat your kibble gordon dont wet the rug gordon ahlward screamed at me you shut the fuck up latch shook off ahlwards hand and lunged again at the same time a pale bulk rose from the couch a polar bear coming out of hibernation taking hold of latchs shoulders shoving him forward latch fell heavily toward ahlward on ahlward his weight causing the redhaired man to stumble backwards onto the desk a look of surprise on the blunt features latch was on top of him thrashing wildly ahlward tried to shove him off cursing and twisting to get free trying to get to the gun latch remained sprawled on top of him screaming the two of them wrestling then ahlwards face was speckled with blood showered with it latch screamed a terrible sound more than just frustration blood kept spurting ahlward thrashing away from it spitting it something shiny and sharp emerged from the soft freckled flesh on the back of latchs neck worked its way through like a burrowing grub silver sharpnosed grub the knife point ruby and silver latch gurgled and tore at his throat the knife kept nosing its way out ahlward gave a hard twohanded shove latch came loose inertia threw ahlward backwards off the desk top onto the swivel chair stricken by astonishment milo moved unsteadily toward the gun reached out for it touched the butt missed the weapon skidded across the wooden surface and sailed away landing somewhere on the floor ahlward dove for it i felt a hand on my wrist yanking freeing my hands cmon milo limped toward the door i followed him dazed watching latch sink to the floor the knife still embedded in his neck hands grabbing the handle gurgling trying to yank it free salivating blood his eyes rolled back cmongoddammitalex yanking me the two of us out the black door slamming it into the hall four blackshirts smiling as if savoring the tail end of a joke they saw us and the smiles hung in midair milo howled at them and kept coming the smiles vanished and they looked terrified naughty kids unprepared for reality one a darkhaired fat boy with an old mans jowls wore a bolstered pistol and reached for it i used my shoulder and hit him hard ran past the sound of painscreams and cracking bone running through a cardboard alley warning shouts the crackle of gunfire we took the first turn available meeting up with two more gestaposcouts girls they could have been sorority sisters discussing pledge night one put a hand to her mouth we hurtled past bowled them over heard girlsqueals fuck chivalry more gunshots louder i looked back as i ran saw ahlward pumping his legs screaming orders that no one was heeding calling for his troops but the troops were frozen unprepared for reality a cold rush of wind as something tore into a carton inches from my head another turnoff just a few yards away we ran for it above all the noise i could hear milo gasping saw him put a hand to his chest more gunshots then a louder sound earthquake loud rumbling up from the cement floor rattling the floor as if it were paper cartons tumbled in our path like giant tantrumstricken building blocks someone screamed more screams panic the way the schoolyard must have sounded another rumble even stronger bouncing us like toys knocking us to the floor more boxes toppled cartons shot up in the air tossed by an unseen juggler and landed with dull sickening thumps milo tripped was down i helped him to his feet he looked deathly but resumed running no sign of ahlward a jumble of cardboard behind us shielding us we made the turn blackshirts scattering the autoshop smell of seared metal another roar the hiss of disintegrating plaster we climbed over boxes ran around them milo stopped hand on chest legs bowed head down i called his name he said fine he swallowed air did it again nodded dully and began moving again another explosion the building shivered like a wet puppy more cartons crashed down around us a vesuvius of printed materials we swerved dodged managed to make our way through the rubble another turn past the forklift metal clatter more hiss more thunder screams of agony the hiss grew louder joined by an unmistakable odor burning paper a sudden burgeoning heat demolition music tongues of orange licking the ground just a few feet away filthy inky smoke oozed from between the boxes rising to the top of the warehouse darkening it the heat intensified through it another cold rush thunk shredded cardboard ahlward emerging from the smoke howling soundlessly ignoring the smoke that churned behind him mindless with hate he aimed again there was a clearing in the cardboard wall i ran toward it realized milo wasnt with me looking over my shoulder i saw him hand to chest a wall of smoke had risen between him and ahlward shots came through it milo looking from side to side disoriented i went back for him grabbed his hand felt the resistance of his weight on my wrist straining the sinews i pulled hard he managed to get going again i saw the sliding metal door of the loading dock just a few yards up shredded like foil and blackened around the edges metal fragments scattered on the ground glinty treasure on a bed of masonry dust and something else a blackshirt prone blond crew cut pale broad face white eyes husky body stretched out limp two pieces of body the trunk separated from the legs bifurcated by slidingdoor shrapnel closer to the door another corpse half buried in metal and offal a charred head above hamburger four others barely discernible moist spots in the ash pile my gorge rose i began to choke chemical fumes the warehouse was a furnace flames reaching to the ceiling smoke thickening as it rolled toward us a greasy tornado a black form emerged from the charcoal mass ahlward sooty and singed jerking his head from side to side as if shaking off leeches sighting us screaming lifting his big black gun i went for the largest hole in the shredded door pulled milo through it slipping on the bloodslick floor feeling the crunch of metal and bone beneath my shoes outside fresh air gasolinestink air the two of us lurched along the loading dock fumes and flames poured out of the warehouse out of shattered windows the ravaged metal door shooting out of the gaping holes that had been blown in the wall milos breathing was raw and labored i pulled him down the stairs into the parking lot an incoherent scream rose at our backs ahlward out on the dock highlighted by the burning building looking very small aiming a true believer gunfire a frogsong ratatat didnt know a pistol could make a sound like that another burst from our backs trapped frogs sang again i looked over my shoulder saw ahlward jerk and fall saw the pistol go flying into the inferno the flames rolled out of the warehouse and ate him dessert then a voice out of the darkness you and your detective friend are safe dr delaware ive saved you he stepped forward orangelit by the fire wearing a dark windbreaker and holding an assault rifle that looked too big for him a complicatedlooking scope had been mounted on the weapon his thin hair was blowing embers fell all around him there was a look of deep contentment on his face i said mr burden mahlon he said id say weve reached the appropriate degree of familiarity wouldnt you alex smile i saw milo tense i stood rooted dont be afraid said burden im friend not foe he looked past me at the burning warehouse gave the satisfied look of a boy scout whod just rubbed two sticks together successfully over the roar and crackle i could still hear people screaming ashes fell onto my sweaty face lacy foulsmelling snowflakes burden said you dont look well detective sturgis lets get you to a hospital milo was working hard at taking in breath in the shimmer of the firelight his bruises looked awful congealed and livid as sloppy special effects burden said come on detective milo said forget that shaking his head and spreading his arms for balance linda overstreet theyve sent someone to her place gotta get to a phone call it in he took several lurching steps burden said ill do you one better detective snap of fingers another face out of the darkness early thirties handsome big walrus mustache over a clipped beard doctor youve met gregory graff photographically here he is in the flesh gregory help me with detective sturgis graff stepped forward very big very broad a rifle similar to burdens was slung over his shoulder he wore camouflage fatigues that looked as if theyd been frenchlaundered his demeanor was pure concentration a surgeon tying off a capillary he put one arm around milos shoulder the other on milos elbow dwarfing milo six five at least i took milos other arm milo tried to shake us off im okay goddammit get me a phone this way said burden he turned his back on the inferno and began walking fast we followed him out of the parking lot soot blowing in our eyes milo insisted on walking without assistance but shakily still breathing with effort graff and i stayed by his side i kept looking at my friend finally his breathing regularized for all the punishment milod taken he seemed in decent shape what shape was linda in i tried not to think of that could think of nothing else someone who knows how to bring out the best in a woman my own breathing grew clogged i fought for composure we made our way through the darkness then a hideous tidal wave of sound monsters at feeding time rose behind us and the lot was engulfed in bloody light still moving i looked back flames had burst through the roof of the warehouse and were shooting into the sky bloodying it a few people had made it out to the landing dock engulfed in flames arms flapping and throwing off sparks one of them dropped to the ground and rolled more screams burden turned nonchalantly raised his rifle to his shoulder and squeezed off a frogburst milo said forget that goddammit move covering our tracks said burden always sound strategy in this type of mission but he lowered the rifle and sprinted ahead milo cursed and tried to walk faster his legs gave out graff lifted him slung him over his shoulder as if he were a straw man and kept going without breaking step milo protested and cursed graff ignored him and here we are said burden the sheetmetal gate was propped open by a crowbar just beyond it parked at the curb was a van darkgray one blackened window on each side the roof coiffured with antennas tongues of reflected fire from afar created the illusion of a lowrider mural along the slab sides dancing mural hell on wheels i heard the shriek of sirens from somewhere in the distance it reminded me of something a crack alley dogs began howling burden took something out of his pocket and pressed a button metallic click the vans rear doors swung open milo looked up at the antennas you have a phone put me down and let me use the fucking thing burden said gregory see that the detectives comfortable in the back graff lifted milo brideoverthethreshold style and slid him into the back of the van milo disappeared from view cursing the doors slammed shut i grabbed burdens shoulder stop playing games and lets get to the phone burden smiled and peeled my fingers off oh this is no game doctor i feel ive done a very fine job of saving your life the least you could do would be to trust me he went around to the drivers side and said hop in i opened the righthand door two recaro racing bucket seats in front between them a console bearing a mini computer and phone modem i got in the passenger seat and lifted the phone dead burden was behind the wheel i said activate it damn you burden was expressionless he handed his rifle back to graff and put a key in the ignition i looked back the rear of the vehicle was a carpeted shell milo lay on the floor sharing space with several metal boxes and some electronic gear that i couldnt identify graff knelt beside him his big head brushing against the ceiling a gun rack covered one wall of the shell semiautomatic handguns rifles something uzilike milo forced himself up and grabbed the back of burdens seat you sadistic little asshole graff pulled him off and held his wrist milo cursed burden said such gratitude and turned the key the engine started and the dashboard became a light show meters dials graphic displays led readouts a row of circular dials on the front edge of the ceiling parallel with the windshield still more dials on the console on both sides of the computer and surrounding the phone enough hardware to fill the cockpit of a burden said welcome to the official mobile testing lab of new frontiers limited components come and go i get free samples all the time keep only the best i thought of linda now his narcissism was deadly fighting down the urge to strangle him i said please its life and death he touched dark space to the right of the steering wheel a square yellow screen the size of a cocktail coaster appeared black numbers flashed a twodigit combination followed by seven more numbers that kept changing below the screen a key pad the light from the screen revealed two more phones freehand dashmounted their buttons bananayellow police scanner said burden playing the pad with four fingers programmable for any region of the world which in and of itself is nothing out of the ordinary but this one has been modified it can be used to interface with police dispatch systems and place calls smile gorging himself on power totally illegal please dont tell on me detective sturgis i said for gods sake call it in and shouted lindas address i know the address he said would you like me to place the call or would you prefer to do it yourse just do it he clucked his tongue punched another button that froze the numbers on the scanner and picked up one of the dash phones all west la units he said in a voice not his own all west la units and peering eight atwentynine adw in progress possible attempt oneeightyseven he rattled off street and number specified lindas apartment code three i repeat the radio talked back via a speaker on the ceiling a patrolmans voice confirmed taking the call within seconds two more units had called in code six assisting there burden said pushing a button that darkened the dash that should take care of it drive there asshole said milo what about your injuries detective sturgis just get the fuck over there burdens seat swiveled he looked backgregory graff lifted one of milos arms flexed it gently milo said get the fuck off me paul bunyan drive burden or i will bust you for something graff said doesnt look like anythings broken mr burden a basso befitting his size good elocution new england inflections the sirens grew louder burden said the last thing i want is to be accused of medical negligence particularly with regard to an officer of the law milo said get moving you smug little fuck burdens face turned stony in the dashlight ill put that down to shock detective milo cursed some more burdens face got harder i said look its been a long night for all of us we appreciate what youve done saving us but lets make it perfect by trying to save linda too he looked at me perfect no i dont think so he sat with his hands on the steering wheel as the sirens grew deafening finally he fastened his seat belt gave the van gas and pulled away from the curb just as we turned out of the winding alley the fire trucks came charging through i said where are we van nuys burden said that red light is victory boulevard milo said shoot the light burden said such a bad influence detective but he sped through the blackened intersection i said how about we turn the scanner on hear whats happening he shook his head not necessary have some faith doctor at first i thought it just another power play but a block later he said no doubt youll want to know how it was done your liberation from the back milo said the fucking punch line he began to cough graff said here drink some water sure water is all it is paul thats all it is rumbled graff babysitterpatient burden said detective sturgis youre a hostile illmannered man too many years of being on the outside the therapist in me yearned to turn that back on him christ milo said i heard him gulping looked back and saw graff holding a canteen to his lips burden said its water all right pure spring water from washington state artesian springs water with a natural mineral composition miraculously matched to the bodys own electrochemical requirements what page gregory slowing the van as he talked the streets were desolate clear sailing i wanted to shove my foot down on the accelerator graff said seven section two beauty and balance i said burden said very good alex another red light riverside this time he stopped lets see freeway or canyon at this hour id say freeway he headed west i said of course i want to know howd you do it any hypotheses a few lets hear them for starts you tapped my phone the time you dropped in at my house my very nice home asking to use the facilities so he could have time alone in the rear of the house crying and spilling his coffee in order to have time alone in the living room me adding to his worktime by waiting in the kitchen so that he could compose himself very good he said but actually it went far beyond the phones i installed listening devices in several locations in and around your house under furniture and beds near the front door todays technology permits incredible ease of installation ive got units no bigger than a grain of rice though the ones i used for you were larger lentilsized selfadhesive longdistance superhigh resolution tunable i said section five life and limb stroking him while realizing all hed heard phone conversations pillow talk the violation he was my liberator but i didnt like him any better for it being saved by him was like finding out god existed but that he had a bad personality he said actually these particular components havent been featured in the catalogue yet so you got a sneak preview id be happy to leave them installed show you how to use them for your own benefit no thanks no doubt youre feeling intruded upon but monitoring your input and output was necessary you were my informational conduit to the school the police all of them no one would help me everyone treated me as if i were a pariah i needed good data that was my right i knew i had to be thorough i pretuned the units to receivers in my house identical receivers were also installed in this van no one else could possibly receive the transmission so you neednt be concerned that anyone else was monitoring you and the tapes will be destroyed very shortly i appreciate that unable to keep the sarcasm out of my voice but he missed it or ignored it we were on the sherman oaksnorth hollywood border now approaching coldwater a few cars on the street late diners heading home from the restaurants on ventura more lights then the onramp to the west he said the lentils are manufactured in poland of all places though i suppose the actual research and development came out of the soviet union glasnost and perestroika have been a boon for those of us interested in the free exchange of advanced technology the distributor in hong kong was more than happy to send me a boxful of the little devils at great discount in the hopes that id feature them in the next catalogue it didnt work out that way did it gregory no mr b too expensive for our target audience very expensive even at discount but only the best for you dr delaware because i respect you your tenacity i had high expectations of the quality of information youd be able to shunt to me and i was right wasnt i so id say the lentils paid for themselves as did the homing tracers i placed in your seville and in detective sturgiss matador and fiat unfortunately i couldnt quite get to the ford he traded for the matador but by that time i had enough data to be able to trace his abduction what a guy said milo no longer hoarse now clear and quiet and enraged i knew what he was thinking burden had let him endure the interrogation waiting listening i said howard was your conduit too you dropped in on him and waited in his office so you could install your lentils and hear every hateful word his son had spewed absolutely he said a little too nonchalantly hollys behavior had been puzzling distant preoccupied due to her communication problems i couldnt draw it out of her i knew shed snuck over to howards both of them thinking i didnt know about their little attempt at rapportbuilding i thought howard might be able to shed some light on the change in his sister now that the two of them were communicating but you couldnt simply ask howard about it because he also has communication problems exactly i remembered the loathing that had filled howards office how was a father able to deal with that to defend against it i looked over at him placid blocking it out narcissism in service to the soul he made a left turn onto the freeway all six lanes were as empty as indy the day after the race howards a bright boy he said but hes got many many problems blind spots you saw how obese and nervous he is how he sweats he gets eczema too gastric discomfort and insomnia clear signs of unhappiness constitutional weakness made worse by a poor attitude toward life if hed allowed me i could have helped him with all of it perhaps one day he will in the meantime i couldnt let his weakness get in the way thats why you were so eager for me to meet with him hoping he might open up to me and youd get it all on taper he smiled more than hope databased prediction the conversation between the two of you ended up being a very useful transmission wannsee two i said howard described how holly had babbled about that the day her sisterinlaw came over i set out to learn what it meant you listened and taped and followed along no no he said annoyed i didnt need you for that i was one step ahead of you i know enough history to understand exactly what wannsee was vahnsay is the correct pronunciation of course gregory knows about wannsee too even though hes from your generation because a good deal of gregorys family was eliminated by the nazis so when i called and told him we were dealing with wannsee two he was more than eager to get involved in this project werent you gregory absolutely mr b good ventriloquism said milo whered you find a dummy this big graff gave a deep loose laugh hardly said burden gregorys got training in electronics and biophysics under his belt a year of medical school at an ivy league university a law degree from that same university and graduate studies in business pride paternal pride his real son i said sounds like a real renaissance man one part of my brain thinking about linda and running at methedrine pace another making small talk trying to get information from the odd scary man in the drivers seat bet he has military training too i said former intelligence officer same as you thats how you found him isnt it not some modeling agency when it was time to recruit a partner you know precisely where to go im not a partner said graff just a figurehead more laughter burden laughed too the exchange to the appeared he took it going south and moved into the center lane maintaining a steady seventy miles per i said how about going a little faster he didnt answer but the speedometer climbed to seventyfive wanting a hundred but knowing that was all i was going to get i said heres another hypothesis between the two of you new frontiers has access to military computers ahlward had a military background you checked him out military background said graff beargrowl laughter burden didnt join in he was the first one i researched before i approached you the press was painting him as some kind of hero i wanted to learn about the one who actually pulled the trigger the hero whod killed my daughter what i found out smelled bad hed lied about being a military man his tone said that was the ultimate felony all he had was seven months in the marine corps april of sixtyseven to november of sixtyeight a good part of it in the brig before he was dishonorably discharged for moral turpitude a closed file that i managed to open two separate incidents sexual harassment of a sixteenyearold girl a black girl and attempts to organize a whitesupremacist gang among other new recruits it was the latter that made me research him further after his discharge he enjoyed brief stints in local jails for theft and burglary and disorderly conduct i decided he was scum looked into his family history his father had been a bundist war criminal ran one of their summer camps schweiben ahlward senior was imprisoned for sedition in released in only to die a year later of cirrhosis alcoholic scum multigenerational scum which led to another question why would a supposedly liberalminded city councilman hire someone like that so i researched the city councilman too found nothing there but a piece of lint masquerading as a man good family all the privileges not a trace of hardship in his background not a trace of character either addiction to the path of least resistance needless to say he found his way into the latrine we know as politics angry words but a conversational tone i monitored latchs headquarters easy as pie right gregory but that didnt teach me much latchs people displayed a modicum of discipline tended to be circumspect over the phone but you were doing a fine job as my conduit putting it all together novato the old woman that pathetic washout crevolin for a brief period i thought the vandalization of ms excuse medr overstreets car was related to it but detective sturgis proved me wrong congratulations detective fuck off and drive nevertheless the rest of it proved what id known all along that my daughter had been a victim herself a dupe i put it all together before either of you did and in answer to the question you asked of howard doctor my political beliefs are antithetical to fascism i believe in unrestrained free enterprise minimal government control live and let live on condition the other side behaves itself die and let die said graff never again gregory and i had no trouble believing in wannsee two because of our military background our access to classified data we knew what had gone on in various army bases during the late seventies racist cells that the armed forces broke up swiftly but at the cost of discharging the fascists into the weak civilian world where irregularities couldnt be dealt with as efficiently that insight and experience gave me the edge i knew from the careful way latchs people handled themselves over the phone that there had to be some other place they did their dirty work a secret headquarters where the swine spoke freely but they never let on not through all the monitoring then i thought of latchs wife began tracing properties deeded to her burrowing through the layers of corporations shed wrapped around herself piercing that kind of cocoon is absurdly easy if you know how and i quickly came up with several possibilities despite the fact that shes a very welllanded lady i was in the process of narrowing down the list when you made my job easy calling detective sturgis last night and leaving him the message about your being followed that license plate i have trace capacities better than most police departments millions of licenses in my data bank i matched your number to one of my possibilities a company listed as a printing facility gregory and i were there just alter sundown saw detective sturgis being delivered there listening show him gregory graff lifted something from the floor of the van glass cone with a microphone in the center this is a stevens twentyfivex longrange parabolic microphone said burden good up to two miles i said another sample of eastern bloc creativity perish the thought said burden this ones allamerican born in the usa said graff burden said when you arrived trussed and shackled detective sturgis we were waiting you held up nicely your own military background no doubt quite impressive rest assured that had you been in any serious danger we would have saved you but we knew from our previous monitoring that they planned to keep you alive finish both you and the doctor off in a sexually suggestive manner you however had no way of knowing that and you did very well aw shucks said milo id suggest said burden that you conserve your anger for those who deserve it for example why do you think they came after you in the first place masquerading as fbi silence from the back are you truly ignorant detective or just repressing no answer graff said your own people sold you out extremely bad form i said frisk burden nodded another piece of lint when he came to interrogate me the day of the shooting he actually attempted to install a monitoring device in my living room primitive piece of junk needless to say i left it in place talked to it played the cello for it leading frisk exactly where i wanted to lead him in circles because hes a moron i could see right away thered be no use working with him the next time i saw him at his office i returned the favor so i have a very clear picture of what hes been up to and its nothing i would tolerate if i were you detective polish lentils at parker center said milo our vaunted antiterrorist division said burden if it wasnt so sad it would be funny the incompetence you see latch and company have been under investigation for quite some time but not for the right reasons frisk hasnt the slightest inkling no suspicions about wannsee two he suspects latch of being a communist subversive an unrepentant leftwinger because latchs political enemies have been feeding him that massengil i said among others the late assemblyman was a prime source of disinformation on latch because he knew latch had designs on his job dr dobbs helped him compose little false reports of latchs supposed subversive activities dr dobbs actually made direct phone calls to frisk using a code name santa talking on pay phones all of it very malicious and childish cinematic cloakanddagger nonsense but our lieutenant frisk took it very seriously compiled a file on latch a classified file chuckles echoed by graff i said why didnt he move against latch he considered it said burden i have recordings of him talking to his dictaphone thinking out loud considering his options playing every angle against the other ruminating endlessly but he was afraid to confront latch without solid evidence yet unable to get any evidence because a he didnt know how and b the whole thing was a sham the man really is incredibly stupid thats why he was so eager to take over the massengil murder he suspected latch might be behind it this would be his big chance and he was right but for the wrong reasons the idiot said burden he actually believed he had a chance to be promoted to deputy chief you detective sturgis were considered a threat to that ambition the possibility that you might solve the case yourself you threaten him because down deep he knows youre what he isnt a competent investigator and also of course on another level i believe despicable fag bastard is the way he generally refers to you if youd like i can play you the tapes milo was silent burden got off the freeway at the pico exit and headed east toward westwood during the course of my brief surveillance he said i havent been mightily impressed by the police department too much time spent on what officers do in bed whom they do it with religious beliefs other irrelevant issues thats not the way you win a war it must be an awful strain on you detective sturgis milo said thanks for the sympathy mother teresa but i could tell he was digesting what burden had told him burden drove smoothly and rapidly like a true politician frisk used you called latch as a supposed confidant informed him that you were the one who was suspicious about him apologetic yon were an embarrassment to the department a rogue cop rogue fag cop with a drinking problem the department only kept you on the payroll to avoid lawsuits and political hassles it was only a matter of time before youd be drummed out in disgrace frisk told latch youd been asking questions about him were unstable prone to violence warning the good councilman so latch began having you and dr delaware tailed meanwhile frisk tailed latch you were his decoy detective had you died tonight he might have blundered into a solution maybe even had glory and his promotion deputy chief frisk wouldnt that be lovely milo thought out loud he didnt tail me tonight no not tonight tell him why gregory he and his staff are having a retreat said graff lake arrowhead burden said to share feelings outline management strategy frisk is a modern policeman reads his textbooks and knows his operations manuals i said sounds like something out of dobbss book of tricks theyre all the same said burden pencilpushers in any event dont you think im a hundred percent correct detective about focusing your anger properly two blocks of silence we approached sepulveda burden said do you want to know what we used to demolish the building on the edge of my seat linda linda sure selectively applied dabs of plastique not semtex something better brandnew a little dabll do you said graff a very little dab said burden complete with a tiny little detonating cell stuck smack in the middle they didnt see us because the entire front wall of the warehouse was windowless their idea of security but they ended up hoist on their own petard gregory dabbed then retreated to the van where we relaxed ate sandwiches and listened you were very good doctor trying to play them off against each other holding onto your nerves then when the time came we pushed buttons boom said graff id say it was poetic justice said burden wouldnt you too bad mr latch wasnt around to see it what exactly happened to him we heard some sort of commotion i waited for milo to reply when he didnt i said he fell on ahlwards knife it went through his neck splendid big smile literally hoist on his own petard what a pretty picture my only regret was that i wasnt there to see it all in all a very productive adventure wouldnt you say gregory aone mr b lots of people died i said therell be questions burden took one hand off the steering wheel and made a whoopdedoo spinning gesture the more questions the merrier city and state commissions senate subcommittees our beloved press bring them all on i love washington dc in the winter a certain bleakness sets in on the capitol mall that matches the spirit of the petty bunch who work there i especially love it when i go there with something to trade the unmasking of ahlwards other covert nazis it should prove to be quite a revelation he said after i supply the names i guarantee you ill be a hero people magazine entertainment tonight a current affair popular enough to run for office and win if i had the poor taste to harbor such ambitions i however will choose to avoid the limelight and most of my fame will fade fairly quickly thats the age we live in the public has no attention span craves constant novelty meanwhile gregory and i will be mapping out a strategy for harnessing whatever good will weve garnered in washington for business purposes ive been thinking about increasing my weaponry division for a while anyway makes sense i said life and limb buy your akfortyseven from the man who knows very good alex have you ever thought of applying your psychological skills to marketing not this year westwood boulevard came into view backed by the nightgloomed mass of the pavilion we turned right i said sounds like youve got it all figured out thats my business anticipating understanding trends mapping behavioral patterns pause not that i can ever be compensated for my loss i looked over at him they took what was mine he said fatal error ambulances crimescene van another domino spill of squad cars roofflashers pulsing in counterpoint to my heartbeat all the old mechanical vultures familiar as pets a street without them would look naked burden pulled the van behind one of the blackandwhites a very younglooking cop came over to the drivers window and said if you people dont live around here youll have to move milo said its okay sitz propping himself up on his elbows his face just visible over the drivers bucket seat the officer tensed and peered in its me sitz detective sturgis you okay sir big trouble out in van nuys fire multiple deaths i was lucky all i lost was my shirt and id these good citizens helped get me over here possibly related to one of my cases whats the situation attempt oneeightyseven detective hardys up there we havent heard much as milo reached over and opened the door sitz backed away from it i was out of the van like a bandit running hearing milos voice behind me its okay let him go racing up the walkway to the apartment past a pair of technicians carrying crimescene kits a handful of gawkers in nightclothes lounging behind a tape line ducking under the tape someone said whoa hes stressed out another cop came forward one hand on his gun tall thin beach tan over pimples heavy underbite god they were hiring them young i said i need to get up there he held me back with one arm are you a resident of the building sir yes he raised the clipboard name and apartment number my heart threatened to burst out of my chest i contemplated violence underbite sensed it and touched his gun a voice at my back its okay stoppard milo was trying to look dignified with his wounds and his tattered undershirt underbite stared at him and said sir i said its okay stoppard underbite stepped aside i raced forward legs churning into the greenfoil lobby another uniform holding the closetelevator open when he saw me he touched his pistol too a second later when he saw milo he gave a bmovie double take milo said out of the elevator buell stay in the lobby a silent maddening ride up three flights so slow endless me punching the walls of the elevator milo just standing there close to me i knew he could smell my fear but he made no effort to distance himself when the elevator finally bumped to a stop i squeezed myself through the door before it was completely open more green foil racing to the far end cop at the door always cops suspicious eyes milo giving the okay yes sir through her door now tagged with an lapd crimescene label into her living room bright lights perfume smell oyster walls fresh vacuum tracks in gold carpeting what an organized young lady stretched out on the carpet something humansized in a black zipped bag i broke down sank to my knees a grayhaired bearded man in a bottlegreen blazer and gray flannels sat at the butcherblock table holding a minirecorder black gladstone bag at his feet stethoscope around his neck different kind of house call he looked up at me diagnostic appraisal but no sympathy just curiosity sounds from the bedroom i got up staggered in more perfume cloying a slender balding black man in a navyblue suit stood by the brass bed holding a note pad and gold pen the covers were in disarray linda sat on the bottom sheet shoulders hunched knees drawn to her chest wearing a pink quilted robe staring off into space i ran to her held marble the man in the navy suit turned such a nice suit hed always had a thing for clothes dapper half of the odd couple when hed partnered with milo tonight no exception skyblue broadcloth shirt with white pin collar redandblue paisley tie rustred just a shade lighter than the muddy spots on the mirror above the dresser rust on the plaster too three holes radiating spiderleg cracks left of the mirror tight formation the top surface of the dresser a wasteland of tipped perfume bottles freeform blood blotches shattered mirrortray blood looped down the front of a drawer the carpet was a collage of glass shards more mud something metallic a snubnosed revolver with a walnut grip to my unpracticed eye identical to the one milo carried when he carried delano hardy looked at me with surprise and said doc she talked about you was worried about you im fine shes gonna be fine too the power of wishful thinking i held her tighter stroked her back still frozen and she did a good job del was saying protected herself which is what its all about right he pointed to the revolver im a crack shot very softly he said tough lady shes got my vote for sheriff gave her statement really coherently then when we were through she got real quiet sank into the way she is now the shocks settling in according to the coroner not physical shock psychologicalyour neck of the woods physically shes okay the vital signs and everything coroner checked her out said she was tough gave her something to take the edge off make her sleepy said she looks fine physically but should go in for a couple days observation ambulance from ucla is on its way talking faster than id ever heard del hardy talk despite all the years all the bodies still able to be affected i remembered why i liked him apart from the fact that hed saved my life once upon a time i said its down there already del whats that the ambulance its here oh del looked at me diagnostically too i held linda closer tried to engulf her be everything for her finally she molded to me but remained cold and inert as modeling clay milo came into the room dels eyes widened must have been some kind of party guy milo said hot time in the old town del shoulda been there battered but oddly authoritative his gaze rested on linda he and del traded coptocop eye signals as in the past i felt like an outsider didnt mind hardy repeated the few facts hed just told me seemed to be talking even faster pushing comfort linda began to tremble violently i held on to her but it wasnt enough to make her stop milos big face drooped with pain and empathy he said lets talk outside del del nodded put away his pen and pad and said keep her warm doc pull the covers over her shes supposed to be resting they left i lowered her down on the bed and gathered the comforter around her stroked her face her hair she was still shaking gradually it slowed then ceased she began breathing rhythmically i touched her cheek kissed it kissed her eyes waited until i was certain she was deeply asleep before returning to the living room del and milo were walking the greenjacketed coroner to the door his trousers had a sharp crease everyone had dressed for tonight milo had on a couple of handages after the coroner was gone del pointed to the body bag intruder got in by picking the lock he said bande tools professional set but he made too much noise doing it and woke up the victim dr overstreet not that it was a particularly sloppy job pretty good actually pointing to the doorjamb i couldnt see any scratch marks milo examined it and said spickandspan no print dust no dust in the bedroom either i saw the print boys down there whats the delay my orders said del havent authorized them yet the uniforms who got here dont think they touched the jamb but they did touch the knob and they trampled the bedroom pretty darned good charging it it was a code three they were after prevention not preservation milo said yeah del said let me ask you any reason to go through the whole shebang trash her place most of its light surfaces that means the black dust you know what a godawful mess that makes seems like a clearcut selfdefense situation coroner says height of the spatters backs up everything she said milo thought and rubbed his face and said no reason i mean if were going to get into a giant hassle lets do it milo but i just dont see the point no point said milo ill handle any procedural hassles glance at the body bag tell me a bedtime story del del said okay so she hears the door opening wakes up shes normally a good sleeper but tonight she was jumpy because of the docs call he looked at me something about your being followed some weird nazi stuff that i couldnt really make out what i did get was that cause you sounded worried that worried her goddam good reason to be worried said milo del stared at milos wounds and said your hot partys related to this milo let out a long sigh suddenly he looked weak and wasted its a long story del you wouldnt believe it if i tried to give it to you for free im openminded said del milo smiled its a fourdrink story delano you buy i tell after the paperwork fuck the paperwork hardy shrugged youre the dthree someone gets on my case i blame it all on you you sure you dont want a blanket im fine said milo tell the story where was i said del yeah she was jumpy so jumpy she took her gun out of storage s and w police special apparently it used to belong to someone named mondo back in texas where shes originally from she didnt want to talk about that i couldnt get that part real clear if the reg isnt kosher i imagine we can work that out too right no bernie goetz illegal weapons bullshit anyway she had a box of bullets for it loaded it up put it on her night stand and had it ready to grab when she heard the intruder out in the living room intruder came tippytoeing in there was light from the window above the bed she could see the intruder swinging something we found it over in the corner louisville slugger with nails sticking out of it real pretty she yelled at the intruder to stop intruder kept coming she yelled again kept yelling intruder didnt pay any mind so she emptied the gun three slugs in the intruder three nearmisses in the wall shes a damn good shot considering the situation hope she doesnt waste too much time on guilt he knelt beside the bag now for the interesting part tugging down and parting a foot of zipper it sounded like something ripping a face stared up at us female capuchinmonkey face under dirtyblond hair mussed hair eyes closed the left one puffy and plumcolored skin tinted gray the greenishgray reserved for deaths palette a quartersized blackedged ruby hole in the left cheek dry lips parted between them a sliver of cornniblet tooth a woman said hardy can you top that no id nothing on her one thing we should have them dust is the bat hopefully well pull something off of that she calls herself crisp i said audrey crisp that may or may not be her real name yeah said del well crisp got herself crisped shaking his head tugging the zipper another inch lower want to see more anything to see said milo just two more holes down below milo shook his head del zipped up the bag lady with a baseball bat all those spikes like one of those medieval things mace or something gotta be one for the books right ever see that before milo i walked back into the bedroom sat on the bed linda opened her eyes muttered something that could have been my name with no evidence to the contrary i decided it had been my name the power of wishful thinking i brushed hair away from her brow and kissed it she whimpered and turned on her side facing me looking up at me i lay down beside her and closed my eyes when the ambulance attendants came for her they had to wake me had to pry my arm from around her waist and hers from mine her father flew in the next morning from texas id expected gary cooper and got lyndon johnson out of a trash compactor short stout big ears with banjo lobes whiskey nose crinkle chin the only genetic link to linda i could discern a pair of small delicate hands that he kept plastered to his sides nothing texas rangerish about his clothes either powderblue sport coat yellow golf shirt white seersucker slacks brown patentleather loafers he called me sir a lot not sure who i was not sure who his daughter was when he walked into the hospital room she gave a weary smile and i left the two of them alone she left with him the following day promising to call when she got to san antonio following through that evening but sounding tentative herself as if someone was listening in and she was unable to talk freely i told her to take her time healing that id check to make sure the kids at hale were okay that i was there for her whenever she needed me working at making it sound convincing putting a little therapist in my voice she said that means a lot to me alex i know the kids are going to be okay the person theyre using for substitute principal is really good i went to school with him hell do a good job im glad can he call you for advice of course thanks youre so terrific my head is swelling swelling swelling i mean it you are by the way carla has your gift we got a gift for you last week its a set of mark twain the complete works i know you like books i hope you like twain i love twain its an old leather set really pretty i found it for you myself in an antiques store wish i could be there to give it to you but carla will send it to you unless youre at the school then you can pick it up in my office on the desk ill go by thanks pause alex i know this is nervy but do you think you could possibly come on out here spend some time with me not just yet but maybe a little later sounds good to me great ill take you around show you a good time i promise you can have grits for the second time as soon as things settle down look forward to it remember the alamo remember me later that day robin came by with deli sandwiches and jug wine a beautiful smile and a soft quick kiss on the lips we sat facing each other at the ash burl trestle table shed handcarved years ago first time in a long time wed been in the same room if wed scheduled it id have spent hours dreading it but it ended up nice nothing physical nothing covert or calculated or stiff no excavation of old wounds debridement of damaged flesh it wasnt denial there just didnt seem to be any scars either of us could see or feel or maybe it was the wine we sat talking and eating and drinking discussing the pisspoor state of the world occupational hazards occupational joys trading bad jokes the space between us smooth soft babysmooth as if wed birthed something healthy i started to believe friendship was possible when she left my loneliness was tempered by the pleasant confusion of hope and when milo came by to pick me up i was in an amazingly good mood surveillance numb butts but nice to be on the other side the first couple of days yielded no results i learned about cop boredom about selfdoubt about how even the best of friendships get strained by too much of nothing but i refused milos repeated offers to drop out what your year for masochism my year for closure if your guess is right he said if lots of ifs i said if you dont want to bother ill do it myself he smiled joe detective joe curious you think im reaching it was just a look he turned to me the swelling down his wounds greening but one eye was still puffy and wet and his gait was stiff no alex he said softly i think youre worth listening to ive always thought so besides what do we have to lose except sanity and not much of that left right its only been fortyeight hours lets give it at least another couple of days so we sat in the rented car until our butts turned downright frozen ate stale fast food did crossword puzzles engaged in inane chatter that neither of us would have tolerated under different circumstances the second day it happened the maroon volvo rolled away from suburbia the way it always did but this time it abandoned home territory and headed for the freeway milo hung back until it had climbed a northbound onramp then followed hanging back several car lengths you see he said turning the steering wheel with one finger this is the way its done subtly no way short of psychic powers hes going to see us bravado in his voice but he kept checking the rearview mirror i said howre your psychic powers finely honed a moment later i knew the department would buy my story didnt i his story posttraumatic stress reaction a need for seclusion escape from la hed been thorough buying an airplane ticket for indianapolis showing up at lax only to duck out of line just before boarding picking up a rental cadillac and driving into the valley checking into a motel out in agoura under the name s l euth then surveillance the other side picking me up at a preassigned place that changed each day watching making sure we werent being watched today he had on a brown polo shirt tan cords white sneakers and an old felt dodgers cap on his head umm nice leather he said fondling the mochacolored armrest that bisected the sedan de villes bench seat nice even if it does drive mushy i can see why you hold on to yours not too obtrusive for a tail la chevy pal your pricier neighborhoods this is what the help drives he smiled besides its brown like my fashion statement blends in with all the bullshit we followed the volvo onto the toward ventura stayed with it all the way through the west valley when it switched to the north just past westlake village milo sat up straighter and smiled i said lets hear it for educated guesses we sped past an industrial park with hightech leanings vaguely ominous limestone and mirrorglass buildings with nondescript logos securitygated parking lots and streets with names like science drive and progress circle the volvo kept going when traffic thinned out at moorpark milo pulled over to the shoulder and stopped i said what is it now we are too conspicuous gonna give him a mile then get back on not worried about losing him he shook his head we know where hes going dont we if our informations up to date he said the colonels information frowned and checked his watch and got back on the highway the highway became grimes canyon and evolved into a narrow serpentine mountain pass no other cars going our way a few huge tankers coming from the opposite direction the curves challenged the cadillac and milo put two hands on the wheel shifting his weight he said now the mushiness isnt fun i said you could have borrowed the colonels honda right god knows what kind of crap and gizmos hes packed it with would you feel comfortable talking in something he owned nope him and his data banks guys got more info than the irs you see how fast he came up with what we wanted but try to get something on him and other data banks dry up real fast i had a very reliable source on it alex same guy in washington who helped me trace kaltenblud all his computer had to say about the colonel was name rank date of discharge ditto with major bunyan i said new age warrior becomes new age entrepreneur i wouldnt have pegged him for a colonel what then some clerk hes exactly what a colonel is a general even forget the george c scott stuff go high enough in any organization and what you get is assholes exactly like him suddenly angry again i said he thinks he saved our lives milo grunted i said maybe he did but i think we had a pretty good chance without him that sleepingbeauty act you pulled took me by surprise he grunted again the road straightened and we were in agricultural country mountainrimmed ruleredged plots of flat dry lowlands ready for harvest cows grazing side by side with bobbinggrasshopper oil wells pig and egg farms horse breeders where gorgeous arabians pranced arrogantly around roadside corrals acres of citrus being cultivated for sunkist the end point of the view from howard burdens office window the maroon volvo was nowhere in sight nice i said looking up through the windshield at clean blue sky if you have to run do it in style we crossed a greenhooded bridge over a dry bed of the santa clara river and kept going to the junction at fillmore past a business district consisting of wellpreserved twostory brick buildings on spotless empty shopping streets striped with meterless diagonal parking spaces fullservice gas stations staffed by attendants in hats and uniforms and a frosty mug root beer stand that could have been part of the set for american graffiti then a continuation of the highway and more citrus groves working ranches and produce stands advertising nuts olives tomatoes corn and all natural beef jerky just a few more miles to the base of the mountains and piru the outskirts of town was abandoned railyards and citrus warehouses derelict auto bodies and lots of dust a hundred yards in were clumps of small poor houses oneand tworoom structures set in chockablock randomness on fenced dirt lots untrimmed trees lined the road date palms plums beeches and stockylimbed carobs that emitted a spermy perfume which insinuated itself into the cars airconditioning system and lingered chickens in the front yard toddlers in handmedowns making toys out of found materials inflatable wading pools the few adult faces we saw were sunbeaten and solemn tending toward elderly and hispanic main street was a couple of blocks that crawled past a onestory bank so petite it resembled a countyfair model yellow brick tile roof gilt script on the windows over drawn venetian blinds closed then a general store a couple of saloons one with a handwritten menudo today poster taped to the front window and a silveredwood barnlike structure advertising auto repair tack and ferrier supplies bait and tackle milo drove another half block until we reached more empty freightyard stopping and consulting his thomas guide he jabbed a finger at a map page and said okay no problem no problem finding anything here were not talking megalopolis no problem i said if you know theres something to look for circling the tack shop he drove down a back street crossed main and coasted for another couple of blocks before turning off onto orchard the road took on a mild grade turned to dirt and ended at a bungalow court flatroofed buildings of yellow stucco half a dozen of them less than a foot of separation between the units in the center a plaster fountain that hadnt spouted for a long time the volvo was parked at the curb windows open unoccupied with a cardboard sunscreen stretched across the windshield we got out the air was broiling and smelled like marmalade milo pointed again this time for direction we walked past the bungalows taking a dusty path that ran along the right side of the court behind the units in what would have been the backyard was another building fenced by waisthigh pickets that needed priming and painting white frame cottage green sash and shutters tar roof warped porch plank swing hanging lopsided from one piece of rope to the left a weeping willow grew out of the dirt dreaming the impossible dream huge and rich with foliage it imprisoned the tiny house in a wide black ellipse of shade the drapes were drawn milo pointed to the left of the big tree and i followed him twostep cement porch rear panel door he knocked a voice said who is it milo said naranjas sorry weve got milo raised his voice and gave it a plaintive twist naranjas muy barato muy bonito the door opened milo shoved his foot in it and smiled ted dinwiddie stared out at us startled his ruddy face mottled by patches of pallor he said i and remained frozen he was dressed the same way hed been at the market minus the apron blue broadcloth shirt rolled to the elbows rep tie loosened at the neck khaki slacks rubbersoled cordovans same good burghers uniform he wore every day he kept staring finally managed to move his lips what is it milo said even though my mother spent years trying to convince me otherwise i never developed a taste for asparagus so i guess were here to see your other special dinwiddie said i dont know what you look said milo his voice gentle and scary at the same time i was never any fashion model i need all the help i can get to be able to walk down the street without freaking out little kids this he pointed to his eye aint exactly help dinwiddie said im sor can the apologies said milo your being a little more forthcoming in the first place might have prevented substantial pain and suffering to my person i said hes understating the two of us nearly lost our lives trying to figure it out dinwiddie said i know that i read the papers for gods sake he bit his lip im sorry i never meant for it to then how about you let us in out of the heat milo said i what purpose would that really serve milo turned to me whats that word you used dr delaware closure closure ted dr delaware and i would like some closure dinwiddie bit his lip again and tugged his straw mustache closure he said you took psychology said milo or was it sociology either case that should mean something to you mans search for meaning and finality in a cruel ambiguous world man trying to figure out what the fuck is going on he grinned and put his hand on the doorknob dinwiddie said and after that what thats it ted scouts honor i dont believe much in honor anymore detective milo lifted the bill of his baseball cap and wiped the sweat from his forehead brushed away black hair and exposed white sweaty skin knobbed and scraped and scabbed dinwiddie winced milo tapped his foot lost your innocence huh well bully for you mr clean but theres still plenty of explaining to do a voice sounded behind dinwiddie the words incomprehensible but the tone pure question mark the grocer looked over his shoulder and milo took the opportunity to grasp his shoulders move him aside like a toy and walk into the house before dinwiddie realized what was happening i was inside too small kitchen hot as a steambath with white cabinets and counter tops of yellow tile laid diagonally and bordered with winecolored bullnose open doorway to a paneled room yellow enamel walls white porcelain sink fourburner gas stove a pyrex carafe halffilled with water on one of the burners five big paper doublebags printed with the name of dinwiddies market sitting on the counter a sixth bag unpacked boxes of cereal bags of whole wheat flour and sugar sausages smoked meats and fish spaghetti tea a jumbo mochacolored can of deluxegrade colombian coffee holding the can was a boy wearing a baggy tshirt and cutoff jeans i knew his age but he looked younger could have been a high school senior varsity letter in basketball mochacolored himself very tall very thin lightbrown hair worn in a twoinch afro longer than in his photo full lips roman nose his fathers nose almond eyes full of terror he lifted the can as if it were a weapon milo said its all right son were not here to hurt you the boy darted his head at dinwiddie the grocer said these are the two i told you about ike the cop and the psychologist according to the papers theyre on the right side the papers said the boy aiming for defiance but his voice was reedy uneven adolescent in its lack of confidence big hands tightened around the can his legs were skinny and hairless cinnamon sticks perched on bare feet i dont want to talk to you he said maybe so said milo walking up to him and standing on the balls of his feet to go eye to eye but you owe us son you owe someone else too but its too late for that at least this is a debt you can pay the boy retracted his head and blinked the hand holding the can faltered milo reached up and took it from him french roast he said examining the label only the best for a superhip fugitive huh and look at all this other good stuff motioning toward the counter granola pasta what is that tagliarini looks like youve got yourself hunkered down for the long haul son comfy lot more comfy than where holly ended up the boy clenched his eyes shut and opened them blinked again several times harder a tear rolled down his cheek and his adams apple rose and fell ike said dinwiddie alarmed weve been through that dont let him guilttrip you a cold look at milo hasnt he been through enough milo said tell it like it is ted wasnt that an axiom you once lived by the flush had returned to dinwiddies complexion and his thick forearms were lumpy with tightened muscle he was sweating heavily i realized i was sodden all four of us were dinwiddie tugged at his mustache and lowered his head like a bull about to charge i smelled confrontation said to the boy were not your enemies once in a while the papers do get it right we know what youve been through son the running looking over your shoulder never knowing who to trust thats got to be hell so no ones saying anyone in your shoes could have handled it any better you did exactly what you had to but what you know can be useful to get rid of the evil that remains draining the whole swamp terry crevolins agreed to talk and hes not exactly mr idealistic so how about you the boy said nothing i said were not going to force you no one can but how long can you go on like this lies said a brittle voice from the doorway a very small old woman wearing a grayandpink print shift and over that despite the heat a coarsely woven porridgecolored cardigan beneath the shift bowed legs encased in supphose ended in flat sandals her face was wizened and sunspotted under a halo of white frizz big dark eyes clear and steady i wasnt surprised by her appearance remembering latch and ahlwards reaction when i talked about their plucking her off the street and disposing of her body blank stares from both of them no smirking no jumping to take the credit just a look my educated guess but something did surprise me steady hands in one so tiny and old gripping a very big shotgun she said cossacks lying bastards clear eyes too clear something other than mental clarity beyond lucidity a flame that had burned too hot for too long ike said grandma what are you doing put that down cossacks every christmas a pogrom raping and killing and giving the babies to the nazis to eat she aimed the weapon at me held it there for a while shifted it to milo then to dinwiddie to ike then back to dinwiddie come on sophie said the grocer back or ill blast you you cossack bastard said the old woman eyes jumping from one imaginary foe to the other hands shaking the shotgun vibrating ike said grandma enough put that down loud a little whiny a teenager protesting unfair punishment she looked at him long enough for confusion to finally settle in its okay said dinwiddie pushing down with one hand in a calming gesture and taking a step forward her eyes shot back to him back ill blast you you goddammed cossack ike called out grandma dinwiddie said its okay and walked toward the old woman she pulled the trigger click she stared down at the weapon with more confusion dinwiddie put one hand on the walnut stock the other on the barrel and tried to wrest it away from her she held on to it cursing first in english then louder and faster in a language i guessed was russian easy does it sophie said dinwiddie as he carefully pried her fingers from the gun deprived of it she began shrieking and hitting him ike ran to her tried to restrain her but she struck out at him continued to curse the boy struggled with her absorbing blows taking pains to be gentle tears streaming down his face unloaded said dinwiddie handing the shotgun to milo as if it were something unclean to ike i took out the shells last time i was here ike gaped at him where whered you put them theyre not here ike i took them with me ike said why ted talking loud to be heard over the old womans invectives his tall body canopied over her tiny sweatered frame trying to contain her with his spidery arms while fixing his attention on dinwiddie dinwiddie held out his hands and said i had to ike the way she is how shes gotten you just saw that she didnt even know how to use it ted you just saw that i couldnt take a chance ike she was so much worse the last time so you know thats true we talked about it your worries i didnt want anything to happen its obvious i was right the boys face was a battlefield comforting calm for the old woman warring with the pain and rage of betrayal what about our protection ted our arrangement where did that leave us tell me that ted it was a judgment call said dinwiddie what could i do i couldnt take a chance shed ike stamped his foot and began shouting we need protection shotgun protection i know what a shotgun can do i saw what a shotgun can do thats why i asked you for a shotgun ted not some stupid metal tube that clicks and blows air you got me a shotgun because thats what i needed ted now you pull it out from under me without how could you do that ted the words rushing out followed by short harsh breaths fugitive panting fugitive eyes his passion had silenced the old woman shed stopped struggling was looking up at him with the innocence and bafflement of an infant on a first outing dinwiddie shook his head turned away and rested his elbows on the counter one of his hands brushed against a package of pasta he picked it up looked at it absently milo inspected the shotgun this things right out of the box never been fired silence filled the kitchen choking it draining the air of oxygen such a good boy said the old woman reaching up and touching ikes cheek the cossacks come you protect your bubbe yes grandma yes bubbe yes bubbe how are you feeling the old woman shrugged a little tired maybe how about a nap bubbe another shrug she took one of his hands in both of hers and kissed it he escorted her through the doorway milo began to follow ike turned around sharply dont worry mr detective im not going anywhere cant handle going anywhere just let me take care of her then ill come back and you can do whatever it is you want with me we waited for him in the living room knottypine panels working fireplace under a fieldstone mantel brickabrac that had once been meaningful to someone hooked rug overstuffed chairs treestump end tables a couple of trophy fish on plaques over the mantel next to them a snapshot of a beaming whitehaired boy holding an enormous trout it brought to mind the shot of the two children id seen in dinwiddies office but this one was blackandwhite the boys clothes two or three decades out of fashion below that a shot of a heavyset man in wading boots his arm around the same boy a string of fish hanging from the other arm dinwiddie saw me looking we used to come up here a lot dad owned lots of the land around here bought it up after the war thinking hed combine growing with selling avoid the middleman become seriousrich a couple of cold years killed off the profit margin in citrus but the mortgage stayed the same the big outfits could wait it out but it dampened dads enthusiasm so he sold a lot of his acreage to the sunkist coop we continued to come up for a couple of weeks each year and fish just the two of us lake piru used to be jumping with rainbows and bass last few years the rains have been weak and everythings dried up theyre not releasing anything out of the fillmore hatchery until they can be sure the survival ratell be high im sure you saw that coming over the santa clara the dry beds milo and i nodded can i get you coffee or something said dinwiddie we shook our heads he said in the early sixties dad got into another cashflow problem and sold off most of the land he still owned in town like the bungalows in front of us the plot where the school is now all of it gone fast and cheap he kept only this house guess he was more sentimental than hed ever have admitted when he died i inherited it started bringing my own boys up here until the drought i figured it would be a good place who bothers to come out here except truckers lots of mexicans and old people the two of them wouldnt stand out i said makes sense i did it because i had to there was no choice not after ike raised my consciousness he stopped waited for a challenge and when none came said hed talk about the holocaust how so few people had hidden jews how only the danes had stood up as a country how the whole thing could have been prevented if more people had stood up done the right thing you hear that you start to wonder what you would have done the depth of your own principles its like this psych experiment they did years ago im sure you know it telling people to shock other people for no good reason and most people did it just to obey shocked total strangers even though they knew it was wrong didnt want to id always told myself id be different one of the noble few but i was never really sure how can you be when its all theoretical the way my life had gone everything was theoretical so when ike called me middle of the night so scared told me what theyd tried to do to him i knew what i had to do and i know i did the right thing im sorry if it caused you milo said you pick up the old lady too dinwiddie nodded both of us did that she wouldnt have gone with me alone ike was taking a chance coming back to town knowing they were after him but he loved her was worried about what might happen to her especially worried because of the way shed become what is it alzheimers dinwiddie said who knows she wont go to a doctor to me her age it could be anything right hardening of the arteries whatever i said how long has it been going on ike said just a few months said she was such a bright woman before the change that most people didnt notice anything different because when she talked she still made sense and shed always gone on about conspiracies cossacks whatever so if she did it a little more whod notice the way she is now of course youd notice but thats just been the last few weeks maybe its the stress of hiding i dont know he lowered his head rested his forehead in his hands so the two of you came back to town and got her milo said yeah said dinwiddie talking to the hooked rug when she wasnt home ike figured shed either be at the synagogue or walking around shed always loved to walk had started doing it even more since the change in the dark when it wasnt safe we drove to the synagogue saw there was some kind of party inside and waited until she left then we picked her up and brought her here she didnt want to come was yelling at us a lot but ike managed to calm her down hes the only one who seems to be able to calm her down he looked down again knitted his hands and swung them between his knees theres something special between them more than just family the bond of survivors hes not even twenty has been through way too much for someone that age for anyone so bear that in mind okay ike came back into the room and said bear what in mind dinwiddie sat up i was just telling them to keep things in perspective hows shes doing sleeping what kind of perspective just everything thats been going on in other words coddle me out of pity no said dinwiddie the boy looked away from him ike about the shotgun forget it ted you ended up saving your own life what could be better generous smile startling in its suddenness but largesse tainted by bitterness dinwiddie picked up on it knew what it meant an immutable change in the bond between them and his expression turned to misery milo said you ready to tell us what happened son ike said how much do you know everything up to bear lodge bear lodge he said rural nirvana some pipe dream huh all i know about that is what ive been told by grandma whered you live afterward whered i live the boy smiled again and ticked off fingers boston evanston illinois louisville kentucky i was a regular ramblin man another smile so forced it was painful to look at i said not philadelphia philadelphia nope im with w c fields on that one terry crevolin said your fathers family was from philadelphia family the smile opened and twisted and turned into an angry laugh my fathers family was wiped out fifty years ago except for one distant cousin in philadelphia fatcat lawyer ive never even talked to him couldnt imagine hed welcome me with open arms another laugh no grandma wouldnt have sentenced me to philadelphia i said those other places was that your mothers family he cocked a finger at me you guessed it smart person you get the rubber duckie a progressive series of nice middleclass negro neighborhoods where i wouldnt stand out like chocolate syrup in milk nice hospitable relatives who tolerated me until they got sick of me or got scared of what it meant putting me up or things just got too crowded the middle class likes its comforts dinwiddie said why dont you sit down ike the boy wheeled on him what and relax but he did lower himself into an armchair stiltlegs stretching out onto the hooked rug a long silence when milo didnt break it i said any reason you chose a spanish surname spanish oh yeah that id been using montvert some of my moms family were creoles so it seemed appropriate to go french another joyless smile then when i moved here i needed a new one covering tracks i thought of russian for grandma but who would buy that on me i didnt want to attract attention then one day i scoped out ocean heights it had been in the news massengils jim crow bullshit i wanted to take a look at the place see what kkk territory looked like in the eighties took a drive through beaver cleaverland but i noticed they had all these spanish names for the streets stone hypocrisy so i thought why not do em one better go for español which would be verde but that sounded wrong like it wouldnt be someones name so i checked out a spanishenglish dictionary green slang for novice which i was an la novice go west young man novato had a cool ring to it the rest as they say is will and ariel durant territory milo had started to squirm halfway through the speech he said howd it happen the alley boy said ike youre a real master of subtlety fuck subtlety said milo lets aim for truth the boys turn to be startled then a genuine smile he said by the time they told me to meet them in the alley id started to suspect something weird latch was too nice i mean the guy was an elected official and we were talking about murder blowing things up him being really casual as if it were no big deal as if he were still a revolutionary not that i ever really trusted him in the first place grandma didnt trust him said the fact that hed gone into establishment politics said plenty about him so when be told me about the meeting new information i said sure faked being all gungho but i was suspicious from the outset why down there in watts ike nodded exactly that bothered me too latchs story was the source i was going to meet was someone who lived there from mom and dads past the black liberation army someone still wanted by the authorities needed the cover of watts couldnt afford to leave home territory latch give you a name abdul malik but he said that was just a code he liked codes like some kid playing i spy i never really bought it the real reason for watts said dinwiddie was that a black body there wouldnt cause the police to blink an eye and thats exactly what happened isnt it milo ignored that said to ike so in spite of it smelling bad you went down there i had to know what was going on i figured if they were going to pull something theyd do it another time another place might as well be prepared see what was going on so i showed up early hid my bike in the next alley and found a hiding place next to this garage behind some garbage cans the bulb was out and that part of the alley was really dark and rank something out of a nightmare he grimaced remembering junkies sneaking in and out all these low whispers deals going down people shooting up snorting taking leaks taking dumps i started to get scared wondering what id gotten myself into but as it got later closer to the time i was supposed to meet this malik the action started to slow when was that said milo about three am i heard somewhere thats the killing time of day time the life forces are weak hiding in that place you could really feel it everything going dead anyway the junkies and dealers started to go home only a few stragglers real losers nodding off not caring if they were sitting in dog shit or whatever he gave a sick look stopped milo said go on one of them one of the stragglers was about my size maybe a little shorter but almost the same size and really skinny like me i noticed him because of that kind of identified with him thinking about what led him to get that way there but for the grace of god and all that kind of stuff i mean this guy was really pathetic totally wasted walking back and forth muttering stoked on god knows how many different kinds of poison im watching him watching all of this the smells seem to be getting worse and the darkness starts to get really heavy crushing down on me i know now it was my anxiety i start thinking anxietythoughts like is someone going to steal my bike and am i going to get stranded here who knows whos out there watching then the guy they sent to do the job shows up hes early too half hour early i can tell cause hes dressed in black wearing this long black coat even though its summer thats one thing that tipped me off though by itself it didnt mean much junkies get cold but he stepped under a garage light and i saw that he was a white guy real cracker face turnedup pig nose but with stuff on his face greasepaint to make him look black like a minstrel act in the darkness it almost worked the few junkies who were left never noticed they just wanted their dope but i was looking out for it so i caught it right away this guy just kind of saunters in walking cool headbopping trying to look as if he belongs there but overdoing it playing black then when he saw no one was paying attention to him looking at his watch showing how jumpy he was i stay behind the garbage cans then this tall thin junkie spots him says yo bro and starts ambling up to him talking really slurred stoned out of his mind maybe he was trying to buy or sell or just hitting the white guy up for a handout the guy in the coat says my nameyo malcolm like that and the junkie mutters something back doesnt say hes not me and keeps coming at him maybe he even wanted to mug him or something i dont know he was pretty big must have looked pretty scary to old whitey so old whitey pulls something out of the coat sawedoff shotgun and blasts the tall guy from right up close maybe he was two feet away if that i could see him fly back as if hed been hit by a hurricane just fly back and fall the other stragglers started running it was weird no screams no one talking just silent running like rats like they were used to it this was no big deal then the white guy in the coat runs away and i hear a car start at the end of the alley and drive off i wait awhile scared out of my mind but knowing i should go over to the junkie see if theres anything i can do for him even though i know there isnt the way he was thrown back the way he exploded but finally i do when i see what the shotgun did to him i get really sick for him and also i guess because i know this is what they meant for me im dizzy i feel like throwing up but i know ive got to get out of there before the police show up so i hold it in my stomachs really killing me churning i need to go to the bathroom then i think of something some way to take something good out of this make the junkies life meaningful i put my hands in his pockets its disgusting theyre all wet with blood and empty except for some pills no id i slip my id in and split hoping the way he looks what the shotgun did to him us being around the same size no one will figure it out later riding away i get real paranoid about it start to shake tell myself it was the most idiotic thing i could have done what if they do figure it out theres my id right on the body im cooked i could be busted for murder so i call ted from a pay phone he gets out of bed and drives me here and i wait scared out of my mind out here in nowheresville for the cops to come looking for me for latchs nazis to come looking for me the next day the cops do come around talking to grandma asking about my involvement with dope accepting the dead body as me so im officially dead smile never thought it would feel so good the smile faded but i cant stop thinking about the junkie his dying for me like the azazel goat in the bible almost as if he were my jesus if i believed in jesus i think about the fact that he was someones little kid once maybe someone loved him now no one will ever know what happened to him then i rationalize it saying it wouldnt make him any more alive to tell the story the way he was so far gone probably everyone whod once loved him had given up on him looking to us for confirmation i gave a supportive smile and nodded milo nodded too the boy clenched and opened his hands blinked wiped his eyes when he spoke again his voice was small and tight i know what youre thinking he said holly another sacrifice but i had no idea shed do what she did it wasnt as if the two of us were confidants or anything i felt sorry for her so lonely so closed in that father who treated her like a slave if i had known i would have called her warned her not to do anything stupid milo said what did the two of you talk about son using the voice id heard him use with victims things said the boy wretched all kinds of things she didnt talk much herself she wasnt very bright just a step above retarded really so i did all the talking i had to do all the talking he held his hands out supplicating zeroing in on milo wanting a cops forgiveness milo said absolutely if you didnt talk it would have been like treating her the way everyone else did shutting her out exactly shining her on everyone shined her on treated her like some kind of subhuman creature even that father of hers going around doing his own thing with his computers pretending she didnt exist she told me that told me how he expected her to do his housework his scutwork for no money after we got to know each other she said her dad had been in the army a general or something demanded everything perfect that she could never be perfect so she knew hed never like her ever meet the father said milo just in passing he walked by me once or twice pretending i didnt exist whether it was racism or just the way he was i didnt know until ted told me he looked at dinwiddie and our eyes followed the grocer looked uncomfortable what i told him is that burden was strange to be careful the whole family was strange and the other stuff ike said softly rumors said dinwiddie about burden having been some kind of government spy rumors that were going around back when i was in high school we used to ask howard about it he always said he didnt know but no one believed him why wouldnt he know about his own father we figured he was hedging this was the sixties it was uncool to be military not that i really believed it but i just wanted ike to know that he was dealing with a possible risk factor so as not to get into trouble you wanted to make sure i didnt sleep with her said ike smiling without malice which is cool that would have been stupid but there was never any chance of that it wasnt she wasnt like that wasnt feminine more like a kid gullible it would have been like sleeping with a kid perverted milo nodded again and said how much detail did you give her about wannsee more than i realized i guess when id come over there shed be so happy to see me set out food start to make a big deal about it i was the only one who gave her any attention so i guess i just kind of went on talking my head off you mention latchs name he looked down muttered something that passed for uhhuh and massengils all of it still downcast and muttering he looked up suddenly weteyed again i had no idea she was really listening half the time she was so spacedout i felt like i was talking to a wall talking to myself almost a stream of consciousness thing just letting it all out i dont even remember what i told her how much i told her if ida known he broke off shook his head wept dinwiddie went over to him and patted his shoulder milo waited a long time before saying it wasnt your fault the thin brown face shot up like a jackinthebox no nothing like that whose fault was it you want to torture yourself with guilt son wait until youre a bit older after youve given yourself some good reason ike stared at him dried his eyes youre weird man for a cop what is it you want from me thats up to you said milo latch and ahlward and a bunch of the others are dead mrs latch is being looked into but quite a few of them too many of them survived weve got very little to hold them on nothing thatll do serious damage in terms of jail time and maybe thats no big deal theyre all a bunch of sheep with the leaders gone theyll forget politics go into real estate or growing dope or writing screenplays whatever but maybe not meaning meaning you were an eyewitness to a homicide maybe you saw enough of the asshole in the coat to be able to match him up to a face match that pig nose if you dont want to bother i understand you cant buy beer legally and youve been through ten lifetimes worth of shit you still dont trust anyone know whos right whos wrong but if you can id him theres a chance we can put the nazi flick away get some of the others for conspiracy get them really seared and talking thats it said the boy match a face course not said milo if you do get a match therell be depositions subpoenas the whole legal ball of twine if it gets that far the police department will offer you protection but the truth is that can be kind of halfassed so ill protect you myself make sure its done right ill also make sure your grandma gets protection and good medical help ive got close medical connections why why what why go to all the bother milo shrugged part of its personal im still plenty pissed at them what they did to me he ran his hand over his face removed his baseball cap and scratched his head sweat and pressure had turned his hair into something black and oily and sodden also maybe im curious the way ted was how id react being asked to shock someone he yawned stretched put his hat back on anyway im not going to pressure you son tell me to forget it and i drive back to la you go on to your next hideyhole sayonara the boy thought for a while bit his nails gnawed his knuckles match a face it was a long time ago pretty dark what if i cant then its byebye and good luck do i have to see them him in person or can i just look at some photos photos for a start if you come up with an id well do a lineup with full security behind a oneway mirror the boy got up paced punched his palm with his other hand i couldnt help thinking how much he reminded me of milo wrestling always wrestling okay he finally said ill look at your photos when right now said milo if youre ready ive got stuff in the car it ended the way it started turn on your tv alex id been sitting at the dining room window watching the sun set over the glen reading twain then poetry whitman robert penn warren dylan thomas stuff id neglected for too long stuff with body to it music and lust and despair and religion is it important milo quick or youll miss it i got up and switched on the tube six oclock news tape of lieutenant frisk at a podium below him a microphone audience fawncolored suit cream shirt green tie grinning and blathering about longterm investigations interdepartmental task forces multiple indictments the result of careful coordination with federal and state agencies using the word hero looking as if he had to force his lips around it holding out a hand milo stepped up to the podium frisk shook his hand handed milo a piece of paper milo took it looked at it gave the camera a hi mom smile pocketed the commendation frisk stood away from him stood back waiting for him to leave the stage milo stayed there still smiling frisk looked puzzled milo mugged for the camera again turned and faced frisk drew back his arm and hit frisk
