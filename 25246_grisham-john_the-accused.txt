john grisham the accused chapter the accused was a wealthy man by the name of pete duffy and his alleged crime was murder according to the police and the prosecutors mr duffy strangled his lovely wife in their attractive home on the sixth fairway of a golf course where he the accused was playing golf that day alone if convicted he would spend the rest of his life in prison if acquitted he would walk out of the courtroom a free man as things turned out the jury did not find him guilty or not guilty this was his second trial four months earlier the first trial had ended suddenly when judge henry gantry decided it would be unfair to continue he declared a mistrial and sent everyone home including pete duffy who remained free on bond in most murder cases the accused cannot afford to post a bond and stay out of jail while waiting on a trial but because mr duffy had money and good lawyers he had been free as a bird since the police found his wifes body and the state accused him of killing her he had been seen around towndining in his favorite restaurants watching basketball games at stratten college attending church with greater frequency and of course playing lots of golf as he waited on his first trial he seemed unconcerned with the prospect of a trial and the possibility of prison now though facing his second trial and with a new eyewitness ready to be used by the prosecution pete duffy was rumored to be very worried the new eyewitness was bobby escobar a nineteenyearold illegal immigrant who was working at the golf course on the day mrs duffy was murdered he saw mr duffy enter his home at about the same time she died then hurry away and resume his golf game for a lot of reasons bobby did not come forward until the first trial was underway once judge gantry heard bobbys story he declared a mistrial now with bobby ready to testify most of the folks in strattenburg who had been closely watching the duffy case were expecting a guilty verdict it was almost impossible to find someone who believed pete duffy did not kill his wife and it was also difficult to find a person who did not want to watch the trial a murder trial in the strattenburg courthouse was a rare eventindeed murder was rare in stratten countyand a large crowd began gathering at am just after the front doors of the courthouse opened the jury had been selected three days earlier it was time for the courtroom drama to begin at mr mount got his eighthgrade class quiet and called the roll all sixteen boys were present homeroom lasted for only ten minutes before the boys went off to first period spanish with madame monique mr mount was in a hurry he said okay men you know that today is the first day of the pete duffy trial round two we were allowed to watch the first day of the first trial but as you know my request to watch the second trial was denied several of the boys hissed and booed mr mount raised his hands enough however our esteemed principal mrs gladwell has agreed to allow theo to watch the opening of the trial and report back to us theo theodore boone jumped to his feet and like the lawyers he watched and admired walked purposefully to the front of the room he carried a yellow legal pad just like a real lawyer he stood by mr mounts desk paused for a second and looked at the class as if he were indeed a trial lawyer preparing to address the jury since both of his parents were lawyers and he had practically been raised in their law offices and he hung out in courtrooms while the other eighth graders at strattenburg middle school were playing sports and taking guitar lessons and doing all the things that normal thirteenyearolds tend to do and since he loved the law and studied it and watched it and talked about little else the rest of his class was quick to yield to theo when discussing legal matters when it came to the law theo had no competition at least not in mr mounts eighthgrade homeroom theo began well we saw the first day of the first trial four months ago so you know the lineups and the players the lawyers are the same the charges are the same mr duffy is still mr duffy there is a different jury this time around and of course there is the issue of a new eyewitness who did not testify during the first trial guilty yelled woody from the back of the room several others chimed in and added their agreement all right theo said show of hands who thinks pete duffy is guilty fourteen of sixteen hands shot upward with no hesitation whatsoever chase whipple a mad scientist who took pride in never agreeing with the majority sat with his arms folded across his chest theo did not vote but instead became irritated this is ridiculous how can you vote guilty before the trial has started before we know what the witnesses will say before anything happens weve talked about the presumption of innocence in our system a person charged with a crime is presumed to be innocent until proven guilty pete duffy will walk into the courtroom this morning completely innocent and will remain innocent until all the witnesses have testified and all the proof is before the jury the presumption of innocence remember mr mount stood in a corner and watched theo at his best he had seen this before many times the kid was a natural on his feet the star of the eighthgrade debate team of which mr mount was the faculty adviser theo pressed on still pretending to be indignant at his classmates rush to judgment and proof beyond a reasonable doubt remember whats the matter with you guys guilty woody yelled again and got some laughs theo knew it was a lost cause he said okay okay can i go now sure mr mount replied the bell rang loudly and all sixteen boys headed for the door theo darted into the hallway and raced to the front office where miss gloria the schools secretary was on the phone she liked theo because his mother had handled her first divorce and because theo had once given her some unofficial advice when her brother was caught driving drunk she handed theo a yellow release form signed by mrs gladwell and he was off the clock above her desk gave the time as exactly outside at the bike rack by the flagpole theo unlocked his chain wrapped it around the handlebars and sped away if he obeyed the rules of the road and stayed on the streets he would arrive in front of the courthouse in fifteen minutes but if he took the usual shortcuts and raced through an alley or two and cut across a backyard here and another one there and ran at least two stop signs theo could make it in about ten minutes on this day he did not have time to spare he knew the courtroom was already packed he would be lucky to get a seat he flew through an alley got airborne twice then darted through the backyard of a man he knew an unpleasant man a man who wore a uniform and tried to act as though he were a real officer of the law when in fact he was little more than a parttime security guard his name was buck boland or buck baloney as some people whispered behind his back and theo saw him occasionally hanging around the courthouse as theo flew across mr bolands backyard he heard a loud angry voice get outta here kid theo turned to his left just in time to see mr boland throw a rock in his direction the rock landed very close by and theo pedaled even harder that was close he thought perhaps he should find another route nine minutes after leaving the school theo wheeled to a stop in front of the stratten county courthouse quickly chained his bike to the rack and sprinted inside up the grand staircase and to the massive front doors of judge gantrys courtroom there was a crowd at the doorspectators in a line trying to get in and tv cameras with their bright lights and several grimfaced deputies trying to keep order theos least favorite deputy in all of strattenburg was an old grouchy man named gossett and as luck would have it gossett saw theo trying to ease his way through the crowd where do you think youre going theo gossett growled it should be obvious where im going theo thought quickly to himself where else would i be going at this moment at the beginning of the biggest murder trial in the history of our county but being a wise guy would not help matters theo whipped out his release from school and said sweetly i have permission from my principal to watch the trial sir gossett snatched the release and glared at it as if he might have to shoot theo if his paperwork didnt measure up theo thought about saying if you need some help ill read it for you but again bit his tongue gossett said this is from school this is not a pass to get inside do you have permission from judge gantry yes sir theo said let me see it its not in writing judge gantry gave me verbal permission to watch the trial gossett frowned even harder shook his head with great authority and said sorry theo the courtroom is packed there are no more seats were turning people away theo took his release and tried to appear as if he might burst into tears he backtracked turned around and headed down the long hallway when gossett could no longer see him he ducked through a narrow door and bounced down a utility staircase one used only by the janitors and service technicians on the first floor he eased along a dark cramped corridor that ran under the main courtroom above then stepped nonchalantly into a break room where the courthouse employees gathered for coffee doughnuts and gossip well hello theo said lovely jenny by far theos favorite clerk in the entire courthouse hello jenny he said with a smile as he kept walking across the small room he disappeared into a utility closet came out the other side onto a landing which led to another hidden staircase in decades past this had been used to haul convicts from the jail to the main courtroom to face the wrath of the judges but now it was seldom used the old courthouse was a maze of cramped passageways and narrow staircases and theo knew every one of them he entered the courtroom from a side door next to the jury box the place was buzzing with the nervous chatter of spectators about to see something dramatic uniformed guards milled about chatting with one another and looking important there was a crowd at the main door as people were still trying to get in on the left side of the courtroom in the third row behind the defense table theo saw a familiar face it was his uncle ike and he was saving a seat for his favorite and only nephew theo wiggled and darted down the row and wedged himself into a tight spot next to ike chapter ike boone had once been a lawyer in fact he had once been in the same offices as theos parents the three boones had survived a rocky partnership until ike ran afoul of the law and got himself into trouble big trouble so much trouble that the state bar association revoked his license to practice law now he worked as an accountant and tax adviser to several small businesses in strattenburg he had no family to speak of and was generally an unhappy old man he liked to think of himself as a loner a misfit a rebel who dressed like an old hippie and wore his long white hair pulled back into a ponytail on this day he was wearing typical ike attireancient sandals with no socks faded jeans a red tshirt under a checkered sports coat with frayed sleeves thanks ike theo whispered as he settled into his place ike smiled and said nothing he was to theos right to theos left was an attractive middleaged woman he had never seen as theo looked around he noticed several lawyers seated among the spectators his own parents claimed to be far too busy to waste time watching the trial though theo knew they were keenly interested in it his mother was a wellrespected divorce lawyer with lots of clients and his father handled real estate transactions and never went to court theo would one day be a great courtroom lawyer one who stayed away from divorce and real estate or he might be a great judge like his pal henry gantry he couldnt decide but he had plenty of time he was only thirteen the jury box was empty and because theo had watched so many trials he knew that the jurors were not brought into the courtroom until everyone else was settled there was a large square clock on the wall far above the judges bench and at the prosecutors appeared from a side door with their usual air of great importance they were led by jack hogan a veteran who had been hounding criminals in strattenburg for many years in the first trial four months earlier theo had been greatly impressed with mr hogans courtroom skills and for weeks afterward theo had considered becoming a prosecutor the man the entire town would turn to when a horrible crime had been committed mr hogan was surrounded by several of his younger prosecutors and investigators they made quite a team across the aisle the defense table was desertednot a single member of the pete duffy trial team was present just behind it though in the first row theo could see omar cheepe and his sidekick paco a couple of thugs hired by the defense to investigate things and cause trouble as the clock ticked and the crowd settled in it seemed odd at least to theo that only half the lawyers were present and ready to go judge gantry believed in being prompt and when nothing happened at am sharp the crowd stared at the clock then finally at the defense team entered the courtroom and took seats it was led by clifford nance a wellknown trial lawyer who at that moment looked pale and perplexed he leaned over the bar and huddled with omar cheepe and paco and it was apparent that something was wrong there was no sign of pete duffy who should have been sitting at the defense table next to clifford nance omar cheepe and paco suddenly left the courtroom at a bailiff stood and yelled all rise for the court as he did so judge henry gantry entered from behind his bench his black robe flowing after him the bailiff went on hear ye hear ye the criminal court of the tenth district is now in session the honorable henry gantry presiding let all who have matters come forth may god bless this court please be seated judge gantry said and the crowd still in the process of rising suddenly fell back again judge gantry glared at clifford nance and took a deep breath all eyes followed his and mr nance looked even paler finally judge gantry said mr nance where is the defendant peter duffy clifford nance slowly got to his feet he cleared his throat and when he finally spoke his rich voice sounded scratchy and defeated your honor i do not know mr duffy was scheduled to be in my office this morning at am for a pretrial meeting but he did not show he has not called faxed emailed or texted me or anyone on my staff we have called his phone numbers many times but got nothing weve gone to his home but no one is there we are at this moment searching for him but it appears as though he has vanished theo listened in disbelief as did everyone in the courtroom a deputy stood and said your honor if i may proceed said judge gantry this is the first weve heard of this had we been notified earlier we could have begun a search well start looking now judge gantry said angrily he was obviously upset at the absence of pete duffy he rapped his gavel and said well be in recess for an hour please tell the jurors to make themselves comfortable back there and with that judge gantry disappeared through a door behind his bench for a moment or two the spectators sat in stunned disbelief as if they might see pete duffy walk in any moment now if they simply kept waiting then there were whispers and light chatter then movements as several stood and began milling about no one left though because no one wanted to take the chance of losing a seat surely pete duffy would arrive any minute apologize for being late blame it on a flat tire or something and the trial would go on ten minutes passed theo watched the lawyers slowly ease toward the center of the courtroom and engage in hushed conversations jack hogan and clifford nance huddled as if to compare notes both men frowning gravely what do you think ike theo asked softly looks like he skipped out what does this mean it means a lot of things duffy put up some real estate to secure his bond to guarantee his appearance in court so that property will be forfeited and hell lose it of course if he has indeed skipped out hes not too worried about property here because hell spend the rest of his life on the run hell be a fugitive until they catch him will they catch him they usually do his face will be everywhereall over the internet on wanted posters in the post office and every police station in the country it will be difficult to avoid capture but there have been some famous cases of fugitives who are never caught they usually get out of the country and go to south america or some place im surprised i didnt think pete duffy had the guts to make a run for it guts sure think about it theo the guy killed his wife and got lucky when the first trial ended in a mistrial he knew that would not happen again so he was looking at a lifetime in prison me id rather take my chances on the run hes probably buried some money somewhere got himself some new papers a new name maybe a pal whos helping knowing duffy hes probably got some young woman hooked into his scheme pretty smart move if you ask me ike made it sound like a real adventure but theo wasnt so sure as the clock approached am he gazed at the empty chair where the defendant was supposed to be and found it impossible to believe that pete duffy had jumped bond skipped town and was now prepared to live the life of a fugitive omar cheepe and paco reappeared and huddled with clifford nance from the way they shook their heads whispered urgently and exchanged hard looks it was obvious the situation had not improved pete duffy was nowhere to be found a bailiff rounded up the lawyers and herded them into judge gantrys chambers for another meeting several deputies were telling jokes near the jury box the noise level was rising as the crowd grew restless and frustrated im getting kind of bored theo ike said a few others had left the courtroom i might hang around theo said his only other option was to return to school emptyhanded and suffer through classes the release from the principal plainly stated that theo was excused from school until pm and he did not want to return any sooner trial or no trial are you stopping by this afternoon ike asked it was a monday and the boone family rituals required theo to stop by ikes office every monday afternoon for a visit sure theo said ike smiled and said see you then after he was gone theo weighed the pros and cons of the situation he was disappointed that the biggest criminal trial in the recent history of strattenburg had evidently been sidetracked and that he would not get the chance to watch jack hogan and clifford nance go toetotoe like two gladiators but he was also relieved that bobby escobar would not be forced to testify and point the finger of guilt at pete duffy theo had played a big role in bringing bobby to the attention of judge gantry during the first trial and theo knew that duffys lawyers and his thugs especially omar cheepe and paco were keeping an eye on him theo preferred not to have the attention in fact as the clock ticked and the crowd waited theo decided that the sudden disappearance of pete duffy was a good thing at least for him selfishly he was pleased two men behind theo were having a disagreement in low voices they were arguing over the fact that duffy had been allowed to post a bond the first man said ill bet gantry takes some heat for this if he had denied bail duffy would have been locked up while he waited for his trial the same as every other defendant charged with murder no one gets bail in a murder case gantry caved in because duffy has money the second man said i doubt it why not allow a defendant to post bail and get out hes innocent until proven guilty right why lock up a guy before hes convicted murder or otherwise you cant punish a guy just because he has money duffys bail was a million dollars he put up some property and nobody complained until now anyway theo tended to side with the second guy the first one responded until now thats the whole point bail is supposed to secure his appearance in court guess what hes not here awol flew the coop over the wall well never see him again because gantry granted bail theyll find him ill bet they dont hes probably in mexico city right now getting his face worked on by some plastic surgeons who got rich redoing the eyes and noses of drug lords ill bet they never find pete duffy ill bet you twenty bucks hes back here in thirty days in jail you got it twenty bucks there was a rustle of activity and the bailiffs sprang to attention the lawyers streamed out of judge gantrys chambers and took their places the spectators scurried for their seats and became silent remain seated a bailiff barked judge gantry assumed his position on the bench he rapped his gavel loudly and said order bring in the jury please it was am the jurors filed into the courtroom and took their seats in the jury box when they were in place judge gantry looked sternly at clifford nance and said mr nance where is the defendant nance rose slowly and replied your honor i do not know we have had no contact with mr duffy since ten thirty last night judge gantry looked at jack hogan and said mr hogan your honor we have no choice but to move for a mistrial and i have no choice but to grant one judge gantry then turned and addressed the jury ladies and gentlemen it appears as though the defendant mr peter duffy has disappeared he has been free on bond awaiting this trial and well he has evidently vanished the sheriffs department is conducting a search and the fbi has been notified without a defendant we cannot proceed at this time i apologize for the inconvenience and once again i thank you for your willingness to serve you are dismissed one of the jurors slowly raised her hand and asked but judge what if they find him this afternoon or tomorrow judge gantry seemed surprised by a question coming from the jury box well i suppose it depends on how he is found lets say they catch him at a border trying to sneak out of the country then hell be brought back here to face additional charges that would certainly affect his strategy at trial so he would be entitled to a delay but lets suppose hes found somewhere around here and has a valid excuse for not showing up this morning in that case i would revoke his bond or bail put him in jail and reschedule the trial as soon as possible this satisfied the juror and theo as well court is adjourned judge gantry said and pecked his gavel once again theo waited and waited and finally left when a bailiff was turning off the lights he had no place to go but school and he biked in that general direction two blocks away from the courthouse a black jeep cherokee eased alongside theo its passenger window came down and pacos swarthy head leaned out he smiled but said nothing theo braked and they passed why would they be following him he was rattled and made the quick decision to duck through an alley and cross a backyard he was half looking over his shoulder when a large man stepped in front of him and grabbed the handlebars of his bike hey kid he growled now facetoface with theo it was buck baloney breathing fire and ready for war stay outta my yard okay he growled still gripping the handlebars okay okay sorry theo said afraid of getting slapped whats your name buck hissed theodore boone let go of my bike buck was dressed in an illfitting and cheap uniform with the words a ll p ro s ecurity stitched on the sleeves and he had a rather large pistol on his belt stop cutting across my yard you understand i got it theo said buck let go and theo sped away without getting shot suddenly he was excited about returning to school and to the safety of his classroom chapter theo checked in at the front office and returned his release form his classmates were in fourth period chemistry and theo wanted to avoid walking in late instead he went to mr mounts tiny office down the hall from his classroom the door was open and luckily mr mount was at his desk eating a sandwich and watching the local news on his laptop have a seat mr mount said and theo sat in the only other chair in the office so i guess you know theo said oh yes its all over the news mr mount slid his laptop over a few inches so theo could have a better look the sheriff was talking to a gang of reporters he was saying that there was no sign of mr duffy they had searched his home and found nothing both of his vehicles a mercedes sedan and a ford suv were locked and parked in the garage evidently mr duffy had played golf alone late sunday afternoon and was seen leaving the course by a caddy he was in his golf cart and headed in the general direction of his home on the sixth fairway the same route the caddy had seen him take many times after playing a round at on sunday night pete duffy spoke by phone to clifford nance and according to nance agreed to meet with his defense team at am sharp for a lengthy prep session pete duffy lived two miles east of town in a fairly new development called waverly creek an upscale residential community designed around three golf courses and meant to offer its residents a lot of privacy entry and exit were monitored twentyfour hours a day by guards at gates with surveillance cameras recording everything the sheriff was positive pete duffy had not left waverly creek during the night through one of the gates there are some gravel roads leading in and out and i suppose thats where he went the sheriff speculated it was obvious the sheriff had little patience with reporters he went on to say there was no indication yet of how pete duffy fled on foot bike scooter fourwheeler golf cartthey had not been able to determine that but there was no record of duffy owning a scooter motorcycle or other type of vehicle that required registration in response to random and thoughtless questions the sheriff explained that there was no evidence of an accomplice involved in the duffy escape there was no suicide note in the event he jumped from a bridge or some other dramatic stunt there was no evidence of foul play as if an intruder for some unknown reason wanted to eliminate duffy the night before he was to stand trial and so far they had found no witness who laid eyes on duffy after the caddy saw him drive away with his golf clubs the sheriff finally had enough and excused himself the news station switched back to the studio where a couple of anchors launched into a windy summary of what little had just been said by the sheriff so where is he mr mount asked chewing on his sandwich i cant believe he would take off in the middle of the night on foot and through the woods theo said whats your theory an accomplice duffy is not the outdoor type not a man who understands the woods and what it takes to survive ill bet he slipped away from his house after midnight when his neighbors were sound asleep used a bicycle because he didnt want to make noise and rode a mile or two down a trail where his accomplice was waiting they tossed the bike in the trunk of the car or the back of a pickup and away they went he wasnt due in court until am so they had a head start of seven or eight hours youre really into this arent you theo asked amused sure and youre not of course but i havent given it as much thought as you where is he right now far away the cops have no idea what kind of vehicle theyre driving so theyre home free until more clues pop up he could be anywhere you think theyll catch him something tells me they will not this might be the perfect escape especially if he has an accomplice mr mount was in his midthirties and at least in theos opinion was by far the coolest teacher at the school his father was a judge and his older brother was a lawyer and he often talked of leaving the classroom and going to law school he sponsored the eighthgrade debate team theo was his star and so the two had developed a close friendship as they watched the news on the laptop both minds were spinning wild scenarios about what had happened to pete duffy how had he really managed to disappear i guess well discuss this in government tomorrow theo said are you kidding this town will talk of nothing else for the next two days the bell rang and theo was suddenly ready to leave lunch was only a twentyminute break and there was no time to waste the halls were instantly crowded as five sections of eighth graders hurried from their classrooms to their lockers and to the cafeteria the strattenburg middle school had been modernized a few years earlier and one of the more popular improvements was the new lockers they were wide and deep and made of wood instead of the old noisy metal boxes that had lined the halls for decades keys were not needed because each locker had an entry panel similar to the keypad of a phone punch in your five or sixdigit secret code and the door clicked open theos pass code was judge in honor of his beloved dog he pulled open the door and immediately knew something was wrong several things were missing theo occasionally suffered asthma attacks which required him to use an inhaler he kept one in his pocket at all times and he kept a threepack of reserves in his locker these were gone as was a blue and red minnesota twins cap he kept on a hook in case it rained two unused notepads were missing his books were there stacked on top of each other he froze for a moment staring into the locker to make sure he wasnt dreaming then glanced around to see if anyone the thief might be watching no one seemed to be paying attention to him he shifted his books poked around and finally came to the conclusion that his locker had been broken into he had been robbed smalltime thievery happened occasionally the new lockers though with their advanced security system had virtually eliminated such breakins he looked down the hall and up to a spot above a large wall clock there was an empty bracket where a security camera had once been installed the camera was gone because the school was in the process of updating its videomonitoring system theo wasnt sure what to do if he reported the theft he would spend the next hour or so in the principals office filling out paperwork and worse still he would have to deal with a hundred nosy questions from his friends and classmates as he walked to the cafeteria he decided to wait to think about it to try and figure out how someone could learn his code and break in his locker he could always report it tomorrow he paid two dollars for a bowl of spaghetti a piece of cold bread and a bottle of water he sat with chase and woody and the conversation quickly turned to the duffy trial and disappearance as they talked theo could not help but survey the cafeteria it was filled with eighth graders none of whom was wearing his twins cap as far as theo knew he was the only twins fan in strattenburg during mr mounts study hall that afternoon theo gave a quick description of what hed seen in court that morning then they watched the local news as the duffy story continued to dominate every conversation in town still no sign of the fugitive an fbi agent was interviewed and asked the community for leads so far they had no clues into his disappearance much was being made of the one million dollar bond he had posted to remain free on bail and this led to several stories about his financial situation a former business partner claimed to know duffy well and offered the opinion that he always kept a lot of cash stashed away in secret places this juicy bit of gossip sent the local reporters into a frenzy after school theo checked his locker again and things appeared to be fine nothing else had been taken he thought about changing his pass code but decided to wait changing the code was no simple matter because all codes were registered with the principals office the school maintained the right to open any locker at any time for good cause but this was seldom done on at least one prior occasion theo had failed to properly close his locker and the following day was puzzled to find its door shut but unlocked this was not uncommon in the seventh and eighth grades because the closing mechanism required a student to press and hold the close button for a full three seconds twelve and thirteenyearolds can get in a hurry or get distracted and fail to hold the button long enough by the time theo left the building and walked to his bike he had convinced himself that his locker had been vandalized but not broken into he vowed to be more vigilant theo soon had another problem he unchained his bike wrapped the chain around his handlebars as always and pushed off instantly he realized his front tire was flat he got off his bike examined the tire and found a small gash where someone had punctured the sidewall theo was in the midst of an unlucky run with his bike tires in the previous three months he had collected two nails a piece of glass from a soft drink bottle a jagged piece of metal and he had punctured two front tires on account of reckless riding his father was not happy with this and when the subject of the cost of bike tires came up over dinner things were tense this latest puncture though was no accident someone had deliberately stuck a sharp object into his tire he waited until his friends rode away then began the humiliating journey downtown pushing his bike along streets that now seemed much longer wondering who would do such a thing to him and trying to put this latest act of vandalism in the context of a day that had not gone well the excitement of the trial had vanished omar cheepe and paco had followed him as he rode to school buck baloney had almost hit him with a rock and then caught him the second time he dashed through his backyard someone had vandalized his locker and now thisa slashed bike tire that would cut deeply into his savings account theo couldnt help but take an occasional glance over his shoulder certain that eyes were watching gils bike shop was downtown three blocks from the courthouse on a narrow street lined with small momandpop stores there was a cleaners a shoe shop photo lab bakery a knife sharpener that owed ike money for tax services and a couple of delis theo took pride in knowing every owner gil was one of his favoritesa short round man with an awesome belly that was always partially hidden by a thick work apron covered in dirt and grime gil sold bikes and he loved to repair them his shop was jampacked with models of every size and color with the smaller ones hanging from large hooks in the ceiling and the fancier mountain bikes lined up in the front windows theo rolled his through the front door thoroughly defeated by the day gil was sitting on a stool by the back counter drinking coffee well well he said look whos back hey gil theo said another flat tire what happened gil asked as he rolled himself off the stool and waddled over looks like sabotage gil lifted the handlebars spun the front tire until he found the hole in it and exhaled a soft whistle you make somebody mad not that i know of small penknife id say certainly no accident cant do anything with it theo you gotta have a new one i was afraid of that how much you should know the price better than me eighteen bucks you want me to send the bill to your dad no hes fed up with me and my bike tires ill pay for this one but i cant swing eighteen dollars today how much can you pay now i can give you ten tomorrow and the rest in a couple of weeks you have my word gil ill even sign a promissory note i thought you were a lawyer theo sort of well then you need to do some more research a person has to be eighteen years old before he can enter into a valid contract including a promissory note sure sure i know that lets just do an oldfashioned handshake deal ten bucks tomorrow and the other eight bucks in two weeks gil extended his dirty and chubby right hand and theo shook it fifteen minutes later he was flying down park street happy to be so mobile again but still wondering if the day could get any worse he was also debating about how much of his bad luck should be reported to his parents the farther he got away from his vandalized locker the less important it seemed theo could live with those losses irritating as they were the slashed tire was another story because it involved a weapon as he approached the law offices of boone amp boone theo suddenly had a frightening thought what if the same person had robbed his locker then slashed his tire as well chapter boone amp boone was a small law firm on a street full of other lawyers accountants and architects all of the buildings along that section of park street had once been homes long before theo was born he carried his bike up the front steps and leaned it against the wall near the door its customary parking place he glanced around just to make sure no one was watching him or his bike inside the front door the reception area was the turf of elsa miller the firms head secretary and sometimes its boss she was a spry hyperactive woman who was old enough to be theos grandmother and she often acted as though she was as always she bounced from her chair behind her desk and assaulted theo the moment she saw him there was a fierce hug a painful yank of the earlobe a tussling of his hair but thankfully no kissing elsa understood that thirteenyearold boys did not want to be kissed by anyone during this attack and theo considered it nothing less she was talking nonstop theo how was your day are you hungry does that shirt match those pants have you finished your homework have you heard the news about pete duffy jumping off a bridge jumping off a bridge theo repeated taking a step back and freeing himself from her embrace well thats just one theory but good gosh there is so much gossip racing around this town right now i was in court this morning when he didnt show theo said proudly you were yes elsa retreated as quickly as she had attacked allowing judge to come forth and say hello judge spent his days easing around the office checking on everyone sleeping in various places and always looking for something to eat he usually waited for theo in one of two placeseither theos chair back in his office or on a small bed at elsas feet supposedly providing protection for the firm but doing nothing of the sort there are pecan brownies in the kitchen elsa said who made them theo asked it was a fair question elsas pecan brownies were somewhat edible if one were starving but the wedges occasionally brought in by dorothy the real estate secretary were not they looked like brick mortar and tasted like mud and not even judge would give them a sniff i made them theo and theyre delicious yours are perfect theo said as he headed down the hall your mother is in court and your father is across town wrapping up a real estate deal elsa said an important part of her job was to keep track of everybody especially mr and mrs boone and this was easy because she was in charge of their schedules but elsa at any given moment could give you the precise whereabouts of dorothy and of vince the paralegal who worked under mrs boone add judge and theo to the list and elsa knew everyones appointments lunch dates coffee dates doctors visits depositions loan closings birthdays vacations anniversaries even funerals she once gave dorothy a sympathy card after her fathers funeralthree years to the day after the old guy was buried according to the boone master plan for daily living theo was expected to arrive at the office each day after school where he checked in with elsa and suffered through her rituals then stopped by his mothers office for a quick hello then walked upstairs with judge close at his heels where he gave his father a rundown of the days activities then after a quick word with dorothy and another one with vince he went to his small office in the back of the building and cranked out his homework which was to be done before dinner of course if he had something else to do like work on a merit badge or watch his classmates play soccer or basketball he was excused from the office ritual he was a kid an only child and his parents strict as they were understood the realities of raising a wellrounded thirteenyearold theo closed the door to his tiny office and pulled his laptop from his backpack he checked the local news for an update on the search for pete duffy there was not a single word about the man jumping off a bridge and this did not surprise theo elsa was known to exaggerate theo found it difficult to concentrate but after two hours the homework was complete for the most part elsa was tidying up her desk and preparing to leave both mr and mrs boone were still busy elsewhere theo checked his bike for further damage and finding none took off with judge in hot pursuit ikes office was on the second floor of an old building owned by a greek couple the first floor was their small deli and the office above it was always engulfed in the smell of lamb roasting in onions to a visitor it was a heavy shot to the nose though not altogether unpleasant but ike after many years there seemed not to notice the aroma ike was at his long cluttered desk sipping a bottle of beer listening to a barely audible bob dylan on the stereo when theo walked in without knocking and fell into a dusty old chair hows my favorite nephew ike asked the same opening question each week theo was ikes only nephew haha great theo replied kinda bummed out about the trial strange indeed ive been listening all day and have heard nothing since his dramatic fall from a prominent and wellrespected lawyer to a disbarred and eccentric old hippie ike had lived on the fringes of the underworld in strattenburg and down there he heard plenty in one poker club he played cards with retired cops and lawyers in another he rubbed elbows with several excriminals like himself regardless of the raging story ike could usually track down a rumor and examine it closely before it made its wider rounds so whats your theory ike asked theo shrugged as if he knew precisely what happened its simple ike pete duffy hopped on a bike sometime after midnight rode it a couple miles down a gravel road hooked up with his accomplice tossed his bike in the trunk of a car or the back of a pickup and away they went theo delivered this quick narrative casually as if he knew exactly how things had happened and when he finished he offered a silent word of thanks to mr mount ikes eyes narrowed as he absorbed this his jaw dropped slightly as he thought about it his forehead wrinkled as he analyzed it where did you hear that he asked hear it nowhere i think its obvious what happened how else can you explain it ike scratched his beard and stared across the table he was often impressed by the maturity and street savvy of his nephew but this easy explanation of the duffy mystery seemed a bit rehearsed theo decided to continue and ill bet they dont find him ill bet pete duffy planned this perfectly and is now somewhere far away probably with plenty of cash and a new set of id papers oh really sure ike he had an eighthour head start and the police have no idea what kind of vehicle hes in so what are they looking for they dont know you want something to drink ike asked as he turned in his swivel chair there was a small refrigerator under the credenza behind his desk and it was usually well stocked no thanks theo said ike pulled out another bottle of beer popped the top and took a sip theo knew that he drank too much which he had learned by listening carefully around the offices at boone amp boone and around the courthouse as well two or three times he had picked up on comments that suggested ike boone struggled with the bottle and theo assumed this was true however he had never witnessed it ike was divorced and far removed from his children and grandchildren he lived alone and was in theos opinion a sad old man do you still have a b in chemistry ike asked come on ike do we have to discuss my grades all the time they get enough attention from my parents and its an a minus not a b how are your parents theyre doing fine i have a note from my mother reminding me to ask you to join us for dinner tonight at robilios how nice of her ike waved his hand over the files stacked haphazardly on his desk then delivered the same tired old line theo heard almost daily from his own parents i have too much work what a surprise thought theo for reasons he would never understand the relationship between his parents and ike was complicated and there was nothing he could do to simplify things it doesnt take long to eat dinner he said tell marcella i said thanks will do theo often confided in ike and told him things he would not tell his own parents he considered mentioning how bizarre his day had become after leaving the courtroom that morning but decided to let it pass he could always tell ike later and seek his advice they talked baseball and football and after half an hour theo and judge said goodbye his bike was right where he had left it with two tires full of air and he dashed away with judge following he found both of his parents back at the office and went through the routine of briefly describing his day marcella boone did not enjoy cooking and was often too busy to even attempt it woods boone was a lousy cook but a fine eater and since theo was a toddler the family enjoyed sampling the wonderful ethnic foods of strattenburg on monday they ate italian at robilios tuesday was soup and a sandwich in a homeless shelter not exactly fine cuisine they bounced back wednesday with chinese carryout from one of three restaurants they liked on thursday mr boone picked up the daily special at a turkish deli friday dinner was always fish at maloufs a rowdy lebanese bistro on saturday they rotated selections with each of the three picking their preference without input from the other two finally on sunday mrs boone would assume command of her kitchen and try a new recipe for a roasted chicken the results were not always spectacular precisely at pm the boone family entered robilios and were led to their favorite table chapter tuesday morning and not just any tuesday but the first tuesday of the month which meant theo and about fifty other boy scouts from troop old bluff council wore their official scouting shirts and colorful neckerchiefs to school the school board had decided that the wearing of a full uniform by a boy scout on school property would not be tolerated there was a dress code that was vague loosely enforced and always causing trouble and a full scout uniform would not violate it however the school board was worried that if it allowed boy scout and girl scout uniforms on campus even for just one specific day each month then all types of uniforms might follow sports uniforms karate uniforms theatrical costumes even religious garments like buddhist robes and muslim burkas the entire issue had become complicated and when a compromise was reached theo and the other scouts felt lucky to get a partial uniform one day a month he showered quickly brushed his teeth which were covered in thick braces and virtually unseen and put on his official khaki shortsleeved shirt adorned with the required council shoulder patch blueandwhite troop numerals patrol emblem and life ranking award when the shirt was perfect and tucked into a pair of jeans he carefully fitted the orange neckerchief around his neck and secured it with the official scout slide a full uniform would have allowed theo to show off his merit badge sash something he was proud of because he had just been awarded his twentysecond and twentythird merit badges for astronomy and golf if all went according to plan theo would attain the rank of eagle the summer before he entered the ninth grade his goal other than becoming an eagle scout was to have at least thirtyfive merit badges all colorfully displayed and sewed on in perfect order by his mother judge who slept under theos bed had been awake for thirty minutes and was tired of waiting he was whimpering and wanted to go downstairs then outside theo adjusted his neckerchief again approved of what he saw in the mirror grabbed his backpack and bounced down the stairs for the moment he had forgotten about the pete duffy disappearance his mother who was not an early morning gogetter was sipping coffee at the kitchen table and reading the newspaper good morning theo arent you cute good morning theo said as he kissed his mother on the forehead he hated the word cute when she used it to describe him he opened the door and judge disappeared outside before his chair was the usuala box of cereal a carton of milk a bowl a spoon and a glass of orange juice no sign of pete duffy his mother said her nose still stuck in the paper theyre not going to find him theo said repeating what he had said numerous times over dinner im not so sure about that its hard to run away from the fbi these days with all the technology they have theo had heard this too over dinner he fixed his bowl of cereal then opened the door again so judge could race in judge did not waste time in the mornings when breakfast was being served theo poured cereal and milk into the dog bowl and judge attacked it without taking her eyes off the newspaper mrs boone said so you have scouting this afternoon huh no mom its halloween no mom all of my other shirts are dirty no mom this is an attempt to confuse you so that youll only think its the first tuesday of the month then maybe youll show up in the wrong courtroom oh all the things he wanted to say but theo being a good scout and respecting authority and also being a good son and not wanting to anger his mother with a smart remark said sure when is the next camping trip she asked slowly turning a page a week from friday at lake marlo troop spent at least one weekend per month in the woods and the camping trips were theos favorite adventures there was at least one clock in every room of the boone home a clear sign of organized people the one in the kitchen gave the time at and theo finished breakfast every day at am when judge slurped his last bit of breakfast theo rinsed both bowls in the sink returned the milk and orange juice to the refrigerator then raced up the stairs where he stomped around his room a few times to make some noise without brushing his teeth for a second time he sprinted back to the kitchen where he pecked his mother on the cheek and said im off to school lunch money she asked always is your homework done its perfect mom ill see you after school be careful teddy and remember to smile im smiling mom love you teddy over his shoulder he said love you mom outside he rubbed judges head and said goodbye racing away he repeated the word teddy a bothersome little family nickname that he despised cute little teddy he mumbled to himself he waved at mr nunnery a neighbor who would spend his entire day sitting on his porch as theo sped through strattenburg he remembered yesterdays incident in buck baloneys backyard and decided to stay on the streets and obey the rules of the road he also thought about the duffy trial and all the excitement he would miss because the defendant had chosen to become a fugitive theo thought about a lot of things as he dashed along the sleepy streets of strattenburg his lockerhe was anxious to see if it had been violated his slashed tirecould it possibly happen again omar cheepe and pacomight they still be watching him homeroom was buzzing with the latest duffy gossip all sixteen boys were brimming with opinions and scenarios they had picked up over the dinner table and heard their parents debating one report had a possible sighting not far away by a rural mail carrier another had pete duffy murdered by drug lords yet another had him safe and untouchable in argentina theo listened to the chatter but did not participate he was just happy he had found his locker secure the bell rang and the boys filed out of the room and drifted to the hallway another dreary day of classes underway troop met in the basement of a building owned by the vfw veterans of foreign wars upstairs the older soldiers gathered each afternoon for pinochle cribbage and beer and on the first and third tuesdays the boy scouts met below for their official meetings the scoutmaster was a former marine who preferred to be called major ludwig or simply major for short and occasionally wiggie behind his back but only when it was absolutely certain that he was far away major ludwig was about sixty years old and ran troop as if he were preparing a bunch of marines for an invasion he was a serious runner claimed to do five hundred situps and pushups before breakfast and was constantly pushing his boys to swim farther row faster hike longer and in general do everything better he monitored their report cards and expected every member of the troop to attain the rank of eagle he tolerated no bad habits and was quick to call parents if a scout was falling behind and though he could bark like a drill sergeant the major knew precisely how to mix discipline and fun he liked to yell but he also liked to laugh the boys adored him occasionally when he wasnt dreaming of becoming a great trial lawyer or a wise judge theo thought about becoming a fulltime scoutmaster just like the major such a future posed problems though because scouting was volunteer work at precisely pm the major called for order and the large room fell silent troop was divided into five patrolspanther rattlesnake ranger warthog and falcon each had a patrol leader assistant leader and seven or eight other members theo led the falcon patrol at rapt attention and under the intense gaze of the major the troop pledged allegiance to the flag then said the scout pledge and motto after the scouts were seated the major led them through a wellorganized agenda that included reports from each patrol rankings and merit badge updates fundraising activities and most importantly plans for the next weekend campout at lake marlo there was a fifteenminute video on first aid for puncture wounds and that was followed by a work session with ropes and knots the major explained that he was less than impressed with the troops overall level of hitching lashing and knotting and he expected better work during the camping trip because he had been practicing for years the major was a whiz with the square knot and clove hitch but what dazzled the boys was his mastery of the more complicated knots such as the timber hitch and overhand bend as always the ninetyminute meeting flew by and at precisely it was adjourned most of the scouts left on bikes and as theo shoved off with the gang he realized there was a problem the rear tire was flat gils wheels was closing as theo approached tired and sweating from the ordeal of pushing his bike at least ten blocks from the vfw well well gil said as he rubbed his hands on a shop rag he kept in a front pocket my favorite customer theo felt like crying not only was he tired but he was overwhelmed with the thought of buying another tire and more importantly frightened that someone was really after him gil spun the rear tire stopped it poked at the incision and said yep probably the same knife that got the front tire yesterday this happen at school no at the vfw while i was in a scout meeting so this person is following you around huh i dont know gil what should i do have you told your parents no one knows but you gil had a wrench and was slowly removing the rear tire from the bikes frame me id start with my parents then id think about filing a report with the police and someone at the school should know about it too ill bet youre not the only kid whos getting his tires cut like this have you seen others in here not in a couple of weeks but this isnt the only bike shop in town of course its the best if you want my unbiased opinion haha gil laughed at his own humor but theo could not crack a smile eighteen dollars he asked same as yesterday gil replied i guess id better talk to my dad good idea woods boone was in his office meeting with another lawyer marcella boone was in her office with a divorce client elsa was on the phone when theo arrived and dorothy and vince were running errands only judge was waiting for theo and the two made their way to his tiny office in the back of the building theo unloaded his backpack and his deskan old card tablewas soon covered with books notepads and his laptop he was daydreaming though and unable to concentrate on homework why would anyone slash his tires and vandalize his locker he had no known enemies at that point in his life unless he considered omar cheepe and paco and he was convinced they had more important things to worry about they were career thugs real pros not exactly the types to do their dirty work around a middle school how could they possibly sneak through the hallways of the school without being noticed there was no way and why would they be interested in stealing a threepack of inhalers and a twins cap he could not imagine them loitering around the bike racks by the front flagpole watching for the right moment to cut his tire or following him to the vfw for a boy scout meeting theo suspected the vandal was another student but who and why theo was lost in these thoughts when literally his world was shattered there was a door that led from his office to the rear parking lot of boone amp boone and the top half of the door was comprised of four panes of glass a large rock suddenly burst through the glass crashing loudly and sending shards of broken glass everywhereonto the bookshelves over his desk across the floor judge jumped and barked loudly theo instinctively threw both arms over his head in case there was another rock on the way he waited for a few seconds trying to catch his breath then bolted to his feet he yanked open the door but saw no one outside judge growling and barking jumped down the steps and raced around the small parking lot but found nothing the rock was the size of a softball and came to rest next to judges bed elsa rushed in and exclaimed theo what in the world then she saw the shattered windowpanes and broken glass are you okay i think so theo said still in shock what happened someone threw a rock theo said as he picked it up they examined it mrs boone appeared and asked whats going on back here then mr boone walked in behind her and asked the same thing for a few minutes they inspected the damage and scratched their heads elsa found a piece of glass in theos hair but there were no wounds ill call the police mr boone said good idea said mrs boone any idea who did this elsa asked no theo replied chapter it was proving to be an eventful afternoon because mrs boone handled a lot of divorces and always on the side of the wife the office was occasionally the scene of some bad family drama just as the dust had settled in theos office and as mr boone was heading toward the conference room to call the police there were loud voices near the front door an angry man and a shrieking woman were having a spat and it quickly led to a confrontation the woman was mrs treen a new boone amp boone divorce client and the man was her husband mr treen they had a house full of kids and a world of problems and mrs boone had been trying to convince them to undergo marriage counseling instead of going the divorce route according to mrs treen her husband had become violent and abusive and impossible to be around he certainly appeared to be violent as he stood by elsas desk and growled at his wife you are not filing for divorce over my dead body he was a thick stout man with a beard and eyes that flashed when he spoke mrs boone elsa and theo entered the reception area and stopped to watch mr boone took a step forward and said lets take a deep breath here and try to be civilized mrs treen eased away and stood close to mrs boone elsa and theo stayed in the background all eyes and ears i cant live with you mrs treen said im tired of getting punched and slapped around im taking the kids and leaving roger and theres nothing you can do about it ive never hit you he replied though no one believed this mr treen had the look of a brawler who might slap just about anyone stop the lying roger she said perhaps we should step into my office mrs boone said calmly hes got a gun mrs treen said and all spines stiffened its in his pocket all eyes went straight to the pockets of mr treens pants and sure enough there appeared to be something dangerous there get in the car karen mr treen said with eyes glowing and jaw muscles clenching no one with any sense would get in the car with this guy no she replied im not taking orders from you anymore ill ask you to leave mr boone said firmly mr treen smiled touched his right pocket and said maybe i dont want to leave then ill call the police mr boone said there was a long pause no one moved finally mrs boone said i have an idea lets step into the conference room just the four of us get some coffee and have a conversation because she negotiated divorce settlements and spent a lot of time in the courtroom mrs boone understood the need for compromise her soft voice and even temper drained some of the tension it was a standoff mr treen was not leaving mrs treen was not leaving with him and no one wanted to provoke the guy with the gun mr treen blinked first and in doing so kept the situation from getting worse he said okay lets talk elsa quickly added ill get the coffee the treens and the boones stepped into the conference room and closed the doors at first theo and elsa were not sure if they should call the police or wait on mr boone theo was worried about his parents being in there with a somewhat agitated and emotional man who was unstable enough to carry a pistol in his pocket what if things took a turn for the worse what if they suddenly heard gunfire popping in the conference room theo wanted to call the police immediately elsa though had a different approach mr treen had agreed to talk peacefully about their problems if the police showed up and arrested him on some weapons charge then he might crack go off the deep end and do something crazier the next time elsa was confident her bosses could defuse the situation and perhaps make progress in settling some of the treens issues elsa called a glass repairman who advertised hour service minutes passed with no gunfire from the conference room nor were there loud angry voices theo settled down somewhat though given the events of the day he was still unnerved he and elsa decided to take photos of the office and show the police later they swept up the glass and saved the rock for evidence the repairman arrived after dark and began replacing the broken panes usually on tuesday nights the boones left their offices and walked a few blocks to the highland street shelter where they served food to the homeless and helped in other ways mrs boone along with three other female attorneys in strattenburg had started a small free legal clinic for abused women several of whom were homeless and stayed at the shelter mr boone saw clients there too typically folks who had been wrongfully evicted from their homes and apartments and people who had been denied benefits theos job was to help the homeless children with their studies the meeting with the treens gave every indication of lasting forever so theo decided to go to the shelter alone his parents would catch up later if for no other reason than to have dinner after they served the homeless they always had a quick bowl of soup or a sandwich before dispensing legal advice theo was starving and tired of the office he said goodbye to elsa and rode his bike to the shelter he was too late for dinner but found leftovers in the kitchen his current project was teaching math to the koback boys russ was eight and ben was seven and they had been living in the shelter with their mother for the past two months mrs boone was handling the legal matters for mrs koback and though theo did not know the details he did know the little family was reeling from some type of tragedy mr koback had been killed in a faraway place and in a manner that was not being discussed after he died the family lost everything and had lived in an old truck for several weeks before finding beds in the shelter for theos eagle scout project he was planning to organize a program in which teenage volunteers who were old enough to drive would adopt a homeless kid sort of like big brothersbig sisters he was also thinking about building another shelter one that would house homeless people who were still living in tents and under bridges however his father had warned him that such a project would cost millions as usual the koback boys were subdued even shy their young lives had been filled with turmoil and misery mrs boone said they were damaged and needed counseling theo managed to coax a few smiles as they plowed through the math workbooks their mother sat nearby watching and as theo suspected trying to learn the math too theo knew she could not read well each visit to the shelter reminded theo how fortunate he was only half a mile from his warm secure environment there were people like the kobacks sleeping on cots in a shelter and eating food donated by churches and charities theos future was fairly predictable if all went according to plan he would finish high school go to college he had not yet decided where then on to law school to become a lawyer the koback boys on the other hand had no idea where they would be living in a year highland street allowed its friends to stay for twelve months only during which time they were expected to find a job and a more permanent place to live so like everyone else the kobacks were just passing through at pm all volunteers checked out of the shelter theo said goodbye to ben russ and their mother and left the basement there was no sign of his parents so he decided to bike back to the office to get his backpack and his dog and hopefully find everyone still alive there was almost no traffic at that hour and theo darted through the streets with little regard for the rules of the road he jumped curbs dashed along sidewalks ran stop signs and along the way reminded himself of how nice it was to have two fully inflated tires at the corner of main and farley a red light had two cars waiting in front of theo so he swerved onto the sidewalk as he was executing a rather risky sliding turn onto main he slid into another bike one being ridden by a uniformed policemanofficer stu peckinpaw a lean grayhaired veteran whod been patrolling downtown strattenburg for decades every kid in town knew him and tried to avoid him theo bounced up unhurt and brushed the dirt off his legs sorry about that he said half expecting to be arrested and hauled away to the police station officer peckinpaw leaned his bike against a signpost and removed his helmet whats your name kid he demanded as if theo might be a serial killer theo boone the two had met several times over the years at least in passing this though was theos first real runin with officer stu that names familiar he said and gave theo the opening he always wanted yes sir my dad is woods boone and my mother is marcella boone the law firm of boone amp boone rings a bell so if both parents are lawyers then you should know the law right i guess city code prohibits bikes on sidewalks at all hours of the day and night no exceptions dont you know this yes sir i do peckinpaw glared at theo as if he might whip out the old handcuffs and slap both wrists together are you okay yes sir then get home and stay off the sidewalks yes sir thanks officer stu had the reputation of having a loud bark but no bite and he rarely wrote tickets to kids on bikes he liked to yell and threaten but preferred to avoid the paperwork theo sped away greatly relieved to be out of trouble but also curious about what else might happen on this eventful day his cell phone beeped and he stopped to answer it it was his mother telling him to head home the meeting with the treens was finally over and it had been a success his parents were eating a frozen pizza when he walked into the kitchen they were exhausted they asked about the shelter but were almost too tired to talk theo was curious about the treens and what happened after he left but the old attorneyclient shield was quickly thrown up and the conversation was cut off his parents never talked about their clients never a clients business and the conversation between lawyers and their clients were strictly offlimits mrs boone did say an agreement had been reached and the treens would seek counseling theo had a lot of things to discuss two punctured tires a vandalized school locker now a rock through his office window someone was tormenting him and he needed to talk but it would be a long conversation and all the boones including judge were ready for bed his father a lawyer who usually avoided conflict seemed especially fatigued by the threehour ordeal with the treens mrs boone was complaining of a headache theo was about to press on anyway because he needed help and advice but just as he was about to say something the phone rang it was mrs treen upset again theo and judge went upstairs to bed chapter the following day wednesday theo raced to school as always though he did avoid downtown and he did stay off the sidewalks he did not have the chance to chat with his parents over breakfast because his father as always left for early gossip with his coffee group and his mother was walking out the door late for a meeting theo and judge ate alone and in silence according to the headlines there was no sign of pete duffy thieves had broken into a computer store on main street two students at stratten college had been arrested for cyber stalking not a single word about some unknown thug vandalizing the law office of theo boone since the police had yet to be notified theo was thankful for wednesday it would certainly be better than tuesday during second period geometry theos wednesday suddenly became much worse than his tuesday over the loudspeaker the shrieking voice of the school secretary miss gloria demanded miss garman is theo boone present at that moment theo was drifting away and daydreaming about the upcoming camping trip to lake marlo at the sound of his name he bolted upright and felt as though hed been slapped he is miss garman replied send him to the office please theo jumped to his feet and left the room there were two detectives in dark suits sitting in the office of the principal mrs gladwell who looked like she had seen a ghost when theo walked in she gushed theo these two gentlemen are with the police department and they would like to talk to you neither detective stood neither smiled the short one was an older man a detective vorman and theo had seen him around the courthouse in fact theo had watched him testify in a trial a couple of months earlier the other detective hamilton theo had never seen before he said theo wed like to ask you a few questions since there were no empty chairs theo leaned with his back against the wall and wondered why they were there his first thought was the broken window but he quickly dismissed it such a minor act of vandalism would not require the involvement of two detectives theo managed to say okay hamilton went on did you happen to be downtown last night theo did not like his tone nor his frown combined they gave the strong impression that they suspected him of doing something wrong theo looked at mrs gladwell who was nervously tapping her fingers on her desk he looked at detective vorman who was writing something on his pocket notepad theo said i was at the highland street shelter last night were you on main street for any reason last night hamilton asked why are you asking me these questions theo asked and this really irritated both detectives ill handle the questions theo you do the answers hamilton sneered like a bad tv actor just answer the questions vorman chimed in a real bully no i was not downtown theo said slowly i went to the shelter then i rode my bike home did you bump into officer stu peckinpaw hamilton asked yes i accidentally ran into him but everything was okay and where did this take place on main street main and farley so you were downtown last night werent you theo i was on my bike the detectives gave each other a smug look mrs gladwell tapped her fingers even faster hamilton said theres a computer store on main street two blocks down from farley its called big macs systems you know the place theo shook his head no however he remembered the name from his quick review of the mornings local headlines the store had been broken into the night before vorman helped out they sell pcs laptops printers software the usual but also the latest tablets smartpads ebook readers even cell phones youve never been to the store theo no sir do you have a laptop yes sir jupiter air thirteen inch got it for christmas where is it now in my backpack back in the classroom do you ever keep it in your locker hamilton asked occasionally why again theo well handle the questions okay but i get the feeling you think ive done something wrong and if thats the case then i want to call a lawyer both detectives found this amusing a thirteenyearold kid asking for a lawyer they dealt with thugs and criminals all day long and every one of them demanded a lawyer this kid must watch too much television wed like to see your locker hamilton said theo knew it was unwise to agree to any type of search car home pockets office even lockernever agree to a search if the police believed there was evidence of a crime then they could go to a judge and get a warrant or written permission and conduct a search however theo knew he had done nothing wrong and like all innocent people wanted to prove this to the police he also knew the school could open his locker without his approval sure he said somewhat reluctantly and both detectives as well as mrs gladwell could not help but notice that theo hesitated before agreeing to a search the four left the office and headed down the empty hallway the bell would ring in less than fifteen minutes and there would be plenty of students to witness theo in the presence of two darksuited strangers within seconds the entire school would know that he was being investigated for something when they stopped in front of his locker theo glanced around the hall was empty when did you last open your locker hamilton asked when i got to school this morning around eight thirty so about two hours ago yes sir and did you notice anything unusual at that time no sir theo wanted to mention the fact that a stranger had been in his locker on monday but he was suddenly in a hurry he was terrified that someone might see him with two cops and the principal you can open it now hamilton said theo punched in the code judgeand pulled open the door nothing appeared to be missing but something had certainly been added on the left side leaning against some textbooks were three slender objects theo had never seen before dont touch anything hamilton said as he leaned down and in and breathed on theos neck vorman and mrs gladwell huddled close and for a few seconds no one moved or said a word finally hamilton asked see anything unusual theo with a dry mouth theo managed to say yes sir those are not mine the slender objects were linx tablets the hottest and lightest personal computers dominating the marketplace with stunning graphics unlimited memory a million applications and a price tag of the was cheaper yet far more sophisticated than its current competition detective vorman wearing surgical gloves and treating the s like rare diamonds placed them side by side on mrs gladwells desk big mac had been called and was on his way to identify his stolen property please call my mother theo said to mrs gladwell or my father it doesnt matter not so fast hamilton said we have some more questions im not answering any more questions theo said i want my parents here if theo says he didnt steal these tablets then i believe him mrs gladwell said thank you so much hamilton said how did you know they were there theo asked and once again young theo please well handle the questions hamilton said his tone and attitude had been lousy to start with now with the evidence in hand and the crime apparently solved he was becoming unbearable can i call his parents mrs gladwell asked sure you can theo said they dont run this school they cant tell you what to do knock it off kid vorman said i beg your pardon mrs gladwell said dont talk to my student in such a manner theo is no criminal i believe whatever he says theo walked to a spot beside mrs gladwell who was seated at her desk and removed his cell phone using speed dial he called the offices of boone amp boone elsa answered and theo staring straight into the angry eyes of detective hamilton said hey elsa its me theo i need to talk to mom something wrong theo no just let me talk to mom shes in court theo shell be tied up all morning okay then let me talk to dad hes not here hes in wilkesburg closing a land deal whats going on theo theo did not have the time to chat with elsa and she could not help him anyway the detectives were fuming and theo figured he was almost out of time he canceled the call to elsa punched another number for speed dial and said ike its me theo ike replied good morning theo why are you calling me at ten thirty theo said ike im at school and there are two detectives here accusing me of stealing computers that someone put in my locker can you get down here thats enough kid hamilton growled ike did not respond but his office line went dead theo slapped his phone shut and returned it to his pocket technically this was a violation of school rules only eighth graders were allowed to have phones on campus and a few of them did their use was strictly controlled all cell phones had to be turned off during classes and could be used only during recess and lunch under the circumstances though theo doubted if mrs gladwell would be upset with him she was not we havent accused you of anything hamilton said were just doing our investigation and when we find stolen goods in someones possession then we have to ask questions doesnt that make sense theo didnt steal the computers okay mrs gladwell said firmly vorman decided to play the nice cop and offered a sappy smile so theo if you didnt place these computers in your locker then someone else obviously did who else has the entry code to your locker safe question theo replied no one that i know of but someone was in my locker monday they stole a twins baseball cap and some other items i didnt report it at that time but i was planning to mrs gladwell turned and looked at theo you should have told us theo i know i know im sorry i was going to discuss it with my parents first then report it to you but i never got the time and the school has a list of all entry codes vorman asked yes but its protected in a secure file in our main computer mrs gladwell said has anyone ever hacked into it not to my knowledge has the school had a problem with people breaking into lockers no she replied occasionally a student will fail to properly close a locker and the door will be left slightly open this might lead to a missing item or two but i cannot recall a situation where a student obtained an entry code and went into another students locker how about you theo vorman asked do you know of anyone who got somebody elses code and broke into their locker no sir hamilton glanced at his notes then looked at theo and said during the breakin last night at big macs systems the thief or thieves took ten of these tablets six fifteeninch laptops and about a dozen cell phones you have any idea where this stuff is now theo gritted his teeth and said i dont know anything about the breakin last night because i wasnt there and i dont know how these tablets got into my locker i said i wanted to talk to a lawyer and im not answering any more questions until my lawyer is present things will go smoother if you cooperate with us theo hamilton said i am cooperating i allowed you to search my locker and im telling the truth chapter big mac was a small man only slightly taller than theo and when he entered mrs gladwells office he glared at the suspect as if he wanted to shoot him theo stood his ground behind the principals chair and watched as the detectives offered big mac a pair of surgical gloves why dont you two wait outside hamilton said and theo and mrs gladwell stepped outside into the reception area when the door was shut she said quietly i dont know why they have to be so rude theyre just doing their job theo said do you want to call your parents again maybe later theyre not in the office and theyre busy the bell rang loudly and theo looked for a place to hide students would be changing classes and it was not unusual for several of them to rush into the front office for urgent business someone might see him sitting there looking guilty detained for some reason he found a magazine hid his face behind it and cowered near the watercooler as the noise from the halls rose through the school inside mrs gladwells office big mac removed a small plate on the back of each tablet and checked the registration numbers using gloves to avoid smudging any possible fingerprints he compared the number to his inventory list yep these came from my store he said looks like you got your man well see hamilton said what do you mean by that you found these in that kids locker right looks to me like you got him nailed caught redhanded i want to press charges right now lets put the squeeze on him so we can find all the other stuff he stole well handle the investigation mac i think i saw that kid in my store last week vorman looked at hamilton are you sure about this mac i cant prove it you know a lot of kids come and go but that one looks familiar he told us hes never been in your store what do you expect him to say we know hes a thief dont we if hell break in and steal then im sure hell lie too i want that kid busted okay i lose a ton of money every year to shoplifters and thieves and i prosecute everyone i catch got it mac well wrap up the investigation and stop by the store when were finished thanks for your cooperation no problem just find the rest of my stuff okay well do that big mac slammed the door to mrs gladwells office and as he stomped past miss glorias desk he saw theo hiding near the watercooler hey you kid wheres the rest of the stuff you stole from my store he demanded at that moment there was a sixthgrade teacher chatting quietly with mrs gladwell not far away and there was a seventhgrade student with a fever lying on a small sofa everyone looked at big mac then at theo who couldnt speak for a second or two i want my stuff okay big mac said even louder and took a step toward theo i dont have it theo managed to say if you dont mind mrs gladwell said to big mac the door opened and detective vorman stepped out he pointed a finger at big mac and said thats enough well handle things here you can go now big mac left without another word the bell was ringing to start third period the sixthgrade teacher was staring at theo as if he were a murderer mark somebody the student with the fever was sitting up staring at theo miss glorias eyebrows were arched and her forehead was creased with thick wrinkles a very guilty look theo wanted to shout that he was not a thief had not stolen anything belonging to big mac in fact had never stolen anything in his life but for a few long seconds he just stood there in disbelief he had never before been accused of a crime detective vorman said could you please come in theo followed mrs gladwell back into her office where she sat in her large swivel chair behind her desk theo stood beside her the two of them versus the two detectives vorman said these were identified by the owner registration numbers match up all nice and neat now that we have recovered some of the stolen property we need to thoroughly examine mr boones locker check it carefully for fingerprints inventory its contents that sort of thing hamilton chimed in and well need to talk to the kids who have lockers near this one maybe they saw something or someone suspicious you know just routine stuff the sooner we can do this the better kids have short memories you know mrs gladwell knew that thirteenyearolds have far better memories than adults but she would not argue she said okay but im certain you can wait until after three thirty this afternoon when classes are over why disrupt school during the day theo was horrified at the idea of the two detectives lining up his friends for questioning word would soon spread that theo was under suspicion that the cops were hot on his trail theo needed help mrs gladwell was doing her best to protect him but theo needed more firepower the door burst open and ike stormed in whats going on here he demanded theo are you okay not really theo said vorman stood and said im detective vorman strattenburg pd and this is my partner detective hamilton who may i ask are you the introductions were stiff none of the three men made any effort to shake hands ike boone formerly of boone amp boone attorneys and theo is my nephew and im mrs gladwell the principal welcome to my office ike nodded slightly and said a pleasure i think weve met before now whats going on are you a lawyer vorman asked ike replied former lawyer right now im theos uncle adviser consultant guardian and anything else i need to be if you want lawyers just give me an hour or so and ill have them lined up ike was wearing his usual attire faded jeans sandals with no socks an ancient red stripe beer tshirt under a ragged brownplaid sports coat and his long gray hair was pulled back into a tight ponytail he was highly agitated and looking for a fight and theo realized at that moment that he could have no better protector detective hamilton read the situation perfectly and took over in a calm voice he said fine mr boone a computer store on main street was broken into last night this morning we received an anonymous tip that some of the loot could be found in the locker of one theodore boone here at the school theo consented to a search of his locker and we found these three linx tablets valued at about four hundred dollars each the owner of the store has checked the serial numbers and identified his goods perfect ike said loudly then we know exactly who robbed the store the punk who gave you the anonymous tip why arent you chasing him down instead of harassing theo no harassment mr boone hamilton said we are merely conducting an investigation part of which is an effort to track down the anonymous caller were trying to cover everything right now okay ike took a breath and looked at his nephew are you okay theo i guess he replied but he was not two slashed bike tires a rock through his window with broken glass all over him and his dog the first invasion into his locker and the stolen cap and now this someone was tormenting him and doing a fine job of it mrs gladwell said well if you want my opinion and we are in my office so ill just go ahead and give it anyway the police have every right to pursue an investigation as long as it does not disrupt my school its also my opinion that theodore boone didnt steal anything the three men nodded theo agreed completely but didnt move a muscle whats next ike snarled at the detectives detective hamilton replied well we would like theo to come down to the police station so we can take a formal statement from him just a routine matter then wed like to talk to some of the other students theo had watched enough television to know that a trip downtown usually meant handcuffs and a ride in the back of the patrol car and for a split second he was amused by the idea he had never been handcuffed before nor had he seen the backseat of a police car and the entire adventure would be fun to talk about later long after he was cleared but any amusement soon faded when he realized that the gossip would race through the school and the town and soon the whole world would know that theo was the prime suspect schools out at three thirty right ike asked mrs gladwell thats correct good ill have theo at the police station at four oclock this afternoon if that suits you im sure his parents will be with him the detectives exchanged glances and it was obvious neither wanted to argue with ike about this when can we have a chat with the other students vorman asked well i suppose at three thirty mrs gladwell said whose lockers are next to yours theo hamilton asked woody chase joey ricardo most of the guys in my homeroom theo replied darren is directly below me vorman looked at hamilton and said well need to check with the lab and see if they can dust the area for fingerprints right hamilton replied and well need to print you too theo we can do it this afternoon when you come in you want my fingerprints theo asked of course im not sure about that ike said ill discuss it with his parents i dont care theo said take them you wont find any of my prints on those tablets because ive never touched them and if you want to you can give me a lie detector test fine i have nothing to hide well see vorman said the detectives were suddenly in a hurry to leave hamilton flipped his notepad shut and stuck it in a coat pocket thank you for your time mrs gladwell he said standing and thanks theo for your cooperation mr boone its been a real pleasure after they left theo sat down in the chair that hamilton had used theres something else we need to talk about he said and ike fell into the other chair as mrs gladwell listened intently theo described his two slashed tires one of which happened on school property when theo recounted the story of the rock crashing into his office the day before ike said someones after you no kidding theo said chapter not surprisingly the situation changed dramatically when theos mother got involved theo called her during lunch and fifteen minutes later she was at the school in mrs gladwells office demanding answers she was furious that theo had been interrogated by the police without his parents being present but mrs gladwell assured her that theo handled himself well he was cautious with his answers and gave the officers as little information as possible the search of his locker was unavoidable because the school had the right to open it for any good reason school policy required mrs gladwell and all other administrators to fully cooperate with law enforcement officials in all situations mrs boone initially wanted to take theo from school to her office and then to the police station mrs gladwell though thought it wiser to wait until classes were over theo had already been yanked out of class once that wednesday and to do so again would only create even more suspicion just keep things as normal as possible she advised then she went on to discuss the rest of theos rather exciting week theo had not yet told his parents about his slashed tires and the first locker breakin and his mother was shocked to learn of these episodes she was more than a bit irritated that theo had kept it all quiet as she was leaving she asked mrs gladwell to give theo strict instructions to go straight to the office after school at detective hamilton was waiting in mr mounts classroom he had called mr mount and asked him to invite darren woody chase joey and ricardo to hang around after school for a brief meeting with mr mount present the detective spoke with each boy separately and briefly darren was first and after establishing the exact location of his locker in an enlarged photo the detective asked what time did you first go to your locker this morning darren shrugged and said when i got to school just before homeroom and homeroom begins when eight forty why did you go to your locker to get some books and drop off some books same as always did you see theo boone at the locker this morning darren thought for a second shrugged again and said i dont think so i think theo was already in homeroom who do you remember seeing at your locker this morning another pause as he pondered the question ricardo maybe woody just some of the guys i really didnt stop and think about who i was seeing at the time were usually in a hurry to get to homeroom did you see anyone near the lockers who didnt belong there hamilton asked slowly like who like anybody who shouldnt have been hanging around your lockers did somebody do something wrong thats what were trying to find out darren did you see a stranger around the lockers at any time before ten oclock this morning a stranger like an adult an adult another student anyone who would not normally be hanging around the locker area on this end of the hallway another longer pause then he slowly shook his head no sir i didnt see anyone like that nothing out of the ordinary no sir similar conversations were had with the other boys only chase remembered bumping into theo that morning at the lockers and no chase did not see theo remove books or other items from his backpack detective hamilton was careful not to reveal what had been found in theos locker and he was careful not to give the impression that their friend was in hot water at pm wednesday afternoon theo and his parents and ike too walked into the police station on main street two blocks east of the courthouse they were met by detective vorman who led them down a flight of stairs to a small room in the cramped basement after offering them something to drinkall declinedvorman got down to business he and mrs boone had already spoken twice by phone that afternoon so there would be no surprises theo would voluntarily give a statement with plenty of legal advice nearby and vorman would record it by video camera and audiotape theo had assured his parents that he had nothing to hide and knew nothing about the breakin or the stolen goods he began with monday and the first episode with his locker he covered the two slashed tires and said that gil at gils wheels could confirm those details he explained again that he had not told his parents because he simply had not had the time or opportunity he described the large rock crashing into his office the day before with vorman serving up easy questions theo finally got around to the stolen tablets in his locker he had gone to his locker just a few minutes before homeroom same as always the hall was crowded noisy just like the day before and the day before that he opened the locker with his code and saw nothing out of the ordinary he was paying close attention to the contents of his locker because of what happened on monday he was certain the linx tablets were not in his locker at that time he did not see anyone unusual hanging aroundno strange adults no students from other classes grades or classrooms he was not aware of any other person with knowledge of his code he did not know of similar incidents involving unauthorized entry into a locker at the school theo spoke slowly and carefully and repeated his statements when asked to do so to his left was his mother to his right his father ike was at the end of the table still irritated that the police would dare suspect his nephew detective hamilton sat directly across from theo and patiently walked him through the process a video camera on a tripod stood next to hamilton and recorded it all theo gave an accurate and detailed summary of his brief runin with officer stu peckinpaw tuesday night and explained the circumstances surrounding it he was certain that he had never been inside big macs systems he suggested they check the stores sales records to prove he had never bought anything there when he finished the camera and recorder were turned off and everyone relaxed detective hamilton explained that they would postpone the fingerprinting because there was not a single print taken from any of the three tablets there was nothing to compare with theos prints someone was very careful hamilton said looking at theo wiped everything off probably used gloves theo was unable to tell if hamilton still suspected him like all good detectives he revealed little and acted as though anyone could be guilty what about the anonymous caller ike asked any luck tracing his call sort of hamilton answered abruptly and it was obvious he did not want to be pressed by ike it came from a pay phone near the hospital so it will be difficult to determine who made the call what time was it received asked woods boone nine twenty hamilton replied mr boone continued so if the tablets were not in theos locker at eight forty when he stopped by then the thief opened his locker at some point during the first period after he dropped off the tablets he either left the school and raced to a pay phone near the hospital and made the call or he notified someone on the outside that the mission was accomplished and the police could then be notified probably the latter so you have more than one member of some little gang at work here detective hamilton stared at woods boone who stared right back perhaps you should become a detective hamilton said perhaps you should see the obvious here this was a plant a setup dont know who or why but its pretty clear that theo had nothing to do with it right now hes a victim not a suspect i havent called him a suspect mr boone hamilton said coolly the crime is less than twentyfour hours old give us a break here weve just begun the investigation whats next as far as theo is concerned asked mrs boone hes free to go were not going to arrest him in the middle of the night if we need to have another chat ill give you a call hamilton was getting a bit testy probably because he was getting grilled by a bunch of lawyers our job is to track down all leads and try to determine who committed this crime we dont know if theo is telling the truth he certainly sounds believable but im a detective and ive talked to a lot of criminals who claimed to be innocent maybe he is maybe hes not you folks have no doubts but thats not the way detectives go about their work one day soon we hope well know a lot more and then id like to be able to say theo youre telling the truth until that happens though im not believing anybody you dont believe me theo asked wounded look theo i dont know if youre lying and i dont know if youre telling the truth its too early for me as the detective handling the case to make that decision we dont have much evidence in this case so far but what we do have points to you do you understand this theo nodded slightly but it was obvious he wasnt pleased with it hamilton looked at his watch closed a file and said now i thank you folks for stopping by and as i said well be in touch the boones walked out of the police building in a small group no one was smiling theo tried to study in his office at boone amp boone but he was too distracted a new window had been installed and the shattered glass had been removed there was no sign of the damage from yesterday afternoon but theo could still hear the crash of the breaking glass the sharp thud of the rock hitting the bookshelf the splattering of debris the shriek of panic from judge followed quickly by a furious round of barking in the frantic seconds afterward theo could almost hear something else he thought he had heard it in a dream he thought he had heard it once that morning at school during first period before the police showed up and ruined his day he could almost close his eyes place himself at his desk when the rock came crashing through and then in the seconds that followed he could almost hear footsteps someone was running away the person who threw the rock was making his escape from close by theo wished a dozen times he had been able to catch a glimpse of the person running away who was this mysterious person was it an adult another student male or female a lone gunman or a member of a gang even judge seemed a bit jumpy the first return visit to the scene of the crime brings back bad memories and theo found it impossible to do his homework he finally locked the door took a peek through the new window saw no one and left the building on his bike with judge in hot pursuit chapter the photo was sent from an anonymous gashmail account and initially sent to the inboxes of a dozen or so students at strattenburg middle school from there it rapidly picked up steam and by wednesday evening hundreds if not thousands of people in town had seen it and knew what it was all about it was taken by a person who was determined to remain nameless and faceless and evidently he or she was hiding somewhere across the street when theo his parents and ike left the police station the photo clearly showed all four frowning and worried and just behind and above them on the front of the building in bold letters were the words s tr a ttenburg p olice s t a tion with the photo was a description theo boone age thirteen of mallard lane leaves the strattenburg police station with his parents after being arrested for the tuesday night breakin and burglary of the wellknown downtown computer store big macs systems sources say the police found stolen merchandise wednesday morning in boones locker at the middle school he is expected to appear in juvenile court next week as always on wednesday evenings the boones were having chinese takeout they were in the den dining on folding tv trays while watching television judge who considered himself at least half human was sitting next to theo getting an occasional bite of sweetandsour shrimp his favorite there was almost no conversation over dinner theo was burdened by recent events which seemed to be snowballing his parents were preoccupied with thoughts of protecting their son mrs boone hardly nibbled at her chicken chow mein mr boone chewed with a vengeance as if he were off in court somewhere slugging it out with the bad guys and proving that theo had done nothing wrong theos cell phone vibrateda text message was arriving he glanced at it april finnemore his close friend said tb check email now urgent interrupting dinner was frowned on by his parents so theo between bites texted back what is it april replied terrible urgent go now theo replied ok he took a few more bites chewed and swallowed quickly then announced im stuffed he stood with his plate and glass and headed for the kitchen that was fast his mother said his father was in another world theo rinsed his plate and went straight for his backpack on the kitchen counter a few seconds later he was online then he opened his mailbox he clicked on urgent message from gashmail and saw the photo bright clear no doubt about who was leaving the police station his first reaction when reading the description was disbelief his jaw dropped his mouth fell open wide and for several seconds he stared at the image of himself leaving the police station the shock was quickly replaced by anger anger at the lies the fiction he had not been arrested he was not due in court then the questionswho took the photo where had they been hiding why would anyone tell such outright lies how many people have seen this guys theo yelled his parents crowded behind him and gawked at the monitor sitting on the kitchen counter a photo taken secretly by some punk and then broadcast to the world with a bunch of lies to describe it as lawyers their first reaction waswhat could be done legally to stop it to fix it to bring the guilty party to justice im assuming this is everywhere mrs boone said probably so theo replied what is gashmail mr boone asked its kind of a shady server you use when you dont want to get caught a lot of unknown emails start there and its really hard to track them down so we cant track this anything is possible with the internet but it would be complicated and expensive the internet mr boone said in disgust and walked to the window above the sink and stared into the darkness of the backyard theo sat down at the table and rubbed his temples i guess my life is ruined he said and for a moment was near tears this can be explained theo his father said your friends will know the truth what strangers think doesnt matter thats easy for you to say dad you dont have to face all those kids at school tomorrow and you dont know how fast rumors fly on the internet half the town is looking at the photo right now and deciding that im guilty theos mother sat next to him and patted his arm youre not guilty of anything theo and the truth will come out im not so sure about that mom you saw detective hamilton today he thinks im guilty what if they dont find the real thieves what if they finish their investigation with nothing but me just me and those three stolen tablets in my locker at some point they have to charge somebody with the crime and it could easily be me i saw the owner of the store today they call him big mac and believe me hes convinced im guilty and hes out for blood hell see this photo the police will see it too it makes it easier to believe im guilty there was a long heavy pause as theos words settled in the kitchen was reality gradually seeping in was it possible that theo could actually be charged with the crime and once the wheels of justice began moving could the boones do anything to prevent a terrible outcome each tablet had a value of approximately four hundred dollars for a total of twelve hundred dollars when the combined value of stolen goods was in excess of five hundred dollars then the crime was deemed a felony a more serious crime than a misdemeanor theo knew the law hed been pondering it for hours now he had even doublechecked the codes and statutes at the office when he was supposed to be doing his homework if he were eighteen or older he would be staring at a felony charge however because he was only thirteen the case would be handled in juvenile court where the rules were different things were more private there the files were not made public nor were the hearings there were no juries all matters were decided by a juvenile court judge jail sentences were rare and seldom for long periods of time if this train wreck continued and theo somehow got convicted he could possibly be sentenced to a few months in a detention center for kids jail theodore boone sentenced to serve time outrageous crazy an overreaction all of the above but theos hyperactive mind was out of control his mother was speaking to him theo the first thing you do is fight back attack when youre right you never back down post a message on your page and tell the truth email all your friends and tell them this photo and its caption are misleading get april chase and woody and those you trust the most to flood the internet with the truth spread the word that we your family are considering legal action we are theo asked of course we are we are considering it it might not work but we are at least considering it moms right theo mr boone said the least you can do at this point is put up a fight theo liked it he had been paralyzed for the past ten minutes and now it was time for action an hour later the boones were still at the kitchen table all three hammering away at their laptops as they tried to chase the rumors while containing them at the same time it was a losing battle the photo and its caption were too juicy to ignore and theo was proving to be a good target the only child of two wellknown lawyers arrested for breaking and entering and burglary caught redhanded with the stolen goods in his school locker like every false rumor it gained credibility while being repeated and before long it was practically a fact mr boone closed his laptop and began taking notes on his standard yellow pad at any given moment in theos young life he could walk through the house and lay eyes on at least five yellow legal pads lets do some detective work mr boone said mrs boone removed her reading glasses and closed her laptop too she took a sip of herbal tea and said okay sherlock holmes lets go first who could break into your locker without being seen mr boone asked i cant imagine a stranger an adult entering the school going straight to the locker somehow knowing the code and breaking in agreed said mrs boone theo do you ever see teachers or coaches or janitors or any other adult opening the lockers never you never see them around the lockers the teachers hang out in the faculty lounge the janitors have a locker room in the basement but its offlimits for students the coaches use the locker rooms at the gym so an adult would be noticed theo thought for a moment then said if we knew the adult and she was opening one of our lockers then sure we would make a note of it that would be unusual if it were a stranger we would probably say something to the person i dont know for sure because its never happened but this is between classes when the halls are busy right asked mr boone yes what about while youre in class and the halls are empty theo thought some more the halls are rarely empty during class theres usually someone going somewherea student with a hall pass a janitor a teachers assistant what about security cameras in the halls mr boone asked they took them down a few weeks ago to install a new system mrs boone said sounds to me like it would be too risky for an adult to open a students locker i agree theo said but every crime has some risk right sure but isnt the risk much greater for someone who does not normally use a locker yes mr boone said with certainty and even riskier for someone from outside the school i say we eliminate that person can we agree that this is an inside job someone from inside the school theo shrugged but did not disagree nor did his mother mr boone continued someone who knows how to open the locker someone who could steal the code and someone with easy access to the bike racks where it takes about two seconds to poke a hole in a tire someone who knows theos bike knows where he parks it someone who knows his schedule and movements someone who knows theo well and can watch him without getting caught another student theo asked exactly mrs boone was skeptical i find it hard to believe that a thirteenyearold could break into the computer store avoid the security cameras and make a clean getaway thats more believable than a janitor or a teachers assistant mr boone replied there was a long pause as the three detectives took a deep breath and considered this theo spoke first he had a partner right remember the anonymous call from the pay phone near the hospital plus it would take at least two people to haul away all the stolen goods from the computer store exactly mr boone said again and look at the technical knowhow involved here someone hacked into the schools file and got the code someone was clever enough to snap a photo of us this afternoon as we left the police station and knew how to use this gashmail to distribute it without getting caught sounds like a kid to me i guess anyone could throw a rock through a window mrs boone observed yes but it does seem more of a juvenile act doesnt it all three agreed theo said and i guess most kids in the school at least most of the boys know when and where the boy scouts meet it wouldnt be difficult to sneak around the vfw and find my bike during the meeting the evidence was becoming overwhelming how many students are in the middle school theo mrs boone asked five sections in grades five through eight thats about eighty for each grade times four so somewhere around three hundred and twenty lets eliminate the girls mr boone said i cant see a girl slashing tires or throwing rocks through windows i dont know dad we have some pretty rough girls in our school humor me for now theo we can talk about the girls later okay now were down to a hundred and sixty boys theo said where do we start the trail suddenly seemed a bit cooler mr and mrs boone knew theo was a popular kid who did not bully or fight or start trouble mr boone said we know your friends theo but thats only a handful we dont know the majority of the students at school why dont you make a list of possible suspects kids youve had disagreements with kids who may carry a grudge for something that happened recently or a year ago what about the debate team mrs boone asked youve never lost a debate maybe someone on the losing side got their feelings hurt maybe one of your fellow scouts is jealous added mr boone theo was nodding along his mind racing and trying to imagine possible enemies he said well im sure there are kids who dont like me but why this it seems like theyre going overboard to settle a grudge a grudge i know nothing about indeed it does said mrs boone think about it theo make a list of your top suspects and well discuss them over dinner tomorrow night ill try theo said chapter thursday morning theo was wide awake when his alarm rang at there was a knot in his stomach and he was certain he was too sick to go to school he stared at the ceiling and waited for his illness to grow worse to hopefully become a fullblown bout of nausea that would make him heave and vomit his head hurt too and he was convinced a migraine was on its way though he had never had one minutes passed unfortunately his condition did not deteriorate how could he walk into school and face all the suspicion how could he survive the jokes and snide comments and teasing if there had ever been a perfect day to skip school play hooky call in sick whatever then it was today judge moved first he popped up from under the bed and was ready to go theo envied him his day would be spent at the office sleeping next to elsas desk roaming from one room to the next hanging out in the kitchen looking for food and napping in theos office waiting for him to arrive from school no worries no stress no fears of someone stalking him and plotting more mischief what a life thought theo a dogs life it didnt seem fair theo sat on the edge of his bed waited for a moment in hopes he would throw up but soon admitted that he was feeling better judge just stared at him there were footsteps outside his door then a gentle knock theo his mother said softly are you awake yes maam theo said in a fake scratchy voice as if he might be taking his last breath she opened the door stepped inside and sat next to him on the bed here i brought you a cup of hot chocolate theo took the cup and held it with both hands the aroma was strong and delicious did you sleep well she asked she was still in her heavy bathrobe and her favorite pink fuzzy slippers not really theo said i had this nightmare that wouldnt go away tell me about it she said as she tussled his hair theo took a sip of the hot chocolate and smacked his lips it was a really weird dream that made no sense at all and it seemed to go on and on i was running from the police lots of police with guns and everything i was on my bike getting away leaving them behind when they shot out both tires so i threw the bike in a ditch and ran through the woods they were getting closer and closer bullets hitting trees all around me and they had dogs too and the dogs were right on my heels someone yelled hey theo over here i ran to the voice and it was pete duffy in a pickup truck so i jumped in the back of the truck and we took off bullets still flying all around us he was driving like a maniac slinging me all over the back of the truck and suddenly we were on main street and people were yelling go theo go and stuff like that police cars were behind us with lights and sirens we smashed through a roadblock and were about to get away when the cops shot out all four tires theo paused took another sip judge was staring at him with only one thoughtwheres breakfast did you get away his mom asked she seemed to be amused by the story im not sure i dont think i finished the dream we were running through some alleys and every time we turned a corner there were more policemen all of them blasting away it was like a small army was after us there was a swat team and even a helicopter overhead pete duffy kept saying theyre not going to catch us theo just keep running we ran through the courthouse which was full of people in the middle of the night and we ran toward the river for some reason we decided to cross the bridge about halfway over we saw a swat team on the other side coming right at us we stopped looked behind saw cops and dogs everywhere pete duffy said we gotta jump theo and i said im not jumping so he crawled over the railing and was about to jump when he got hit with bullets from all sides he screamed and fell over and i watched him fall until he hit the water there were people on the river in boats and they cheered when he made a splash then they started yelling jump theo jump the police were closing in from both sides the dogs were growling sirens blaring away gunfire i held up my hands like i was going to surrender then in a split second i jumped over the railingwhich was about eight feet highbut this was a dream okay i looked like an olympic diver flying through the air on the way down i started doing flips and twists and turns dont know where i learned all those moves the river was far below and getting closer and closer he took another sip what happened she asked dont know that dive lasted for a long time and i woke up before i hit the water i tried to go back to sleep to finish the dive but couldnt get it to work thats a pretty cool dream theo lots of action and excitement it wasnt very cool at the time i was scared to death you ever been shot at by the police no i have not you were going to think about some possible enemies who might be carrying a grudge of some sort theo took another sip and thought for a moment come on mom kids dont have enemies do they look we all have people we dont like and dont like us right but i cant think of a single person id call an enemy fair enough who is the kid who dislikes you the most betty ann hockner and whats the history we had a debate several months ago boys versus girls the issue was gun control things got pretty heated but it was all fair we won the debate and she was really upset i heard later that she called me a jerk and a cheapshot artist ive seen her almost every day since then and she gives me these looks like she would love to slit my throat you should reach out to her theo no way and why not im afraid shell slit my throat could she slash your tires and throw a rock through a window theo shook his head and thought for a second not really shes a nice girl but shes not very popular i kinda feel sorry for her shes not our suspect so who is i dont know im still thinking about it youd better get ready for school i feel pretty lousy mom nausea and a headache i think id better stay in bed today she smiled tussled his hair again didnt believe a word of it and said what a surprise you know theo if you didnt fake so many illnesses in order to skip school i might believe you every now and then schools boring well its not optional if you want to go to law school there is a rule somewhere that you must complete the eighth grade show me that rule i just made it up look theo today might be a bit rough lots of gossip and such and probably some jokes i know youd rather skip it but you cant bite your lip grit your teeth and hold your head up because youve done nothing wrong you have nothing to be ashamed of i know and keep smiling the world is a brighter place when youre smiling it might be hard to smile today theo parked his bike at a different rack one by the cafeteria and after he chained it he couldnt help but look around to see if anyone was watching this looking over his shoulder was already a habit and he was tired of it it was he met april finnemore in the cafeteria where students who arrive early on buses were allowed to meet and socialize or have an apple juice or to sometimes study april was a friend a close one but not a girlfriend theo trusted her above all others and she confided in him as well her home life was a constant mess with a father who came and went a mother who was at least half crazy if not more and older siblings who had already fled town april too wanted to leave home but was much too young her dream was to be an artist and live in paris how are you doing she asked as they sat at the end of a long table as far away from the other students as possible theo gritted his teeth held up his head and said im fine nothing wrong with me this stuff is all over the internet it seems to be growing look april i cant control that im innocent what am i supposed to do about it you want an apple juice sure theo walked across the cafeteria to a counter where cups of free apple juice were waiting he picked up two and was walking back to april when a group of seventhgrade boys began chanting guilty guilty guilty theo looked at them and flashed his braces offered a fake smile as if he found it humorous the biggest loudmouth was a kid named phil jacoby a tough kid from a bad part of town theo knew him but they did not hang out a few other kids joined in guilty guilty guilty but by the time theo sat down the chants were dying the fun was over creeps april hissed as she glared at the boys just ignore them theo said if you fight back it just gets worse more kids arrived and backpacks hit the tables what will the police do next april asked almost in a whisper finish their investigation theo said softly glancing around there are no fingerprints on the tablets found in my locker so they figure the thief is pretty smart they were going to dust my locker but now they figure thats a waste of time you gotta keep in mind april this is a minor crime the cops have much more important matters to worry about like finding pete duffy exactly plus they have drug cases and more serious crimes to investigate they wont spend a lot of time on this burglary its not that serious unless youre the accused dont tell me youre not worried about getting framed for this sure im worried but i trust the police and the courts you gotta trust the system april im innocent and i know it the police will find the real thieves and ill be off the hook just that simple yes i think the gang of seventh graders walked behind him phil jacoby said loudly hey you guys watch your backpacks theo the thief is in the room his buddies howled with laughter but kept walking the other students glared at theo a couple moved their backpacks closer oh boy theo said defeated i guess i have a new nickname creeps theo found it difficult to bite his lip grit his teeth and hold up his head this would indeed be a long day the fight broke out a few minutes later as theo was closing his locker the troublemaker was another loudmouth a kid named baxter who was in madame moniques eighthgrade homeroom and had a locker not far from theos baxter walked behind theo and in a loud voice said hey whats up jailbird this got a few laughs but not nearly as many as baxter was looking for he stopped and grinned at theo baxters mistake was opening his big mouth when woody happened to be closing his own locker he whirled around and angrily said shut up nobody messed with woody he had two older brothers who played football and loved karate and were known to fight for any reason woodys home was in a constant state of physical conflict with broken windows furniture and sometimes bones as the youngest woody had been the tackling dummy and the punching bag and he actually enjoyed a good fight with someone his own size he was never a bully but often he was too quick to throw a punch or to threaten a classmate but baxter had his own toughguy reputation and he could not back down with people watching dont tell me to shut up he shot back if i want to call theo a jailbird then ill call him a jailbird woody was already walking toward baxter and at that point serious trouble was inevitable excitement gripped the hallway as the other students realized that like a couple of gunslingers neither of these two would back down theo glanced up and down the hall in hopes of seeing mr mount or another teacher but there was no adult in sight at that crucial moment he said its okay woody its okay but it wasnt okay with woody he glared at baxter and said take it back baxter said no thanks when you steal and get arrested then in my book youre a jailbird he was still talking tough but his eyes were also getting bigger his left eye though was about to get closed woody lunged with a right hook that landed perfectly on baxters face baxter to his credit managed to land a solid punch before both boys locked each other up in death grips and tumbled to the floor fights were rare at the middle school and a good one was not to be missed a crowd gathered around instantly down the hall someone yelled a fight a fight woody and baxter were sliding all over the tiled floor clawing and scratching like two cats baxters sidekick was a runt named griff and evidently he knew what the other boys knewit would only be a matter of seconds before woody gained the upper hand and began working on baxters face so griff to protect his friend made the dumb move of joining the fray he growled some sort of impromptu battle cry and lunged himself onto woodys back theo and the rest of the crowd gawked in disbelief fighting carried an automatic suspension from classes the student manual was clear and every teacher stressed the evils of fighting the punishment handed down by mrs gladwell was flexible and depended on the circumstances a pushandshove match on the playground might result in a oneday suspension with three extra hours in study hall a fullblown fist fight with busted lips and bloody noses might result in a threeday suspension no afterschool activities and one month of probation theo was not a fighter his last scuffle had been in fourth grade when he and walter norris got in a heated wrestling match at the city swimming pool but as he stood there frozen and watched the fight right in front of him he suddenly had the urge to join it after all his friend woody was slugging it out in defense of his honor the least theo could do was go to his rescue and perhaps a suspension was not the end of the world his parents would go berserk but they would eventually settle down what did his mother say last night the first thing you do is fight back attack when youre right you never back down ike would be proud sometimes a guy has got to fight theo dropped his backpack yelled something that not even he understood and jumped into the pile chapter on one side of the table baxter sat with griff and on the other side woody sat with theo the opposing sides faced each other as the tension slowly faded and reality set in baxter had an ice pack on the side of his face and his left eye was swollen and completely closed it looked awful woody was proud though he suppressed a smile with suspension coming and angry parents to deal with smiles were not possible griffs face showed no damage nor did woodys theos bottom lip was puffy and there was a spot of dried blood on it he tapped it with a tissue his more serious wound was a throbbing head courtesy of a kick at the bottom of the pile by either baxter or griff but he did not mention this mr mount sat at the end of the table and stared at the boys he had angrily pulled them apart and marched them down to the library and into the small study room where they were now sitting and cooling off as the seconds and minutes ticked by the boys settled down their breathing slowed their heart rates were returning to normal nothing like a good fight to get the pulse racing and the blood pumping what happened mr mount finally asked all four boys stared at the table nothing not a word could this have anything to do with the rumor that theo was arrested yesterday mr mount asked looking squarely at theo who did not take his eyes off the surface of the table mr mount knew that woody was a hothead and baxter liked trouble he also knew that griff followed baxter around like a new puppy he would never believe though that theo boone would start a fight or jump into the middle of one but mr mount had once been a boy and he understood things the way he figured it baxter and griff were picking on theo and woody defended his friend there were voices outside the room mr mount said i think mrs gladwell is here i wouldnt want to be in your shoes with that he stood and left the room as soon as the door closed behind him woody snarled nobody rats okay i mean it nobody rats not one word as soon as the words left his mouth the door opened wide and mrs gladwell stormed in one look and the boys knew they were dead she stared at them as she slowly took a seat at the end of the table mr mount eased into the room closed the door and stood against the wall he was there as her witness are you okay baxter she asked without a touch of sympathy baxter nodded slightly and theo is that blood on your bottom lip theo nodded slightly she stiffened her spine frowned even harder and began well i want to know what happened neither boy moved the tiniest muscle all seven eyes baxter had only one workable eye at this point were glued firmly at something fascinating though invisible on the table silence as seconds passed her face became redder her frown even harsher fighting is a very serious offense she lectured we do not tolerate fighting at this school and youve known this since you arrived here in the fifth grade fighting carries an automatic suspension a suspension goes into your file and becomes part of your permanent record not exactly theo said to himself sure it might be a permanent record but it would never leave the middle school no college or law school or potential employer would ever know that a student got suspended for fighting in the eighth grade theo she said sternly i want to know what happened look at me theo theo slowly turned and looked at the rather frightening face of his principal tell me what happened she demanded theo unable to maintain eye contact focused his attention at a spot on the wall and clenched his jaws of the four theo was a leader griff was a follower woody and baxter generally moved with the pack if theo kept his mouth shut then the other three would too this was mrs gladwells first mistake the way to crack a case with multiple defendants is to separate them theo if in charge would isolate griff in a small room with several grimfaced adultsadministrators coaches people with clout and authority they would explain to griff that the other three boys were talking and pointing the finger at him griff baxter is saying that you were taunting theo and griff theyre saying you threw the first punch and so on griff wouldnt believe this at first but after a few minutes of getting hammered at he would eventually start talking once he gave his version he would be told that it didnt jive with the other three so obviously griff was lying lying would only compound his troubles lying plus fighting would lead to an even longer suspension and probation griff would then become desperate to make it known that his version was indeed truthful and accurate once this strategy was used on all four boys they would be singing like birds and the truth about the fight would become clear this of course would require deception on the part of the authorities but such tactics are permissible under the law on the other hand mrs gladwells strategy involved no deception and she would learn nothing from the boys theo was happy that she did not understand basic police interrogation tactics theo said nothing and returned his gaze to the table in front of him his refusal to speak to rat meant all four would go down together she continued baxter who punched you in the eye baxter lowered the ice pack and set it on the table the ice was working and the swelling had gone down a little he almost said i dont know but caught himself he of course did know there was no benefit in lying at this point just clam up like theo and suffer through this there was a long pause as she waited the air was thick with tension and looming trouble none of the boys had ever been suspended though woody and baxter had been on probation a couple of times mrs gladwell had been informed early that morning the internet was buzzing with the rumors that theo had been arrested for the theft and was going to court she had been shown the photo posted on gashmail she had planned to meet with theo at some point during the day and offer her support now she was faced with the unpleasant task of suspending him and the other three finally she said i suspect that either baxter or griff said something about theo getting into trouble with the law maybe getting arrested or something like that since woody and theo are classmates and good friends i suspect that woody intervened and this started the fight am i right about this griff griff jerked as though hed been slapped but he quickly composed himself so he could say nothing not a word he narrowed his eyes and gritted his teeth and gave her nothing she waited and waited and her frown disappeared the boys were playing games so she would play along baxter baxter tapped the table nervously but said nothing boys we can sit here all morning she said behind her mr mount tried not to smile secretly he admired the boys for protecting each other and facing their punishment together mr mount would you take baxter griff and woody outside she said i want to talk to theo alone without a word the three followed mr mount out of the room when the door closed theo felt totally isolated look at me theo she said softly theo turned and made eye contact i know youve had a bad week she said you feel as though youre the victim the police are after you someone is trying to frame you for the burglary someone is stalking you someone is bullying you your face is all over the internet in that photo of you and your parents leaving the police station lies are being told rumors are out of control i understand all this theo im on your side and i hope you know this theo managed to nod slightly and im certain that you did not start this fight i want you to tell me exactly what happened okay i got in a fight theo said but did you start the fight theo i got in a fight and fighting is against the rules he found the strong urge to look away but somehow managed to stare at her she was disappointed even hurt and theo felt lousy he considered her a friend an ally a person of authority who was trying to help him and he was giving her nothing after a long tense nervous silent pause she said so youre not going to tell me what happened theo shook his head it hurt more when he moved it then a cruel question what will your parents think when i call them and tell them youve been suspended from school for fighting i dont know theo managed to say horrified by the prospect facing his parents would be far worse than getting kicked in the head a sharp pain stabbed him in the stomach as he saw the looks in their eyes okay please step outside theo quickly jumped from his chair and left the room when he stepped through the door he saw the other three and ran his index finger across his mouth lips are zipped i didnt rat and you dont either baxter was next he returned to the room to the table as if he might be executed did you say something to theo about getting into trouble she asked no response did you taunt him or harass him no response did woody hit you in the face no response did theo nothing would you please step outside and send in woody she said when baxter stepped through the door and saw the other three he ran his index finger across his lips nobody rats while woody was getting grilled by mrs gladwell theo and griff and baxter sat on a wooden bench under the watch of mr mount who felt sorry for the boys they were all good kids and nothing would be gained by suspensions still rules were rules of the four woody would be the last to crack under pressure and he refused to answer any question from mrs gladwell when she asked him if he hit baxter he responded name rank and serial number only very funny woody you think this is a game no did you throw the first punch i refuse to incriminate myself he replied get out of here the weakest link was griff and when he survived his little questionandanswer period with mrs gladwell by refusing to rat she reassembled the four boys in the room she said very well im going to suspend each of you one day for fighting and another day for your refusal to cooperate today is thursday and the suspension will run today and tomorrow you will return to classes on monday at which time you will begin a thirtyday probation any violation during the next thirty days and you will be suspended for a week the prospect of missing classes for two days did not really trouble theo but the reality of facing his parents was painful he thought about calling ike first because ike would understand and probably praise theo for taking a stand perhaps ike could then break the news to theos parents and soften the impact theo was contemplating this when mrs gladwell said ill call your parents it took an hour to work out the details of the suspensions and do the paperwork the boys stayed in the room at the table facing each other while mr mount sat bored at the end of the table he stepped out once to get coffee and while he was gone baxter said sorry theo no problem theo said woody did not apologize woodys parents and baxters parents had jobs thus no one was home during the day mrs gladwell explained they would be receiving inschool suspensions and would be required to sit in separate study rooms at school from am until classes ended at they would be alone with nothing to do but extra homework no cell phones laptops nothing but textbooks they would eat lunch at their desks alone this seemed far worse than the oldfashioned suspensions where they kicked you off campus griffs mother was a housewife so he could stay at home and probably sleep late watch television play with the dog and do whatever he wanted unless of course his parents were ticked off enough to impose penalties theo too had a place to gothe offices of boone amp boone his mother was in court his father picked him up from school as they were driving away theo said what about my bike well get it later his father replied so far he had been remarkably cool and undisturbed at least on the surface a block or two later his father said what happened its just between me and you right what happened theo his father snapped youre not telling mrs gladwell are you i cant rat on the other guys no just tell me what happened theo told him everything the details poured forth in a rush and theo who had been unable to tell his side of the story unloaded when he finished they were sitting in the small parking lot behind the office are you upset with me dad theo asked you know the rules and you broke the rules mr boone said sternly i did but at the time i had no choice mr boone turned off the ignition and said thats the way i see it too chapter theo sat in his dark office lights off shades pulled just him and judge brooding in the shadows and thinking about what could possibly happen next in a couple of hours his mother would return from court she and his father would huddle behind a locked door and have one of those deadly serious conversations that only troubled parents can have then he would be hauled in like a felon to face the music he would be lectured his mother would cry suspended from school how could he do such a thing and on and on he was already tired of thinking about it his fathers initial response was somewhat comforting there had been no drama though his father generally was not one for theatrics no yelling but then woods boone was too laid back to yell no threats or additional punishment though theo knew his parents always chatted first before throwing the book at him until a few hours earlier theo had never dreamed he would get suspended from school he had never thought about it and as he pondered the incident he asked himself if it was worth it he didnt believe in breaking rules he didnt enjoy disappointing mrs gladwell and mr mount he suspected his parents would view it as an embarrassment and this troubled him and to be honest there had been no pleasure in the violence the frantic melee in which all four warriors seemed to be kicking punching scratching and cursing each other while some students in the crowd gawked in awe and others egged them on on the other hand there was some pride in the fact that he had gone to the aid of a friend who was being doubleteamed he had seen the admiration in the eyes of the spectators his classmates and friends he theo boone was being falsely accused and had gone on the attack to defend his good name and also to protect a friend what a friend theo could not help but smile as he replayed the encounter he marveled at the speed and fearlessness with which woody had stepped forward and shut up bigmouth baxter and theo had a hunch woody was not finished most likely he would wait until he caught baxter offcampus and close his other eye theo hoped his fighting days were over but if another bout popped up he wanted woody nearby there was a soft knock on the door come in theo said it was elsa redeyed and with tears on her cheeks she flipped the light switch and reached down to hug him theo im so sorry she said its okay its okay he said this was the last thing he wantedbigtime drama from those who loved him he endured the hug im fine its nothing okay he said getting irritated she stood and wiped her cheeks with a tissue i cant believe it youre the nicest kid in the world probably not maybe top five look elsa im okay who attacked you no one it was just a stupid fight okay no big deal she patted her cheeks with the tissue and began to realize that her sympathies were not being appreciated i still love you theo she said as if he had killed someone im fine elsa just fine now would you please get out of here she left and theo turned off the light he and judge returned to their brooding which was actually quite enjoyable five minutes passed and there was another knock at the door yes he said the door opened slowly and dorothy his fathers real estate secretary took a step inside she flipped on the light and said theo are you okay yes he said shortly and for a long second he was afraid she might lunge at him with an awkward hug as if he needed her physical support i cant believe it why would the school suspend you because i got in a fight plain and simple fighting is against the rules yes but theo surely it wasnt your fault theo shook his head and looked out the window how many times would he be forced to explain what happened doesnt matter whos at fault a fight is a fight after an awkward pause she said well if you need a friend im just down the hall thanks oh sure im going to unload my troubles to a fully grown adult whos old enough to be my mother she left and theo turned off the light his cell phone beeped with a text from april finnemore just heard u ok yep at office no classes luv it your parents mom n court dads not sore whod u punch not sure lot of contact wounds blood theo suddenly wished he had more to show for his efforts typically he decided to exaggerate a little he wrote busted lip blood awesome when can i see later u need to study now he again returned to his brooding five minutes later there was a knock at the door before theo could respond vince stepped in and turned on the light with his arrival the entire firm of boone amp boone had now come to pay its respects except of course marcella boone who would arrive soon enough vince had been her paralegal for many years he did the grunt work for mrs boones divorce cases and it was not always pleasant he spent a lot of time out of the office investigating clients and spying on their husbands and checking facts theo had known for many years that divorce clients often do not tell the truth to their lawyers and vince was called upon to verify their stories he was about thirtyfive single a nice guy with a tough job elsa had entered the room crying dorothy seemed ready for a breakdown but not vince he was smiling as he leaned against the door way to go theo did you pop him a good one theo smiled finally he realized he would tell his story a hundred times so why not dress it up a bit yep he said attaboy look theo youve just learned a valuable lesson there comes a time when you gotta stand your ground regardless of the circumstances i couldnt back down theo said suspensions are no big deal as long as they dont become a habit i got one in the sixth grade no kidding true story i grew up in northchester and we walked to school there was a bully named jerry prater a tough kid and he was giving me a hard time about once a week he would catch me on the playground before school and knock me down kick me some and grab my lunch box he would take the good stuff the chips twinkies ham sandwiches and leave me the apples and carrots the next day he would grab one of my buddies and go through the same routine i guess jerry was always hungry anyway he was making our lives pretty miserable i had an older brother in high school and he explained to me that bullies are really cowards and until you take a stand things will just get worse my brother told me what to do i hid my lunch in my backpack and filled my lunch box with rocks the next morning i saw jerry on the playground and headed toward him he was about to punch me when i suddenly swung the lunch box and hit him in the face hard i mean it was a nasty blow that cut a gash in his cheekbone he screamed and fell down and i whacked him a few more times in the head there was a crowd by now and a teacher came running over they took him to the doctor and sewed him up eighteen stitches ten across his cheekbone everybody yelled at me and my dad came to the school and picked me up i explained the situation and he had no problem with it my mom cried but thats what moms do anyway jerry left me alone after that thats awesome how long was the suspension a week i was a hero for a short time but after a while i felt bad about it jerry prater deserved to get punched but he had this scar on his face that was my last fight theo i stood up to a bully but i used a weapon i should have used my fists and nothing else i still feel bad about it what happened to jerry he dropped out of school and later went to prison never had much of a chance anyway you did the right thing so dont spend too much time worrying about it i dont want my mom to yell at me she wont i know that woman very well theo after he left theo fell asleep and judge went to look for food they met in the conference room during lunch theo sat at the end of the long imposing table with a parent on each side before him was a chicken salad sandwich which he had no desire to eat his appetite was gone his mother was not smiling but she wasnt yelling either it was obvious that she and mr boone had had their little private meeting about their son and his suspension so mrs boone was over the shock if this happened again what would you do differently theo she asked calmly as she sipped an iced tea theo chewed on a piece of lettuce and considered the question which he found interesting well mom im not sure i could do nothing to prevent the fight because it began so quickly and i couldnt exactly break it up because woody and baxter were really going at it when griff jumped on woody i felt like i had no choice woody was fighting for me the least i could do was help him so you wouldnt do anything differently i guess not does that mean youve learned nothing from this little episode ive learned that i dont like fighting getting punched in the face and kicked in the head is not that pleasant there are a few guys who like to fight but not me id say that is a valuable lesson learned mr boone chimed in as he took a bite of his sandwich it appeared as though mrs boone was about to begin a lecture when elsa tapped on the door she opened it and said sorry to bother but the police are here why mr boone asked theo wanted to crawl under the table they want to talk to theo and his parents of course detectives hamilton and vorman were back with lunch interrupted they settled into two seats on one side of the table and placed a large white envelope in front of them the boones readjusted themselves on the other side sorry to disturb lunch hamilton said we stopped by to chat with the two of you and were told that theo is here a suspension thats correct mrs boone said sharply she was obviously irritated suspension for what ill be happy to answer that if you can convince me its any of your business it was none of their business and hamiltons face blushed as his partner gave him a look of frustration go get em mom theo said to himself with a lawyer on each side he felt well protected however he was nervous and sitting on his hands to keep them from shaking im sure theres a good reason for this visit mr boone said vorman leaned forward and said yes well we wanted to talk to theo about the baseball cap that was stolen from his locker on monday would you describe it for us theo theo looked up at his mother then at his father both nodded go ahead answer the question he said its navy blue with a red bill adjustable strap with the twins logo in the middle of the front any idea who made the cap vorman asked nike any identifying marks on the cap my initials tb on the underside of the bill what did you use to write your initials a black magic marker vorman slowly opened the envelope removed a cap and slid it across the table to theo is this your cap theo held it gave it a quick inspection and said yes sir where did you find it mrs boone asked at the computer store big macs the cleaning crew comes in every wednesday night after hours last night they were doing the floors when one of them swept under a counter and found this the thief broke in around nine pm tuesday night and somehow in the mad scramble to steal what he wanted and make a quick getaway he lost his cap theo stared at the cap and wanted to cry his favorite cap was now being used as evidence against him it did not seem fair the proof was piling up for some weird reason he could hear baxters obnoxious voice jailbird jailbird for a moment his parents seemed unable to speak theo wasnt about to make a sound the detectives stared at them with looks of grim satisfaction as if to say youre nailed lets see you worm your way out of it this time finally mrs boone cleared her throat and said looks as though the thief is very clever he planned his crime carefully with the intention of framing theo on monday he stole the cap then left it at the scene of the crime and on wednesday he returned to the locker with the stolen goods thats one theory vorman said and you might be right but were also working with another theory one that has theo wearing the cap tuesday night maybe to help disguise his face when he entered the store around nine and we know he was in the vicinity around that time he even admits this and in his rush to grab the tablets and laptops and cell phones he lost his cap and here it is and of course we found some of the stolen loot in his locker on wednesday its kinda hard to ignore theo as a suspect hamilton added very hard vorman agreed in fact with most investigations we dont have this much evidence against a suspect it was hamiltons turn we find it odd that you didnt report the first breakin on monday locker theft is rare at the school yet you didnt report it and you have given us no good reason for this failure vorman it could be that there was no breakin on monday when you got caught with the stolen tablets on wednesday you said someone broke in and left them in your locker to make this sound believable you added the little twist that someone had robbed your locker two days before hamilton but there was no record of that no proof vorman and this mysterious thief was unseen by anyone at the school kinda hard to believe with eighty eighth graders and dozens of teachers plus janitors and assistants busy hallways and such hard to believe hamilton pretty incredible story if you ask me this tag team was making theo sick he closed his eyes gritted his teeth and told himself not to cry you dont believe my son mrs boone asked to theo it was obvious that they did not lets just say that were still investigating vorman replied did you check the cap for fingerprints mr boone asked we did its difficult to get good prints from cloth so we were unsuccessful our lab guys are pretty sure that there are no prints looks like the thief wore gloves and was very careful no prints on the tablets none on the cap none at the crime scene do you plan to charge theo mrs boone asked we havent made a decision yet hamilton said but its safe to say were headed that way the boones absorbed this and said nothing mr boone exhaled and looked at the ceiling mrs boone scribbled something on a legal pad theo was still fighting back tears he knew he was innocent and telling the truth but the police did not believe him he wondered if his parents did vorman broke the silence with still more bad news wed like to search your house he said mr and mrs boone reacted in disbelief for what mr boone demanded for evidence vorman replied for the rest of the stolen goods you cant treat us like common criminals mrs boone said angrily this is outrageous we will not consent to a search mr boone said we dont need your consent vorman said with a nasty smile we have a search warrant he grabbed some folded papers from his coat pocket and slid them across the table mrs boone adjusted her reading glasses and read the twopage document when she finished she handed it to her husband theo wiped a tear with the back of his hand chapter for the next half hour they haggled over the details the air was thick with tension and the exchanges between the detectives and theos parents were testy it was finally agreed that the boones would not enter their home until pm that afternoon at which time they would meet the detectives and other officers who would conduct the search the only words theo could muster were its a waste of time theres nothing there both parents told him to be quiet after hamilton and vorman left and theo could finally speak he reassured his parents that he was not involved in the crime in any way and that a search was a waste of time all three were stunned by the turn of events theo had never seen his parents so confused and even frightened they agreed they would seek the advice of a criminal defense lawyer a friend and mrs boone left the conference room to make a call at pm mr boone drove theo back to the school where they met with mrs gladwell theo apologized for fighting mr boone said he and mrs boone understood the decision to suspend theo and had no problems with it they were disappointed of course but supported mrs gladwell afterward theo got his bike found his tires unslashed and rode back to the office his parents were busy with clients and urgent legal matters they closed their doors and seemed to forget about theo elsa vince and dorothy were also preoccupied with piles of paperwork that were far more fascinating than chatting with a thirteenyearold or perhaps theo was being too sensitive he and judge finally retreated to his office where he attempted to plow through some homework nothing happened he couldnt take his mind off spike hock a kid who lived one block away who was caught selling drugs in the ninth grade and spent eighteen very unpleasant months in a juvenile detention center two hundred miles away though theo did not know spike and had never spoken to him he had heard many stories of his life behind chainlink fencing and razor wire gangs beatings cruel guards a long ugly list spike never got his act together and fell back into the street life theo had been in court when spike at the age of seventeen was sentenced as an adult to twenty years in prison for a multitude of crimes spike testified begged for mercy and blamed his troubles on the bad conditions he endured in the juvenile detention center spike was a tough kid from the streets theo was not theo was a nice kid from a good family a boy scout an a student with plenty of friends how was he supposed to survive locked away with gang members and tough guys separated from his parents his friends judge he was overwhelmed with fear and could think of nothing else he stretched out on judges little bed and fortunately fell asleep beside his dog a beeping cell phone awakened him it was april finnemore theo where are you she asked nervously at the office he said jumping to his feet whats up im in animal court with my mom and miss petunia we need your help i think im sort of confined right now come on theo were really scared and need you it wont take long i didnt say i would help this woman i know theo i know but shes really upset and needs a friend please theo she cant afford a real lawyer and well shes been crying for the past hour please theo thought for a second no one had specifically ordered him to remain at the office everyone else was super busy and probably wouldnt miss him okay he said and slapped his phone shut stay here judge he said then eased out of the back door ran around to the front of the building and quietly got his bike off the front porch ten minutes later he was parking it at the bike rack in front of the courthouse miss petunia grew flowers and herbs in a yard behind her small cottage just outside the city limits of strattenburg every saturday morning from march through october she hauled her plants to the city farmers market in levi park near the river there she joined dozens of farmers gardeners florists fishermen dairymen producers and other vendors who displayed their goods in booths that were arranged in neat rows on small patches of land that were carefully divided and regulated because miss petunia had been selling her flowers and herbs for many years she had perhaps the best booth one next to the entrance to the market next door to her was the booth run by may finnemore aprils eccentric mother who made and sold goat cheese miss petunia was pretty weird too and naturally the women had become close friends over the years the market was wildly popular in strattenburg and on a bright saturday morning half of the town would be there virtually anything edible could be found crispinos tortilla hut was the alltime favorite with a long line forming by am martha lou sold her world famous ginger cookies by the pound and always attracted a mob many of the vendors relied on the market to show a profit for the year and there was a waiting list of those wanting booths because mrs boone spent little time in the kitchen the family was not attracted to the market theo and his father played eighteen holes of golf on saturday mornings teeing off at and having lunch at to theo this was far more important than buying tomatoes and veggie burgers miss petunia was having trouble with the law because of her beloved pet llama lucy april had mentioned the matter to theo the day before during lunch but he had been too preoccupied with his own troubles to worry about miss petunias at aprils request though he had done some research into the citys laws and ordinances he had passed this along to april and considered the matter closed as far as he was concerned certain that he was already a marked man and the subject of gossip all over town and especially around the courthouse theo entered through a side door and hustled down a back stairway animal court was in the basement a fitting place for the lowest court in town real lawyers tried to avoid it people with complaints could act as their own lawyers and that is what attracted theo to it on most days anyway today though theo was not excited about making an appearance in court for the first time in his life the word court meant a place to be avoided he entered the door for animal court and walked inside there was a dusty aisle down the middle of the room with folding chairs on both sides to his right theo saw april her mother may and a third person he assumed to be miss petunia she had purple hair and round granny glasses with brightorange frames april had described her as weirder than my mother theo sat down and began whispering with the women judge yeck was not on the bench across the aisle several people were waiting one was buck boland or buck baloney as he was better known and he was wearing his standard tightfitting dark brown uniform one issued by allpro security buck wore the uniform everywhere on duty or off and hed been wearing it last monday morning when he stopped theo as he cut across his backyard he had grabbed theos bike and threatened him earlier he had thrown a rock at theo and now buck glared across the aisle as if he would like to strangle him judge yecks ancient clerk sat at a table in one corner doing her crossword and trying to stay awake after a few minutes judge yeck walked through the door behind his bench and said remain seated no one had attempted to stand formalities were dispensed with in animal court also known as kitty court the judge was wearing his usual outfitjeans combat boots no tie an old sports coat and he conducted himself with his usual disdain for his job he had once been in a law firm but couldnt keep a job he ran animal court because no one else would do it well well he began with a smile its mr boone again theo stood and said hello judge always nice to see you and you whos your client miss petunia plankmore the owner of the animal judge yeck looked at some papers then looked at buck baloney and whos mr boland thats me buck said very well the parties can come forward and well try and work things out theo knew the routine and he and miss petunia stepped through the small gate in the bar and took a seat at a table closer to the judge buck followed them and sat as far away as possible when they were in place judge yeck said mr boland you have filed this complaint against miss petunia you go first keep your seat and tell us what happened buck looked around nervously then plunged in well judge i work for allpro security and we have the contract for the farmers market why are you wearing a gun the judge asked im a security guard i dont care and i have a permit i dont care i dont allow guns in my courtroom please remove it buck grabbed his holster and snapped it off his belt he placed it and the gun on the table up here judge yeck said pointing to a spot on his bench buck awkwardly stepped forward and placed the gun right where he was told it was a very large pistol now go on yeck said when buck returned to his seat and so anyway its my job to provide security at the farmers market there are two of us me and frankie he works the west end and i watch the front been doing it for a few months and miss petunia here has a booth near the front entrance where she sells flowers and herbs and right next to her booth is a small open area where she keeps her llama that would be lucy judge yeck asked yes sir two saturdays ago i was walking by her booth same as always just doing my job you know when this llama walks up and stares at me were about on the same eye level me and the llama and at first i thought she might try and kiss me the llama kisses people judge yeck interrupted shes a very sweet llama loves people or most people miss petunia blurted judge yeck looked at her and politely but firmly said youll get your chance in a moment please do not interrupt sorry judge continue buck sucked in his ample gut and went on yes sir the llama kisses people especially little kids kinda gross if you ask me but theres usually some folks hanging around to get a better look at the llama and occasionally shell sort of lean down and kiss one of them okay okay weve established that lucy the llama likes to kiss people now move on yes sir well like i said the llama walked up to me we stared at each other for a few seconds then the llama raised her nose straight up which means shes not happy then she sort of cocked back her head and spit in my face a lot of spit too not just a couple of drops it was gross sticky and smelly the llama spits at people judge yeck asked amused oh yes judge and she did it real quick like i had no idea what was coming aprils mother may finnemore was a loud woman with rough manners who could be counted on to do the wrong thing she laughed and made no effort to conceal it thats enough judge yeck said sternly though he himself seemed ready to chuckle please continue mr boland got it there were some kids watching and i think they knew this llama was a spitter and as soon as she spit in my face the kids cracked up laughing it was very embarrassing and it made me mad so after i wiped my face off i walked over to miss petunia and told her what happened she said well lucy doesnt like you and i said i dont care if she likes me or not she cant be spitting at people especially security personnel she didnt apologize or anything in fact i think she thought it was funny is this llama on a leash or confined in some way judge yeck asked no sir it is not it just sort of hangs around miss petunias booth there are always some kids petting it and making a fuss so we discussed the matter for a few minutes and i realized the owner was not going to do anything about it so i decided to walk away to cool off and to wash my face but i kept an eye on the llama and i think she kept an eye on me part of my job is to watch the front entrance sometimes people will try and leave with stuff they havent paid for so i gotta keep em honest you know what i mean judge of course and so anyway about a half an hour later im doing my job and i walk past her booth again didnt say a word to her or to the llama i stopped and i was talking to mr dudley bishop and i felt something behind me he stopped talking i turned around and there was the llama again staring at me before i could back away she spit in my face for the second time it was just as gross as the first time dudley is here as my witness from a folding chair in the audience mr dudley bishop raised his hand is all this true mr bishop the judge asked every word of it the witness replied continue well i was pretty upset people were laughing at me and everything so i wiped my face off and went over to miss petunia she had seen it happen and she was not at all concerned she told me to stay away from the llama and things would be fine i explained that i had a right to do my job and the problem was hers not mine do something with her lousy llama but she refused i cooled off again and tried to keep my distance if i got close to the entrance the llama would stop whatever it was doing and give me a dirty look i talked to frankie about it and suggested we swap places for the rest of the morning but he wanted no part of the llama he said i should call animal control which i did the officer came out and had a chat with miss petunia she said there is no city ordinance requiring llamas to be on a leash or confined in some way and the animal control officer agreed with her i guess its okay for llamas to roam the city at will spitting at people i didnt realize this was a problem in strattenburg judge yeck observed well it is now and theres more to the story judge continue well last saturday it happened again only worse i was keeping my distance from the animal doing my job as best i could trying to avoid it and not even making eye contact i didnt say a word to miss petunia or anybody else around there the other lady there mrs finnemore has the booth next to the flower stall where she sells goat cheese and she has this spider monkey who hangs around attracting customers and increasing sales i think what does the monkey have to do with the llama ill tell you sometimes the monkey will sit on the llamas back sort of ride it around and this always gets a lot of attention kids hang around and take pictures some of the parents even take photos of their kids posing with the llama and the monkey well this one little girl got scared and started screaming i walked over and as soon as the llama saw me she bolted and ran at me i didnt get within thirty feet of her but she attacked anyway i didnt want to get spit on again so i moved back she kept coming with the monkey hanging on like some cowboy when i realized the llama meant business i turned around and started running the faster i ran the faster the llama ran i could hear the monkey squealing having fun i guess this was about eight oclock so the market was packed and everyone was laughing i didnt know if the thing would bite or whatever i thought about grabbing my gun and defending myself but there were too many people around plus i didnt want to kill the llama we ran up and down the aisles all over the market people were laughing the monkey was squealing it was awful judge yeck raised a file to partially cover his face and hide the fact that he was about to burst out laughing theo glanced around the room and everyone was amused its not funny judge buck said continue well it all came to an end when i fell down i stumbled in front of butch tuckers watermelon stand and before i could get up the llama bent down and spit at me it missed my face but got my shirt wet butch is here if you want to verify this butch raised his hand its all true judge i was there he said with a grinning face thank you continue please buck was breathing hard and his face had turned red he said well i finally got to my feet and i was ready to slug the llama and maybe the monkey too when frankie came running up with a stick and shooed the llama away i guess it went back to its spot i dont know i was too upset you gotta do something judge i have the right to do my job without being attacked anything more i guess not thats all for now any crossexamination mr boone theo decided it would be best for his client to tell her side of the story he knew from experience that judge yeck did not like the usual courtroom procedures lets hear from miss petunia he said a good idea miss petunia please give us your version miss petunia jumped to her feet ready to defend lucy you can keep your seat the judge said i prefer to stand she said then please stand thank you judge all of what he said is true but he left out a few things llamas spit when they feel threatened or harassed and they do so as a means of defense to protect themselves they dont bite and they dont kick they are very peaceful animals whove been around for thousands of years theyre from the same family as the camel did you know that judge i did not well they are and theyre hard working loyal and easy to care for ive had lucy for twelve years and she pulls my wagon to the market every saturday morning at sunrise my car is tiny and i cant use it to haul my flowers and herbs so lucy does it for me judge yeck held up a hand looked at theo and asked is it legal for a llama to pull a wagon on city streets theo replied yes sir there is no ordinance against it where does this llama live in my backyard miss petunia said i have a big backyard does the city allow llamas to be kept at private homes theo replied no your honor however miss petunia does not live in the city her home is just outside the city limits in the county and the county does not prohibit a llama from living in her backyard thank you counselor please continue miss petunia a few months ago lucy and i were going home after the market was over and we were stopped by a patrol car two policemen got out and started asking questions they accused us of blocking traffic and other nonsense but i think they were just curious it really upset lucy she felt threatened did she spit on them judge yeck asked no sir how often does she spit on people it rarely happens judge about a year ago the guy who reads the electric meters came around the house and wouldnt leave her alone she got him he was wearing a uniform of sorts you see judge i dont think lucy likes large men in uniforms she feels threatened by them shes never spat on a woman or a child or a man who was not in a uniform a gold star for her and mr boland here has not been that kind to her hes stopped by several times throwing his weight around trying to tell me that lucy needed to be on a leash or kept in a certain place stuff like that he thinks hes in charge of the entire market he gets part of the blame for this thats not true your honor buck said however anyone who watched buck in uniform knew immediately that he was proud of his authority were not going to bicker are you finished miss petunia i guess all right mr boland what exactly do you want me to do well judge i think she should keep her llama at home in the backyard where it cant spit on people or attack them in public theo said but judge she has to get her flowers and herbs to market and theres no law against using her llama to pull her wagon it would be unfair to require my client to keep lucy at home maybe but something must be done mr boone judge yeck said we cant allow an animal like this to spit on people mr boland has the right to do his job without the fear of being assaulted by a llama do you agree mr boone yes i do and on behalf of my client i offer an apology to mr boland for lucys actions apologies meant a lot to judge yeck and theo had insisted that they offer one miss petunia was against the idea but theo prevailed buck nodded his acceptance but was not satisfied you got a plan mr boone judge yeck asked theo stood and addressed the judge lets try this next saturday morning mr boland here swaps places with the other guard frankie and frankie is instructed to stay as far away from lucy as possible and still do his job if lucy goes after frankie then we will agree to take more drastic measures such as your honor lucy has never been on a leash but my client will give it a try miss petunia feels confident that she can talk to lucy about this and convince her not to be so aggressive with large men in uniforms how big is frankie judge yeck asked buck a shrimp miss petunia talks to lucy judge yeck asked theo miss petunia stood too and said oh yes judge we chat all the time lucy is very intelligent i think i can convince her to stop the spitting mr boland what do you think of this idea buck realized he was not getting what he wanted not on this day anyway so he shrugged and said ill give it a try im not looking for trouble judge but its pretty embarrassing im sure it is well proceed with the plan and if it doesnt work well be back here next week agreed everyone agreed and nodded along animal court is adjourned judge yeck said chapter as soon as theo left the courthouse reality returned for a short while he had been able to forget his problems and lose himself in the wacky world of a spitting llama miss petunia was thrilled may finnemore gave him an awkward hug most importantly april was impressed by his courtroom skills but the fun was suddenly over and theo faced nothing but humiliation he was being falsely accused and stalked and harassed and now his entire family was being dragged into it the very thought of a bunch of police officers picking through every room of the boone home was terrifying what would the neighbors think then theo had a thought that was so awful he had to stop his bike and catch his breath he sat down on an empty bus bench and stared at the asphalt pavement if someone were mean enough and reckless enough to stash stolen goods in his locker why wouldnt they do the same thing at his house the garage doors were usually left open there was a storage shed in the rear and they never locked its door it would not be too difficult for some creep to sneak around the exterior of their home and find an unnoticed spot to hide a few more tablets or cell phones or even laptops what if the police found such items caught again redhanded at some point theo wondered if his own parents might become suspicious of him he eventually got on his bike and continued to the office where he eased through the rear door and found judge asleep under his desk he tiptoed down the hall and managed to avoid seeing anyone elsa was tidying up her desk and preparing to leave she was subdued and worried about theo and he felt worse after chatting with her the clock inched closer to pm the police were waiting at the curb in front of mallard lane home of woods and marcella boone and their only child theo who had never lived anywhere else they were waiting in two unmarked cars and for this the boones were thankful two police cruisers adorned with all the bells and whistles would have attracted neighbors like a magnet theo wheeled in first on his bike with his parents right behind him detectives vorman and hamilton approached from the street and introduced officers mabe and jesco both in plainclothes they were invited inside where mrs boone made a pot of coffee and everybody else sat around the kitchen table while the coffee was brewing mr boone slowly read the search warrant again then handed it to mrs boone who did the same i fail to see why its necessary to search every room in the house mr boone said its not necessary mrs boone added sharply their anger was clear but under control for the moment anyway hamilton said i agree we dont plan to be here all night we would like to take a look at theos room and maybe a couple others then the garage the basement maybe the attic theres nothing in my room theo said he was standing in the doorway watching and listening thats enough theo his father said you plan to go through our attic mrs boone asked in disbelief as she poured coffee yes hamilton replied good luck you may not make it out alive do you have any outbuildings vorman asked theres a storage shed out back mr boone said whats in it i dont keep a list the usual stuff a lawn mower garden hoses weed eater old furniture do you keep it locked never theo blurted again theres nothing in the attic and nothing in the storage shed youre wasting your time because you have the wrong suspect the six adults stared at him then his father said okay theo thats enough well i agree with theo his mother said this is a waste of time and effort the longer you suspect theo the longer it will take to find the real criminal were just doing our investigation hamilton said its our job theos room was in surprisingly good shape his parents gave demerits for an unmade bed or clothes on the floor or books off the shelves demerits translated into a reduction in his weekly allowance so to theo some serious cash was on the line if he didnt tidy things up it was agreed that mrs boone would stay with the officers in the room and monitor the search a tenminute inspection revealed nothing and the search party moved to the guest bedroom and its closets then to the den with mrs boone watching every move the officers carefully looked into cabinets and shelves they gently touched every item in a coat closet they almost tiptoed through the house as if they were afraid they might break something after they left the den theo and his father turned on the television and watched the local news theo tried to appear relaxed but he could think of nothing but the storage shed and how easy it would be to hide the loot out there his stomach ached and he wanted to lie down but he tried gamely to look nonchalant what if he heard them yell we found it or here it is his life would be over mrs boone led them to the basement where they searched the laundry room a game room and a utility room nothing she led them to the attic cramped and stuffed with boxes of the typical useless junk that would eventually be thrown away does theo come up here often hamilton asked mrs boone only when he hides stolen goods she replied hamilton vowed to ask no more questions it took almost an hour to open all the cardboard boxes and storage bins finding nothing they moved to the garage and searched another utility room and a large closet housing the heating and airconditioning units while they were out of the house theo asked his father can i go to my room dad sure as theo was leaving the den his father said theo your mother and i believe you one hundred percent do you understand this i do thanks dad upstairs theo stretched out on his bed and patted a spot next to him judge was waiting for the signal and hopped up on the beda nono in the eyes of mrs boone but the door was locked and theo was safe from the world for the moment anyway he heard a noise from the backyard and knew the search party was poking around the storage shed he waited tried to relax and tried to shake the feeling that his room had just been invaded by the police minutes passed and there were no excited noises from outside nothing unusual was found in the storage shed and after two hours the search ended the police thanked mr and mrs boone for their cooperationas if they had a choiceand left mallard lane mrs boone knocked on theos door and he opened it theyre gone she said as she hugged him are you okay no not really neither am i look theo im a pretty good lawyer so is your father were determined to protect you and make sure nothing bad happens okay the detectives are good men who are just doing their jobs they will eventually find the truth and this nightmare will be over i promise you there will be a happy ending if you say so mom your father has a great idea since you dont have school tomorrow lets go to santos and get a pizza theo managed to smile as they were driving away theo from the backseat asked say have you guys ever heard of a spitting llama no his parents replied in unison have i got a story for you chapter late friday morning when he should have been in thirdperiod government theo finally got bored with his suspension and admitted to himself that he missed school his mother was in court his father was buried in paperwork at his desk no one in the law firm had time for him so he informed elsa that he was going to visit ike she gave him a hug and once again looked as though she might cry theo was so sick of all this pity judge ran along behind him as he pedaled through strattenburg being careful to avoid the busy streets because the last thing he wanted was to get stopped by a cop or a truant officer kids were caught all the time skipping school and serious truants were hauled into youth court theo had a hunch that he was about to see more of youth court than he had ever dreamed and the way his luck was running this week he was almost certain another cop would stop him he made it safely to ikes office though and bounded up the steps to a wonderfully messy room where his cranky old uncle barely earned enough money to survive in spite of his cluttered desk and his boonelike fondness of work ike did not really push himself he lived alone in a small apartment he drove an old spitfire with a million miles on it he didnt need much so he didnt work much especially on fridays theo knew from experience that most lawyers ran out of gas around noon on friday the courthouse was much quieter it was hard to find a judge on friday afternoon the clerks took longer lunch breaks and began sneaking away as soon as possible ike though no longer a real lawyer certainly followed this tradition he slept late something he did almost every day and puttered around his office until the crack of noon when he walked downstairs to the greek deli for lunch to start the weekend properly ike had two glasses of wine with his friday lunch theo and judge arrived around and ike after three cups of coffee was hyper and talkative i have a suspect theo not a real person not a name not yet but i have an idea that we must pursue are you with me sure ike first though i want to hear all about the fight every detail every kick punch bloody nose tell me you punched some little thug in the face ikes feet were on his deskdirty sandals no socks so theo kicked back in his chair and put his feet on the desk too well it happened real fast he began and launched into a long and fairly accurate account of the fight ike was grinning a very proud uncle theo did not embellish much and he resisted the temptation to improve his skills as a brawler when he finished describing the meeting with mrs gladwell and the suspension ike said good for you theo sometimes you have no choice wear the suspension like a badge of honor did you hear about the search warrant theo asked anxious to share all of the weeks adventures what search warrant ike demanded theo told that story and ike never stopped shaking his head to lighten things up theo asked have you ever heard of a spitting llama ike had not so theo recounted in great detail his latest adventure in animal court when the story time was over ike jumped to his feet cracked his knuckles and said okay theo our task is to find the person whos trying to frame you right right ive thought about nothing else for the past fortyeight hours tell me what you know so far not much my dad is convinced that its someone from inside the school most likely another student because an adult would have a hard time getting into my locker without being suspicious he thinks its more than one kid i agree completely whos your number one suspect i dont have one ike my parents have pushed me to make a list of all the kids who may have a grudge im not saying im the greatest guy at school but i really cant think of anyone who would a break into my locker and steal stuff on monday then b break in and rob the computer store tuesday night leaving the cap behind then c break into my locker again on wednesday and plant the stolen tablets all in an effort to get me thrown in jail somebody out there really really hates me and i just cant think of who it might be thats because you dont know him youve probably never met him maybe youve seen him but you dont know it ike was pacing back and forth behind his desk scratching his gray beard frowning in deep thought okay theo replied who is it ike suddenly sat down and leaned across his desk staring at theo with glowing eyes your parents are lawyers and good ones lawyers take cases that involve people who are mad upset hurt in trouble ticked off enough to spend a lot of money filing a lawsuit now your father is a real estate lawyer which is a pretty dull way to make a living if you ask me he does a lot of paperwork he deals with people who are buying and selling homes buildings land you know what im talking about im not going to be a real estate lawyer theo said attaboy my point being he does not deal with clients who are engaged in conflict right right your mother on the other hand deals with nothing but conflict and the worst kind divorces marriages blow up husbands and wives fighting over who gets custody of the kids who gets the house the cars the furniture the money charges of adultery abuse neglect terrible cases sometimes theo i never had the stomach for divorce your mother though is one of the best always has been theo was nodding listening waiting he knew all of this ike tapped his fingertips together and said a divorce is an awful thing for a child theo the two people he loves most suddenly cant live together they no longer love each other in fact they often hate each other and in the process of splitting up they use the child as a prize to fight over for the child it is traumatic bewildering and quite painful the child is not sure which parent will get custody so the child does not know where heshe will be living often the husband and wife are forced to sell the family home sometimes the child prefers one parent over another and is forced to choose imagine theo being forced to choose whether you want to live with your mother or your father a divorce is an emotional shock for a child and the damage lasts for a long time he paused to scratch his beard then i think your problems are linked to one of your mothers divorce cases i think one of her clients has a kid in your school and this kid secretly hates you because he doesnt like the way the divorce is going since your mother always represents the wife and the wife almost always gets custody of the children maybe this kid doesnt like his mother and wants to live with his father who for obvious reasons really doesnt like marcella boone this intense dislike of your mother is not at all unusual in divorce cases and its probably shared with the children who are caught in the crossfire two bricks one on each shoulder suddenly vanished into the air and theo felt much lighter what a brilliant idea and one that had never occurred to theo but ike the wise old uncle could see it all he continued you may wonder why marcella hasnt mentioned this she has probably given it some thought but your mother is such a zealous advocate for her clients that she often does not see the big picture and she is such a professional that she would never consider giving away the secrets of her clients not even to protect her own son sure theo if your mother thought you might be harmed by someone involved in one of her cases i have no doubt she would do everything possible to protect you but lawyers such as your mother can become so determined to protect their clients that they develop blind spots they dont see what others might see and you have to admit theo this is some pretty outrageous behavior by our mystery kid not exactly the type of behavior that could be anticipated by your mother or anyone else for that matter your mother has handled so many divorces for so many years she probably doesnt think about grudges being carried by the children of her clients do i have a chat with my mother and ask her what whos in the middle of a bad divorce with kids at your school suppose she can think of a couple of cases suppose you narrow the list of suspects somehow not sure exactly but lets say youre able to prove the mystery kid is the real culprit the kid gets arrested for burglarizing the computer store kicked out of school all the bad stuff that he deserves youre off the hook and the kids in big trouble right right there is the possibility your mother could get into some trouble herself her client will not be happy with her because shes responsible in part for the clients kid getting into a serious jam i mean this kid will do time in a detention facility and the finger might be pointed at your mother sure the kids guilty and should be punished but the client will feel as though your mother violated her privacy it puts your mother in a dicey situation you have a plan always did you bring your laptop theo patted his backpack and said right here good lets go online and check the cases filed in family court make a list of all of the current divorce cases in which your mother is the lawyer well go through the most active ones and make a list of those in which there are kids involved kids who go to your school at that point the list should be pretty short theo was already unloading his laptop this is a brilliant idea ike well see the family court clerks docket divided divorces into various categories contesteduncontested activeinactive childrenno children in discoveryawaiting trial after half an hour with theo on his laptop and ike pecking away at his bulky desktop they had a list of twentyone active divorce cases in which marcella boone represented the wife of those three were in the no children category and therefore removed from the list five more were in the uncontested category and ike felt as though these could be eliminated too uncontested divorces were much easier and quicker and did not create the raw feelings that would lead someone to slash tires and throw rocks through windows what does secured mean theo asked as they scanned the records it means trouble for us ike said i had forgotten about the secured docket there are some divorce cases in which the claims of bad conduct are particularly nasty and either party can ask the judge to secure the file which means its locked away and is only available to the attorneys involved nothing is made public it could be our dead end unless of course we have access to your mothers files but lets keep going ike made a list of the clients last names involved in the thirteen cases on their list and theo downloaded the directory of students at strattenburg middle school crosschecking the list shrunk to about half with a possible seven cases involving kids in theos school some names were so common though that they could not be included or excluded there was a smith a johnson a miller and a green looking at the names theo felt somewhat relieved he did not know any of the kids with the last names on the list two years earlier when theo was in the sixth grade a girl named nancy griffin told him his mother had been her mothers lawyer in a recent divorce the divorce was over final and mrs griffin was quite pleased with the work theos mother had done this was the first time theo realized mrs boones job could affect his friends and classmates he later asked his mother about it and demanded to know why she had not informed him mrs boone carefully and sternly explained that lawyers work with certain ethical rules and one of the most important is complete secrecy about a clients business ike scribbled on a legal pad and said so we have a possibility of seven names or seven divorce cases being handled by your mother with the kids in your school recognize anyone not really theres a kid named tony green in the seventh grade but we dont know if hes in the right green family other than that nothing looks familiar lets go back to the secured docket ike said and theo was there a good ten seconds before his uncle there were eight cases under lock and key and identified only by the last name of the wife or husband who had filed the lawsuit for divorce the names of the attorneys were not listed ike said you gotta figure that the divorce were looking for is a nasty one the parents are fighting for custody and our mystery kid prefers to live with his father otherwise he wouldnt be attacking the son of his mothers lawyer make sense i guess for a father to gain custody he must prove the mother is unfit to raise the kids the law always prefers the mother and its rare that the father gets custody i know theo said to prove a mother unfit the father has to come up with all sorts of bad behavior on the part of the mother those cases often end up being protected by the secured docket and for obvious reasons then were out of luck yes unless we could take a peek at your mothers files are you crazy yes theo im crazy been that way for some time now and ill do crazy things to find out whos stalking you harassing you and trying to get you convicted of a serious crime call me crazy but maybe its time to break some rules you got in a fight yesterday and broke a rule but you really had no choice right right i guess im not talking about breaking the law theo it would not be illegal to look at marcellas files might be a bit unethical but were not going to give away sensitive information and it might be the only way to solve this little mystery i dont know ike what type of digital storage system does the firm use its called infobrief a pretty basic system just for storage cataloging and cutting down on paper who has access to it not me my parents dorothy and vince and elsa but my dad and dorothy rarely use it my mom and vince use it as a way to keep everything in order and find stuff without digging through a bunch of paperwork plus it has all the legal research built in can you get a password theo thought about this for a long time if he got the password and gave it to ike then he would be an accomplice to something not a crime maybe but certainly something he would rather avoid he was in enough hot water already the last thing he wanted was his mother yelling at him for violating her clients privacy look ike ill just go to my mom and tell her what i think ill lay out our theory and ask for her help she is my mother you know thats a great idea theo and it makes good sense but dont do it right now lets see if we can crack this case without getting her involved i dont want to ask marcella boone to give me sensitive information about a client is this a long shot ike maybe but its the best theory so far the police are not looking at anyone else because theyre convinced youre the thief they might show up any day now with a warrant to haul you into youth court if we dont find the real criminal soon theo this situation will get much worse do you understand yes believe me i understand listen to me theo a long time ago i was a successful lawyer in strattenburg had an office just down the hall from your mother had lots of clients and life was good then the cops showed up and started asking questions i didnt have all the answers they came back with more questions then more i couldnt believe what was happening and i slowly realized i was headed for trouble but i couldnt stop it once the criminal justice system starts moving against you its hard to stop believe me theo ive been there its a rotten feeling the sky is falling and theres no place to hide it was the first time ike had ever talked about his troubles his past and theo was fascinated he decided to ask the question he had always wanted to ask were you guilty ike ike thought about this and finally said i did some things wrong theo things ill always regret you on the other hand have done nothing wrong and thats why i dont mind breaking a few little rules to protect you lets get to the bottom of this now and get the police off your back okay okay can you get me the password i think so chapter again theo and judge avoided the busy streets as they returned to the law offices of boone amp boone theo was so deep in thought and so thoroughly confused that he ran a stop sign and darted in front of a mail carrier watch it kid the man yelled and theo said sorry over his shoulder judge raced ahead as if he wanted to keep his distance from theo it was lunchtime and elsa and dorothy were eating salads in the kitchen both talking at the same time theo slipped by without being seen his mothers office was empty probably tied up in court he mumbled to himself vinces door was open but he was gone he usually left the building for lunch his desktop was on as always with the screen saver visible the easiest way to borrow the password was to take it from one of the five pcs each lawyer had one plus vince dorothy and elsa if theo really believed he could go so far as borrowing a password then this was the perfect opportunity but he was having a difficult time convincing himself that it was the right thing to do ike was convinced but theo wasnt ike theo knew it was wrong maybe not illegal but certainly wrong the line between right and wrong had always been clear now though nothing was clear the wrongs were piling on top of him it was wrong for someone to break into his locker and plant stolen loot with the obvious goal of getting him in serious trouble it was wrong for someone to stalk him to slash his tires and throw a rock through his window theo had done nothing wrong yet he was now being treated like a criminal the police had the wrong suspect the police were wrong in not believing him and if theo were to be charged by the police another wrong would occur it was wrong for theo to jump into the fight though his father and vince and ike seemed to think it was not so wrong was it wrong for theo to break an office rule and steal a password all in an effort to prevent another much larger wrong could doing something wrong lead to the right result it was all so confusing but theo trusted ike and ike had no doubt that taking the password was the right thing to do theo led judge back to his office and told him to take a nap when the dog was situated theo eased down the hallway and listened for voices dorothy and elsa were talking about recipes no sound from his father upstairswoods boone was known to take his own nap during lunch theo slipped into vinces office closed the door and locked it he sat in vinces chair and careful not to disturb anything on his desk examined his pc the screen saver was a stock photo of a sunset over the ocean theo clicked on main menu then on infobrief a password was demanded so he exited and went to my computer he clicked on desktop then control panel then system and security then passwords vince had a lot of passwords and theo felt like a creep for looking at them passwords for online retail accounts cell phones two dating sites a travel site fantasy football and at least a dozen others at the end of the list was infobrief and theo clicked on it the password avalancheteebone appeared theo quickly wrote it down then exited to main menu he clicked on infobrief entered the password and the screen went blank for five seconds until infobriefboone amp booneaccount code r appeared theo wrote down the code and clicked on enter a long list of case names appeared names such as denise sneiter versus william b sneiter and theo knew he had found his mothers divorce cases he quickly exited returned to the screen saver and stood without touching anything else he took a deep breath and turned the doorknob certain that someone was outside just waiting to pounce on him but the coast was clear and he hurried back to his little office where his dog was still sleeping and everything was safe theo knew that the infobrief account would record an entry at pm friday from vinces computer but he doubted if it would be noticed anytime soon if anyone questioned him he would simply deny everything it was after all friday afternoon and there was a good chance neither vince nor his mother nor anyone else would use infobrief until monday morning and more importantly the systems entry record was not something that was routinely pulled up and examined though his little crime so far seemed perfect theo felt lousy about it he debated whether he would actually give ike the password and code and as the minutes passed he was inclined not to it was one thing to sneak around and lift them from vinces lightly secured computer but it was something far more serious for ike to actually open the files and dig for sensitive information his mother arrived just before pm she had brought lunch and they ate at the conference room table with mr boone the mood was somber and they talked about things other than theos mess as he nibbled on a sandwich he was tempted to bring up the idea that the conspiracy against him could be related to one of his mothers bad divorce cases but ike had told him to wait so he waited theo was in his office plowing through homework and watching the clock move slowly when elsa buzzed him through the phone intercom theo theres someone here to see you she said who is it he asked startled and then afraid the police were back a friend theo hurried to the front of the building standing awkwardly by elsas desk was griff who when last seen the morning before was receiving suspension from mrs gladwell just like theo they walked into the conference room and theo closed the door they sat in the heavy leather chairs and griff looked around the room pretty cool he said is this yours i use it sometimes theo said i have a small office in the back after an awkward pause griff asked did your parents yell at you not too bad what about you they werent too happy im grounded for a month extra work around the house no allowance for two weeks but i guess it couldve been worse sounds pretty bad look theo the reason im here is that my parents want me to apologize for the fight so i apologize no problem theo said i apologize too it was all pretty stupid you know yep pretty stupid baxters got a big mouth and it gets him in trouble baxter apologized too lets forget about it done another pause but griff had something else on his mind look theo the rumor is that the cops think you broke into big macs and stole a bunch of stuff and some of it was found in your locker is that right theo nodded well i find it hard to believe because i dont think you would break into a store at night and steal stuff you know thats not like you tell that to the police i will if you want me to thanks anyway big mac has been telling people in the store that the police have caught the thief theodore boone and that they found three linx tablets in your locker i guess the guys got a big mouth theos shoulders sunk and he looked out a window i guess he does you wanna hear something strange my sister amy is in the tenth grade and she knows a guy named benny hes not a boyfriend or anything like that just a friend this guy benny knows a guy named gordy and according to gordy some guy offered to sell him an tablet for fifty dollars a couple of days ago at school in the parking lot brand new still in the box those things cost four hundred dollars and this guy is trying to sell one for fifty you gotta figure its stolen right right theo said suddenly staring at griff whats his name i dont know but i can probably find out how many of the s were stolen im not sure but i think more than three along with some laptops and cell phones why would someone plant the stuff in your locker and then call the police thats the key question here griff the one were trying to answer look there cant be too many stolen s on the black market out there we need to get the name of the guy whos trying to sell them and the sooner the better can you talk to your sister sure i can please do it griff and hurry griff hustled away and theo returned to his office the suspension was really getting old at his mother gave him permission to leave the office for personal reasons theo said goodbye to judge and sped away on his bike school was out for the day and for the week and other kids were loose on the streets of strattenburg ready to play and enjoy the short break theo was happy that the week was over it had begun monday with a slashed front tire and plunged straight downhill from there he was also worried and for obvious reasons if he didnt find out who was after him and quickly the upcoming week could be even worse major ludwig was waiting in the basement of the vfw building the home of boy scout troop the meeting was scheduled to begin at pm sharp but the major expected his scouts to arrive at least five minutes early he despised tardiness and was known to bark and growl if you showed up late for anything theo arrived at brian and edward two friends from mr mounts homeroom were there along with sam isaac and bart three seventh graders all six scouts had signed on for the aviation merit badge and major ludwig would be their counselor he had flown fighter jets in the marines and now worked parttime as a flight instructor at the city airport at first theo was a little awkward around brian and edward his classmates he wasnt sure if he should feel embarrassed or proud how much gossip was making the rounds at school in his absence plenty he figured the major sensed the unease and wasted no time in discussing his plans this is going to be very exciting he began ive been flying for almost forty years and i have loved every minute of it we are going to study airplanespiston engines turboprops and jets were going to build a model airplane powered by batteries and able to climb to an altitude of two hundred feet this will teach you the principles of flightairspeed lift drag aerodynamicsas well as the control surfacesthe ailerons elevators and rudder you will learn how to read an aeronautical chart and plot a course for a real flight a flight you will make using some really cool simulator software we will visit the airport here in strattenburg look at various airplanes then climb up into the tower and watch the air traffic controller as he directs traffic theres not a lot of traffic here but it will still be interesting to see how a controller handles things then last but not least when youve learned all the basics well go for a real flight with your parents permission ill take you up two at a time in my little cessna well climb to about five thousand feet and ill let you handle the airplane ill keep my hands on the controls at all times but youll get a real good feel for the airplane well do turns climbs and descents well pick a beautiful day so youll have a perfect birdseye view of where we live and the land around us how about it men sound like fun the six boys were in a trance thoroughly engrossed in their upcoming adventure all six nodded eagerly for the moment theo forgot about his problems the major handed out aviation merit badge booklets and outlined the assignment for their meeting next friday then he picked up a large model airplane the same one he used for real instruction and began describing its various parts theo ever the dreamer began thinking of how cool it would be to fly airplanesfighter jets and s what a great lifefirst the adventure of dogfights high above the battlefield then traveling the world as the captain of a luxury commercial airliner he had always wanted to be a lawyer but right now the law had lost some of its appeal being a pilot seemed far more exciting at pm sharp the major said the meeting was over when they gathered for the next meeting he expected all assignments to be in perfect order as the scouts said their goodbyes he waited until they were almost out of the door when he said say theo could i have a word with you sure major theo said the other scouts got on their bikes and left theo and the major stood near the door none of my business the major said but i hear things are not going too well some kind of problem with the police involving a burglary im not being nosy theo im just concerned theo nodded and for a second thought it would be wiser to reveal nothing however with his face plastered all over the internet his name linked to the crime and his guilt already determined it seemed silly acting as though he couldnt talk about it yes sir he said it looks like im the number one suspect so youve met with the police several times in fact theo could not remember how many times they dont believe me and they seem determined to charge me with the crime thats absurd theo i sure think so look theo i do some volunteer work in youth court if a kid in trouble needs a volunteer someone to listen to him and give him advice the court will appoint me to lend a hand the kid has a lawyer of course but you know how busy lawyers are i work with the lawyer to do whats best for the kid my point is that i know both of the youth court judges very well ill be happy to get involved on your behalf if you would like not as a volunteer because you dont need one but as someone who can talk to the judges off the record the idea of accusing you of a burglary is ridiculous theo felt himself getting choked up but managed to say thanks major i know youre innocent theo and ill do everything i can to help thanks theo said trying to hide his emotions chapter the major shook hands with theo gave him a pat on the back and closed the door behind him when theo was outside he walked to his bike and got on it he pushed off felt something strange and realized his front tire was flat a sharp pain hit low in his stomach and theo wasnt sure if it was anger or fear or both he looked around to see if anyone was watching then he stared at the tire and thought about what he should do next nothing came to mind he was so angry and confused his brain was a jumbled mess slowly he got off his bike and looked at the front tire the small gash looked familiar he decided not to bother the major so he began pushing his bike through the parking lot of the vfw and onto the sidewalk the more he walked the clearer he could think how many people knew he would be at a merit badge meeting on friday afternoon at pm he suddenly had five suspectsthe other scouts brian and edward from his homeroom and bart isaac and sam from the seventh grade they had parked their bikes in the same rack theo had parked his and when his departure was delayed by the major there was the splitsecond opportunity for one of them to stick a knife in his front tire the law office was about ten blocks away and theo was tired he called his fathers cell phone and surprisingly he answered woods boone despised his cell phone and usually ignored it dad its me theo said yes theo i can read the words on my little screen here whats up my front tire has been slashed again flat as a pancake it happened outside the vfw while i was meeting with the major where are you on bennington street near fourteenth stay where you are ill be there in ten minutes theo sat on a bus bench with his disabled bike nearby and thought about brian and edward both were nice kids from good families both had lockers very close to theos and neither had a reason to slash his tires throw rocks through his window break into a computer store or plant stolen loot in his locker theo considered both of them to be friends he did not know the seventh graders as well though every scout in the troop got along just fine the major insisted on it sams father was a doctor and his mother was a dentist theo could not imagine him behaving like a hoodlum bart was a straight a student and perhaps the nicest kid in the world of the five the only real suspect could be isaac scheer a quiet kid who seemed moody often troubled and who wore his hair a bit too long and listened to heavy metal the scheer family had issues an older sister had been arrested for drugs the father was usually unemployed and rumored to prefer living off his wifes income most importantly isaac had an older brother in high school since the boone detective team believed the attacks on theo were the work of at least two people isaac and his brother fit in nicely as always though when picking suspects theo was stopped cold by the question of motive why would isaac and his brother or anyone else for that matter go to such trouble to ruin his life it made no sense mr boone arrived in his suv he opened the rear hatch lifted theos bike and shoved it inside on top of his golf clubs judge who had arrived riding shotgun was demoted to the backseat theo sat in the front arms crossed eyes fixed straight ahead as they drove away nothing was said until theo realized they were not headed in the direction of the boone home where are we going dad he asked to the police station okay why because i want the detectives to see firsthand what weve been telling them someone is stalking you and trying to frame you for a crime you did not commit theo liked the idea they parked on the street next to the police station wait here mr boone said and he slammed his door and marched into the building minutes passed as theo talked to judge and explained what was happening judge seemed to be confused detective vorman appeared with mr boone who popped the hatch and slid the bike onto the rear bumper theo got out of the suv and walked around to join the conversation look at this mr boone said firmly as he lifted the front tire and pointed to the hole in the sidewall this is the third one this week vorman looked closer touched the tire and said its definitely a deliberate puncture it certainly is mr boone replied and where did this happen vorman asked outside the vfw same place the rear tire was punctured last tuesday theo said what am i supposed to do with this vorman asked mr boone shoved the bike back into the suv and slammed the hatch youre supposed to realize that whoever is slashing these bike tires and throwing rocks through our office windows is the same person who is trying to frame my son for the burglary thats what youre supposed to do with this youre supposed to realize youre wasting your time investigating and accusing theo of a crime go get him dad theo almost said how can you be so sure these crimes are related vorman asked with his usual sneer i guarantee you theyre related and until you understand that they are youre not going to figure out who broke into the computer store while you waste your time though lay off my son hes not guilty of course hes not but youre the father right vorman said his voice rising his irritation apparent i wish i had a dollar for every mother and father whove sworn to me that their precious loved ones were innocent well handle the investigation mr boone with no help from you and as of now and until we find something to the contrary your son is still the leading suspect all evidence points to him vorman pointed an angry finger at theo then turned and walked away theo felt worse as they drove away and he assumed his father did too gils wheels was closed so they headed home are you playing golf tomorrow mr boone asked sure theo said with no enthusiasm its supposed to rain im sure it will why not end a bad week with a heavy rain and a washedout golf game friday dinner was usually a trip to maloufs a lebanese restaurant with great seafood but neither theo nor his parents were in the mood they were tired from a long and quite unusual week the constant anxiety was taking a toll on their moods for three days now theo had thought of little else but being falsely accused and arrested and maybe sent to a prison facility for kids he knew his parents were far more worried than they appeared the latest tire slashing had rattled their nerves even more after a sandwich and a bowl of soup theo excused himself and went to his room ike had texted him three times during the afternoon wanting to know if theo had obtained the password to the law firms digital file storage system theo had not answered the texts because he could not force himself to violate the firms unwritten rules lifting the password from vinces computer was a dishonest act one that weighed heavy on theo giving the password to ike would only make the guilt worse on the other hand though theo was tired of running and tired of being the target of someones carefully plotted conspiracy it was time to fight back the police seemed determined to nail him the clock was ticking time was against him before long the situation could get worse he called ike who was still at the office its about time ike said irritated did you get the password yes i did but you gotta convince me ike that this is the right thing to do ive already told you that theo were not breaking any laws here were just snooping thats all look at it this way theo you can walk through the offices of boone amp boone and see files everywhere right right its a law office there are files on desks files stacked neatly in cabinets files left behind in the conference room files in open briefcases piles of files waiting to be stored away files files everywhere files now theo have you ever picked up one of these files and flipped through it a slight hesitation then theo said yes of course you have and you didnt break any law you didnt violate any ethical rule because youre not yet a lawyer you were just being nosy thats all just snooping a little thats all were doing here theo snooping some of the law firms files are now stored in a digital vault available to members of the firm for easier access these same files exist in hard folders throughout the firm the same kind of file youve peeked at before i understand that ike but it just doesnt seem right ike breathed heavily into the phone and theo braced for a sharp rebuke instead ike calmly said im trying to help you here theo look at it like this the information were after will be kept between the two of us were not going to share client secrets with anyone the privacy of the clients will not be violated in any way were just trying to solve a mystery and if were able to do so no one will ever know that weve been snooping but if you access the digital vault there will be a record of your entry dont worry about that theo ill use an encrypted code that cannot be traced im a step ahead of you on this im not your typical lowtech geezer theo i didnt say you were and ill bet the entry log is checked about once a year right probably give me the password theo its avalancheteebone spell it theo slowly spelled it then gave him the account code smart move theo ill get to work theo stretched out on his bed and stared at the ceiling ike was a smart man whod once been a brilliant lawyer but he often had strange ideas his theory that theos problems were being caused by one of his mothers nasty divorces was pretty farfetched but at least he had a theory theo was dwelling on isaac scheer and the more he thought about him the less he was convinced the kid could be a real suspect theo texted griff any luck finding the name of the guy selling s he waited for ten minutes then turned off his phone chapter saturday morning theo awoke to the sounds of heavy thunder and raindrops pecking at his window he slowly crawled out of bed and peeked through the curtains water was standing in puddles in the backyard no golf today judge followed him downstairs where his parents were busy in the kitchen cooking pancakes and sausage and talking of course about the weather theo would never understand why adults spent so much time on the subject of the weather they couldnt change it the town was buzzing with the news that pete duffy had been spotted at ohare international airport in chicago he had tried to pay cash for a oneway ticket on a flight to mexico city but was delayed when the clerk noticed something odd about his fake passport the clerk notified her supervisor at that point duffy fled the ticket counter and disappeared into a crowd the fbi identified him by lifting a fingerprint from the passport and by analyzing video footage there was a photo of duffy on the front page of the strattenburg newspaper and he was not recognizable at least in theos opinion he was wearing some type of beret thickframed eyeglasses the makings of a beard and his hair was blond almost white the fbi has this technology that can enhance a photo of a persons face and see things not visible to the naked eye mr boone was explaining as if he knew a great deal about fbi techniques theo was at the table eating pancakes feeding some to judge staring at the blackandwhite photo of pete duffy and giving thanks that the man was back in the news maybe the town would spend a few days rekindling its interest in pete duffy and forget about that other criminaltheo boone i wonder where hes been all week mrs boone asked as she sipped her coffee and read the obituaries working on his new look i guess replied mr boone doing his hair grooming his beard a beret give me a break a guy walking through ohare wearing a beret is bound to attract attention it sure doesnt look like pete duffy theo said its him mr boone said with certainty hes changed his looks got some cash bought him some new papers though they must not be very good and he almost got away id like to get away theo said theo mrs boone said its true mom id like to bolt out of here and go hide someplace things are gonna be okay theo mr boone said oh really how do you figure that i have the cops breathing down my neck ready to haul me into youth court and i have some crazy stalker chasing me all over town with a knife ready to slash my tires again sure dad things are really looking great relax theo youre innocent and you will be proven innocent okay dad heres the question do you think the person who robbed big macs is the same person whos slashing tires throwing rocks and spreading all the garbage on the internet mr boone chewed on a bite of sausage for a few seconds then said i do mom i believe so that makes three of us to me its pretty obvious so why cant we convince the police of this i think we can theo mr boone said theyre still investigating the breakin and burglary i trust the police and i think theyll catch the criminals well i think theyve already decided its me that guy vorman thinks im lying i dont like him he gives me the creeps things will be fine theo mrs boone said patting his arm then theo saw her glance at his father they held each others gaze for a second or so and it was not a look of confidence they were as worried as theo maybe more after breakfast theo and his dad drove to gils wheels for yet another new tire at mr boones request gil disappeared into the rear of his store and found the first two damaged tires he gave them to mr boone who now had a collection of three mr boone paid for numbers two and three and paid the eight dollars theo owed on the first tire gil assured them that there was no epidemic of tire slashings in town in fact he had seen only three the entire week all of which belonged to theo outside the bike shop the rain had stopped but the skies were still cloudy and threatening for a moment theo and his father talked about driving to the golf course and waiting on the weather the course though would be soaked and if it was opened later in the morning there would be a crowd theo knew that a crowded golf course was worse than no course at all they agreed that it was not a good idea ike had texted twice during the morning and wanted to meet back home theo puttered around the house and watched the weather after an hour he announced that he was bored and explained to his parents that ike had invited him for lunch they said yes and theo took off on his bike ike looked worse than usual his eyes were red and puffy with dark circles just below them ive been up all night he said as theo took a chair didnt sleep a wink spent the whole night reading through divorce files and you want to know something theo there are a lot of sad folks out there who need to get divorced ive never been so depressed in my life i dont know how your mother does this kind of work every day of the week wives accuse husbands of all manner of terrible behavior husbands accuse wives of even worse they claw each others eyes out over who gets the house the cars the bank accounts the furniture but man when it comes to who gets the kidsits worse than cage fighting horrible stuff theo theo just sat and listened ike was hyper probably jazzed on coffee and one of his little super juice drinks that guaranteed quick energy he blitzed on so i still like my theory do you sure ike its the best theory yet thank you they slashed my bike tire again yesterday at the vfw ike paused pondered this took a swig of coffee we gotta catch em theo the police do not believe me ike we gotta move fast ike picked up his notepad and flipped some pages i found two cases that we should explore both are nasty divorces from the secured docket which of course means that the court has locked away the files so only the lawyers have access the first case involves mr and mrs rockworth i wont bore you with the details but its safe to say that mr rockworth does not like your mother two children involved huge fight over who should get custody with both parents doing a pretty good job of proving that neither was fit to raise kids after a bitter trial mrs rockworth was given custody and mr rockworth was given liberal visitation rights with the kids both of whom are in counseling the judge ordered mr rockworth to pay eighteen thousand dollars in attorney fees to the firm of boone amp boone do you know anybody named rockworth no how old are the kids the boy is twelve in the seventh grade at the middle school he has an older sister whos fifteen evidently both wanted to live with their father the family has lived here for just a couple of years which explains why you havent heard of them is this your top suspect oh no just a possibility i have a much better prospectthe fighting finns the divorce is far from final with a trial set for next month these people have spent every dime they had trying to prove the other is a bigger creep mrs finn is pretty crazy and has done time in the nuthouse mr finn cant stay sober and tends to gamble too much all kind of bad habits on both ends three children but the eighteenyearold daughter has already left home the other two are twelve and fourteen both boys and they really dont like their mother who of course is represented by your mother tons of bad blood here theo and its safe to say that mr finn and the two boys have an intense dislike for your mother and anybody else named boone this divorce has been going on for over a year and its vicious these people have driven themselves loony what are the boys names jonah finn age twelve seventh grade jessie finn age fourteen ninth grade theo closed his eyes and tried to place the names with faces but he could not dont know them i thought you were a fairly popular kid at school theo do you know anyone im in the eighth grade ike we dont mix too much with the seventh grade nor does the seventh grade mix with the sixth and so on we have different classes different schedules how much do you know about these guys the basics but not much more at least for the younger one jonah the court has appointed a guardian to look out for their best interests and both boys have expressed a strong desire to live with their father their mother through her talented lawyer claims the boys want to live with their father because he lets them do whatever they want including smoking cigarettes and drinking beer can you imagine a seventh grader drinking beer around the house with his dad no i cannot these are probably pretty tough kids right theyve had a rough life moved around a lot changed homes and schools not much stability yes id guess that these two boys are pretty much on their own last year jessie was caught with marijuana and went through youth court he got probation the boys were sent to a foster home three months ago as sort of a safe house until the divorce was over but they kept running away as of now theyre living with their mother who works a night shift at the hospital i doubt if theres much supervision its a mess theo but these two boys are our prime suspects everything fits a twoman team a strong dislike for your mother the motive to take revenge against you the capacity to engage in vandalism and even burglarize a computer store we need to find out more about them i dont suppose my mother is involved in a divorce for a mr and mrs scheer ike looked at his notes flipped a page then said no why just a hunch a kid i know in scouts whos a little different thats all theres no file on them there was a long pause as theo and ike thought about the situation ike gulped coffee while theo stared at the floor finally theo said i need to tell you about my friend griff theo told the story of griffs sister amy and her friend benny and his friend gordy and the episode in which gordy was offered a new linx tablet for fifty dollars by some unknown kid in the high school parking lot ikes red eyes lit up when he heard this this could be huge theo he said what if its jessie finn whos trying to sell the tablet theo asked you gotta make this happen theo but how if we can get our hands on a stolen tablet we take it straight to the police wholl check the registration number if it came from big macs then theyll get off your back and go after these little finn thugs from a rear pocket ike pulled out his wallet opened it and withdrew some cash he counted out two twentydollar bills and a ten heres fifty bucks stick it in your pocket go find griff tell him to talk to his sister make this happen theo theo took the money and stuck it deep in his pocket he sat down again and said but what if it doesnt work what if this gordy guy doesnt want to handle a stolen tablet or what if the dude has already sold it to someone else we wont know until we try do it theo get it done and in the meantime find out all you can about jonah and jessie finn thanks ike and dont worry about the fact that i snooped through your mothers files if it is the finns and if we solve this little mystery ill talk to marcella and woods and take all the blame believe me ive done much worse thanks ike youve already said that now get out of here what about lunch im not hungry im sleepy see you later chapter the showers had stopped but the skies were still threatening theo raced across town to levi park on a bluff above the yancey river on the eastern edge of strattenburg as he pedaled furiously he was hoping the rain had not canceled the farmers market because he was curious about lucy the llama had she attacked buck baloney again had she attacked his sidekick frankie would he theo be forced to make another appearance in animal court to once more save miss petunias beloved pet the market was still open with many of the vendors huddled under tent roofs as their customers roamed about with shopping bags and umbrellas the ground was wet and sticky everyones shoes and boots had at least an inch of mud on the soles lucy was next to miss petunias booth soaking wet but not perturbed at all she looked harmless as two small children stopped and gawked across the way on the other side of the entrance a tiny man in a brown uniform was eating popcorn and talking to a lady who sold corn dogs theo presumed he was frankie buck was nowhere in sight theo said hello to miss petunia who was delighted to see her lawyer she squeezed him and thanked him again for his incredible courtroom heroics and she happily reported that so far that morning lucy had behaved herself as had the two security guards no spitting no chasing nothing out of the ordinary no complaints from anyone next to her booth was one displaying goat cheese the handiwork of may finnemore who was sitting in a folding chair knitting while her spider monkey frog hung from a tent pole that supported the roof over the booth why a spider monkey was named frog had never been adequately explained to theo he had asked april and more than once but her response had been its just my mother theo so much of what may finnemore did made little sense to anyone theo avoided the woman when possible but not today may stood and gave theo an awkward hug she said aprils here where theo asked delighted that he would see her april despised the farmers market and rarely sat with her mother as she peddled her dreadful cheese theo had tasted it a couple of times and felt like vomiting whenever he saw or smelled it she went that way mrs finnemore said pointing at a row of booths thanks theo said and disappeared as quickly as possible keeping a sharp eye out for buck baloney he walked past dozens of vendors most of them in the process of repacking their unsold goods and closing shop april was standing near a tiny booth where an old bearded man was at work sketching in pencil the portrait of a teenage girl who was seated on a small crate in front of him for only ten dollars mr picasso would do your portrait in less than ten minutes he had half a dozen samples on displayelvis john wayne and others theo stopped next to april and said hi hello theo she said with a smile then she turned and drew close for a better look at his face i thought you had a busted lip i did the swellings gone she was disappointed with his wound how was the suspension overrated pretty boring really i actually missed school they began to slowly walk away what are you doing here he asked my mom begged me to come today she said we might need an extra eyewitness in case lucy started spitting at people so far she hasnt felt the urge what are you doing here i came to check on lucy to see if i might be needed in animal court again can we talk in secret sure april was a quiet girl who understood the importance of secrets her family life was a wreck and she often confided in theo who always listened thoughtfully now it was her turn to listen they sat at a small table near an icecream vendor and when theo was certain no one else could hear he told april everything the icecream vendor was closing his booth and needed their table they began walking again slowly ambling toward the front of the market this is awful theo she said i cant believe the police are accusing you i cant either but i guess i look pretty guilty what do your parents think theyre worried and i get the feeling theyre doing a lot of talking when im not around you know how parents are not really you have normal parents theo i do not theo wasnt sure how to respond to this and ike thinks it could be related to a bad divorce yes thats his theory and its a pretty good one nothing else makes sense i sort of know jonah finn you do not well just a little whats the scouting report she thought about this as they walked then said trouble a loner misfit really smart guy who makes bad grades i think his family is about as whackedout as mine how do you know this theres a guy in his class rodney tapscott who lives across the street from me and he and jonah hang out some do you know rodney i know who he is but i dont really know him doesnt he play the drums he tries to we can hear him across the street can you talk to him about what about jonah finn i need to find out all i can about this kid right now hes my only suspect and i need information ill see what i can do and april this is top secret i cant get caught snooping around and we cant accuse anybody of anything this is a long shot you understand got it theo other than april the two friends theo believed he could trust the most were woody lambert and chase whipple claiming the three needed to use a rainy saturday afternoon to begin work on an upcoming project in chemistry theo convinced his two friends to meet and make plans the truth was that chase was the last person in the world theo would partner with in a chemistry lab chase was a brilliant mad scientist with a long record of experiments gone haywire he had started fires and set off explosions and no lab was safe when chase was at work he had been banned from the labs at school unless a teacher was nearby for close surveillance woody was indifferent to math and science but did well in history and government they met in the basement game room of the whipple home and after half an hour of pingpong they got down to business of course first they had to replay the fight chase who had never struck another person in anger had witnessed the entire brawl and had been thrilled with the excitement woody reported that his mother yelled at him then started crying his father just shrugged and said boys will be boys theo swore them to secrecy he even made them raise their right hands and promise to tell nothing and when he was satisfied they could be trusted he told them the entire story everything the slashed tires broken window vandalized locker planted loot meetings with the detectives everything then he got around to ike and his research though theo did not confess to lifting the password from vinces computer he described how ike had gone through the law firms divorce files and identified a probable suspect or suspects thats brilliant woody said it makes sense chase added the guy behind all of this is somebody who hates you and you dont even realize it theo agreed and then talked about the finn boys and their parents ugly divorce my brother is in the tenth grade woody said i wonder if he knows jessie finn we gotta find out theo said thats our project right nowto find out all we can about these two guys chase left to go upstairs and get his laptop woody pulled out his cell phone and called his brother tony but got voice mail theo called griff who reported he had made no progress in getting the name of the ninth grader who was trying to sell black market tablets for fifty dollars griff promised to keep trying mrs whipple who was also a lawyer and close friend of mrs boone brought down a platter of cookies and a carton of milk she asked how the chemistry project was going and all three claimed to be excited with their progress after she left chase went to the website of strattenburg high school and after a few minutes of browsing said there are three hundred and twenty ninth graders at shs guess how many are named jessie four woody said three theo said two chase answered jessie finn and jessie neumeyer we need to get the name from griff im trying theo said griff woody hissed im going to punch that kid out next time i catch him off campus i cant believe he jumped on me like that what a little twerp knock it off theo said as of now griff is on our side besides he apologized so did baxter baxter hasnt apologized to me id like to see his eye right now probably blackandblue chase went to google earth and typed in the finns address on edgecomb street near the college he zoomed in and said heres their house theo and woody huddled behind chase and all three looked at the screen the finn home was a twostory white frame on a street lined with several just like it there was nothing different or remarkable about it in the backyard there was a small aboveground pool and along the back fence there was a storage shed the information was nice to have but of no real value theos cell phone vibrated in his pocket he yanked it out opened it looked at the screen and said its griff griff told theo that his sister had finally made contact with benny and benny had called gordy and gordy had reluctantly said that the guy peddling the tablets was named jessie somebody didnt know his last name and really didnt know much about him griff assured theo that his sister had not revealed the reason for her interest theo again stressed the need for secrecy now were getting somewhere woody said why dont we go to the police chase asked they can talk to both jessies in the ninth grade and find out which one is trying to sell the stuff its too early theo said suppose its jessie finn when the cops approach him whats he gonna do admit hes got a stash of stolen computers and cell phones fall on his knees and confess everything no way hell just deny it all and if the cops cant find any of the loot in his backpack they cant do anything hell get scared and well never find the stuff theos right woody added we have to buy it from him then we give it to the police and they check the registration numbers how are we going to buy it chase asked thats the big question theo said first we start with gordy if hell agree to help us then he can hook up with jessie finn and buy the tablet i dont know this gordy guy woody said but i doubt if hes that stupid why would anyone get involved in this mess we cant really expect him to buy a tablet he knows is stolen and then hand it over to us when were taking it straight to the police he wont get into trouble theo said not if hes helping solve a crime i dont think so woody said i agree with woody chase said what about tony your brother theo asked are you sure he wont get into trouble im positive if he helps the police find stolen goods theyll thank him and pat him on the back i happen to know the law remember how could we ever forget chase said well as you know tony will do anything hes an idiot and loves to meddle in everybody elses business thats a great idea theo but where do we get fifty bucks ive already got it theo said woody looked at chase who said why am i not surprised call him again theo said and woody pulled out his cell phone he smiled as it was ringing then said hey tony its me they talked for a few minutes and woody did not mention their idea of getting tony involved woody explained that they needed some inside dirt on a ninth grader named jessie finn tony did not know him but said he would start digging for half an hour the gang of three kicked around ideas of how to nail the finn boys who by now were guilty beyond any doubt chase found their photos from a student directory and printed enlarged copies of their faces theo stared at the two certain he had never seen them before jessie finn had a facebook page jonah did not and chase scanned it but found nothing that would interest them or help in their search for clues woody who was sprawled on the sofa playing catch with a pingpong ball remembered a story you know this makes perfect sense i have two cousins who live near baltimore and last year their parents went through a nasty divorce it was awful i remember my two cousins saying bad things about their fathers divorce lawyer they really hated the guy and i guess he was just doing his job does your mother worry about such things theo im sure she does but she never talks about it its her job chase observed the son of a lawyer chapter sunday morning theo sat in church between his parents and tried to listen to the sermon being delivered by the reverend judd koker but it was a challenge in a cruel twist the message was on the evils of thievery of stealing and theo felt as though he might be the target he had caught a few stares before the service began and almost bolted from the sanctuary when mrs phyllis thornberry happened by their pew and let it slip that they were praying for theo mrs thornberry was an ancient member of the church and a terrible gossip and theos parents somehow resisted the urge to inform her that theo was fine save your prayers for those who are truly in need theo liked reverend koker because he was young and energetic and his sermons were sprinkled with humor and mercifully short the old dude before him pastor pat as he was known had led the church for thirty years and was an awful preacher in theos opinion his sermons were long and dull and could force even the most devout worshipper into a nearcomalike trance in a matter of minutes koker though knew the art of the short sermon and so far in his brief ministry at the church he had been well received the point of his sermon was that there are various ways in which we steal and all of them are wrong in gods eyes the eighth commandment proclaimed by moses was thou shall not steal which of course means it is wrong to take something that belongs to another person koker was expanding on this though to include other forms of theft stealing time away from god family friends stealing the gift of good health by pursing bad habits stealing from the future by missing opportunities in the present and so on it was pretty confusing theo glazed over fairly quickly and began thinking about the finn boys and specifically how he and his little gang might get their hands on some of the stolen goods the finns were perhaps trying to sell theo knew quite well that the first thing his father would say when they were in the car was theo how did you like the sermon for that reason and none other theo tried desperately to pay attention theo glanced around and realized he wasnt the only one drifting away it was not a good sermon his mind began to wander again he asked himself how all of these fine people seated around him would react if cute little teddy boone got arrested and hauled into court and what would they think if he couldnt come to church anymore because he was locked away in a juvenile detention center it was too awful to think about theo again tried to concentrate on the sermon but his mind was racing he began to fidget and his mother squeezed his knee he looked at his watch but it seemed to have stopped cold it was the second sunday of the month and this caused an unpleasant mood in the boone family second sunday meant that theo and his parents would not leave church and go directly home where they would lunch on sandwiches read the sunday newspapers watch a game on television take naps and in general observe a day of rest no sir second sunday had evolved into a ritual so dreadful that theo and his parents were having sharp words the boones and three other families had established a tradition of rotating brunch on the second sunday of each month which meant that theo would be required to suffer through a long meal at a long table with a bunch of adults and listen to them talk about things in which he had little interest theo was a late child and this meant that he was by far the youngest person invited to second sunday the oldest person was a retired judge named kermit lusk who was also an elder in their church and a man of great wisdom and humor he was pushing eighty as was his wife and their children were long gone the rotation had brought the brunch to the lusk home a cramped and cluttered old house in bad need of a good sandblasting at least in theos opinion his opinions though were not worth much during these insufferable meals in the car mr boone said as he did every sunday so theo how did you like the sermon it was boring and you know it theo shot back already mad again i fell asleep twice it was not one of his better efforts mrs boone agreed they rode in silence to the lusk home the tension rising the closer they got when they parked at the curb theo said ill just stay in the car im not hungry lets go theo his father said sternly theo slammed the door and followed his parents inside he hated these brunches and his parents knew it fortunately theo could sense some weakness on the part of his mother perhaps a twinge of sympathy she knew how miserable he was and she understood why inside theo managed a fake metallic smile as he said hello to mr and mrs garbowski a pleasant couple about the same age as theos parents whose sixteenyearold son phil threatened to run away from home if his parents forced him to go to brunch on second sundays the garbowskis caved in and phil was still at home theo admired him greatly and was pondering the same strategy he said hello to mr and mrs salmon he owned a lumber company and she taught at the college they had three children all older than theo and none present just great theo mumbled to himself eight adults and me since nothing can make one hungrier than sitting in church and waiting for lunch the group soon took their seats around the diningroom table judge lusk gave a quick prayer of thanks and a housekeeper appeared with the first course a salad a dry salad theo noted dressing wasnt expensive was it where was the dressing but he dove in starved what did you think of the sermon judge lusk asked since all four families attended the same church the sermon was usually analyzed first great thought theo bad enough to suffer through it live and in color now i get tortured again regardless of how bad a sermon might have been no one over brunch ever suggested that it was anything short of brilliant even pastor pat had received rave reviews though there had been some remarks like perhaps he couldve shaved off fifteen minutes the second course was baked chicken and gravy and it was delicious theo using perfect table manners because his mother was always watching dug in and ate like a refugee in her old age mrs lusk had stopped cooking and this had been well received her housekeeper was an excellent cook the garbowskis would host the next second sunday then the boones theos mother made no pretense of preparing a fine meal and always had it catered by a turkish woman who fixed amazing dishes much to theos delight the conversation turned to pete duffy and his adventures of the past week this sparked lively comments around the table as everyone wanted to rush in with their opinions and reports of the latest rumors the verdict was unanimouseveryone was convinced duffy had murdered his wifeand his flight from justice was further proof of his guilt mr salmon claimed to know pete well and was of the opinion that he had stashed away plenty of cash and would probably never be found judge lusk disagreed and argued that duffys close call at the airport in chicago was proof that he would make another mistake sooner or later theo ate in silence and listened with interest the conversation was usually about politics and what was happening in washington but this was far more interesting then he had a miserable thought would these people one day soon be talking about him had any of these people ever been charged with a crime he had serious doubts about that were the boones and their son already the topic of hushed conversations behind their backs he cleaned his plate and waited on dessert what he was really waiting on was two oclock the magic moment when it was time to go late sunday afternoon theo rode his bike across town and met april at an icecream parlor near stratten college april got a frozen yogurt and theo got his favoritechocolate gelato covered in crushed oreos and they found a booth away from the other customers i talked to rodney tapscott she said in a low voice i went over to his house last night and watched television theo took a large bite and said okay im listening well without sounding suspicious i managed to get around to jonah finn rodney knows that you and i are close friends so i was careful not to seem too nosy rodney said that jonah is a weird kid whos been acting even stranger since his parents are divorcing says hes real moody even angry jonah doesnt have many friends he bums money off of rodney and other kids to buy lunch his grades are getting worse the kids a wreck he said that one day they were talking and jonah said something about how much he dislikes your mother i asked why was that rodney said its because their father blames your mother for most of their problems said that shes trying to make jonah and his brother live with their mother and they rea lly dont want to i kinda figured that theo said glancing around he said jonahs father says bad things about your mother all the moneys going for legal fees and on top of that your mother is trying to get jonahs father to pay too much in child support and alimony rodney asked me if youre a good guy and of course i said yes thanks dont mention it heres the interesting part rodneys never seen jonah with a cell phone seventh graders are not supposed to have them at school anyway but last week he thinks it was thursday while they were on lunch break jonah showed him a new excell smartphone he said his father bought it for him rodney thought it was odd because the guy never has a dime the store was broken into tuesday night theo said ignoring his gelato thats right do you know what was stolen just what was in the newspaper some laptops tablets cell phones and a few other items excell smartphones i have no idea the police do not release that type of information it gets better on friday they were in the library and jonah was studying in a cubicle one of those on the second floor by the computer lab he was at a desk all hunched over as if he was trying to hide whatever he was doing rodney saw him and was curious he managed to ease behind him and he saw jonah playing a video game on an eightinch screen tablet the linx has an eightinch screen exactly and theres no way jonah can afford one theo took a small bite but could taste nothing we have to get that tablet somehow any ideas no not right now do you think rodney would help i doubt it hes not the type of kid wholl rat out a friend he likes jonah says hes strange and all but he also feels sorry for the kid i didnt seem too interested in all of this because i didnt want to appear too eager this is good stuff april cant you just go to the police and tell them maybe i dont know let me think about it they discussed various plans none of which seemed to work as they were leaving theo thanked her again april said she would do anything to help legal or otherwise theo headed home but suddenly changed direction and went to see ike chapter pursuant to instructions from mrs gladwell theo arrived at her office at sharp on monday morning he sat across from her desk as she flipped through a file she had yet to smile as if still ticked off about the fight how was your weekend she asked without the slightest hint of real interest okay i guess theo said he was not there to talk about his weekend they had other business his weekend had been fairly lousy and he now realized that his life would not return to normal until his good name was cleared he was still the accused which was a dark cloud hanging over his head lets change the entry code to your locker she said this was why she wanted to meet early before classes started do you have a new code yes maam its lawyer she wrote it down then compared it to the other codes i guess this will work theo cleared his throat and said mrs gladwell i would like to say again how sorry i am for what happened last thursday you know the fight and all i broke the rules and i apologize i expect better behavior out of you theo im really disappointed and i want you to avoid any more trouble i will she closed the file and managed a slight smile did you talk to the police over the weekend she asked no maam have they finished their investigation i dont think so as far as i know they havent caught the right people do they still suspect you theo as of last friday i was their main suspect she shook her head in disbelief theo thought about ikes advice readjusted himself in the chair cleared his throat emitted an uh and gave the clear impression that what he was about to say was not easy mrs gladwell if you knew a student here a seventh grader had a cell phone on campus what would you do she leaned back in her chair and chewed the end of her pen well i would talk to his or her homeroom teacher ask her to approach the student and if he or she had a phone then we would confiscate it the normal punishment is a halfday suspension in school why do you ask this theo just curious no youre not just curious you know a seventh grader who brings a cell phone to school dont you theo maybe she stared at him for a long time then began to figure it out could this cell phone be stolen she asked theo nodded and said could be not sure but it could be i see and could this stolen phone be linked to the breakin at big macs last week theo nodded slightly and said could be i dont know for sure and im not accusing anyone of the theft the breakin is one thing theo and its really none of my business the police are in charge of that but the possession of a cell phone by a seventh grader is a violation of the rules here on my turf lets deal with that first theo stared at her but said nothing another long pause mrs gladwell waited and waited she finally looked at her watch and said okay if you want me to help you give me the name if not its monday morning and i have a thousand things to do i feel like a snitch theo said first of all theo he or she will never know you told me second and much more important youre the prime suspect in a crime that someone else committed if i were you i would do everything i could to find the real criminal now give me the name or go to homeroom trying to appear reluctant theo said jonah finn ike had said he had no choice but to deliver the criminal the bell rang for first period and mr krauthammer dismissed his seventhgrade homeroom as the boys were filing out of the room he took a few steps toward the desks placed his hands on the shoulder of jonah finn and said could i see you a minute when the room was empty mr krauthammer closed the door and said did i see you with a cell phone in the hall about ten minutes ago he in fact did not but this was part of the strategy no jonah snapped he took a step back and looked thoroughly guilty whats in your pockets mr krauthammer asked stepping toward him jonah reluctantly removed a cell phone and handed it over a halfday suspension would not bother him he had seen worse mr krauthammer looked at the phone an excell smartphone and said very nice come with me after a brief meeting with mrs gladwell jonah was taken to a small study room in the library where he would be confined for the next four hours under the watchful eyes of mrs dunleavy the librarian his books were placed on a study table as if he were expected to plow through some extra homework as part of his punishment instead jonah put his head on the table and promptly went to sleep mrs gladwell called detective vorman and gave him the registration number of the cell phone at strattenburg high school second period ended at and was followed by a twentyminute break tony lambert woodys brother tracked jessie finn from a distance and watched as he left the main building and walked into the large open courtyard where many of the students killed time on break and during lunch jessie sat by himself at a picnic table and was about to check his cell phone when tony came out of nowhere hey man i hear you got some tablets for a good price tony said glancing around as if a drug deal was in process jessie eyed him suspiciously and said who are you tony lambert tenth grade he replied shoving a hand forward jessie shook it reluctantly and asked oh yeah where did you hear that word gets around how much are you asking for what for an i got fifty bucks who told you i was selling something come on jessie word gets around i really want that tablet i dont have anything man ive already sold it can you get another one maybe but the price has gone up seventyfive bucks i can get seventyfive when can you get the tablet here tomorrow same time same place you got it they shook hands and tony left he walked inside the main building and sent a text to woody no deal maybe tomorrow theos monday morning had been uneventful during homeroom mr mount made a big deal out of welcoming him and woody back to school and there were some smart comments from his classmates most though seemed to be proud of their two buddies for not being afraid to take a stand in first period spanish madame monique asked theo how he was doing and seemed a little too concerned about him he brushed it off and said everything was fine in second period geometry mrs garman acted as though nothing had happened which suited theo just fine during the morning break april informed theo that rodney had passed along the news that jonah finn had been in homeroom but then disappeared rodney did not know where he was while jonah was napping in the library study room detective vorman arrived at the school and met with mrs gladwell the two of them casually walked to a row of seventhgrade lockers not far from theos and she punched in the code for jonahs inside they found the usual assortment of textbooks notebooks supplies and junk hidden in a threering binder were two brandnew linx tablets they took them back to her office where detective vorman using rubber gloves removed the back panels and wrote down the registration numbers they then returned to jonahs locker and carefully replaced the tablets in the threering binder detective vorman thanked mrs gladwell left the school and went to his desk at the police station where he checked the registration numbers against the list from big macs system not surprisingly they matched he reported his findings to detective hamilton and they decided to get a search warrant for the finn home vorman filled in the blanks of a standard affidavit a sworn written statement and set forth the details of what he had found he also included a statement that the subjects brother jessie finn had allegedly attempted to sell a linx tablet to a classmate the previous week once the affidavit was completed and signed by detective vorman he prepared a twopage search warrant in which he described the area he wished to searchthe finn home and its outbuildings with his paperwork done he walked four blocks down main street to the courthouse and left the affidavit and search warrant with the secretary for judge daniel showalter youth court division the secretary informed him that the judge was in the middle of a hearing and it might be two hours before he could review the affidavit and search warrant detective vorman walked back to his office confident he had solved another crime though a rather small one he would have preferred to spend his time chasing drug dealers and serious criminals chapter at monday afternoon detective vorman arrived at the school and went to mrs gladwells office he waited as she walked to a classroom on the second floor and pulled jonah finn out of last period study hall jonah who had already endured a halfday suspension mumbled whats the matter now as he followed her from the room just follow me she said and the two walked without a word back to her office they waited in the reception area by miss glorias desk as the last bell rang and the students rushed out of the building during the chaos of dismissal jonah and mrs gladwell stepped into her office and closed the door vorman stood flashed a badge and said are you jonah finn he replied yes he looked at mrs gladwell for help have a seat vorman said id like to ask you some questions is something wrong maybe jonah sat down and put his backpack in his lap he was obviously frightened and not sure what to do or say vorman sat on the edge of the desk and looked down at jonah it was not a fair fight a tough cop in a dark suit and a frightful scowl glaring down at a scared skinny kid with bangs in his eyes vorman knew exactly where the conversation was going jonah wasnt so sure the detective began were investigating a burglary that happened last week at a computer store downtown big macs systems and i just have a few routine questions thats all jonah took a deep breath almost gasped and dropped his head he stared at the floor his mouth open in shock vorman had never seen a guiltier face that cell phone you got busted with this morning where did you get it uh i bought it vorman opened his notepad licked his pen and asked okay whod you buy it from uh some guy named randy vorman scribbled on his notepad and asked how much did you pay for it uh fifty dollars the phone was stolen from big macs did you know it was stolen when you bought it no sir i swear whats randys last name uh im not sure do you know where he lives where i can find him and go talk to him no sir okay so this mysterious guy randy just pops up and offers to sell you a brandnew smartphone for fifty bucks one thats valued at three hundred and you dont think it might be stolen no sir thats not too smart on your part is it i guess not are you lying to me no sir if you lie to me jonah things will only get much worse im not lying i think you are jonah shook his head his bangs flopping in his eyes vorman had spent years questioning tough criminals men who could tell great lies with sincere faces this kid was nowhere close to being believable the thief or thieves who broke into big macs also took some tablets and laptops did randy offer to sell you a brandnew tablet or laptop no sir have you ever seen a linx tablet jonah shook his head his eyes still watching the floor you know the school has the right to inspect your backpack and your locker vorman said moving in for the kill do you understand that i guess good lets take a look inside your backpack what are you looking for jonah asked more stolen goods vorman reached for the backpack jonah clutched it for a second then let go vorman placed it on mrs gladwells desk and slowly unzipped it he removed textbooks notebooks a video game magazine and then a tablet a linx he held it up examined it and said jonah you lied to me where did this come from jonah leaned forward and placed both elbows on both knees his head hanging low vorman pressed on jonah where did you get this did your brother give it to you no response okay lets go have a look inside your locker at about the same time a mile away at the high school detective hamilton introduced himself to jessie finn they were in the principals office a few minutes after the final bell jessies backpack was on the desk unopened id like to ask you a few questions hamilton began with a friendly smile the principal mr trussel was sitting at his desk watching about what jessie asked with a sneer he had been through the youth court system once and didnt like cops or judges or even lawyers for that matter do you have a brother named jonah thats an easy question then answer it yes thought so we have jonah in custody right now caught him with a stolen excell smartphone and three linx s one in his backpack the other two still in boxes in his locker any idea where he got them jessie flinched though he tried to seem unmoved the color drained from his face and it was pale he shook his head no didnt think so hamilton said we checked the registration numbers and we know where they came from do you jessie no well jessie at this moment your little brother is one scared boy hes talking singing like a bird and he says that breaking into big macs was all your idea says he didnt want to do it but you pressured him because you needed some help in hauling away all of the laptops cell phones and tablets what do you think about that jessie hes not a very tough kid is he i mean hes your brother and he began ratting on you before we could even put the handcuffs on him handcuffs jessie said with a dry husky voice his face confused and scared yep and ive got a pair for you too just hang on your little brother says that you two broke into the store through a back window last tuesday night and took about a dozen cell phones six fifteeninch laptops and ten linx tablets says you guys were in the store less than five minutes because you had scoped out the place and knew where things were plus you knew how to dodge the security cameras any of this ring a bell jessie i dont know what youre talking about oh i think you do can i look inside your backpack go right ahead jessie said and shoved it at him hamilton unzipped it and slowly removed books notebooks a water bottle a couple of magazines nothing that appeared to be stolen hamilton shrugged and stuffed all of it back into the backpack lets go take a look at your locker you cant do that jessie said oh really why not its a violation of my privacy not so fast jessie mr trussel said as he lifted a piece of paper this is a locker rental agreement you signed for the academic year we dont require our students to use a locker but when they choose to do so they must sign this agreement this clearly states that you must submit to a search of your locker when asked to do so by the school or the police lets go said detective hamilton back at the middle school detective vorman and mrs gladwell returned to her office along with jonah who looked as though he was ready to cry on her desk were the same two tablets she and vorman had taken from jonahs locker earlier in the day vorman said we have your brother in custody over at the high school and hes saying it was your idea to plant the three linx tablets in the locker of theodore boone hes saying you hacked into the schools files got the entry number and placed the tablets there last wednesday morning in an effort to frame theo for the crime true or false jessie said that oh yes and plenty more right now hes sitting in a small room at the high school in handcuffs telling the entire story pretty sad if you ask me to rat out your little brother like this but thats what happens when you do stupid things with an accomplice i dont believe it i dont care what you believe son youre in more trouble than you can possibly imagine youre looking at breaking and entering felony theft stalking conspiracy vandalism your brother even says you slashed theos bike tires and tossed the rock through his office window no he did that jonah blurted then caught himself he held his breath as he stared at the detective who just smiled in the heat of the battle the kid had made a crucial admission vorman looked at mrs gladwell both smiled the mystery had been solved back at the high school the contents of jessies locker were stacked neatly on the floor of the hallway detective hamilton wearing surgical gloves gently removed the last itemstwo linx tablets gee i wonder where these came from he said with a smile jonah said we would probably find them here let me guess jessie you have no idea how these shiny new things made their way into your locker right jessie said nothing they stepped into an empty classroom and mr trussel closed the door sit there hamilton barked at jessie as he pointed to a desk jessie did as he was told there was no fight left in him what i want at this point hamilton said as he hovered over jessie as if he might begin slapping him at any second is the rest of the stolen goods where are they i dont know what youre talking about jessie said feebly his hands were clenched together on the desk and he stared at them hamilton reached into a pocket and pulled out some papers youre a real smart kid arent you jessie so tell me what is a search warrant jessie shook his head you dont know maybe youre not that bright after all jessie shook his head a search warrant allows the police to go into your house and search every room every drawer cabinet closet box bag every pile of junk in the attic and every piece of old furniture in the garage it allows us to turn your house upside down looking for the rest of the stuff you and your little brother stole from big macs hamilton dropped his search warrant on the desk and it landed on jessies arms he made no effort to read it is your mother at home jessie hamilton asked shes asleep she works the night shift at the hospital well lets go wake her up chapter linda finn was sound asleep in her bedroom on the ground floor of her home at about pm monday afternoon when the doorbell rang and jarred her awake she never got enough sleep she worked from pm to am four days a week and occasionally on weekends for extra money such a weird schedule disrupted normal sleep patterns and kept her tired and often when she should have been sleeping she was wide awake worrying about her bruising divorce her worthless husband and his hardnosed lawyer and her two boys and the bad direction in which they seemed to be headed linda had plenty to worry about the doorbell would not stop ringing so she pulled on an old bathrobe and walked to the front door in her bare feet she opened the door staring at her was detective vorman with jonah and behind them were two police officers in full uniform beyond them at the curb were two police cars with lights and all the usual decorative painting and decals there was an unmarked car in the driveway she put her hand over her mouth and almost fainted then she managed to open the storm door and said what is it vorman flashed his badge and said detective scott vorman strattenburg police may i come in what is it jonah she asked horrified jonah looked at his shoes we need to talk vorman said opening the storm door wider she backed away clutching her bathrobe to make sure she was decent vorman followed jonah inside and closed the door behind them in the driveway detective hamilton sat in his car with jessie in the passengers seat are we going in jessie asked maybe hamilton replied the two uniformed officers loitered in the front yard smoking cigarettes across the street a few neighbors were on their porches watching with curiosity inside vorman found a seat in an old chair with holes in the fabric linda and jonah sat on a sofa with battered cushions ill get to the point mrs finn a computer store on main street was broken into last tuesday night the thieves took some laptops cell phones and tablets about twenty thousand dollars worth of stuff our prime suspects are jonah and jessie she jerked around and glared at jonah who was still fascinated by his shoes vorman went on weve searched their lockers and backpacks and so far weve recovered five of the tablets and one cell phone we suspect the rest of the stuff might be hidden somewhere in this house so we have a search warrant signed by a judge that allows us to look everywhere everywhere linda gasped immediately thinking of the stacks of unwashed dishes in the kitchen sink the piles of dirty laundry in the basement the unmade beds the undusted furniture and shelves the filthy bathrooms the litter in the hallway the halfempty glasses and cups in the den and all of this was only the downstairs the upstairs where the boys lived and she was afraid to go looked worse than a landfill thats right vorman said as he pulled out the search warrant and handed it to her she just gawked at it and shook her head every room every closet every drawer vorman said cranking up the pressure vorman knew no woman would want the police or anyone else poking through their house is this true jonah she asked her eyes suddenly wet jonah refused to speak yes its true vorman said jessie has pretty much confessed to everything but he will not tell us where the rest of the stolen goods are so we have no choice but to take the house apart and see if the stuff is here is it here jonah she demanded he glanced at her another guilty look at this point its important to cooperate vorman said helpfully the judge will take it into consideration if its here tell them she said angrily to jonah theres no sense in making the police dig through our home after a long pause vorman said look i dont have all afternoon and all night im going to call for some extra men and well start by digging through the boys bedrooms tell me jonah mrs finn growled jonah crossed his arms bit his bottom lip and finally said in the crawl space above the garage sitting in the unmarked car jessie watched with horror as the policemen walked out of the garage with armloads of laptops tablets and cell phones well well i guess they found everything hamilton said stay here he got out of the car to go have a look jessie wiped a tear off his cheek linda finn quickly got dressed and followed the police downtown jessie was riding in the car in front of her jonah was with detective vorman in another car she cried all the way asking herselfhow could this happen what had she done wrong as a mother what would they do with her boys how would this affect her divorce and her battle to win custody of jonah and jessie would custody be an issue if they were sent away a hundred questions raced through her mind as the little caravan moved through the streets of strattenburg at the police station they gathered in a small room in the basement and for the first time since that morning jonah and jessie were facetoface jessie looked as though he wanted to punch his little brother jonah was thinking what a rat his big brother was but they could say nothing detective hamilton took charge by saying this crime has been solved and you boys are in some serious trouble no sense in beating around the bush youre not going home tonight and you may not be home for quite a while linda started crying again after a few sobs she managed to ask where are you taking them theres a juvenile detention center down the street they will appear in youth court the day after tomorrow and the judge will decide what to do with them at that point a formal hearing will be held in about a month any questions a thousand questions but none spoken detective hamilton said im going to ask detective vorman to explain your miranda rights listen carefully vorman slid across two sheets of paper one for each boy these are the same number one you have the right to remain silent number two anything you say in this meeting may be used against you in court number three you have the right to an attorney and if you cant afford one the court will provide you with one just like on television jessie said the wise guy you got it vorman said any questions okay sign those forms at the bottom mrs finn as their mother you sign just under their names the finns reluctantly signed their names vorman collected the sheets of paper hamilton looked at jonah and jessie and said ive been through this a thousand times and i can promise you that the most important thing you can do right now to help yourselves is to cooperate youre guilty we know youre guilty we can prove youre guilty so none of this pointing fingers at everybody else the judge the same guy who decides if youre gonna be sent away to juvenile detention and for how long will ask me in court if you boys cooperated if i say yes he likes that if i say no then he frowns and doesnt like that understand i want a lawyer jessie said we can sure get you one hamilton shot back scott take him to jail vorman jumped to his feet snapped a pair of handcuffs off his belt grabbed jessie by the neck pulled him up and cuffed his hands behind his back he opened the door and was about to take him away when linda slapped the table and said wait a minute i want the truth i want you two boys to tell me the truth sit down jessie sit down right here and tell me what happened vorman released jessie who was stunned at the speed with which he got himself handcuffed carefully he sat on the edge of his chair his hands still cuffed behind his back when everyone took a deep breath jonah said we did it because we needed the money chapter theo was in the middle of his homework when his fathers voice came across the office phone intercom hey theo yes sir could you please step into the conference room sure both parents were there and his mother had been crying whats the matter theo asked we have some good news his father said then why is mom crying im not crying theo she said not now his father said i just talked to detective vorman theyve arrested two boys brothers jonah and jessie finn for the breakin at big macs the police found most of the stolen goods in the boys home their mother is my client theo mrs boone said sadly no kidding theo thought but said nothing mr boone continued the boys have confessed to everything including their little campaign of terror against you seems they were carrying a pretty substantial grudge because of the divorce im so sorry theo mrs boone said i should have realized this theo took a deep breath and smiled and thought about ike his crazy uncle had solved the mystery long before anyone else had a clue this is great theo said the flat tires the rock the internet stuff everything everything his father said the break came when someone at school reported that the younger boy the seventh grader had a cell phone in his pocket as you know thats against the rules and the cell phone turned out to be one that was stolen from the store one thing led to another more stolen goods were found in the boys lockers and then the police got a search warrant theo felt as though someone was reading secrets hed written about himself he managed to smile and nod happily along and he wasnt really faking it theo was delighted this little nightmare was over whats gonna happen to them he asked that will be determined in youth court mrs boone said the older one jessie has a record and i suspect hell be sent away jonah will probably get probation what does this do to you and your client their mother theo asked i cant represent her theo ill withdraw tomorrow as her lawyer her boys attacked you because of me and i should have realized it im so sorry please mom you had no idea its the right thing to do theo mr boone added we may have to appear in youth court and talk about what these two guys did your mother cannot represent mrs finn when we may have to testify against her sons i know its sticky but theres no other choice theo shrugged secretly delighted that all finns would be gone from boone amp boone theo was thrilled his parents were relieved even judge looked happier its monday theo said im going to run over and see ike bob dylan was playing softly on the stereo ike was smoking a pipe and a cloud of blue fog hung over the room theo had sent ike a dozen text messages throughout the day to keep him posted his last one read finns arrested full confessions whoopee congratulations ike theo said as he dropped the fifty dollars on ikes insanely cluttered desk you did it ike grinned because it was not the right moment for modesty what can i say im a genius beautiful ike just beautiful what kind of mood is marcella in not too good shes blaming herself she should have realized theo marcella is too smart not to have suspected something from one of her cases dont blame her ike she feels lousy enough okay but if i thought about it then she should have thought about it too agreed are we going to tell her about snooping through her files ike kicked back and put his feet onto his desk knocking off a few files in the process you know theo ive been thinking about that now is not the time to come clean so when dont know let some time pass everybodys kinda edgy right now your parents have been worried sick let things cool down and then well discuss the matter just the two of us id feel better if we told my parents everything maybe you would maybe you wouldnt look theo honesty is a great virtue you should always strive to be honest and trustworthy and if your mother asked you tonight if you stole the password gave it to me and thus allowed me access to her divorce files you would say yes that would be the honest thing to do right right but she doesnt know and she may never know therefore is it dishonest not to tell her it feels dishonest youre thirteen years old have you told your mother every bad thing youve gotten away with in your life no of course not no one does theo we all have our little secrets and as long as theyre harmless who really cares with time the secrets often go away and things dont matter anymore what if someone checks the entry record to the firms infobrief and sees that it was accessed offsite well if you are confronted then you tell the truth and ill step in tell the truth too and take all the blame you cant take all the blame ike because i stole the password under the circumstances it was the right thing to do ill have a little chat with your parents and explain that i insisted on looking at the files well fight and all that but weve been fighting for a long time sometimes you gotta fight theo remember i guess but i still dont feel good about it lets do this theo lets not mention this issue again for one full month im writing this down one month from today well discuss it again theo thought about it for a moment then reluctantly said okay theo knew though that it was not okay and he knew it would bug him until he told his mother everything mom says youre invited to dinner tonight at robilios tell her i said thanks i need to go i dont know what to say ike youre the greatest not the greatest theo but maybe in the top five theo bounded down the steps hopped on his bike and headed for the office he pedaled furiously as he flew down the street everything seemed lighterthe air the mood the bike theodore boone no longer the accused
