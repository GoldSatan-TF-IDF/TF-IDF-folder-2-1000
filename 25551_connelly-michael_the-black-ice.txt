michael connelly the black ice the second book in the harry bosch series this is for linda mccaleb connelly the smoke carried up from the cahuenga pass and flattened beneath a layer of cool crossing air from where harry bosch watched the smoke looked like a gray anvil rising up the pass the late afternoon sun gave the gray a pinkish tint at its highest point tapering down to deep black at its root which was a brushfire moving up the hillside on the east side of the cut he switched his scanner to the los angeles county mutual aid frequency and listened as firefighter battalion chiefs reported to a command post that nine houses were already gone on one street and those on the next street were in the path the fire was moving toward the open hillsides of griffith park where it might make a run for hours before being controlled harry could hear the desperation in the voices of the men on the scanner bosch watched the squadron of helicopters like dragonflies from this distance dodging in and out of the smoke dropping their payloads of water and pink fire retardant on burning homes and trees it reminded him of the dustoffs in vietnam the noise the uncertain bobbing and weaving of the overburdened craft he saw the water crushing through flaming roofs and steam immediately rising he looked away from the fire and down into the dried brush that carpeted the hillside and surrounded the pylons that held his own home to the hillside on the west side of the pass he saw daisies and wildflowers in the chaparral below but not the coyote he had seen in recent weeks hunting in the arroyo below his house he had thrown down pieces of chicken to the scavenger on occasion but the animal never accepted the food while bosch watched only after bosch went back in off the porch would the animal creep out and take the offerings harry had christened the coyotetimido sometimes late at night he heard the coyotes howl echoing up the pass he looked back out at the fire just as there was a loud explosion and a concentrated ball of black smoke rotated up within the gray anvil there was excited chatter on the scanner and a battalion chief reported that a propane tank from a barbecue had ignited harry watched the darker smoke dissipate in the larger cloud and then switched the scanner back to the lapd tactical frequencies he was on call christmas duty he listened for a half minute but heard nothing other than routine radio traffic it appeared to be a quiet christmas in hollywood he looked at his watch and took the scanner inside he pulled the pan out of the oven and slid his christmas dinner a roasted breast of chicken onto a plate next he took the lid off a pot of steamed rice and peas and dumped a large portion onto the plate he took his meal out to the table in the dining room where there was already a glass of red wine waiting next to the three cards that had come in the mail earlier in the week but that he had left unopened he had coltranes arrangement of song of the underground railroad on the cd player as he ate and drank he opened the cards studied them briefly and thought of their senders this was the ritual of a man who was alone he knew but it didnt bother him hed spent many christmases alone the first card was from a former partner who had retired on book and movie money and moved to ensenada it said what anderson s cards always said harry when you coming down the next one was also from mexico from the guide harry had spent six weeks living and fishing and practicing spanish with the previous summer in bahia san felipe bosch had been recovering from a bullet wound in the shoulder the sun and sea air helped him mend in his holiday greeting written in spanish jorge barrera also invited boschs return the last card bosch opened slowly and carefully also knowing who it was from before seeing the signature it was postmarked tehachapi and so he knew it was handprinted on offwhite paper from the prisons recycling mill and the nativity scene was slightly smeared it was from a woman he had spent one night with but thought about on more nights than he could remember she too wanted him to visit but they both knew he never would he sipped some wine and lit a cigarette coltrane was now into the live recording of spiritual captured at the village vanguard in new york when harry was just a kid but then the radio scannerstill playing softly on a table next to the televisioncaught his attention police scanners had played for so long as the background music of his life that he could ignore the chatter concentrate on the sound of a saxophone and still pick up the words and codes that were unusual what he heard was a voice saying onektwelve staff two needs your twenty bosch got up and walked over to the scanner as if looking at it would make its broadcast more clear he waited ten seconds for a reply to the request twenty seconds staff two location is the hideaway western south of franklin room seven uh staff two should bring a mask bosch waited for more but that was it the location given western and franklin was within hollywood divisions boundaries onektwelve was a radio designation for a homicide detective out of the downtown headquarters parker center the robberyhomicide division and staff two was the designation for an assistant chief of police there were only three acs in the department and bosch was unsure which one was staff two but it didnt matter the question was what would one of the highestranking men in the department be rolling out for on christmas night the second question bothered harry even more if rhd was already on the call why hadnt hethe oncall detective in hollywood divisionbeen notified first he went to the kitchen dumped his plate in the sink dialed the station on wilcox and asked for the watch commander a lieutenant named kleinman picked up bosch didnt know him he was new a transfer out of foothill division whats going on bosch asked im hearing on the scanner about a body at western and franklin and nobodys told me a thing and thats funny cause im on call out today dont worry bout it kleinman said the hats have got it all squared away kleinman must be an oldtimer bosch figured he hadnt heard that expression in years members of rhd wore straw bowlers in the s in the fifties it was gray fedoras hats went out of style after thatuniformed officers called rhd detectives suits now not hatsbut not homicide special cops they still thought they were the tops up there high like a cats ass bosch hated that arrogance even when hed been one of them one good thing about working hollywood the citys sewer nobody had any airs it was police work plain and simple whats the call bosch asked kleinman hesitated a few seconds and then said weve got a body in a motel room on franklin its looking suicide but rhd is going to take iti mean theyve already taken it were out of it thats from on high bosch bosch said nothing he thought a moment rhd coming out on a christmas suicide it didnt make muchthen it flashed to him calexico moore how old is this thing he asked i heard them tell staff two to bring a mask its ripe they said itd be a real potato head problem is there isnt much head left looks like he smoked both barrels of a shotgun at least thats what im picking up on the rhd freek boschs scanner did not pick up the rhd frequency that was why he had not heard any of the early radio traffic on the call the suits had apparently switched freeks only to notify staff twos driver of the address if not for that bosch would not have heard about the call until the following morning when he came into the station this angered him but he kept his voice steady he wanted to get what he could from kleinman its moore isnt it looks like it kleinman said his shield is on the bureau there wallet but like i said nobodys going to make a visual id from the body so nothing is for sure how did this all go down look bosch im busy here you know what i mean this doesnt concern you rhd has it no youre wrong man it does concern me i shouldve gotten first call from you i want to know how it went down so i understand why i didnt awright bosch it went like this we get a call out from the owner of the dump says hes got a stiff in the bathroom of room seven we send a unit out and they call back and say yeah we got the stiff but they called back on a land lineno radiocause they saw the badge and the wallet on the bureau and knew it was moore or at least thought it was him well see anyway i called captain grupa at home and he called the ac the hats were called in and you were not thats the way it goes so if you have a beef its with grupa or maybe the ac not me im clean bosch didnt say anything he knew that sometimes when he was quiet the person he needed information from would eventually fill the silence its out of our hands now kleinman said shit the tv andtimes are out theredaily news they figure its moore like everybody else its a big mess youd think the fire up on the hill would be enough to keep them occupied no way theyre out there lined up on western i gotta send another car over for media control so bosch you should be happy you arent involved its christmas for chrissake but that wasnt good enough bosch should have been called and then it should have been his decision when to call out rhd someone had taken him out of the process altogether and that still burned him he said goodbye and lit another cigarette he got his gun out of the cabinet above the sink and hooked it to the belt on his blue jeans then he put on a lighttan sport coat over the army green sweater he was wearing it was dark outside now and through the sliding glass door he could see the fire line across the pass it burned brightly on the black silhouette of the hill it was a crooked devils grin moving to the crest from out in the darkness below his house he heard the coyote howling at the rising moon or the fire or maybe just at himself for being alone and in the dark bosch drove down out of the hills into hollywood traveling mostly on deserted streets until he reached the boulevard on the sidewalks there were the usual groupings of runaways and transients there were strolling prostituteshe saw one with a red santa hat on business is business even on christmas night there were elegantly made up women sitting on bus benches who were not really women and not really waiting for buses the tinsel and chistmas lights strung across the boulevard at each intersection added a surreal touch to the neon glitz and grime like a whore with too much makeup he thoughtif there was such a thing but it wasnt the scene that depressed bosch it was cal moore bosch had been expecting this for nearly a week since the moment he heard that moore had failed to show up for roll call for most of the cops at hollywood division it wasnt a question of whether moore was dead it was just a question of how long before his body turned up moore had been a sergeant heading up the divisions street narcotics unit it was a night job and his unit worked the boulevard exclusively it was known in the division that moore had separated from his wife and replaced her with whiskey bosch had found that out firsthand the one time he had spent time with the narc he had also learned that there might be something more than just marital problems and early burnout plaguing him moore had spoken obliquely of internal affairs and a personnel investigation it all added up to a heavy dose of christmas depression as soon as bosch heard they were starting a search for cal moore he knew the man was dead and so did everyone else in the department though nobody said this out loud not even the media said it at first the department tried to handle it quietly discreet questions at moore s apartment in los feliz a few helicopter runs over the nearby hills in griffith park but then a tv reporter was tipped and all the other stations and the newspapers followed the story for the ride the media dutifully reported on the progress of the search for the missing cop moore s photograph was pinned to the bulletin board in the parker center press room and the weight of the department made the standard pleas to the public it was drama or at least it was good video horseback searches air searches the police chief holding up the photo of the darkly handsome and seriouslooking sergeant but nobody said they were looking for a dead man bosch stopped the car for the light at vine and watched a man wearing a sandwich board cross the street his stride was quick and jerky and his knees continuously popped the cardboard sign up in the air bosch saw there was a satellite photograph of mars pasted on the board with a large section of it circled written in large letters below was repent the face of the lord watches us bosch had seen the same photograph on the cover of a tabloid while standing in line at a lucky store but the tabloid had claimed that the face was that of elvis the light changed and he continued on toward western he thought of moore outside of one evening spent drinking with him at a jazz bar near the boulevard he had not had much interaction with moore when bosch had been transferred to hollywood division from rhd the year before there had been hesitant handshakes and gladtoknowyous from everyone in the division but people generally kept their distance it was understandable since he had been rolled out of rhd on an iad beef and bosch didnt mind moore was one of those who didnt go out of his way to do much more than nod when they passed in the hall or saw each other at staff meetings which was also understandable since the homicide table where bosch worked was in the firstfloor detective bureau and moore s squad the hollywood bangshort for boulevard antinarcotics groupwas on the second floor of the station still there had been the one encounter for bosch it had been a meeting to pick up some background information for a case he was working for moore it had been an opportunity to have many beers and many whiskeys moores bang squad had the kind of slick mediagrabbing name the department favored but in reality was just five cops working out of a converted storage room and roaming hollywood boulevard at night dragging in anybody with a joint or better in his pocket bang was a numbers squad created to make as many arrests as possible in order to help justify requests for more manpower equipment and most of all overtime in the following years budget it did not matter that the das office handed out probation deals on most of the cases and kicked the rest what mattered were those arrest statistics and if channel or or a times reporter from the westside insert wanted to ride along one night and do a story on the bang squad all the better there were numbers squads in every division at western bosch turned north and ahead he could see the flashing blue and yellow lights of the patrol cars and the lightningbright strobes of tv cameras in hollywood such a display usually signaled the violent end of a life or the premiere of a movie but bosch knew nothing premiered in this part of town except thirteenyearold hookers bosch pulled to the curb a half block from the hideaway and lit a cigarette some things about hollywood never changed they just came up with new names for them the place had been a rundown dump thirty years ago when it was called the el rio it was a rundown dump now bosch had never been there but he had grown up in hollywood and remembered he had stayed in enough places like it with his mother when she was still alive the hideaway was a sera courtyard motel that during the day would be nicely shaded by a large banyan tree which stood in its center at night the motels fourteen rooms receded into a darkness only the glow of red neon invaded harry noticed that thee in the sign announcing monthly rates was out when he was a boy and the hideaway was the el rio the area was already in decay but there wasnt as much neon and the buildings if not the people looked fresher less grim there had been a streamline moderne office building that looked like an ocean liner docked next to the motel it had set sail a long time ago and another minimall was there now looking at the hideaway from his parked car harry knew it was a sorry place to stay the night a sorrier place to die he got out and headed over yellow crime scene tape was strung across the mouth of the courtyard and was manned by uniformed officers at one end of the tape bright lights from tv cameras focused on a group of men in suits the one with the gleaming shaven scalp was doing all the talking as bosch approached he realized that the lights were blinding them they could not see past the interviewers he quickly showed his badge to one of the uniforms signed his name on the crime scene attendance log the cop held on a clipboard and slipped under the tape the door to room was open and light from inside spilled out the sound of an electric harp also wafted from the room and that told bosch that art donovan had caught the case the crime scene tech always brought a portable radio with him and it was always tuned to the wave a newage music channel donovan said the music brought a soothing calm to a scene where people had killed or been killed harry walked through the door holding a handkerchief over his mouth and nose it didnt help the odor that was like no other assaulted him as soon as he passed the threshold he saw donovan on his knees dusting fingerprint powder onto the dials of the airconditioner unit in the wall below the rooms front and only window cheers donovan said he was wearing a painters mask to guard against the odor and the intake of the black powder in the bathroom bosch took a look around quickly since it was likely he would be told to leave as soon as the suits discovered him the rooms queensized bed was made with a faded pink coverlet there was a single chair with a newspaper on it bosch walked over and noted that it was the times dated six days earlier there was a bureau and mirror combination to the side of the bed on top of it was an ashtray with a single butt pressed into it after being half smoked there was also a special in a nylon boot holster a wallet and a badge case these last three had been dusted with the black fingerprint powder there was no note on the bureauthe place harry wouldve expected it to be no note he said more to himself than donovan nope nothing in the bathroom either have a look that is if you dont mind losing your christmas dinner harry looked down the short hallway that went to the rear off the left side of the bed the bathroom door was on the right and he felt reluctance as he approached he believed there wasnt a cop alive who hadnt thought at least once of turning his own hand cold he stopped at the threshold the body sat on the dingy white floor tile its back propped against the tub the first thing to register on bosch was the boots gray snakeskins with bulldog heels moore had worn them the night they had met for drinks one boot was still on the right foot and he could see the manufacturers symbol ans like a snake on the worn rubber heel the left boot was off and stood upright next to the wall the exposed foot which was in a sock had been wrapped in a plastic evidence bag the sock had once been white bosch guessed but now it was grayish and the limb was slightly bloated on the floor next to the door jamb was a twentygauge shotgun with sidebyside barrels the stock was splintered along the bottom edge a fourinchlong sliver of wood lay on the tile and had been circled with a blue crayon by donovan or one of the detectives bosch had no time to deliberate on these facts he just tried to take it all in he raised his eyes the length of the body moore was wearing jeans and a sweatshirt his hands were dropped at his sides his skin was gray wax the fingers thick with putrefaction the forearms bulging like popeyes bosch saw a misshapen tattoo on the right arm a devils grinning face below a halo the body was slumped back against the tub and it almost appeared that moore had rolled his head back as if to dip it into the tub maybe to wash his hair but bosch realized it only looked that way because most of the head was simply not there it had been destroyed by the force of the doublebarrel blast the light blue tiles that enclosed the tub area were awash in dried blood the brown drip trails all went down into the tub some of the tiles were cracked where shotgun pellets had struck bosch felt the presence of someone behind him he turned into the stare of assistant chief irvin irving irving was wearing no mask and holding no rag to his mouth and nose evening chief irving nodded and said what brings you here detective bosch had seen enough to be able to put together what had happened he stepped away from the threshold moved around irving and walked toward the front door irving followed they passed two men from the medical examiners office who were wearing matching blue jumpsuits outside the room harry threw his handkerchief into a trash can brought to the scene by the cops he lit a cigarette and noticed that irving was carrying a manila file in his hand i picked it up on my scanner bosch said thought id come out since im supposed to be on call tonight its my division its supposed to be my call yes well when it was established who was in the room i decided to move the case to robberyhomicide division immediately captain grupa contacted me i made the decision so its already been established thats moore in there not quite he held up the manila file i ran by records and pulled his prints they will be the final factor of course there is also the dentalif there is enough left but all other appearances lead to that conclusion whoevers in there checked in under the name rodrigo moya which was the alias moore used in bang and theres a mustang parked behind the motel that was rented under that name at the moment i dont think there is much doubt here among the collective investigative team bosch nodded he had dealt with irving before when the older man was a deputy chief in command of the internal affairs division now he was an ac one of the top three men in the department and his purview had been extended to include iad narcotics intelligence and investigation and all detective services harry momentarily debated whether he should risk pushing the point about not getting the first call i should have been called he said anyway its my case you took it away before i even had it well detective it was mine to take and give away wouldnt you agree there is no need to get upset call it streamlining you know robberyhomicide handles all officer deaths you would have had to pass it to them eventually this saves time there is no ulterior motive here other than expediency thats the body of an officer in there we owe it to him and his family no matter what the circumstances of his death are to move quickly and professionally bosch nodded again and looked around he saw an rhd detective named sheehan in a doorway below themonthly rat s sign near the front of the motel he was questioning a man of about sixty who was wearing a sleeveless tshirt despite the evening chill and chewing a sodden cigar stump the manager did you know him irving asked moore no not really i mean yes i knew him we worked the same division so we knew each other he was on night shift mostly working the streets we didnt have much contact bosch did not know why in that moment he decided to lie he wondered if irving had read it in his voice he changed the subject so its suicideis that what you told the reporters i did not tell the reporters a thing i talked to them yes but i said nothing about the identity of the body in this room and will not until it is officially confirmed you and i can stand here and say we are pretty sure that is calexico moore in there but i wont give that to them until weve done every test dotted everyi on the death certificate he slapped the manila file hard on his thigh this is why i pulled his personnel file to expedite the prints will go with the body to the medical examiner irving looked back toward the door of the motel room but you were inside detective bosch you tell me bosch thought a moment is this guy interested or is he just pulling my chain this was the first time he had dealt with irving outside of the adversarial situation of an internal affairs investigation he decided to take a chance looks like he sits down on the floor by the tub takes off his boot and pulls both triggers with his toe i mean i assume it was both barrels judging by the damage he pulls the triggers with his toe the recoil throws the shotgun into the door jamb splintering off a piece of the stock his head goes the other way onto the wall and into the tub suicide there you go irving said now i can tell detective sheehan that you concur just as if you had gotten the first callout no reason for anybody to feel left out thats not the point chief what is the point detective that you cant go along to get along that you do not accept the command decisions of this department i am losing my patience with you detective something i had hoped would never happen to me again irving was standing too close to bosch his wintergreen breath puffing right in his face it made bosch feel pinned down by the man and he wondered if it was done on purpose he stepped back and said but no note no note yet we still have some things to check bosch wondered what moore s apartment and office would have been checked when he first turned up missing same with his wifes home what was left could moore have mailed a note to somebody it would have arrived by now when did it happen hopefully well get an idea from the autopsy tomorrow morning but i am guessing he did it shortly after he checked in six days ago in his first interview the manager said moore checked in six days ago and hadnt been seen outside the room since this jibes with the condition of the room the condition of the body the date on the newspaper the autopsy was tomorrow morning that told bosch that irving had this one greased it usually took three days to get an autopsy done and the christmas holiday would back things up even further irving seemed to know what he was thinking the acting chief medical examiner has agreed to do it tomorrow morning i explained there would be speculation in the media that would not be fair to the mans wife or the department she agreed to cooperate after all the acting chief wants to become the permanent chief she knows the value of cooperation bosch didnt say anything so we will know then but nobody the manager included saw sergeant moore after he checked in six days ago he left specific instructions that he was absolutely not to be disturbed i think he went ahead and did it shortly after checking in so why didnt they find him sooner he paid for a month in advance he demanded no disturbances a place like this they dont offer daily maid service anyway the manager thought he was a drunk who was either going to go on a binge or try to dry out either way a place like this the manager cant be choosey a month thats he took the money and they made good on their promise not to go to room seven until today when the managers wife noticed that mr moyas carthe mustanghad been broken into last night that and of course they were curious they knocked on his door to tell him but he didnt answer they used a passkey the smell told them what was happening as soon as they opened the door irving said that mooremoya had set the airconditioner on its highest and coldest level to slow decomposition and keep the odor contained in the room wet towels had been laid across the floor at the bottom of the front door to further seal the room nobody heard the shot bosch asked not that we found the managers wife is nearly deaf and he says he didnt hear anything they live in the last room on the other side weve got stores on one side an office building on the other they all close at night alley behind we are going through the registry and will try to track other guests that were here the first few days moore was but the manager says he never rented the rooms on either side of moore s he figured moore might get loud if he was detoxing cold turkey and detective it is a busy streetbus stop right out front it could have been that nobody heard a thing or if they heard it didnt know what it was after some thought bosch said i dont get renting the place for a month i mean why if the guy was going to off himself why try to hide it for so long why not do it and let them find your body end of story thats a tough one irving said near as i can figure it he wanted to cut his wife a break bosch raised his eyebrows he didnt get it they were separated irving said maybe he didnt want to put this on her during the holidays so he tried to hold up the news a couple weeks maybe a month that seemed pretty thin to bosch but he had no better explanation just then he could think of nothing else to ask at that moment irving changed the subject signaling that boschs visit to the crime scene was over so detective how is the shoulder its fine i heard you went down to mexico to polish your spanish while you mended bosch didnt reply he wasnt interested in this banter he wanted to tell irving that he didnt buy the scene even with all the evidence and explanations that had been gathered but he couldnt say why and until he could he would be better off keeping quiet irving was saying i have never thought that enough of our officersthe nonlatins of coursemake a good enough effort to learn the second language of this city i want to see the whole depart got a note donovan called from the room irving broke away from bosch without another word and headed to the door sheehan followed him into the room along with a suit bosch recognized as an internal affairs detective named john chastain harry hesitated a moment before following them in one of the me techs was standing in the hallway near the bathroom door with the others gathered around him bosch wished he hadnt thrown away his handkerchief he kept the cigarette in his mouth and breathed in deeply right rear pocket the tech said theres putrefaction but you can make it out it was folded over twice so the inside surface is pretty clean irving backed out of the hallway holding a plastic evidence bag up and looking at the small piece of paper inside it the others crowded around him except for bosch the paper was gray like moore s skin bosch thought he could see one line of blue writing on the paper irving looked over at him as if seeing him for the first time bosch you will have to go harry wanted to ask what the note said but knew he would be rejected he saw a satisfied smirk on chastains face at the yellow tape he stopped to light another cigarette he heard the clicking of high heels and turned to see one of the reporters a blonde he recognized from channel coming at him with a wireless microphone in her hand and a models phoney smile on her face she moved in on him in a wellpracticed and quick maneuver but before she could speak harry said no comment im not on the case cant you just no comment the smile dropped off her face as quick as a guillotines blade she turned away angrily but within a moment her heels were clicking sharply again as she moved with her cameraman into position for the ashot the one her report would lead with the body was coming out the strobes flared and the six cameramen formed a gauntlet the two medical examiners men pushing the covered body on a gurney passed through it on the way to the waiting blue van harry noticed that a grimfaced irving walking stoically erect trailed behindbut not far enough behind to be left out of the video frame after all any appearance on the nightly news was better than none especially for a man with an eye on the chiefs office after that the crime scene began to break up everybody was leaving the reporters cops everybody bosch ducked under the yellow tape and was looking around for donovan or sheehan when irving came up on him detective on second thought there is something i need you to do that will help expedite matters detective sheehan has to finish securing the scene here but i want to beat the media to moore s wife can you handle nextofkin notification of course nothing is definite but i want his wife to know what is happening bosch had made such a show of indignation earlier he couldnt back away now he wanted part of the case he got it give me the address he said a few minutes later irving was gone and the uniforms were pulling down the yellow tape bosch saw donovan heading to his van carrying the shotgun which was wrapped in plastic and several smaller evidence bags harry used the vans bumper to tie his shoe while donovan stowed the evidence bags in a wooden box that had once carried napa valley wine what do you want harry i just found out you werent supposed to be here that was before this is now i just got put on the case i got nextofkin duty some case to be put on yeah well you take what they give what did he say who moore look harry this is look donnie irving gave me next of kin i think that cuts me in i just want to know what he said i knew this guy okay it wont go anywhere else donovan exhaled heavily reached into the box and began sorting through the evidence bags really didnt say much at all nothing that profound he turned on a flashlight and put the beam on the bag with the note in it just one line i found out who i was the address irving had given him was in canyon country nearly an hours drive north of hollywood bosch took the hollywood freeway north then connected with the golden state and took it through the dark cleft of the santa susanna mountains traffic was sparse most people were inside their homes eating roasted turkey and dressing he guessed bosch thought of cal moore and what he did and what he left behind i found out who i was bosch had no clue to what the dead cop had meant by the one line scratched on a small piece of paper and placed in the back pocket harrys single experience with moore was all he had to go on and what was that a couple of hours drinking beer and whiskey with a morose and cynical cop there was no way to know what had happened in the meantime to know how the shell that protected him had corroded he thought back on his meeting with moore it had been only a few weeks before and it had been business but moore s problems managed to come up they met on a tuesday night at the catalina bar amp grill moore was working but the catalina was just a half block south of the boulevard harry was waiting at the bar in the back corner they never charged cops the cover moore slid onto the next stool and ordered a shot and a henrys the same as bosch had on the bar in front of him he was wearing jeans and a sweatshirt that hung loose over his belt standard undercover attire and he looked at home in it the thighs of the jeans were worn gray the sleeves of the sweatshirt were cut off and peeking from below the frayed fringe of the right arm was the face of a devil tattooed in blue ink moore was handsome in a rugged way but he was at least three days past needing a shave and he had a look about him an unsteadinesslike a hostage released after long captivity and torment in the catalina crowd he stood out like a garbage man at a wedding harry noticed that the narc hooked gray snakeskin boots on the side rungs of the stool they were bulldoggers the boots favored by rodeo ropers because the heels angled forward to give better traction when taking down a roped calf harry knew street narcs called them dustbusters because they served the same purpose when they were taking down a suspect high on angel dust they smoked and drank and smalltalked at first trying to establish connections and boundaries bosch noticed that the name calexico truly represented moore s mixed heritage dark complexioned with hair black as ink thin hips and wide shoulders moores dark ethnic image was contradicted by his eyes they were the eyes of a california surfer green like antifreeze and there was not a trace of mexico in his voice theres a border town named calexico right across from mexicali ever been there i was born there thats how come i got the name ive never been dont worry you havent missed much just a border town like all the rest i still go on down every now and then family nah not anymore moore signaled the bartender for another round then lit a cigarette off the one he had smoked down to the filter i thought you had something to ask about he said yeah i do i gotta case the drinks arrived and moore threw his shot back in one smooth movement he had ordered another before the bartender had finished writing on the tab bosch began to outline his case he had caught it a few weeks earlier and so far had gotten nowhere the body of a thirtyyearold male later identified through fingerprints as james kappalanni of oahu hawaii was dumped beneath the hollywood freeway crossing over gower street he had been strangled with an eighteeninch length of baling wire with wooden dowels at the ends the better to grip the wire with after it had been wrapped around somebodys neck very neat and efficient job kappallanis face was the bluish gray color of an oyster the blue hawaiian the acting chief medical examiner had called him when she did the autopsy by then bosch knew through ncic and doj computer runs that in life he had also been known as jimmy kapps and that he had a drug record that printed out about as long as the wire somebody had used to take his life so it wasnt too big a surprise when the me cut him open and found fortytwo rubbers in his gut bosch said what was in them this hawaiian shit called glass a derivative of ice i am told i remember when ice was a fad a few years back anyway this jimmy kapps was a courier he was carrying this glass inside his stomach had probably just gotten off the plane from honolulu when he walks into the baling wire i hear this glass is expensive stuff and the market for it is extremely competitive i guess im looking for some background maybe shake an idea loose here cause ive got nothing on this no ideas on who did jimmy kapps who told you about glass major narcs downtown not much help nobody really knows shit thats why they tell you about black ice a little thats the competition they said comes from the mexicans thats about all they said moore looked around for the bartender who was down at the other end of the bar and seemed to be purposely ignoring them its all relatively new he said basically black ice and glass are the same thing same results glass comes from hawaii and black ice comes from mexico the drug of the twentyfirst century i guess youd call it if i was a salesman id say it covers all the demographics basically somebody took coke heroin and pcp and rocked em all up together a powerful little rock its supposed to do everything its got a crack high but the heroin also gives it legs im talking about hours not minutes then its got just a pinch of dust the pcp to give it a kick toward the end of the ride man once it really takes hold on the streets they get a major market going then shit forget about it therell be nothing but a bunch of zombies walking around bosch said nothing much of this he already knew but moore was going good and he didnt want to knock him off track with a question he lit a cigarette and waited started in hawaii moore said oahu they were making ice over there just plain ice they called it thats rocking up pcp and coke very profitable then it evolved they added heroin good stuff too asian white now they call it glass i guess that was their motto or something smooth as glass but in this business there is no lock on anything there is only price and profit he held up both hands to signify the importance of these two factors the hawaiians had a good thing but they had trouble getting it to the mainland you got boats and you got planes and these can be regulated to a good degree or at least to some degree i mean they can be checked and watched so they end up with couriers like this kapps who swallow the shit and fly it over but even that is harder than it seems first of all you got a limited quantity that you can move what fortytwo balloons in this guy what was that about a hundred grams thats not much for the trouble plus you got the dea they got people in the planes airports theyre looking for people like kapps they call them rubber smugglers theyve got a whole shakedown profile you know a list of what to look for people sweating but with dry lips licking their lipsthe antidiarrhetic does that that kaopectate shit the rubber smugglers swig that shit like its pepsi it gives them away anyway what i am saying is that the mexicans got it a whole helluva lot easier geography is on their side they have boats and planes and they also have a twothousandmile border that is almost nonexistent as a form of control and interdiction they say the feds stop one pound of coke for every ten that gets by them well when it comes to black ice they arent even getting an ounce at the border i know of not one single black ice bust at the border he paused to light a cigarette bosch saw a tremor in his hand as he held the match what the mexicans did was steal the recipe they started replicating glass only theyre using homegrown brown heroin including the tar thats the pasty shit at the bottom of the cooking barrel lot of impurities in it turns it black thats how they come up with calling it black ice they make it cheaper they move it cheaper and they sell it cheaper theyve bout put the hawaiians out of the business and its their own fucking product moore seemed to conclude there harry asked have you heard anything about the mexicans taking down the hawaiian couriers maybe trying to corner the market that way not up here at least see you gotta remember the mexicans make the shit but they aint the ones necessarily selling it on the street youre talking several levels removed when you get down to the street but they still have to be calling the shots true thats true so who put down jimmy kapps got me bosch this is the first ive heard about it your team ever make any arrests of black ice dealers shake anybody down a few but youre talking about the lowest rungs on the ladder white boys rock dealers on the boulevard are usually white boys its easier for them to do business now that doesnt mean it isnt mexicans givin it to them it also doesnt mean it aint southcentral gangs givin it so the arrests weve made probably wouldnt help you any he banged his empty beer mug on the bar until the bartender looked up and was signaled for another round moore seemed to be getting morose and bosch hadnt gotten much help from him i need to go further up the ladder can you get me anything i dont have shit on this and its three weeks old ive got to come up with something or drop it and move on moore was looking straight ahead at the bottles that lined the rear wall of the bar look ill see what i can do he said but you gotta remember we dont spend time on black ice coke and dust some reefer thats what we deal in day in and day out not the exotics were a numbers squad man but ive got a connection at dea ill talk to him bosch looked at his watch it was near midnight and he wanted to go he watched moore light a cigarette though he still had one burning in the crowded ashtray harry still had a full beer and shot in front of him but stood up and began digging in his pockets for money thanks man he said see what you can do and let me know sure moore said after a beat he said hey bosch what i know about you you know whats been said around the station i know youve been in the bucket i wonder did you ever come up against an iad suit name of chastain bosch thought a moment john chastain was one of the best in iad complaints were classified at the end as sustained unsustained or unfounded he was known as sustained chastain ive heard of him he said hes a three runs one of the tables yeah i know hes a detective third grade shit everybody knows that what i mean is did he is he one of them that came after you no it was always somebody else moore nodded he reached over and took the shot that had been in front of bosch he emptied it then said chastain from what youve heard do you think he is good at what he does or is he just another suit with a shine on his ass i guess it depends on what you mean by good but no i dont think any of them are good job like that they cant be but give em the chance any one of them will burn you down and bag your ashes bosch was torn between wanting to ask what was going on and not wanting to step into it moore said nothing he was giving bosch the choice harry decided to keep out of it he said if theyve got a hardon for you there isnt much you can do call the union and get a lawyer do what he says and dont give the suits anything you dont have to moore nodded silently once more harry put down two twentydollar bills that he hoped would cover the tab and still leave something for the bartender then he walked out he never saw moore again bosch connected with the antelope valley freeway and headed northeast on the sand canyon overpass he looked across the freeway and saw a white tv van heading south there was a large painted on its side it meant moore s wife would already know by the time bosch arrived and bosch felt a slight twinge of guilt at that mixed with relief that he would not be the one breaking the news the thought made him realize that he did not know the widows name irving had given him only an address apparently assuming bosch knew her name as he turned off the freeway onto the sierra highway he tried to recall the newspaper stories he had read during the week they had carried her name but it didnt come to him he remembered that she was a teacheran english teacher he thoughtat a high school in the valley he remembered that the reports said they had no children and he remembered that she had been separated a few months from her husband but the name her name eluded him he turned on to del prado watched the numbers painted on the curbs and then finally pulled to a stop in front of the house that had once been cal moores home it was a common ranchstyle home the kind minted by the hundreds in the planned communities that fed the freeways to overflow each morning it looked large like maybe four bedrooms and bosch thought that was odd for a childless couple maybe there had been plans at one time the light above the front door was not on no one was expected no one was wanted still in the moonlight and shadow bosch could see the front lawn and knew that the mower was at least a month past due the tall grass surrounded the post of the white ritenbaugh realty sign that was planted near the sidewalk there were no cars in the driveway and the garage door was closed its two windows dark empty sockets a single dim light shone from behind the curtained picture window next to the front door he wondered what she would be like and if she would feel guilt or anger or both he threw his cigarette into the street and then got out and stepped on it then he headed past the sadlooking for sale sign to the door the mat on the porch below the front door saidwelcome but it was worn and nobody had bothered to shake the dust off it in some time bosch noticed all of this because he kept his head down after knocking he knew that looking at anything would be better than looking at this woman her voice answered after his second knock go away no comment bosch had to smile thinking how he had used that one himself tonight hello mrs moore im not a reporter im with the la police the door came open a few inches and her face was there backlit and hidden in shadow bosch could see the chain lock stretching across the opening harry was ready with his badge case already out and opened yes mrs moore yes i am harry bosch um im a detective lapd and ive been sent outcould i come in i need to ask you a few questions and inform you of some uh developments in youre late ive had channel and and already out here when you knocked i figured you were somebody else two or seven i cant think who else can i come in mrs moore he put his badge wallet away she closed the door and he heard the chain slide out of its track the door came open and she signaled him in with her arm he stepped into an entryway of rustcolored mexican tile there was a round mirror on the wall and he saw her in it closing and locking the door he saw she held tissue in one hand will this take long she asked he said no and she led him to the living room where she took a seat on an overstuffed chair covered in brown leather it looked very comfortable and it was next to the fireplace she motioned him toward a couch that faced the fireplace this was where the guests always sat the fireplace had the glowing remnants of a dying fire on the table next to where she sat he saw a box of tissues and a stack of papers more like reports or maybe scripts some were in plastic covers book reports she said having noticed his gaze i assigned books to my students with the reports due before the christmas vacation it was going to be my first christmas alone and i guess i wanted to make sure i had something to keep me busy bosch nodded he looked around the rest of the room in his job he learned a lot about people from their rooms the way they lived often the people could no longer tell him themselves so he learned from his observations and believed that he was good at it the room in which they sat was sparse not much furniture it didnt look like a lot of entertaining of friends or family happened here there was a large bookshelf at one end of the room that was filled by hardback novels and oversized art books no tv no sign of children it was a place for quiet work or fireside talks but no more in the corner opposite the fireplace was a fivefoot christmas tree with white lights and red balls a few homemade ornaments that looked as if they might have been passed down through generations he liked the idea that she had put up the tree by herself she had continued her life and its routines amidst the ruins of her marriage she had put the tree up for herself it made him feel her strength she had a hard shell of hurt and maybe loneliness but there was a sense of strength too the tree said she was the kind of woman who would survive this would make it through on her own he wished he could remember her name before you start she said can i ask you something the light from the reading lamp next to her chair was low wattage but he could clearly see the intensity of her brown eyes sure did you do that on purpose let the reporters come up here first so you wouldnt have to do the dirty work thats what my husband used to call it telling families he called it the dirty work and he said the detectives always tried to get out of it bosch felt his face grow warm there was a clock on the fireplace mantel that now seemed to be ticking very loudly in the silence he managed to say i was told only a short time ago to come here i had a little trouble finding it i he stopped she knew im sorry i guess youre right i took my time its okay i shouldnt put you on the spot it must be a terrible job bosch wished he had a fedora like the ones the detectives in the old movies always had that way he could hold it in his hands and fiddle with it and let his fingers trace its brim give him something to do he looked at her closely now and saw the quality of damaged beauty about her midthirties he guessed with brown hair and blonde highlights she seemed agile like a runner clearly defined jawline above the taut muscles of her neck she had not used makeup to try to hide the lightly etched lines that curved under her eyes she wore blue jeans and a baggy white sweatshirt that he thought might have been her husbands once bosch wondered how much of calexico moore she still carried in her heart harry actually admired her for taking the shot at him about the dirty work he knew he deserved it in the three minutes he had known her he thought she reminded him of someone but he wasnt sure who someone from his past maybe there was a quiet tenderness there beside her strength he kept bringing his eyes back to hers they were magnets anyway im detective harry bosch he began again hoping she might introduce herself yes ive heard of you i remember the newspaper articles and im sure my husband spoke of youi think it was when they sent you out to hollywood division couple years ago he said before that one of the studios had paid you a lot of money to use your name and do a tv movie about a case he said you bought one of those houses on stilts up in the hills bosch nodded reluctantly and changed the subject i dont know what the reporters told you mrs moore but i have been sent out to tell you that it appears your husband has been found and he is dead i am sorry to have had to tell you this i i knew and you knew and every cop in town knew it would come to this i didnt talk to the reporters i didnt need to i told them no comment when that many of them come to your house on christmas night you know its because of bad news he nodded and looked down at the imaginary hat in his hands so are you going to tell me was it an official suicide did he use a gun bosch nodded and said it looks like it but nothing is definite un until the autopsy i know i know im a cops wife was i mean i know what you can say and cant say you people cant even be straight with me until then there are always secrets to keep to yourselves he saw the hard edge enter her eyes the anger thats not true mrs moore im just trying to soften the im detective bosch if you want to tell me something just tell me yes mrs moore it was with a gun if you want the details i can give you the details your husband if it was your husband took his face off with a shotgun gone completely so we have to make sure it was him and we have to make sure he did it himself before we can say anything for sure we are not trying to keep secrets we just dont have all the answers yet she leaned back in her chair away from light in the veil of shadows bosch saw the look on her face the hardness and anger in her eyes had softened her shoulders seemed to untighten he felt ashamed im sorry he said i dont know why i told you that i should have just thats okay i guess i deserved it i apologize too she looked at him then without anger in her eyes he had broken through the shell he could see that she needed to be with someone the house was too big and too dark to be alone in right now all the christmas trees and book reports in the world couldnt change that but there was more than that making bosch want to stay he found that he was instinctively attracted to her for bosch it had never been an attraction of an opposite but the reverse of that myth he had always seen something of himself in the women who attracted him why it was this way he never understood it was just there and now this woman whose name he didnt even know was there and he was being drawn to her maybe it was a reflection of himself and his own needs but it was there and he had seen it it hooked him and made him want to know what had etched the circles beneath such sharp eyes like himself he knew she carried her scars on the inside buried deep each one a mystery she was like him he knew im sorry but i dont know your name the deputy chief just gave me the address and said go she smiled at his predicament its sylvia he nodded sylvia um is that coffee i smell by any chance yes would you like a cup that would be great if its not too much trouble not at all she got up and as she passed in front of him so did his doubts listen im sorry maybe i should go you have a lot to think about and im intruding here ive please stay i could use the company she didnt wait for an answer the fire made a popping sound as the flames found the last pocket of air he watched her head toward the kitchen he waited a beat took another look around the room and stood up and headed toward the lighted doorway of the kitchen black is fine of course youre a cop you dont like them much do you cops well lets just say i dont have a very good record with them her back was to him and she put two mugs on the counter and poured coffee from a glass pot he leaned against the doorway next to the refrigerator he was unsure what to say whether to press on with business or not you have a nice home no its a nice house not a home were selling it i guess i should say im selling it now she still hadnt turned around you know you cant blame yourself for whatever he did it was a meager offering and he knew it easier said than done yeah there was a long moment of silence then before bosch decided to get on with it there was a note she stopped what she was doing but still did not turn i found out who i was thats all he said she didnt say anything one of the mugs was still empty does it mean anything to you she finally turned to him in the bright kitchen light he could see the salty tracks that tears had left on her face it made him feel inadequate that he was nothing and could do nothing to help heal her i dont know my husband he was caught on the past what do you mean he was justhe was always going back he liked the past better than the present or the hope of the future he liked to go back to the time he was growing up he liked he couldnt let things go he watched tears slide into the grooves below her eyes she turned back to the counter and finished pouring the coffee what happened to him he asked what happens to anybody for a while after that she didnt speak then said i dont know he wanted to go back he had a need for something back there everybody has a need for their past bosch thought sometimes it pulls harder on you than the future she dried her eyes with tissue and then turned and gave him a mug he sipped it before speaking once he told me he lived in a castle she said thats what he called it at least in calexico he asked yes but it was for a short while i dont know what happened he never told me a lot about that part of his life it was his father at some point he wasnt wanted anymore by his father he and his mother had to leave calexicothe castle or whatever it wasand she took him back across the border with her he liked to say he was from calexico but he really grew up in mexicali i dont know if youve ever been there just to drive through never stopped thats the general idea dont stop but he grew up there she stopped and he waited her out she was looking down at her coffee an attractive woman who looked weary of this she had not yet seen that this was a beginning for her as well as an end it was something he never got over the abandonment he often went back there to calexico i didnt go but i know he did alone i think he was watching his father maybe seeing what could have been i dont know he kept pictures from when he was growing up sometimes at night when he thought i was asleep hed take them out and look at them is he still alive the father she handed him a mug of coffee i dont know he rarely spoke of his father and when he did he said his father was dead but i dont know if that was metaphorically dead or that he actually was dead he was dead as far as cal went that was what mattered it was a very private thing with cal he still felt the rejection all these years later i could not get him to talk about it or when he would he would just lie say the old man meant nothing and that he didnt care but he did i could tell after a while after years i have to say that i stopped trying to talk with him about it and he would never bring it up hed just go down theresometimes for a weekend sometimes a day hed never talk about it when he came back do you have the photos no he took them when he left hed never leave them bosch sipped some coffee to give himself time to think it seems he said i dont know it seems like could this have had anything to do with i dont know all i can tell you is that it had a lot to do with us it was an obsession with him it was more important to him than me its what ended it for us what was he trying to find i dont know in the last few years he shut me out and i have to say that after a while i shut him out thats how it ended bosch nodded and looked away from her eyes what else could he do sometimes his job took him too far inside peoples lives and all he could do was stand there and nod he was asking questions he felt guilty asking because he had no right to the answers he was just the messenger boy here he wasnt supposed to find out why somebody would hold a doublebarrel shotgun up to his face and pull the triggers still the mystery of cal moore and the pain on her face wouldnt let him go she was captivating in a way that went beyond her physical beauty she was attractive yes but the hurt in her face the tears and yet the strength in her eyes tugged at him the thought that occurred to him was that she did not deserve this how could cal moore have fucked up so badly he looked back at her there was another thing he told me once uh ive had some experience with the iad uh thats internal i know what it is yes well he asked me for some advice asked me about if i knew somebody that was asking questions about him name of chastain did cal tell you about this what it was about no he didnt her demeanor was changing bosch could actually see the anger welling up from inside again her eyes were very sharp he had struck a nerve but you knew about it right chastain came here once he thought i would cooperate with whatever it was he was doing he said i made a complaint about my husband which was a lie he wanted to go through the house and i told him to leave i dont want to talk about this when did chastain come i dont know couple months ago you warned cal she hesitated and then nodded then cal came to the catalina and asked me for advice harry realized you sure you dont know what it was about we were separated by then we didnt talk it was over between us all i did was tell cal that this man had come and that he had lied about who made the complaint cal said that was all they do lie he said dont worry about it harry finished his coffee but held the mug in his hand she had known her husband had somehow fallen had betrayed their future with his past but she had stayed loyal she had warned him about chastain bosch couldnt fault her for that he could only like her better what are you doing here she asked what if you are investigating my husbands death i would assume you already know about iad you are either lying to me too or dont know if thats the case what are you doing here he put the mug down on the counter it gave him a few extra seconds i was sent out by the assistant chief to tell you what was the dirty work right i got stuck with the dirty work but like i said i sort of knew your husband and i dont think its a mystery you can solve detective bosch he noddedthe old standby i teach english and lit at grant high in the valley she said i assign my students a lot of books written about la so they can get a feel for the history and character of their community lord knows few of them were born here anyway one of the books i assign isthe long goodbye its about a detective ive read it there is a line i know it by heart there is no trap so deadly as the trap you set for yourself whenever i read that i think of my husband and me she started to cry again silently never taking her eyes off bosch this time he didnt nod he saw the need in her eyes and crossed the room and put his hand on her shoulder it felt awkward but then she moved into him and leaned her head against his chest he let her keep crying until she pulled away an hour later bosch was home he picked up the halffilled glass of wine and the bottle that had been sitting on the table since dinner he went out on the back porch and sat and drank and thought about things until early into the morning hours the glow of the fire across the pass was gone but now something burned within himself calexico moore had apparently answered a question that all people carry deep within themselvesthat harry bosch too had longed to answeri found out who i was and it had killed him it was a thought that pushed a fist into boschs guts into the most secret folds of his heart thursday the morning after christmas was one of those days the postcard photographers pray for there was no hint of smog in the sky the fire in the hills had burned out and the smoke had long been blown over the hills by pacific breezes in its stead the los angeles basin basked under a blue sky and puffy cumulus clouds bosch decided to take the long way down out of the hills driving on woodrow wilson until it crossed mulholland and then taking the winding route through nichols canyon he loved the views of the hills covered with blue wisteria and violet ice plants topped with aging milliondollar homes that gave the city its aura of fading glory as he drove he thought of the night before and how it had made him feel to comfort sylvia moore it made him feel like a cop in a rockwell painting like he had made a difference once he was out of the hills he took genesee to sunset and then cut over to wilcox he parked behind the station and walked past the fenced windows of the drunk tank into the detective bureau the gloom in the squad room was thicker than cigarette smoke in a porno theater the other detectives sat at their tables with their heads down most talking quietly on the phone or with their faces buried in the paperwork that haunted their lives with its neverceasing flow harry sat down at the homicide table and looked across at jerry edgar his someofthetime partner there were no permanently assigned partners anymore the bureau was shorthanded and there was a departmental hiring and promotion freeze because of budget cuts they were down to five detectives on the homicide table the bureau commander lieutenant harvey ninetyeight pounds managed this by working detectives solo except on key cases dangerous assignments or when making arrests bosch liked working on his own anyway but most of the other detectives complained about it whats going on bosch asked edgar moore edgar nodded they were alone at the table shelby dunne and karen moshito usually came in after nine and lucius porter was lucky if he was sober enough to get in by ten little while ago ninetyeight came out of the box and said they got the fingerprint match it was moore he blew his own shit away they were silent for a few minutes after that harry scanned the paperwork on his desk but couldnt help thinking about moore he imagined irving or sheehan or maybe even chastain calling sylvia moore to tell her the identification was confirmed harry could see his slim connection to the case disappearing like smoke without having to turn he realized someone was standing behind him he looked around to see pounds looking down at him harry cmon in an invitation to the glass box he looked at edgar who raised his eyes in a whoknows gesture harry got up and followed the lieutenant into his office at the head of the squad room it was a small room with windows on three sides that enabled pounds to look out on his charges but limit his actual contact with them he didnt have to hear them or smell them or know them the blinds that were often used to cut off his sight of them were open this morning sit down harry i dont have to tell you not to smoke have a good christmas bosch just looked at him he was uncomfortable with this guy calling him harry and asking him about christmas he hesitantly sat down whats up he said lets not get hostile harry im the one who should be hostile i just heard you spent a good part of christmas night at that dump motel the hideaway where nobody in this world would want to be and where robberyhomicide happened to be conducting an investigation i was on call bosch said and i should have been called out to the scene i went by to see what was going on turned out irving needed me anyway thats fine harry if you leave it at that i have been told to tell you not to get any ideas about the moore case whats that supposed to mean just what it sounds like it means look if you never mind never mind pounds raised his hands in a calming gesture then pinched the bridge of his nose signifying the onset of a headache he opened the center drawer of his desk and took out a small tin of aspirin he took two without water enough said okay pounds said im noti dont need to get into pounds made a choking sound and jumped up from his desk he moved past bosch and out of the box to the water fountain near the entrance to the bureau bosch didnt even watch him he just sat in his chair pounds was back in a few moments and continued excuse me anyway what i was saying was that i dont need an argument with you every time i bring you in here i really think you have to work through this problem you have with dealing with the command structure of this department you take it to extremes bosch could still see chalky white aspirin caking at the corners of his mouth pounds cleared his throat again i was just passing on an aside in your best why doesnt irving pass it on himself i didnt saylook bosch forget it just forget it youve been told and thats that if you have any ideas about last night about moore drop them its being handled i am sure it is the warning delivered bosch stood up he wanted to throw this guy through his glass wall but would settle for a cigarette out behind the drunk tank siddown pounds said thats not why i brought you in bosch sat down again and quietly waited he watched pounds try to compose himself he opened the drawer again and pulled out a wood ruler which he absentmindedly manipulated in his hands while he began to talk harry you know how many homicides weve caught in the division this year the question came from left field harry wondered what pounds was up to he knew he had handled eleven cases himself but he had been out of the rotation for six weeks during the summer while in mexico recovering from the bullet wound he figured the homicide squad for about seventy cases in the year he said i have no idea well im going to tell you pounds said right now we are at sixtysix homicides for the year to date and of course weve still got five days to go probably well pick up another im thinking at least one new years eve is always trouble well pro so what about it i remember we had fiftynine last year murder is going up what else is new what is new is that the number of cases we have cleared is going down it is less than half that number thirtytwo out of sixtysix cases have been cleared now a good number of those cases have been cleared by you i have you with eleven cases seven have been cleared by arrest or other we have warrants out on two others of the two you have open one is idle pending developments and you are actively pursuing the james kappalanni matter correct bosch nodded he didnt like the way this was going but wasnt sure why the problem is the overall record pounds said when taken in its entirety well its a pitiful record of success pounds slapped the ruler hard into his palm and shook his head an idea was forming in harrys mind about what this was about but still there was a part missing he wasnt sure exactly what pounds was up to think of it pounds continued all those victimsand their familiesfor whom justice eludes and then and then think how badly the publics confidence in us in this department will erode when thela times trumpets across their metro page that more than half the killers in hollywood division walk away from their crimes i dont think we have to worry about public confidence going down bosch said i dont think it can pounds rubbed the bridge of his nose again and quietly said this is not the time for your unique cynical view of the job bosch dont bring your arrogance in here i can take you off that table and put you on autos or maybe juvies any time i want to make the move get me id gladly take the heat when you took a beef to the union then wheres your homicide clearance rate going to be whats it going to say in the metro section then two thirds of the killers in hollywood walk pounds put the ruler back in the drawer and closed it bosch thought there was a thin smile on his face and he began to believe he had just talked his way into a trap pounds then opened another drawer and brought a blue binder up onto the desk it was the type used to keep record of a murder investigation but bosch saw few pages inside it point well taken pounds said which brings us to the point of this meeting see were talking about statistics harry we clear one more case and were at the halfway mark instead of saying more than half get away we can say half of the killers are caught if we clear two more we can saymore than half are cleared get me pounds nodded when bosch said nothing he made a show of straightening the binder on his desk then he looked directly at bosch lucius porter wont be back he said talked to him this morning he is going stressrelated said he is getting a doctor lined up pounds reached into the drawer and pulled up another blue murder book then another bosch could see what was happening now and i hope he has a good one lined up pounds was saying as he added the fifth and sixth binders to the pile because last i checked this department doesnt consider cirrhosis of the liver a stressrelated malady porters a lush simple as that and its not fair that he claim a stress disability and take early retirement because he cant handle his booze were going to bust him at the administrative hearing i dont care if he has mother theresa as his lawyer well bust him he tapped his finger on top of the pile of blue binders ive looked through these caseshe has eight open casesand its just pathetic ive copied the chronologies and im going to verify them ill bet dollars to doughnuts they are replete with fraudulent entries he was sitting on a stool somewhere his head on the bar when he says he was interviewing wits or doing the legwork pounds shook his head sadly you know we lost our checks and balances when we stopped partnering our investigators there was nobody to watch this guy now im sitting here with eight open investigations that were as slipshod as anything ive ever seen for all i know each one couldve been cleared and whose idea was it to make detectives work solo bosch wanted to say but didnt instead he said you ever hear the story about when porter was in uniform about ten years back he and his partner stopped one time to write up a citation for some shitbag they saw sitting on a curb drinking in public porter was driving it was routinejust a misdee writeupso he stayed behind the wheel hes sitting there when the shitbag stands up and caps his partner in the face standing there both hands on his cite book takes it right between the eyes and porter sat there watching pounds looked exasperated i know that story bosch pounds said they reenact it for every class of recruits that goes through the academy a lesson in what not to do how not to fuck up but its ancient history if he wanted a stressout he shouldve taken it then thats the point man he didnt take it then when he could have he tried to make it through maybe he tried for ten years and then he just went down in the flood of all the shit in the world what do you want him to do take the same out cal moore took you get a star in your file for saving the city the pension pounds did not speak for a few seconds then said very eloquent bosch but in the long run it is none of your business what happens to porter i should not have brought it up but i did so you would understand what i have to say now he went through his housekeeping trick of making sure all the corners were aligned on the stack of blue binders then he pushed the stack across the desk toward bosch you are taking porters caseload i want you to shelve the kappalanni matter for a few days youre not getting anywhere at the moment put it down until after the first and dive into this i want you to take porters eight open cases and study them do it quickly i want you to look for the one you think you can do something with quickly and then hit it with everything youve got for the next five daysuntil new years day work the weekend ill approve the overtime if you need one of the others on the table to double up with you no problem but put somebody in jail harry go get me an arrest iwe need to clear one more case to get to that halfway mark the deadline is midnight new years eve bosch just looked at him over the stack of binders he had the full measure of this man now pounds wasnt a cop anymore he was a bureaucrat he was nothing he saw crime the spilling of blood the suffering of humans as statistical entries in a log and at the end of the year the log told him how well he did not people not the voice from within it was the kind of impersonal arrogance that poisoned much of the department and isolated it from the city its people no wonder porter wanted out no wonder cal moore pulled his own plug harry stood up and picked up the stack of binders and stared at pounds with a look that said i know you pounds turned his eyes away at the door bosch said you know if you bust porter down hell just get sent back here to the table then where will you be next year how many cases will there still be open poundss eyebrows went up as he considered this if you let him go youll get a replacement a lot of sharp people on the other tables meehan over on the juvenile table is good you bring him over to our table and i bet youll see your stats go up but if you go ahead and bust porter and bring him back we might be doing this again next year pounds waited a moment to make sure bosch was done before speaking what is it with you bosch when it comes to investigations porter couldnt carry your lunch yet youre standing there trying to save his ass whats the point there is no point lieutenant i guess thats the point get me he carried the binders to his spot at the table and dropped them on the floor next to his chair edgar looked at him so did dunne and moshito who had recently arrived dont ask harry said he sat down and looked at the pile at his feet and didnt want to have anything to do with it what he wanted was a cigarette but there was no smoking in the squad room at least while pounds was around he looked up a number in his rolodex and dialed the call was not picked up until the seventh ring what now lou who is it bosch oh yeah harry sorry i didnt know who was calling whats going on you hear im going for a stressout yeah thats why im calling i got your casespounds gave em to meand uh i want to try to turn one real quick like by the end of the week i was wondering if you had any ideayou think you might know which one i should hit im starting from scratch there was a long silence on the phone harry shit he finally said and for the first time bosch realized he might already be drunk aw damn i didnt think that cocksucker would dump it all on you i uh harry harry i didnt do too good on hey lou its no biggee you know my decks were cleared im just looking for a place to start if you cant point me thats okay ill just look through the stuff he waited and realized the others at the table had been listening to him and not even acting like they werent fuck it porter said i aw fuck it i dont know harry ii havent been on it you know what i mean i been kinda fallin apart here you hear about moore shit i saw the news last night i yeah its too bad listen lou dont worry about it okay ill look through the stuff i got the murder books here and ill look through em nothing lou okay harry give me a call back if you want maybe later ill think of something right now im not too fucking good bosch thought a few moments before saying anything else in his mind he pictured porter on the other end of the line standing in total darkness alone listen he said in a low voice you better you have to watch out for pounds on your application he might ask the suits to check you out you know what i mean put a couple of guys on you you gotta stay out of the bars he might try to bust your application understand after a while porter said he understood bosch hung up then and looked at the others at the table the squad room always seemed loud until he had to make phone calls he didnt want anyone to hear he got out a cigarette ninetyeight dumped porters whole caseload on you edgar asked thats right thats me the bureau garbage man yeah then whats that make us chopped liver bosch smiled he could tell edgar didnt know whether to be happy he avoided the assignment or mad because he was passed over well jed if you want ill hustle back into the box and tell ninetyeight that youre volunteering to split this up with me im sure the pencilpushing prick will he stopped because edgar had kicked him under the table he turned in his seat and saw pounds coming up from behind his face was red he had probably heard the last exchange bosch youre not going to smoke that disgusting thing in here are you no lieutenant i was just on my way out back he pushed his chair back and walked out to the back parking lot to smoke the backdoor of the drunk tank was unlocked and open the christmasnight drunks had already been loaded into the jail bus and hauled to arraignment court to make their pleas a trustee in gray overalls was spraying the floor of the tank with a hose harry knew the concrete floor of the tank had been graded on a slight incline as an aid in this daily cleansing he watched the dirty water slosh out the door and into the parking lot where it flowed to a sewer drain there was vomit and blood in the water and the smell from the tank was terrible but harry stood his ground this was his place when he was done he threw his cigarette butt into the water and watched the flow take it to the drain it felt like the detective bureau had become a fishbowl and he was the only one in the water he had to get away from the curious eyes that were watching him bosch picked up the stack of blue binders and walked out the backdoor into the parking lot then he quickly walked back into the station through the watch office door went down a short hallway past the lockup and up a staircase to the secondfloor storage room it was called the bridal suite because of the cots in the back corner an unofficial official cooping station there was an old cafeteria table up there and a phone and it was quiet it was all he needed the room was empty today bosch put the stack of binders down and cleared a dented bumper marked with an evidence tag off the table he leaned it against a stack of file boxes next to a broken surfboard that had also been tagged as evidence then he got down to work harry stared at the foothigh stack of binders pounds said the division had sixtysix homicides so far in the year figuring the rotation and including harrys twomonth absence while recovering from the bullet wound porter had probably caught fourteen of the cases with eight still open that meant he had cleared six others it wasnt a bad record considering the transient nature of homicide in hollywood nationwide the vast majority of murder victims know their killer they are the people they eat with drink with sleep with live with but hollywood was different there were no norms there were only deviations aberrations strangers killed strangers here reasons were not a requirement the victims turned up in alleys on freeway shoulders along the brushy hillsides in griffith park in bags dropped like garbage into restaurant dumpsters one of harrys open files was the discovery of a body in partsone on each of the fire escape landings of a sixstory hotel on gower that one didnt raise too many eyebrows in the bureau the joke going around was that it was a lucky thing that the victim hadnt stayed at the holiday inn it was fifteen stories the bottom line was that in hollywood a monster could move smoothly in the flow of humanity just one more car on the crowded freeway and some would always be caught and some would always be untraceable unless you counted the blood they left behind porter had gone six and eight before punching out it was a record that wouldnt get him any commendations but still it meant six more monsters were out of the flow bosch realized he could balance porters books if he could clear one of the eight open cases the brokendown cop would at least go out with an even record bosch didnt care about pounds and his desire to clear one more case by midnight on new years eve he felt no allegiance to pounds and believed the annual tabulating charting and analysing of lives sacrificed added up to nothing he decided that if he was to do this job he would do it for porter fuck pounds he pushed the binders to the back of the table so he would have room to work he decided to quickly scan each murder book and separate them into two piles one stack of possible quick turns another for the cases he did not think he could do anything with in a short time he reviewed them in chronological order starting with a valentines day strangulation of a priest in a stall at a bathhouse on santa monica by the time he was done two hours had passed and harry had only two of the blue binders in his stack of possibilities one was a month old a woman was pulled from a bus stop bench on las palmas into the darkened entranceway of a closed hollywood memorabilia store and raped and stabbed the other was the eightdayold discovery of the body of a man behind a twentyfourhour diner on sunset near the directors guild building the victim had been beaten to death bosch focused on these two because they were the most recent cases and experience had instilled in him a firm belief that cases become exponentially more difficult to clear with each day that passes whoever strangled the priest was as good as gold harry knew the percentages showed that the killer had gotten away bosch also saw that the two most recent cases could quickly be cleared if he caught a break if he could identify the man found behind the restaurant then that information could lead to his family friends and associates and most likely to a motive and maybe a killer or if he could trace the stabbing victims movement back to where she was before going to the bus stop he might be able to learn where and how the killer saw her it was a tossup and bosch decided to read each case file thoroughly before deciding but going with the percentages he decided to read the freshest case first the body found behind the restaurant was the warmest trail on first glance the murder book was notable for what it did not contain porter had not picked up a finished typed copy of the autopsy protocol so bosch had to rely on the investigators summary reports and porters own autopsy notes which simply said the victim had been beaten to death with a blunt objectpolicespeak meaning just about anything the victim estimated to be about fiftyfive years old was referred to as juan doe this because he was believed to be latin and was the sixtyseventh unidentified latin man found dead in los angeles county during the year there was no money on the body no wallet and no belongings other than the clothingall of it manufactured in mexico the only identification key was a tattoo on the upper left chest it was a monocolor outline of what appeared to be a ghost there was a polaroid snapshot of it in the file bosch studied this for several moments deciding the blue line drawing of a casperlike ghost was very old the ink was faded and blurred juan doe had gotten the tattoo as a young man the crime scene report porter had filled out said the body had been found at am on december by an offduty police officer identified only by his badge number going in for an early breakfast or late dinner when he saw the body lying next to the dumpster near the kitchen door of the egg and i diner ro had recently reported code seven and parked behind the location with the intention of entering to eat victim was viewed on the eastern side of the dumpster body was laying in a supine position head to the north and feet to the south extensive injuries were readily noticeable and ro notified the watch commander that a homicide callout was necessary ro saw no other individuals in the vicinity of the dumpster before or after the body was located bosch looked through the binder for a summary filed by the reporting officer but there was none he next reviewed the other photos in the binder these were of the body in place before the techs had moved it to the morgue bosch could see the victims scalp had been rent open by one vicious blow there were also wounds on the face and dried black blood on the neck and all over the oncewhite tshirt the man was wearing the dead mans hands lay open at his sides in closeups of the hands bosch saw two fingers on the right hand bent backward in compound fracturesclassic defense wounds aside from the wounds bosch noted the rough and scarred hands and the ropey muscles that went up the arms he had been a worker of some kind what had he been doing in the alley behind the diner at one oclock in the morning next in the binder were witness statements taken from employees at the egg and i they were all men which seemed wrong to bosch because he had eaten at the egg and i on several early mornings and remembered that there were always waitresses working the tables porter had apparently decided they were unimportant and concentrated only on the kitchen help each of the men interviewed said he did not recall seeing the victim in life or death porter had scribbled a star on the top of one of the statements it was from a fry cook who had reported to work at am and had walked right past the east side of the dumpster and through the kitchen door he had seen no body on the ground and was sure he would have seen one if there had been one to see when he made his entrance that had helped porter set the timing of the slaying to sometime during the fortyfourminute window between the arrivals of the fry cook and the police officer who found the body next in the file were printouts from lapd national crime index california department of justice and immigration and naturalization service computer runs on the victims fingerprints all four were negative no matches juan doe remained unidentified at the back of the binder were notes porter had taken during the autopsy which had not been conducted until tuesday christmas eve because of the usual backlog of cases at the coroners office bosch realized that it might have been porters last official duty to watch one more body be cut up he didnt come back to work after the holiday perhaps porter knew he would not return for his notes were sparse just a single page with a few thoughts jotted down some of them bosch could not read other notes he could understand but they were meaningless but near the bottom of the page porter had circled a notation that said tod to pm bosch knew the notation meant that based on the rate of decrease in liver temperature and other appearances of the body the time of death was likely to have been between noon and pm but no later than pm this did not make sense bosch thought at first that put the time of death at least seven and a half hours before the discovery of the body it also did not jibe with the fry cook not seeing any body by the dumpster at am these contradictions were the reason porter had circled the notation it meant juan doe had not been killed behind the diner it meant he was killed somewhere else nearly half a day earlier and then dumped behind the diner he took a notebook out of his pocket and began to make a list of people he wanted to talk to first on the list was the doctor who had performed the autopsy harry needed to get the completed autopsy protocol then he noted porter down for a more detailed interview after that he wrote the fry cooks name on the list because porters notes only said the cook did not see a body on the ground while going to work there was nothing about whether the cook saw anybody else or anything unusual in the alley he also made a note to check with the waitresses who had been on duty that morning to complete his list bosch had to pick up the phone and call the watch commanders office i want to talk to elevenohone bosch said can you look it up on the board there and tell me who that is it was kleinman again he said very funny smart guy what bosch said but at that moment it struck him is it cal moore was cal moore was harry hung up the phone as several thoughts crowded into his brain at once juan doe had been found on the day before moore checked into the hideaway he tried to piece out what this could mean moore stumbles onto a body in an alley early one morning the next day he checks into a motel turns up the airconditioner and puts two barrels of doubleought buckshot into his face the message he leaves behind is as simple as it is mysterious i found out who i was bosch lit a cigarette and crossed off his list but he continued to center his thoughts on this latest piece of information he felt impatient bothered he fidgeted in the chair then stood up and began to walk in a circle around the table he worked porter into the framework this development provided and ran through it several times each time it was the same porter gets the call out on the juan doe case he obviously would have had to talk to moore at the scene the next day moore disappears the next week moore is found dead and then the next day porter announces he is getting a doctor and is pulling the pin too many coincidences he picked up the phone and called the homicide table edgar answered and harry asked him to reach across the table and check his rolodex for porters home number edgar gave it to him and said harry where you at why ninetyeight looking for me nah one of the guys from moore s unit called a few minutes ago said he was looking for you yeah why hey harry im only passing on the message not doing your job for you okay okay which one called rickard he just asked me to tell you they had something for you i gave him your pager number cause i didnt know if you were coming back anytime soon so where you at nowhere he hung up and dialed porters house the phone rang ten times harry hung up and lit another cigarette he didnt know what to think about all of this could moore have simply stumbled onto the body as it said in the report could he have dumped it there bosch had no clues nowhere he said aloud to the room full of storage boxes he picked up the phone again and dialed the medical examiners office he gave his name and asked to be connected to dr corazón the acting chief harry refused to say what the call was about to the operator the phone was dead for nearly a minute before corazón picked up im in the middle of something here she said merry christmas to you too sorry its the moore cut yes but i cant talk about it what do you need harry i just inherited a case and theres no autopsy in the file im trying to find out who did it so i can get a copy harry you dont need to ask for the acting chief to track that you could ask any of the investigators i have sitting around here on their asses yeah but they arent as sweet to me as you okay hurry up whats the name juan doe date of death was the eighteenth the cut was the twentyfourth she said nothing and bosch assumed she was checking a scheduling chart yeah she said after a half minute the twentyfourth that was salazar and hes gone now vacation that was his last autopsy until next month he went to australia its summer there shit dont fret harry i have the package right here sally expected lou porter would be by to pick it up today but lou never came howd you inherit it lou pulled the pin jeez that was kind of quick whats hishold on she didnt wait for him to say he would this time she was gone more than a minute when she came back her voice had a higher pitch to it harry i reallyve got to go tell you what wanna meet me after work by then illve had some time to reach through this and ill tell you what weve got i just remembered that there is something kind of interesting here salazar came to me for a referral approval referral to what an entomologista bug doctorover at ucla sally found bugs bosch already knew that maggots would not have bred in a body dead twelve hours at the most and salazar would not have needed an entomologist to identify them anyway bugs he said yeah in the stomach content analysis and nasal swabs but i dont have time at the moment to discuss this ive got four impatient men in the autopsy suite waiting for me and only one of em is dead i guess that would make the live ones irving sheehan and chastain the three musketeers she laughed and said you got it okay when and where do you want to meet he looked at his watch it was almost three maybe around six she said that would give me time to finish here and look through this package on your juan doe should i come there his pager began to chirp he cut it off with a wellpracticed move with his right hand to his belt no lets see she said can you meet me at the red wind we can wait out the rush hour ill be there harry said after hanging up he checked the number on his pager recognized it as a pay phone exchange and dialed it bosch a voice said right rickard i worked with cal moore the bang unit right i got something for you bosch didnt say anything he felt the hairs on the top of his hands and forearms begin to tingle he tried to place the name rickard with a face but couldnt the narcs kept such odd hours and were a breed unto themselves he didnt know who rickard was or i should say cal left something for you rickard spoke into the silence you wanna meet i dont want this to go down in the station why not ive got my reasons we can talk about that when i see you wheres that gonna be you know a place on sunset the egg and i its a diner decent food the hypes dont hang out here i know it good were in the last booth in the back right before the kitchen door the table with the only black guy in the place thats me theres parking in the back in the alley i know whos we cal s whole crew is here that where you guys always hang out yeah before we hit the street see ya soon the restaurants sign had been changed since the last time he had been there it was now theallamerican egg and i which meant it had probably been sold to foreigners bosch got out of his caprice and walked through the back alley looking at the spot where juan doe had been dumped right outside the backdoor of a diner frequented by the local narc crew his thoughts on the implications of this were interrupted by the panhandlers in the alley who came up to him shaking their cups bosch ignored them but their presence served to remind him of another shortcoming in porters meager investigation there had been nothing in the reports about vagrants in the alley being interviewed as possible witnesses it would probably be impossible to track them down now inside the restaurant he saw four young men one of them black in a rear booth they were sitting silently with their faces turned down to the empty coffee cups in front of them harry noticed a closed manila file on the table as he pulled a chair away from an empty table and sat at the end of the booth im bosch tom rickard the black one said he put out his hand and then introduced the other three as finks montirez and fedaredo we got tired of being around the office rickard said cal used to like this place bosch just nodded and looked down at the file he saw the name written on the tab was humberto zorrillo it meant nothing to him rickard slid the file across the table to him what is it harry asked not yet touching it probably the last thing he worked on rickard said we were going to give it over to rhd but thought what the hell he was working it up for you and those boys down there at parker are just trying to drag him through the shit aint going to help with that what do you mean i mean they cant let it be that the man killed himself they hafta dissect his life and figure out exactly why he did this and why he done that the man fucking killed himself what else is there to say about it you dont want to know why i already know why man the job it will get us all in the end i mean i know why bosch just nodded again the other three narcs still hadnt said anything im just letting off steam rickard said been one of those days longest fucking day of my life where was this harry asked pointing to the file didnt rhd already go through his desk yeah they did but that file wasnt in it see cal left it in one of the bang carsone of those undercover pieces of shit we use in the pocket behind the front seat we never noticed it during the week he was missing because today was the first time any of us rode in the back of the car we usually take two cars out on operations but today we all jumped in one for a cruise on the boulevard after we came in and heard the news i saw it shoved down into the pocket its got a little note inside says to give it to you we knew he was working on something for you cause of that night he peeled off early to go meet with you at the catalina bosch still hadnt opened the file just looking at it gave him an uneasy feeling he told me that night at the catalina that the shoeflies were on him you guys know why no man we dont know what was going down we just know they were around like flies on shit iad went through his desk before rhd they took files his phone book even took the fucking typewriter off the desk that was the only one we had but what it was about we dont know the guy had a lot of years in and it burns my ass that they were gunning for him thats what i meant before about the job doing him in itll get all of us what about outside the job his past his wife said i dont want to hear about that shit shes the one who put the suits on him made up some story when he walked out and dropped the dime on him she just wanted to bring him down you ask me how do you know it was her cal told us man said the shoeflies might come around asking questions told us it came from her bosch wondered who had been lying moore to his partners or sylvia to himself he thought about her for a moment and couldnt see it couldnt see her dropping the dime but he didnt press it with the four narcs he finally reached down and picked up the file then he left he was too curious to wait he knew that he should not even have the file that he should pick up a phone and call frankie sheehan at rhd but he unconsciously took a quick look around the car to make sure he was alone and began to read there was a yellow postit note on the first page give to harry bosch it was not signed or dated it was stuck to a sheet of paper with five green field interview cards held to it with a paper clip harry detached the fi cards and shuffled through them five different names all males each had been stopped by members of the bang unit in october or november they were questioned and released each card held little more information than a description home address driver license number and date and location of the shakedown the names meant nothing to bosch he looked at the sheet the cards had been attached to it was markedinternal memo and had a subheading that said bang intelligence report it was dated november and had afiled stamp mark on it that was dated two days after that in the course of gathering intelligence on narcotics activities in reporting district officers moore rickard finks fedaredo and montirez have conducted numerous field interrogations of suspects believed to be involved in drug sales in the area of hollywood boulevard in recent weeks it has come to these officers attention the fact that individuals were involved in the sale of a drug known as black ice which is a narcotic combining heroin cocaine and pcp in rock form the demand for this drug remains low on the street at this time but its popularity is expected to increase officers assigned to this unit believe several transienttype individuals are engaged in the street level sale of black ice five suspects have been identified through investigation but no arrests have followed the street sales network is believed to be directed by an individual whose identity is not known to officers at this time informants and users of black ice have revealed that the predominant form of the drug sold at street level in the reporting zone comes from mexico rather than hawaii where ice originatedrefer to dea advisory and still is imported to the mainland in large quantities reporting officers will contact dea for intelligence on sources of this narcotic and will continue to monitor activities in rd sgt c v moore bosch reread the report it was a coveryourass paper it said nothing and meant nothing it had no value but could be produced to show a superior that you were aware of a problem and had been taking steps to attack it moore must have realized that black ice was becoming more than a rarity on the street and wanted to file a report to shield himself against future repercussions next in the file was an arrest report dated november of a man named marvin dance for possession of a controlled substance the report said dance was arrested by bang officers on ivar after they watched him make a delivery of black ice to a street dealer bang unit officers rickard and finks had set up on dance on ivar north of the boulevard the suspect was sitting in a parked car and the narcs watched as another man walked up and got in the report said dance took something out of his mouth and handed it to the other man who then got out of the car and walked on the two officers split up and finks followed the walker until he was out of dances sight then stopped him and seized an eightballeight individually wrapped grams of black ice in a balloon rickard kept a watch on dance who remained in the car waiting for the next dealer to come for the product after finks radioed that he had made his bust rickard moved in to take down dance but dance swallowed whatever else was in his mouth while he sat cuffed on the sidewalk rickard searched the car and found no drugs but in a crumpled mcdonalds cup in the gutter by the car door the narc found six more balloons each containing an eightball dance was arrested for sales and possession with intent to sell the report said the suspect refused to talk to the arresting officers about the drugs other than to say the mcdonalds cup was not his he didnt ask for a lawyer but one arrived at the station within an hour and informed the officers that it would be unconstitutional for them to take his client to a hospital to have his stomach pumped or to search his clients feces when the time came for him to use the bathroom moore who got involved in processing the arrest at the station checked with the oncall da and was told the lawyer was right dance was released on bail two hours after his arrest bosch thought this was curious the report said time of arrest was pm that meant that in two hours in the middle of the night dance had come up with a lawyer bail bondsman and the ten percent cashneeded to make bail and no charges were ever filed against dance the next page of the file was a rejection slip from the das office the filing deputy who reviewed the case determined that there was insufficient evidence linking dance to the mcdonalds cup that was in the gutter three feet from the car so no possession charge next the sales charge was scuttled because the narcs saw no money change hands when dance gave the eightball to the man who had gotten in the car his name was glenn druzon he was seventeen years old and had refused to testify that he had received the balloon from dance in fact the rejection report said he was ready to testify that he had the balloon with him before he got into the car with dance if called he would testify that he had tried to sell it to dance but dance was not interested the case against dance was kicked druzon was charged with possession and later put on juvenile probation bosch looked away from the reports and down the alley he could see the circular copperandglass directors guild building rising at the end he could just see the top of the marlboro man billboard that had been on sunset for as long as he could remember he lit a cigarette he looked at the da reject form again clipped to it was a mug shot of the blondhaired dance smirking at the lens bosch knew that what had happened was the routine way in which many if not most street cases go the small fish the bottom feeders get hooked up the bigger fish break the line and swim away the cops knew that all they could do was disrupt things never rid the streets of the problem take one dealer down and somebody takes his place or an attorney on retainer springs him and then a da with a fourdrawer caseload cuts him loose it was one of the reasons why bosch stayed in homicide sometimes he thought it was the only crime that really counted but even that was changing harry took the mug shot and put it in his pocket then closed the file for the time being he was bothered by the dance arrest he wondered what connection calexico moore had seen between dance and jimmy kapps that had prompted him to put it in the file for bosch bosch took a small notebook out of his inside coat pocket and began to make a chronological list he wrote nov dance arrested nov jimmy kapps dead dec moore bosch meet bosch closed the notebook he knew he had to go back into the diner to ask rickard a question but first he reopened the file there was only one page left another unit intelligence report this one was a summary of a briefing moore had gotten from a dea agent assigned to los angeles this was dated december meaning it had been put together by moore a week after he and bosch had met at the catalina harry tried to figure how this played with everything else and what if anything it meant at their meeting moore had withheld information but afterward had gone to the dea to request information it was as if he were playing both sides of the fence or possibly moore was trying to hotdog boschs case trying to put it together on his own bosch began reading the report slowly unconsciously bending the top corners of the file with his fingers information provided this date by dea asst special agent in charge rene corvo los angeles bureau operations indicates origin of black ice is primarily baja california target q humberto zorrillo believed operating a clandestine lab in the mexicali zone that is producing mexican ice for distribution in the us subject lives on a acre bull ranch sw mexicali state judicial police has not moved against zorrillo for political reasons mode of transport used by this operation is unknown air surveillance shows no airstrip on ranch property it is dea opinion based on experience that the operation uses vehicle routes through calexico or possibly san ysidro however no shipments intercepted at those crossings at this time it is believed that subject enjoys support and cooperation of officers with the sjp he is widely known and revered as a hero in the barrios of sw mexicali subjects support is based in part on generous donations of jobs med supplies barrio dwellings and cook camps in the poor neighborhoods he grew up in some of the residents in sw neighborhoods refer to zorrillo as el papa de mexicali additionally zorrillos rancho remains under heavy guard hours el papathe popeis rarely seen outside of the rancho exception is weekly trips to observe bulls bred on the ranch at bullrings in baja sjp authorities advise at this time that their cooperation in any dea action that focuses on zorrillo would be impossible sgt c v moore bosch stared for a few moments at the file after closing it he had a jumble of differing thoughts he was a man who didnt believe in coincidences and so he had to wonder about how cal moores presence had come to throw a shadow across everything on his own plate he looked at his watch and saw it would soon be time to get going to meet teresa corazón but finally all the movement in his mind could not distract him from the thought that was pushing through frankie sheehan at rhd should have the information in the zorrillo file bosch had worked with sheehan at rhd he was a good man and a good investigator if he was conducting a legitimate investigation he should have the file if he wasnt then it didnt matter he got out of the car and headed back to the diner this time he walked in through the kitchen door on the alley the bang crew was still there the four young narcs sitting as quietly as if they were in the back room at a funeral home boschs chair was still there too he sat down again whats up rickard said you read this right tell me about the dance bust whats to tell rickard said we kick ass the da kicks the case whats new its a different drug man but its the same old thing what made you set up on dance howd you know he was making deliveries there heard it around look its important it involves moore how i cant tell you now you have to trust me until i put a few things together just tell me who got the tip thats what it was right rickard seemed to weigh the choices he had yeah it was a tip it was my snitch who was it look man i cant jimmy kapps it was jimmy kapps wasnt it rickard hesitated again and that confirmed it for bosch it angered him that he was finding this out almost by accident and only after a cops death but the picture was clearing kapps snitches off dance as a means of knocking out some of the competition then he flies back to hawaii picks up a bellyful of balloons and comes back but dance isnt in lockup anymore and jimmy kapps gets taken down before he can sell even one of his balloons why the fuck didnt you come talk to me when you heard kapps got put down ive been trying to get a line on this and all the whatre you talking about bosch moore met you that night on the kapps thing he it became apparent to everybody at the table that moore had not told bosch everything he knew that night at the catalina the silence fell heavy on them if they hadnt known it before they knew it now moore had been up to something bosch finally spoke did moore know your snitch was kapps rickard hesitated once more but then nodded bosch stood up and slid the file across the table to a spot in front of rickard i dont want this you call frank sheehan at rhd and tell him you just found it its up to you but i wouldnt say that you let me look at it first and i wont either harry made a move to step away from the table but then stopped one other thing this guy dance any of you seen him around not since the bust fedaredo said the other three shook their heads if you can dig him up let me know you got my number outside the diners kitchen door bosch looked again at the spot in the alley where moore had found juan doe supposedly he didnt know what to believe about moore anymore but he couldnt help but wonder what the connection was between the juan doe and dance and kapps if there was a connection at all he knew the key was to find out who the man with the workers hands and muscles had been then he would find the killer at parker center harry walked past the memorial sculpture in front and into the lobby where he had to badge the officer at the front counter to get in the department was too big and impersonal the cops at the counter would recognize no one below the rank of commander the lobby was crowded with people coming and going some were in uniform some in suits some withvisitor stickers on their shirts and the wideeyed look of citizens venturing into the maze for the first time harry had come to regard parker center as a bureaucratic labyrinth that hindered rather than eased the job of the cop on the street it was eight floors with fiefdoms on every hallway on every floor each was jealously guarded by commanders and deputy chiefs and assistant chiefs and each group had its suspicions about the others each was a society within the great society bosch had been a master of the maze during his eight years in robberyhomicide and then he crashed and burned under the weight of an internal affairs investigation into his shooting of an unarmed suspect in a series of killings bosch had fired as the man reached under a pillow in his killing pad for what harry thought was a gun but there was no gun beneath the pillow was a toupee it was almost laughable except for the man who took the bullet other rhd investigators tied him to eleven killings his body was shipped in a cardboard box to a crematorium bosch was shipped out to hollywood division the elevator was crowded and smelled like stale breath he got out on the fourth floor and walked into the scientific investigations division offices the secretary had already left harry leaned over the countertop and reached the button that buzzed open the half door he walked through the ballistics lab and into the squad room donovan was still there sitting at his desk howd you get in here let myself in harry dont do that you cant go around breaching security like that bosch nodded his contrition what do you want donovan asked i dont have any of your cases sure you do what one cal moore bullshit look ive got a part of it okay i just have a few questions you can answer them if you want if you dont thats fine too whatve you got im running down some things that came up on a couple cases im working and they run right across cal moores trail and so i just i just want to be sure about moore you know what i mean no i dont know what you mean bosch pulled a chair away from another desk and sat down they were alone in the squad room but bosch spoke low and slow hoping to draw the sid tech in just for my own knowledge i need to be sure what i am wondering is can you tell me if all the stuff checked out checked out to what come on man was it him and was there anybody else in that room there was a long silence and then donovan cleared his throat he finally said what do you mean youre working cases that cross his trail fair enough question bosch thought there was a small window of opportunity there i got a dead drug dealer i had asked moore to do some checking on the case then i got a dead body a juan doe in an alley off sunset moore s the one who found the body the next day he checks into that dump and does the number with the shotgun or so it looks i just want some reassurances its the way it looks i heard they got an id over at the morgue so what makes you think these two cases are connected with moore s thing i dont think anything right now im just trying to eliminate possibilities maybe its all the coincidences i dont know well donovan said i dont know what they got over at the mes but i got lifts in the room that belonged to him moore was in that room i just got finished with it took me all day how come the doj computer was down all morning couldnt get prints i went up to personnel to get moore s prints from his package and they told me irving had already raided it he took the prints out and took em over to the coroner you know youre not supposed to do that but whos gonna tell him get on his shit list so i had to wait for the justice computer to come back on line got his prints off of that after lunch and just finished with it a little while ago that was moore in the room where were the prints hang on donovan rolled back his chair to a set of file cabinets and unlocked a drawer with a key from his pocket while he was leafing through the files bosch lit a cigarette donovan finally pulled out a file and then rolled his chair back to his desk put that shit out harry i hate that shit bosch dropped the cigarette to the linoleum stepped on it and then kicked the butt under donovans desk donovan began reviewing some pages he had pulled from a file bosch could see that each one showed a topview drawing of the motel room where moore s body was found okay then donovan said the prints in the room came back to moore all of them i did the comp you said that im getting to it im getting to it lets see we have a thumbfourteen pointson the stock of the weapon that i guess was the bell ringer the fourteen harry knew that only five matching points in a fingerprint comparison were needed for an identification to be accepted in court a fourteenpoint match of a print on a gun was almost as good as having a photo of the person holding the gun then we lets see we had four threepointers on the barrels of the weapon i think these kind of got smudged when it kicked out of his hands so we got nothing real clear there what about the triggers nope nothing there he pulled the triggers with his toe and he was still wearing a sock remember what about the rest of the place i saw you dusting the airconditioner yeah but i didnt get anything there on the dial we thought he turned the air up you know to control decomp but the dial was clean its plastic with a rough surface so i dont think it would have held anything for us what else donovan looked back down at his charts i got a lift off his badgeindex and thumb five and seven points respectively the badge was on the bureau with the wallet but nothing on the wallet only smears on the gun on the bureau i only got a bunch of smears but a clear thumb on the cartridge then lets see i got the whole hand just about a palm thumb and three fingers on the left cabinet door under the bathroom sink i figure he mustve put his hand on it to steady himself when he was getting on the floor there what a way to go man yeah thats it yeah er no on the newspaperthere was a newspaper on the chair i got a big match there thumb again and three fingers and the shells only smudges couldnt get anything on the shells what about the note nothing on it somebody check the handwriting well actually it was printing but sheehan had it checked by somebody in suspicious documents he said it matched few months back moore moved out on his wife and took a place in los feliz called the fountains he filled out a changeofaddress form it was there in the personnel file irving grabbed anyway the changeofaddress card was printed too there were a lot of commonalities with the note you know found and fountains what about the shotgun anybody trace the serial the number had been filed and acidburned no trace you know harry i shouldnt be saying so much i think we should just he didnt finish the sentence he turned his chair back to the file cabinet and began to put his charts away im almost done man what about a projectile pattern did you do one donovan closed and locked the file drawer and turned back around started to havent finished but youre talking sidebyside barrels doubleought shells thats an immediate spread pattern id say he could have done it from six inches away and gotten that kind of damage no mystery there bosch nodded and looked at his watch then stood up one last thing might as well ive already told you enough to put my ass in a permanent sling you going to be careful with what ive told you course i am last thing outstanding prints how many lifts you get that you havent matched to moore not a one i was wondering if anybody would care about that bosch sat back down this made no sense bosch knew that a motel room was like a working girl every customer leaves a little something his mark behind it didnt matter if the rooms were made up and reasonably cleaned between renters there was always something a telltale sign harry could not accept that every surface donovan had checked had been clean except for those where moore s prints were found what do you mean nobody cared i mean nobody said shit i told sheehan and that iad stiff thats been following him around they acted like it didnt mean a thing to them you know it was like big deal so there were no other prints i guess they never did a motelroom stiff before shit i thought id be collecting prints in there last night til midnight but all i got were the ones i just told you about that was the goddamned cleanest motel room ive ever printed i mean i even put on the laser didnt see a thing but wipe marks where the room had been cleaned up and if you ask me harry that wasnt the kinda place the management cared too much about cleanliness you told sheehan this right yeah i told him when i got done i was thinking you know it being christmas night that they were going to say i was full of shit and just trying to get home to the family but i told em and they just said fine thatll be all good night merry christmas i left fuck it bosch thought about sheehan and chastain and irving sheehan was a competent investigator but with those two hovering over him he could have made a mistake they had gone into the motel room one hundred percent sure it was a suicide bosch would have done the same they even found a note after that they would have probably had to find a knife in moore s back to change their minds the lack of other prints in the room no serial number on the shotgun these were things that shouldve been enough to cut the percentage of their assuredness back to fiftyfifty but they hadnt made a dent in their assumption harry began to wonder about the autopsy results if they would back the suicide conclusion he stood up once more thanked donovan for the information and left he took the stairs down to the third floor and walked into the rhd suite most of the desks lined in three rows were empty as it was after five oclock sheehans was among those that were deserted in the homicide special bullpen a few of the detectives still there glanced up at him but then looked away bosch was of no interest to them he was a symbol of what could happen of how easily one could fall sheehan still around he asked the duty detective who sat at the front desk and handled the phone lines incoming reports and all the other shitwork gone for the day she said without looking up from a staff vacation schedule she was filling out called from the mes office a few minutes ago and said he was code seven until theam there a desk i can use for a few minutes i have to make some phone calls he hated to ask for such permission having worked in this room for eight years just pick one she said she still didnt look up bosch sat down at a desk that was reasonably clear of clutter he called the hollywood homicide table hoping there would still be someone there karen moshito answered and bosch asked if he had any messages just one somebody named sylvia no last name given he took the number down feeling his pulse quicken did you hear about moore moshito asked you mean the id yeah i heard no the cut is screwed up radio news says the autopsy is inconclusive i never heard of a shotgun in the face being inconclusive when did this come out i just heard it on kfwb at five bosch hung up and tried porters number once more again there was no answer and no tape recording picked up harry wondered if the brokendown cop was there and just not answering he imagined porter sitting with a bottle in the corner of a dark room afraid to answer the door or the phone he looked at the number he had written down for sylvia moore he wondered if she had heard about the autopsy that was probably it she picked up after three rings mrs moore its sylvia this is harry bosch i know she didnt say anything further how are you holding up i think im okay i i called because i just want to thank you for the way you were last night with me oh well you didntit was you know that book i told you about last night the long goodbye theres another line in it i was thinking about a white knight for me is as rare as a fat postman i guess nowadays there are a lot of fat postmen she laughed very softly almost like her crying but not too many white knights you were last night bosch didnt know what to say and just tried to envision her on the other end of the silence thats very nice of you to say but i dont know if i deserve it sometimes i dont think the things i have to do make me much of a knight they moved on to small talk for a few moments and then said goodbye he hung up and sat still for a moment staring at the phone and thinking about things said and unsaid there was something there a connection something more than her husbands death more than just a case there was a connection between them he turned the pages of the notebook back to the chronological chart he had made earlier nov dance arrested nov jimmy kapps dead dec moore bosch meet he now started to add other dates and facts even some that did not seem to fit into the picture at the moment but his overriding feeling was that his cases were linked and the link was calexico moore he didnt stop to consider the chart as a whole until he was finished then he studied it finding that it gave some context to the thoughts that had jumbled in his head in the last two days nov bang cya memo on black ice nov rickard gets tipfrom jimmy kapps nov dance arrested case kicked nov jimmy kapps dead dec moore bosch meet moore holds back dec moore receives dea briefing dec moore finds bodyjuan doe dec porter assigned juan doe case dec moore checks in hideawaysuicide dec juan doe autopsybugs dec moore s body found dec porter pulls pin dec moore autopsyinconclusive but he couldnt study it too long without thinking of sylvia moore bosch took los angeles street to second and then up to the red wind in front of st vibianas he saw an entourage of bedraggled homeless men leaving the church they had spent the day sleeping in the pews and were now heading to the union street mission for dinner as he passed thetimes building he looked up at the clock and saw it was exactly six he turned on kfwb for the news the moore autopsy was the second story after a report on how the mayor had become the latest victim in a wave of kamikazi aids protests he was hit with a balloon full of pig blood on the white stone steps of city hall a group called cool aids took credit in other news an autopsy on the body of police sergeant calexico moore was inconclusive in confirming that the narcotics officer took his own life according to the los angeles county coroners office meanwhile police have officially classified the death as suicide the thirtyeightyearold officers body was found christmas day in a hollywood motel room he had been dead of a shotgun blast for about a week authorities said a suicide note was found at the scene but the contents have not been released moore will be buried monday bosch turned the radio off the news report had obviously come from a press release he wondered what was meant by the autopsy results being inconclusive that was the only grain of real news in the whole report after parking at the curb in front of the red wind he went inside but did not see teresa corazón he went into the restroom and splashed water on his face he needed a shave he dried himself with a paper towel and tried to smooth his mustache and curly hair with his hand he loosened his tie then stood there a long moment staring at his reflection he saw the kind of man not many people approached unless they had to he got a package of cigarettes from the machine by the restroom door and looked around again but still didnt see her he went to the bar and ordered an anchor and then took it to an empty table by the front door the wind was becoming crowded with the afterwork crowd people in business suits and dresses there were a lot of combinations of older men with younger women harry recognized several reporters from thetimes he began to think teresa had picked a bad place to meet if she intended to show up at all with todays autopsy story she might be noticed by the reporters he drained the beer bottle and left the bar he was standing in the chilled evening air on the front sidewalk looking down the street into the second street tunnel when he heard a horn honk and a car pulled to a stop in front of him the electric window glided down it was teresa harry wait inside ill just find a place to park sorry im late bosch leaned into the window i dont know lot of reporters in there i heard on the radio about the moore autopsy i dont know if you want to risk getting hassled he could see reasons for it and against it getting her name in the paper improved her chances of changing acting chief me to permanent chief but the wrong thing said or a misquote could just as easily change acting to interim or worse yet former where can we go she asked harry opened the door and got in are you hungry we can go down to gorky s or the pantry yeah is gorky s still open i want some soup it took them fifteen minutes to wend their way through eight blocks of downtown traffic and to find a parking space inside gorky s they ordered mugs of homebrewed russian beer and teresa had the chickenrice soup long day huh he offered oh yeah no lunch was in the suite for five hours bosch needed to hear about the moore autopsy but knew he could not just blurt out a question he would have to make her want to tell it how was christmas you and your husband get together not even close it just didnt work he never could deal with what i do and now that i have a shot at chief me he resents it even more he left christmas eve i spent christmas alone i was going to call my lawyer today to tell her to resume filing but i was too busy shouldve called me i spent christmas with a coyote ahh is timido still around yeah he still comes around every now and then there was a fire across the pass i think it spooked him yeah i read about that you were lucky bosch nodded he and teresa corazón had had an onandoff relationship for four months each meeting sparked with this kind of surface intimacy but it was a relationship of convenience firmly grounded on physical not emotional needs and never igniting into deep passion for either of them she had separated earlier in the year from her husband a ucla medical school professor and had apparently singled harry out for her affections but bosch knew he was a secondary diversion their liaisons were sporadic usually weeks apart and harry was content to allow teresa to initiate each one he watched her bring her head down to blow onto a spoonful of soup and then sip it he saw slices of carrot floating in the bowl she had brown ringlets that fell to her shoulders she held some of the tresses back with her hand as she blew on another spoonful and then sipped her skin was a deep natural brown and there was an exotic elliptical shape to her face accentuated by high cheekbones she wore red lipstick on full lips and there was just a whisper of fine white peach fuzz on her cheeks he knew she was in her midthirties but he had never asked exactly how old lastly he noticed her fingernails unpolished and clipped short so as not to puncture the rubber gloves that were the tools of her trade as he drank the heavy beer from its heavy stein he wondered if this was the start of another liaison or whether she really had come to tell him of something significant in the autopsy results of juan doe so now i need a date for new years eve she said looking up from the soup what are you staring at just watching you you need a date you got one i read in the paper that frank morgans playing at the catalina whos he and what does he play youll see youll like him it was a dumb question anyway if hes someone you like then he plays the saxophone harry smiled more to himself than her he was happy to know he had a date being alone on new years eve bothered him more than christmas thanksgiving any of the other days new years eve was a night for jazz and the saxophone could cut you in half if you were alone she smiled and said harry youre so easy when it comes to lonely women he thought of sylvia moore remembering her sad smile so teresa said seeming to sense that he was drifting away i bet you want to know about the bugs inside juan doe finish your soup first nope thats okay it doesnt bother me i always get hungry in fact after a long day chopping up bodies she smiled she said things like that often as if daring him not to like what she did for a living he knew she was still hooked by her husband it didnt matter what she said he understood well i hope you dont miss the knives when they make you permanent chief youll be cutting budgets then no id be a handson chief id handle the specials like today but after today i dont know if theyll ever make me permanent harry sensed that now he was the one who had shaken a bad feeling loose and sent her traveling with it now might be the right time you want to talk about it no i mean i do but i cant i trust you harry but i think i have to keep this close for the time being he nodded and let it go but he intended to come back to it later and find out what had gone wrong on the moore autopsy he took his notebook out of his coat pocket and put it on the table okay then tell me about juan doe she pushed the soup bowl to the side of the table and pulled a leather briefcase onto her lap she pulled out a thin manila file and opened it in front of her okay this is a copy so you can keep it when im done explaining i went over the notes and everything else salazar had on this i guess you know cause of death was multiple bluntforce trauma to the head crushing blows to the frontal parietal sphenoid and supraorbital as she described these injuries she touched the top of her forehead the back of her head her left temple and rim of her left eye she did not look up from the paperwork any one of these was fatal there were other defensive wounds which you can look at later um he extracted wood splinters from two of the head injuries looks like you are talking about something like a baseball bat but not as wide i think tremendous crushing blows so i think we are talking about something with some leverage not a stick bigger a pick handle shovel something likepossibly a pool cue but most likely something unfinished like i said sally pulled splinters out of the wounds im not sure a pool cue with a sanded and lacquered finish would leave splinters she studied the notes a moment the other thingi dont know if porter told you this but this body most likely was dumped in that location time of death is at least six hours before discovery judging by the traffic in that alley and to the rear door of the restaurant that body could not have gone unnoticed there for six hours it had to have been dumped yeah that was in his notes good she started turning through the pages briefly looking at the autopsy photos and putting them to the side okay here it is tox results arent back yet but the colors of the blood and liver indicate there will be nothing there im just guessingor rather sally is just guessing so dont hold us to that harry nodded he hadnt taken any notes yet he lit a cigarette and she didnt seem to mind she had never protested before though once when he was attending an autopsy she walked in from the adjoining suite and showed him a lung from a fortyyearold threepackaday man it looked like an old black loafer that had been run over by a truck but as you know is routine she continued we took swabs and did the analysis on the stomach contents first in the earwax we found a kind of brown dust we combed some of it out of the hair and got some from the fingernails too bosch thought of tar heroin an ingredient in black ice heroin good guess but no just brown dust bosch was writing in his notebook now yeah we put it on some slides and blew it up and as near as we can tell its wheat wheat dust itsit apparently is pulverized wheat like cereal he had cereal in his ears and hair a waiter in a white shirt and black tie with a brush mustache and his best dour russian look came to the table to ask if they wanted anything else he looked at the stack of photos next to teresa on top was one of juan doe naked on a stainless steel table teresa quickly covered it with the file and harry ordered two more beers the man walked slowly away from the table you mean some kind of wheat cereal bosch asked again like the dust at the bottom of the box or something not exactly keep that thought though and let me move on it will all tie up he waved her on on the nasal swabs and stomach content two things came up that are very interesting its kind of why i like what i do despite other people not liking it for me she looked up from the file and smiled at him anyway in the stomach contents salazar identified coffee and masticated rice chicken bell pepper various spices and pig intestine to make a long story short it was chorizomexican sausage the intestine used as sausage casing leads me to believe it was some kind of homemade sausage not manufactured product he had eaten this shortly before death there had been almost no breakdown in the stomach yet he mayve even been eating when he was assaulted i mean the throat and mouth were clear but there was still debris in the teeth and by the way they were all original teeth no dental work at allever you getting the picture that this man was not from around here bosch nodded remembering porters notes said all of juan doe s clothing was made in mexico he was writing in the notebook she said there was also this in the stomach she slid a polaroid photograph across the table it was of a pinkish insect with one wing missing and the other broken it looked wet as indeed it would be considering where it had been found it lay on a glass culture dish next to a dime the dime was about ten times the size of the bug harry noticed the waiter standing about ten feet away with two mugs of beer the man held the mugs up and raised his eyebrows bosch signaled that it was safe to approach the waiter put the glasses down stole a glance at the bug photo and then moved quickly away harry slid the photo back to teresa so what is it trypetid she said and she smiled shoot i was about to guess that he said she laughed at the lame joke its a fruit fly harry mediterranean variety the little bug that lays big waste to the california citrus industry salazar came to me to send it out on referral because we had no idea what it was i had an investigator take it over to ucla to an entomologist gary suggested he identified it for us gary bosch knew was her estranged soon to be exhusband he nodded at what she was telling him but was not seeing the significance of the find she said we go on to the nasal swabs okay there was more wheat dust and then we found this she slid another photo across the table this was also a photo of a culture dish with a dime in it there was also a small pinkishbrown line near the dime this was much smaller than the fly in the first photo but bosch could tell it was also some kind of insect and this he asked same thing my entomologist tells me only this is a youngun this is a larva she folded her fingers together and pointed her elbows out she smiled and waited you love this dont you he said he drafted off a quarter of his beer okay you got me whats it all mean well you have a basic understanding of the fruit fly right it chews up the citrus crop can bring the entire industry to its knees umptyump millions lost no orange juice in the morning et cetera et cetera the decline of civilization as we know it right he nodded and she went on talking very quickly okay we seem to have an annual medfly infestation here im sure youve seen the quarantine signs on the freeways or heard the helicopters spraying malathion at night they make me dream of vietnam harry said you must have also seen or read about the movement against malathion spraying some people say it poisons people as well as these bugs they want it stopped so whats a department of agriculture to do well one thing is step up the other procedure they use to get these bugs the usda and state medfly eradication project release billions of sterile medflies all across southern california millions every week see the idea is that when the ones that are already out there mate theyll do it with sterile partners and eventually the infestation will die out because less and less are reproduced its mathematical harry end of problemif they can saturate the region with enough sterile flies she stopped there but bosch still didnt get it geez this is all really fantastic teresa but does it get to a point eventually or are we just im getting there im getting there just listen you are a detective detectives are supposed to listen you once told me that solving murders was getting people to talk and just listening to them well im telling it he held his hands up she went on the flies released by the usda are dyed when they are in the larval stage dyed pink so they can keep track of them or quickly separate the sterile ones from the nonsterile ones when they check those little traps they have in orange trees all over the place after the larvae are dyed pink they are irradiated to make them sterile then they get released harry nodded it was beginning to sound interesting my entomologist examined the two samples taken from juan doe and this is what he found she referred to some notes in the file the adult fly obtained from the deceaseds stomach was both dyed and sterilized female okay nothing unusual about that like i said they release something like three hundred million of these a weekbillions over the yearand so it would seem probable that one might be accidentally swallowed by our man if he was anywhere in say southern california that narrows it down bosch said what about the other sample the larva is different she smiled again dr braxton thats the bug doctor said the larval specimen was dyed pink as to usda specifications but it had not yet been irradiatedsterilizedwhen it went up our juan does nose she unfolded her hands and put them down at her sides her factual report was concluded now it was time to speculate and she was giving him the first shot so inside his body he has two dyed flies one sterilized and one not sterilized bosch said that would lead me to conclude that shortly before his death our boy was at the location where these flies are sterilized millions of flies around one or two could have gotten in his food he could have breathed one in through the nose anything like that she nodded what about the wheat dust in the ears and hair the wheat dust is the food harry braxton said that is the food used in the breeding process he said so i need to find where they make where they breed these sterile flies they might have a line on juan doe sounds like he was a breeder or something she smiled and said why dont you ask me where they breed them where do they do it teresa well the trick is to breed them where they are already a part of the natural insect population or environment and therefore not a problem in case some happen to slip out the door before getting their dose of radiation and so the usda contracts with breeders in only two places hawaii and mexico in hawaii there are three breeding contractors on oahu in mexico there is a breeder down near zihuatenejo and the largest of all five is located near mexicali harry how did you know did you already know all of this and let me it was just a guess it fits with something else ive been working on she looked at him oddly and for a moment he was sorry he had spoiled her fun he drained his beer mug and looked around for the squeamish waiter she drove him back to get his car near the red wind and then followed him out of downtown and up to his home in the hills she lived in a condo in hancock park which was closer but she said she had been spending too much time there lately and wanted a chance to see or hear the coyote he knew her real reason was that it would be easier for her to extricate herself from his place than to ask him to leave hers bosch didnt mind though the truth was he felt uncomfortable at her place it reminded him too much of what la was coming to it was a fifthfloor loft with a view of downtown in a historic residence building called the warfield the exterior of the building was still as beautiful as the day in it was completed by george allan hancock beaux arts architecture with a bluegray terracotta facade george hadnt spared the oil money and from the street the warfield with its fleursdelys and cartouches showed it but it was the interiorthe current interior that isthat bosch found objectionable the place had been bought a few years back by a japanese firm and completely gutted then retrofitted renovated and revamped the walls in each apartment were knocked down and each place was nothing but a long sterile room with fake wood floors stainlesssteel counters and track lighting just a pretty shell bosch thought he had a feeling george wouldve thought the same at harrys house they talked while he lit the hibachi on the porch and put an orange roughy filet on the grill he had bought it christmas eve and it was still fresh and large enough to split teresa told him the county commission would probably informally decide before new years on a permanent chief medical examiner he wished her good luck but privately wasnt sure he meant it it was a political appointment and she would have to toe the line why get into that box he changed the subject so if this guy this juan doe was down in mexicali near where they make these fruit flieshow do you think his body got all the way up here thats not my department teresa said she was at the railing staring out over the valley there were a million lights glinting in the crisp cool air she was wearing his jacket over her shoulders harry glazed the fish with a pineapple barbecue sauce and then turned it over its warm over here by the fire he said he dawdled a bit over the filet and then said i think what it was is that maybe they didnt want anybody checking around that usda contractors business you know they didnt want that body connected to that place so they take the guys body far away yeah but all the way to la maybe they were well i dont know that is pretty far away they were both silent with their thoughts for a few moments bosch could hear and smell the pineapple sizzling as it dripped on the coals he said how do you smuggle a dead body across the border oh i think theyve smuggled larger things than that across dont you he nodded ever been down there harry to mexicali just to drive through on my way to bahia san felipe where i went fishing last summer i never stopped you never you know the name of the town just across the border on our side uh uh calexico youre kidding is that where yup the fish was done he forked it onto a plate put the cover on the grill and they went inside he served it with spanish rice he made with pico pico he opened a bottle of red wine and poured two glasses blood of the gods he didnt have any white as he put everything on the table he saw a smile on her face thought i was a tv dinner guy didnt you crossed my mind this is very nice they clicked glasses and ate quietly she complimented him on the meal but he knew the fish was a little too dry they descended into small talk again the whole time he was looking for the opening to ask her about the moore autopsy it didnt come until they were finished what will you do now she asked after putting her napkin on the table guess ill clear the table and see if no you know what i mean about the juan doe case im not sure i want to talk to porter again and ill probably look up the usda id like to know more about how those flies get here from mexico she nodded and said let me know if you want to talk to the entomologist i can arrange that he watched her as she once again got the faroff stare that had been intruding all night what about you he asked what will you do now about what about the problems with the moore autopsy that obvious huh he got up and cleared the plates away she didnt move from the table he sat back down and emptied the bottle into the glasses he decided he would have to give her something in order for her to feel comfortable giving him something in return listen to me teresa i think you and i should talk about things i think we have two investigations probably three investigations here that may all be part of the same thing like different spokes on the same wheel she brought her eyes up confused what cases what are you talking about i know that all of what im about to say is outside your venue but i think you need to know it to help make your decision ive been watching you all night and i can tell you have a problem and dont know what to do he hesitated giving her a chance to stop him she didnt he told her about marvin dances arrest and its relation to the jimmy kapps murder when i found out kapps had been bringing ice over from hawaii i went to cal moore to ask about black ice you know the competition i wanted to know where it comes from where you get it whos selling it anything that would help me get a picture of who mightve put down jimmy kapps anyway the point is i thought moore shined me on said he knew nothing but today i find out he was putting together a file on black ice he was gathering string on my case he held stuff back from me but at the same time was putting something together on this when he disappeared i got the file today there was a note it said give to harry bosch on it what was in it the file a lot including an intelligence report says the main source of black ice is probably a ranch down in mexicali she stared at him but said nothing which brings us to our juan doe porter bails out and the case comes to me today i am reading through the file and ill give you one guess who it was that found the body and then disappeared the next day shit she said exactly cal moore what this means i dont know but he is the reporting officer on the body the next day he is in the wind the next week he is found in a motel room a supposed suicide and then the next dayafter the discovery of moore has been in the papers and on tvporter calls up and says guess what guys i quit does all of this sound aboveboard to you she abruptly stood up and walked to the sliding door to the porch she stared through the glass out across the pass those bastards she said they just want to drop the whole thing because it might embarrass somebody bosch walked up behind her you have to tell somebody about it tell me no i cant you tell me everything ive told you there isnt much else and its all a jumble the file didnt have much other than that the dea told moore that black ice is coming up from mexicali thats how i guessed about the fruit fly contractor and then theres moore he grew up in calexico and mexicali you see there are too many coincidences here that i dont think are coincidences she still faced the door and he was talking to her back but he saw the reflection of her worried face in the glass he could smell her perfume the important thing about the file is that moore didnt keep it in his office or his apartment it was in a place where someone from iad or rhd wouldnt find it and when the guys on his crew found it there was the note that said to give it to me you understand the confused look in the glass answered for her she turned and moved into the living room sitting on the cushioned chair and running her hands through her hair harry stayed standing and paced on the wood floor in front of her why would he write a note saying give the file to me it wouldnt have been a note to himself he already knew he was putting the file together for me so the note was for someone else and what does that tell us that he either knew when he wrote it that he was going to kill himself or he knew he was going to be killed she said bosch nodded or at least he knew he had gotten into something too deep that he was in trouble in danger jesus she said harry approached and handed her her wineglass he bent down close to her face you have to tell me about the autopsy somethings wrong i heard that bullshit press release they put out inconclusive what is that shit since when cant you tell if a shotgun blast to the face killed somebody or not so tell me teresa we can figure out what to do she shrugged her shoulders and shook her head but harry knew she was going to tell they told me because i wasnt a hundred percentharry you cant reveal where you got this information you cant it wont get back to you if i have to i will use it to help us but it wont get back to you thats my promise they told me not to discuss it with anyone because i couldnt be completely sure the assistant chief irving that arrogant prick knew just where to stick it in talking about the county commission deciding soon about my position saying they would be looking for a chief me who knew discretion saying what friends he had on the commission id like to take a scalpel never mind all of that what was it you werent one hundred percent sure about she drained her wineglass then the story came out she told him that the autopsy had proceeded as routine other than the fact that in addition to the two case detectives observing it sheehan and chastain from iad was assistant police chief irving she said a lab technician was also on hand to make the fingerprint comparisons the decomposition was extensive teresa said i had to take the fingertips off and spray them with a chemical hardening agent collins thats my lab tech was able to take prints after that he made the comparison right there because irving had brought exemplars it was a match it was moore what about the teeth dental was tough there wasnt much left that hadnt been fragged we made a comparison between a partial incisor found in the tub and some dental records irving came up with moore had had a root canal and it was there that was a match too she said she began the autopsy after confirming the identity and immediately concluded the obvious that damage from the doublebarrelshotgun blast was massive and fatal instantly but it was while examining the material that had separated from the body that she began to question whether she could rule moore s death a suicide the force of the blast resulted in complete cranial displacement she said and of course the autopsy protocol calls for examination of all vital organs including the brain problem was the brain was mostly unmassed due to the wide projectile pattern i believe i was told the pellets came from a doublebarrel sidebyside configuration i could see that the projectile pattern was very wide nevertheless a large portion of the frontal lobe and corresponding skull fragment were left largely intact though it had been separated you know what i mean the diagram said this had been charted in the bathtub is this too much i know you knew him not that well go on so i examined this piece not really expecting anything more than what i was seeing earlier but i was wrong there was hemorrhagic demarcation in the lobe along the skull lining she took a hit off his wineglass and breathed heavily as if casting out a demon and so you see harry that was a big fucking problem tell me why you sound like irving tell me why tell me why well it should be obvious for two reasons first of all you dont have that much hemorrhage on instant death like that there is not much bleeding in the brain lining when the brain has been literally disconnected from the body in a split second but while there is some room for some debate on thatill give that to irvingthere is no debate whatsoever on the second reason this hemorrhaging was clearly indicative of a contrecoup injury to the head no doubt in my mind at all harry quickly reviewed the physics he had learned over the ten years he had been watching autopsies contrecoup brain injury is damage that occurs to the side of the brain opposite the insult the brain in effect was a jello mold inside the skull a jarring blow to the left side often did its worst damage to the right side because the force of impact pushed the jello against the right side of the skull harry knew that for moore to have the hemorrhage teresa described to the front of the brain he would have to be struck from behind a shotgun blast to the face would not have done it is there any way he trailed off unclear of what he wanted to ask he suddenly became aware of his bodys pangs for a cigarette and smacked the end of a fresh pack on his palm what happened he asked as he opened it well when i started explaining irving got all uptight and kept asking are you sure is that a hundred percent accurate arent we jumping the gun and on and on like that i think it was pretty clear he didnt want this to be anything other than a suicide the minute i raised a doubt he started talking about jumping to conclusions and the need to move slowly he said the department could be embarrassed by what an investigation could lead to if we did not proceed slowly and cautiously and correctly those were his words asshole let sleeping dogs lie bosch said right so i just flatout told them i was not going to rule it a suicide and then then they talked me out of ruling it a homicide so thats where the inconclusive comes from a compromise for now it makes me feel like i am guilty of something those bastards theyre just going to drop it bosch said he couldnt figure it out the reluctance had to be because of the iad investigation whatever moore was into irving must believe it either led him to kill himself or got him killed and either way irving didnt want to open that box without knowing first what was in it maybe he never wanted to know that told bosch one thing he was on his own no matter what he came up with turning it over to irving and rhd would get it buried so if bosch went on with it he was freelancing do they know that moore was working on something for you teresa asked by now they do but they probably didnt when they were with you probably wont make any difference what about the juan doe case about him finding the body i dont know what they know on that what will you do i dont know i dont know anything what will you do she was silent for a long time then she got up and walked to him she leaned into him and kissed him on the lips she whispered lets forget about all of this for a while he conceded to her in their lovemaking letting her lead and direct him use his body the way she wanted they had been together often enough so that they were comfortable and knew each others ways they were beyond the stages of curiosity or embarrassment at the end she was straddled over him as he leaned back propped on pillows against the headboard her head snapped back and her clipped nails dug painlessly into his chest she made no sound at all in the darkness he looked up and saw the glint of silver dripping from her ears he reached up and touched the earrings and then ran his hands down her throat over her shoulders and breasts her skin was warm and damp her slow methodical motion drew him further into the void where everything else in the world could not go when they were both resting she still huddled on top of him a sense of guilt came over him he thought of sylvia moore a woman he had met only the night before how could she intrude on this but she had he wondered where the guilt came from maybe it was for what was still ahead of them he thought he heard the short highpitched bark of the coyote in the distance behind the house teresa raised her head off his chest and then they heard the animals lonesome baying timido he heard her say quietly harry felt the guilt pass over him again he thought of teresa had he tricked her into telling him he didnt think so maybe again it was guilt over what he had not yet done what he knew he would do with the information she had given she seemed to know his thoughts were away from her perhaps a change in his heartbeat a slight tensing in his muscles nothing she said what you asked what i was going to do nothing im not going to get involved in this bullshit any further if they want to bury it let them bury it harry knew then that she would make a good permanent chief medical examiner for the county of los angeles he felt himself falling away from her in the dark teresa rolled off him and sat on the edge of the bed looking out the window at the threequarter moon they had left the curtain open the coyote howled once more bosch thought he could hear a dog answering somewhere in the distance are you like him she asked who timido alone out there in the dark world sometimes everybody is sometimes yes but you like it dont you not always not always he thought about what to say the wrong word and shed be gone im sorry if im distant he tried theres a lot of things he didnt finish there was no excuse you do like living up here in this little lonely house with the coyote as your only friend dont you he didnt answer the face of sylvia moore inexplicably came back into his mind but this time he felt no guilt he liked seeing her there i have to go teresa said long day tomorrow he watched her walk naked into the bathroom picking her purse up off the night table as she went he listened as the shower ran he imagined her in there cleaning all traces of him off and out of her and then splashing on the allpurpose perfume she always carried in her purse to cover up any smells left on her from her job he rolled to the side of the bed to the pile of his clothes on the floor and got out his phone book he dialed while the water still ran the voice that answered was dulled with sleep it was near midnight you dont know who this is and i never talked to you there was silence while harrys voice registered okay okay got it i understand theres a problem on the cal moore autopsy shit i know that man inconclusive you dont have to wake me up to no you dont understand you are confusing the autopsy with the press release on the autopsy two different things understand now yeah i think i do so whats the problem the assistant chief of police and the acting chief me dont agree one says suicide the other homicide cant have both i guess thats what you call inconclusive in a press release there was a low whistling sound in the phone this is good but why would the cops want to bury a homicide especially one of their own i mean suicide makes the department look like shit as it is why bury a murder unless it means theres something right bosch said and he hung up the phone a minute later the shower was turned off and teresa came out drying herself with a towel she was totally unabashed about her nakedness with him and harry found he missed that shyness it had eventually left all the women he became involved with before they eventually left him he pulled on blue jeans and a tshirt while she dressed neither spoke she looked at him with a thin smile and then he walked her out to her car so we still have a date for new years eve she asked after he opened the car door for her of course he said though he knew she would call with an excuse to cancel it she leaned up and kissed him on the lips then slipped into the drivers seat goodbye teresa he said but she had already closed the door it was midnight when he came back inside the place smelled of her perfume and his own guilt he put frank morgansmood indigo on the cd player and stood there in the living room without moving just listening to the phrasing on the first solo a song called lullaby bosch thought he knew nothing truer than the sound of a saxophone sleep was not a possibility bosch knew this he stood on the porch looking down on the carpet of lights and let the chill air harden his skin and his resolve for the first time in months he felt invigorated he was in the hunt again he let everything about the cases pass through his mind and made a mental list of people he had to see and things he had to do on top was lucius porter the brokendown detective whose pullout was too timely too coincidental to be coincidental harry realized he was becoming angry just thinking about porter and embarrassed embarrassed at having stuck his neck out for him with pounds he went to his notebook and then dialed porters number one more time he was not expecting an answer and he wasnt disappointed porter had at least been reliable in that respect he checked the address he had written down earlier and headed out driving down out of the hills he did not pass another car until he reached cahuenga he headed north and got on the hollywood freeway at barham the freeway was crowded but not so that traffic was slow the cars moved northward at a steady clip a sleekly moving ribbon of lights out over studio city bosch could see a police helicopter circling a shaft of white light cast downward on a crime scene somewhere it almost seemed as if the beam was a leash that held the circling craft from flying high and away he loved the city most at night the night hid many of the sorrows it silenced the city yet brought deep undercurrents to the surface it was in this dark slipstream that he believed he moved most freely behind the cover of shadows like a rider in a limousine he looked out but no one looked in there was a random feel to the dark the quirkiness of chance played out in the blue neon night so many ways to live and to die you could be riding in the back of a studios black limo or just as easily the back of the coroners blue van the sound of applause was the same as the buzz of a bullet spinning past your ear in the dark that randomness that was la there was flash fire and flash flood earthquake mudslide there was the driveby shooter and the crackstoked burglar the drunk driver and the always curving road ahead there were killer cops and cop killers there was the husband of the woman you were sleeping with and there was the woman at any moment on any night there were people being raped violated maimed murdered and loved there was always a baby at his mothers breast and sometimes a baby alone in a dumpster somewhere harry exited on vanowen in north hollywood and went east toward burbank then he turned north again into a neighborhood of rundown apartments bosch could tell by the gang graffiti it was a mostly latino neighborhood he knew porter had lived here for years it was all he could afford after paying alimony and for his booze he turned into the happy valley trailer park and found porters doublewide at the end of greenbriar lane the trailer was dark not even a light on above the door and there was no car under the aluminumroofed carport bosch sat in his car smoking a cigarette and watching for a while he heard mariachi music wafting into the neighborhood from one of the mexican clubs over on lankershim soon it was drowned out by a jet that lumbered by overhead on its way to burbank airport he reached into the glove compartment for a leather pouch containing his flashlight and picks and got out after the third knock went unanswered harry opened the pouch breaking into porters place did not give him pause porter was a player in this game not an innocent to boschs mind porter had forfeited protection of his privacy when he had not been straight with him when he hadnt mentioned that moore had been the one who found juan doe s body now bosch was going to find porter and ask him about that he took out the miniature flashlight turned it on and then held it in his mouth as he stooped down and worked a pick and tiny pressure wrench into the lock it took him only a few minutes to push the pins and open the door a sour odor greeted bosch when he entered he recognized it as the smell of a drunks sweat he called porters name but got no answer he turned on the lights as he moved through the rooms there were empty glasses on nearly every horizontal surface the bed was unmade and the sheets were a dingy white amidst the glasses on the night table was an ashtray overloaded with butts there was also a statue of a saint bosch could not identify in the bathroom off the bedroom the bathtub was filthy a toothbrush was on the floor and in the wastebasket there was an empty bottle of whiskey a brand either so expensive or so cheap that harry had never heard of it but he suspected it was the latter in the kitchen there was another empty bottle in the trash can there were also dirty dishes piled on the counters and sink he opened the refrigerator and saw only a jar of mustard and an egg carton porters place was very much like its owner it showed a marginal life if it could be called that at all back in the living room bosch picked a framed photograph up off a table next to a yellow couch it was a woman not too attractive except to porter maybe an exwife he couldnt get over maybe harry put the photo back down and the phone rang he traced the noise to the bedroom the phone was on the floor next to the bed he picked up on the seventh ring waited a moment and in a voice designed to appear jerked from sleep said huh porter yeah the line went dead it hadnt worked but had bosch recognized the voice pounds no not pounds only one word spoken but still the accent was there spanish he thought he filed it away in his mind and got up off the bed another plane crossed above and the trailer shuddered he went back into the living room where he made a halfhearted search of a onedrawer desk though he knew that no matter what he found it wouldnt solve the immediate problem where was porter bosch turned all the lights off and relocked the front door as he left he decided to start in north hollywood and work his way south toward downtown in every police division there was a handful of bars that carried a heavy clientele of cops then after two when they closed there were the allnight bottle clubs mostly they were dark pits where men came to drink hard and quietly as if their lives depended on it they were havens from the street places to go to forget and forgive yourself it was at one of these bosch believed he would find porter he began with a place on kittridge called the parrot but the bartender a onetime cop himself said he hadnt seen porter since christmas eve next he went to the on lankershim and then saints on cahuenga they knew porter in these places but he hadnt been at either tonight it went like that until two by then bosch had worked his way down into hollywood he was sitting in his car in front of the bullet trying to think of nearby bottleclub locations when his pager went off he checked the number and didnt recognize it he went back into the bullet to use the pay phone the lights in the bar came on after he dialed last call was over bosch yeah its rickard bad time nah im at the bullet hell man then youre close by for what you got dance nah not quite im at a rave behind cahuenga and south of the boulevard couldnt sleep so i thought id do some hunting no dance but i got my eye on one of his old salesmen one of the ones that was on the shake cards in the file names kerwin tyge bosch thought a moment he remembered the name he was one of the juvies the bang team had stopped and checked out tried to scare off the street his name was on one of the file cards in the ice file moore had left behind whats a rave an underground they got a warehouse off this alley a flybynight party digital music theyll run all night til about six next week it will be somewhere else howd you find it theyre easy to find the record stores on melrose put out the phone numbers you call the number get on the list twenty bucks to get in get stoned and dance til dawn he selling black ice nah hes selling sherms out front a sherm was a cigarette dipped in liquid pcp went for twenty bucks a dip and would leave its smoker dusted all night tyge apparently was no longer working for dance i figure we can make a righteous bust rickard said after that we might squeeze dance out of his ass i think dance has blown but the kid might know where its up to you i dont know how important dance is to you where do you want me bosch asked come west on the boulevard and just when you pass cahuenga come south at the very next alley the one that comes down behind the porno shops its dark but youll see the blue neon arrow thats the place im about a half block north in a red pieceofshit camaro nevada plates ill be waiting hafta figure out a scam or something to grab him with the shit you know where the dip is yeah hes got it in a beer bottle in the gutter keeps going in and out brings his clients outside ill think of something by the time you get here bosch hung up and went back out to the car it took him fifteen minutes to get there because of all the cruisers on the boulevard in the alley he parked illegally behind the red camaro he could see rickard sitting low in the drivers seat top of the morning to ya the narc said when bosch slipped into the camaros passenger seat same our boy still around oh yeah seems like hes having a good night too hes selling shermans like theyre the last thing on earth too bad we gotta spoil his fun bosch looked down the dark alley in the intervals of blue light cast by a blinking neon arrow he could see a grouping of people in dark clothes in front of a door in the brick siding of the warehouse occasionally the door would open and someone would go in or come out he could hear the music when the door was open loud technorock a driving bass that seemed to shake the street as his eyes adjusted he saw that the people outside were drinking and smoking cooling off after dancing a few of them held blownup balloons they would lean on the hoods of the cars near the door suck from the balloon and pass it on as if it were a joint the balloons are full of nitrous oxide rickard said laughing gas right they sell it at these raves for five bucks a balloon they can make a couple of grand off one tank stolen from a hospital or dentist a girl fell off a car hood and her balloon of gas shot away into the dark others helped her up bosch could hear their shrieks of laughter that legal its a flopper its legal to processa lot of legit uses for it but its a misdee to consume recreationally we dont even bother with it though somebody wants to suck on it and fall down and split their head open have at it i say why shouldthere he is now the slight figure of a teenager walked through the warehouse door and over to the cars parked along the alley watch him go down rickard said the figure disappeared behind a car dropping down see hes making a dip now hell wait a few minutes til it dries a little and his customer comes out then hell make the deal want to go get him no we take him with just the one sherm thats nothing thats personal possession they wont even keep him overnight in the drunk tank we need him with his dip if we wanna squeeze him good so what do we do you just get back in your car i want you to go back around on cahuenga and come up the alley the other way i think you can get in closer park it and then try to work your way up to be my backup ill come down from this end i got some old clothes in the trunk undercover shit i got a plan bosch then went back to the caprice turned it around and drove out of the alley he drove around the block and came up from the south side he found a spot in front of a dumpster and stopped when he saw the hunchedover figure of rickard moving down the alley harry got out and started moving they were closing in on the warehouse door from both sides but while bosch remained in the shadows rickardnow wearing a greasestained sweatshirt and carrying a bag of laundrywas walking down the center of the alley singing because of the noise from the warehouse bosch wasnt sure but he thought it was percy sledges when a man loves a woman delivered in a drunken slur rickard had the undivided attention of the people standing outside the warehouse door a couple of the stoned girls cheered his singing the distraction allowed bosch to move within four cars of the door and about three cars from the spot where tyge had his dip as he passed the spot rickard stopped his song in midchorus and acted as if he had just spotted a treasure he ducked between the two parked cars and came up with the beer bottle in hand he was about to place it in his bag when the boy moved quickly between the cars and grabbed the bottle rickard refused to let go and spun so that the boys back was now to bosch harry started moving its mine man rickard yelled i put it there bro let it go before it spills go get your own man this heres mine let it go you sure its yours its mine bosch hit the boy forcefully from behind he let go of the bottle and doubled over the trunk of the car bosch kept him pinned there pushing his forearm against the boys neck the bottle stayed in rickards hand none of it spilled well if you say so i guess its yours the narc said and i guess that makes you under arrest bosch pulled his cuffs off his belt and hooked the boy up and then pulled him off the trunk some of the others were gathering around now fuck off people rickard said loudly go back inside and sniff your laughing gas go get deaf this here dont concern you unless you want to go along with this boy to the shit can he bent down to tyges ear and said rightbro when nobody in the crowd moved rickard took a menacing step toward them and they scattered a couple of the girls ran back into the warehouse the music drowned out rickards laugh he then turned around and grabbed tyge by the arm lets go harry lets take your wheels they drove in silence for a while toward the station on wilcox they hadnt discussed it earlier but harry was going to let rickard make the play rickard was riding in the back with the boy in the mirror harry saw he had greasy unkempt brown hair that fell to his shoulders about five years earlier he should have had braces put on his teeth but one look at him and bosch could tell he came from a home where things like that were not a consideration he had a gold earring and an uninterested look on his face but the teeth were what got to bosch crooked and protruding they more than anything else showed the desperation of his life how old are you now kerwin rickard said and dont bother lying we got a file on you at the station i can check eighteen and you can wipe your ass with the file i dont give a shit wooo rickard yelped eighteen looks like we got ourselves an adult here harry no holding hands all the way to the juvie hall well go put this kid in seven thousand see how quick he starts keeping house with one of the heavies seven thousand was what most cops and criminals called the county adult detention center on account of the phone number for inmate information the jail was downtown and it was four floors of noise and hate and violence sitting atop the county sheriffs headquarters somebody was stabbed there every day somebody raped every hour and nothing was ever done about it nobody cared unless you were the one getting raped or stabbed the sheriffs deputies who ran the place called it an nhi detail no humans involved bosch knew if they were going to squeeze this kid that rickard had picked the right way to go we got you bagged and tagged kerwin rickard said theres at least two ounces in here got you cold for possession with intent to sell dude youre gone fuck you the kid drew each word out with sarcasm he was going to go down fighting bosch noticed that rickard was holding the green beer bottle outside the window so the fumes wouldnt fill the car and give them headaches thats not nice kerwin especially when the man driving here is willing to do a deal now if it was me id just let you make your deals with the brothers in seven thousand couple days in there and youll be shaving your legs and walking round in pink underwear they dipped in the hawaiian punch fuck off pig just get me to a phone they were on sunset coming up to wilcox almost there and rickard hadnt even gotten around to what they wanted it didnt look as if the kid was going to deal no matter what they wanted youll get a phone when we feel like giving you a phone youre tough now white boy but it dont last everybody gets broken down inside youll see unless you want to help us out we just want to talk to your pal dance bosch turned onto wilcox the station was two blocks away the kid said nothing and rickard let the silence go for a block before giving another try what do you say kid give an address ill dump this shit right now dont be one of those fools who think seven thousand makes them the man like its some fucking rite of passage it aint kid its just the end of the line that what you want i want you to die bosch pulled into the driveway that led to the stations rear parking lot they would have to process the arrest here first book the evidence then take the kid downtown harry knew they would have to go through with it the kid wasnt talking they had to show him that they werent bluffing bosch didnt get back to his search for porter until four in the morning by then he had had two cups of coffee in the station and was holding his third he was back in the caprice alone and roaming the city rickard had agreed to ferry kerwin tyge downtown the kid had never talked his shell of hardened rejection cop hate and misguided pride never cracked at the station it had become a mission for rickard to break the kid he renewed the threats the questions with a zeal that bosch found disturbing he finally told rickard that it was over he told the narc to book the kid and theyd try again later after stepping out of the interview room the two decided to meet at seven thousand at pm that would give the kid about a tenhour taste of the big house enough time to make a decision now bosch was cruising the bottle clubs the afterhour joints where members brought their own bottles and were charged for the setups the setups of course were a ripoff and some clubs even charged a membership fee but some people just couldnt drink at home alone and some people didnt have much of a home at a stoplight on sunset at western a blur passed the car on the right and a figure lunged over the passenger side of the hood bosch instinctively drew his left hand up to his belt and almost dropped his coffee but then realized the man had begun to rub a newspaper on the windshield half past four in the morning and a homeless man was cleaning his windshield badly the mans efforts only smudged the glass bosch pulled a dollar out of his pocket and handed it out the window to the man when he came around to do the drivers side he waved him away dont worry about it partner he said and the man silently walked away bosch headed off hitting bottle clubs in echo park near the police academy and then chinatown no sign of porter he crossed over the hollywood freeway into downtown thinking of the kid as he passed the county lockup hed be on seven the narco module where the inhabitants were generally less hostile hed probably be okay he saw the big blue trucks pulling out of the garage on the spring street side of thetimes building heading off with another mornings cargo of news he tried a couple of bottle clubs near parker center then one near skid row he was scratching bottom now getting near the end of the line and running out of places to check the last place he stopped was poes which was centrally located on third avenue near skid row thelos angeles times st vibianas and the glass bank towers of the financial district where alcoholics were manufactured wholesale poes did a good business in the morning hours before downtown came alive with hustle and greed poes was on the first floor of a prewar brick walkup that had been tagged for demolition by the community redevelopment agency it had not been earthquakeproofed and retrofitting it would cost more than the building was worth the cra had bought it and was going to knock it down to put up condos that would draw livein residents downtown but the whole thing was on hold another city agency the office of preservation wanted the poe building as it was informally known granted landmark status and was suing to stop the demolition so far they had held up the plan four years poes was still open the four floors above it were abandoned inside the place was a black hole with a long warped bar and no tables poes wasnt a place to sit in a booth with friends it was a place to drink alone a place for executive suicides who needed courage broken cops who couldnt cope with the loneliness they built into their lives writers who could no longer write and priests who could no longer forgive even their own sins it was a place to drink mean as long as you still had the green it cost you five bucks for a stool at the bar and a dollar for a glass of ice to go with your bottle of whiskey a soda setup was three bucks but most of these people took their medicine straight up it was cheaper that way and more to the point it was said that poes was not named after the writer but for the general philosophy of its clientele piss on everything even though it was dark outside stepping into poes was like walking into a cave for a moment bosch was reminded of that first moment after dropping into a vc tunnel in vietnam he stood utterly still by the door until his eyes focused in the dim light and he saw the red leather padding on the bar the place smelled worse than porters trailer the bartender in a wrinkled white shirt and unbuttoned black vest stood to the right backed by the rows of liquor bottles each with the bottle owners name attached on a piece of masking tape a red stem of neon ran along the booze shelf behind the bottles and gave them an eerie glow from the darkness to boschs left he heard shit harry whaddaya doing you looking for me he turned and there was porter at the other end of the bar sitting so he could see whoever came in before they could see him harry walked over he saw a shot glass in front of porter along with a halffilled water glass and a thirdfilled bottle of bourbon there was a twenty and three ones fanned out on the bar as well and a package of camels bosch felt anger rising in his throat as he approached and came up on porters back yeah im looking for you whassup bosch knew he had to do what he had to do before any sympathy could crack through his anger he yanked porters sport coat down over his shoulders so his arms were caught at his sides a cigarette dropped out of his hand to the floor bosch reached around and pulled the gun out of his shoulder holster and put it on the bar whatre you still carrying for lou you pulled the pin remember what you scared of something harry whats going on why are you doing this the bartender started walking down behind the bar to the aid of his club member but bosch fixed him with a cold stare held up his hand like a traffic cop and said cool it its private damned right its a private club and you aint a member its okay tommy porter spoke up i know him ill take care of it a couple of men who had been sitting a few stools from porter got up and moved to the other end of the bar with their bottles and drinks a couple of other drunks were already down there watching but nobody left not with booze still in their jars and it not quite being six oclock yet there would be no place else to go bars wouldnt open until seven and the hour or so until then could last a lifetime no they werent going anywhere this crew would sit there and watch a man murdered if they had to harry cmon porter said cool it yourself we can talk can we can we why didnt you talk when i called the other day how about moore did you have a talk with cal moore look harry bosch spun him around off the stool and face first into the woodpaneled wall he came easier than harry had thought he would and hit the wall hard his nose made a sound like an icecream cone hitting the sidewalk bosch leaned his back against porters back pinning him face first against the wall dont look harry me porter i stood up for you man cause i thought you were i thought you were worth it now i know porter i was wrong you quit on the juan doe i want to know why i want to know whats going on porters voice was muffled by the wall and his own blood he said harry shit i think you broke my nose im bleeding dont worry about it what about moore i know he reported the body porter made some kind of wet snorting sound but bosch just pushed him harder the man stunk of sour body odor booze and cigarettes and bosch wondered how long he had been sitting in poes watching the door im calling the police now the bartender yelled he stood holding the phone out so bosch would see it was a real threat which of course it wasnt the bartender knew if he dialed that phone every stool in the bar would be left spinning as the drunks filed out there would be no one left to scam on the change or to leave quarters for his cup using his body to keep porter pinned to the wall bosch pulled out his badge wallet and held it up i am the police mind your own fucking business the bartender shook his head as if to say what is this fine business coming to and put the phone back next to the cash register the announcement that bosch was a police officer resulted in about half the other customers jerking their drinks down and leaving there were probably warrants out for everybody in the place bosch thought porter was starting to mumble and bosch thought he might be crying again like on the phone thursday morning harry ii didnt think i was doing i had bosch bounced harder against his back and heard porters forehead hit the wall dont start that shit with me porter you were takin care of yourself thats what you were doing and im sick im gonna be sick and right now believe it or not right now the only one that really cares about you is me you fuck you just tell me what you did just tell me what you did and were square it goes nowhere else you go for your stress out and i never see your face again bosch could hear his wet breathing against the wall it was almost as if he could hear him thinking you sure harry you dont have a choice you dont start talking you end up with no job no pension he uhi just theres blood on my shirt its roon bosch pushed harder against him okay okay okay ill tell ya ill tell i just did him a favor thas all and he ended up deadern shit when i heard i uh i couldnt come back in see i didnt know what happened i mean i mean theysomebody could be looking for me i got scared harry im scared i been sitting in bars since i talked to you yesterday i stink like shit and now all this blood i need a napkin i think theyre after me bosch took his weight off him but held one hand pressed against his back so he would not go anywhere he reached back to the bar and took a handful of cocktail napkins off a stack near a bowl of matches he held them over porters shoulder and the broken cop worked his hand loose from his jacket and took them he turned his head away from the wall to press the napkin to his swelling nose harry saw tears on his face and looked away the door to the bar opened then and dawns early gray light shot into the bar a man stood there apparently adjusting to the darkness of the bar as bosch had done bosch saw he was dark complexioned with inkblack hair three tattooed tears dripped down his cheek from the corner of his left eye harry knew he was no banker or lawyer who needed a doublescotch breakfast to start the day he was some kind of player maybe finishing a night collecting for the italians or mexicans and needing something to smooth out the edges the mans eyes finally fell on bosch and porter then to porters gun which was still on the bar the man sized up the situation and calmly and wordlessly backed out through the door fucking great the bartender yelled would you get the hell out of here im losing customers the both of you get the fuck out there was a sign that said toilet and an arrow pointing down a darkened hallway to boschs left he pushed porter that way they turned a corner and went into the mens room which smelled worse than porter there was a mop in a bucket of gray water in the corner but the cracked tile floor was dirtier than the water he pushed porter toward the sink clean yourself up bosch said what was the favor you said you did something for moore tell me about it porter was looking at his blurred reflection in a piece of stainless steel that was probably put in when the management got tired of replacing broken mirrors it wont stop bleeding harry i think its broke forget your nose tell me what you did i uhlook all he did was tell me that he knew some people that would appreciate it if the stiff behind the restaurant didnt get idd for a while just string it out he said for a week or two christ there was no id on the body anyway he said i could do the computer runs on the prints cause he knew they wouldnt bring a match he said just take my time with it and that these people the ones he knew would take care of me he said id get a nice christmas present so i you know i went through the motions last week i wouldnt have gotten anywhere with it anyway you know you saw the file no id no wits no nothing the guyd been dead at least six hours before he got dumped there so what spooked you what happened christmas porter blew his nose into a bouquet of paper towels and this brought more tears to his eyes yeah its broke im not getting any air through i gotta go to a clinic get it set anyway well nothing happened christmas thats the thing i mean moore d been missing for almost a week and i was getting pretty nervous about the whole thing on christmas moore didnt come nobody did then when im walking home from the lucky my neighbor in the trailer next door says to me about how real sorry she was about that dead cop they found i said thanks and went inside and put on the radio i hear its moore and that scares me shitless harry it did porter soaked a handful of towels and began stroking his bloodstained shirt in a manner that bosch thought made him look more pathetic than he was bosch saw his empty shoulder holder and remembered he had left the gun on the bar he was reluctant to go back and get it while porter was talking see i knew moore wasnt no suicide i dont care what theyre putting out at parker i know he didnt do himself like that he was into something so i decided that was enough i called the union and got a lawyer im outta here harry im gonna get cleaned up and go to vegas maybe get in with casino security millies out there with my boy i wanna be close by right bosch thought and always be looking over your shoulder he said youre bleeding again wash your face im going to get some coffee im taking you out of here bosch moved through the door but porter stopped him harry you going to take care of me on this bosch looked at his damaged face a long moment before saying yeah ill do what i can he walked back out to the bar and signaled the bartender who was standing all the way down at the other end smoking a cigarette the man about fifty with faded blue tattoos webbing both forearms like extra veins took his time coming over by then bosch had a tendollar bill on the bar give me a couple coffees to go black put a lot of sugar in one of them bout time you got outta here the bartender nodded at the tendollar bill and im taking out for the napkins too theyre not for cops who go round beatn on people that oughta bout cover it you can just leave that on the bar he poured coffee that looked like it had been sitting in the glass pot since christmas into foam cups bosch went to porters spot at the bar and gathered up the smith thirtyeight and the twentythree dollars he moved back to his tendollar bill and lit a cigarette not realizing bosch was now watching the bartender poured a gagging amount of sugar into both coffees bosch let it slide after snapping plastic covers on the cups the bartender brought them over to bosch and tapped one of the tops a smile that would make a woman frigid on his face this is the one with nohey what is this shit the ten bosch had put down on the bar was now a one bosch blew smoke in the bartenders face as he took the coffees and said thats for the coffee you can shove the napkins just get the fuck out of here the bartender said then he turned and started walking down to the other end of the bar where several of the patrons were impatiently holding their empty glasses up they needed more ice to chill their plasma bosch pushed the door to the restroom open with his foot but didnt see porter he pushed the door to the only stall open and he wasnt there either harry left the room and quickly pushed through the womens restroom door no porter he followed the hallway around another corner and saw a door marked exit he saw drops of blood on the floor regretting his play with the bartender and wondering if hed be able to track porter by calling hospitals and clinics he hit the doors push bar with his hip it opened only an inch or so there was something on the other side holding it closed bosch put the coffees down on the floor and put his whole weight on the door it slowly moved open as the blockage gave way he squeezed through and saw a dumpster had been shoved against the door he was standing in an alley behind poes and the morning light flowing down the alley from the east was blinding there was an abandoned toyota its wheels hood and one door gone sitting dead in the alley there were more dumpsters and the wind was blowing trash around in a swirl and there was no sign of porter bosch sat at the counter at the original pantry drinking coffee picking at a plate of eggs and bacon and waiting for a second wind to come he hadnt bothered with trying to follow porter he knew that there would be no chance knowing bosch wanted him even a brokendown cop like porter would know enough to stay away from the likely places harry would look he would stay in the wind harry had his notebook out and opened to the chronological chart he had constructed the day before but he could not concentrate on it he was too depressed depressed that porter had run from him that he hadnt trusted him depressed that it seemed clear that moore s death was connected to the darkness that was out there at the outer edge of every cops vision moore had crossed over and it had killed him i found out who i was the note bothered him too if moore wasnt a suicide where did it come from it made him think about what sylvia moore had said about the past about how her husband had been snared in a trap he had set for himself he then thought of calling her to tell her what he had learned but discarded the idea for the time being he did not have the answers to questions she would surely ask why was calexico moore murdered who did it it was just after eight oclock bosch left money on the counter and walked out outside two homeless men shook cups in front of him and he acted like they werent even there he drove over to parker center and got into the lot early enough to get a parking space he first checked the robberyhomicide division offices on the third floor but sheehan wasnt in yet next he went up to the fourth to fugitives to pick up where porter would have if he hadnt made his deal with moore fugitives also handled missingpersons reports and bosch always thought there was something symbiotic about that most missing persons were fugitives from something some part of their lives a missingpersons detective named capetillo asked bosch what he needed and harry asked to see the male latin missings for the last ten days capetillo led him to his desk and told him to have a seat while he went to the files harry looked around and his eyes fell on a framed photo of the portly detective posed with a woman and two young girls a family man taped to the wall above the desk was a bullfight poster advertising the lineup for a fight two years earlier at tijuana s bullring by the sea the names of the six matadors were listed down the right side the entire left side of the poster was a reproduction of a painting of a matador turning with a charging bull leading the horns away with the flowing red cape the caption inscribed below the painting said el arte de la muleta the classic veronica bosch turned it was capetillo and he was holding a thin file in one hand excuse me bosch asked the veronica do you know anything about thecorrida de toros the bullfights never been magnificent i go at least four times a year nothing compares to it football basketball nothing the veronica is that move he slyly leads the horns away in mexico the bullfight is called the brave festival you know bosch looked at the file in the detectives hand capetillo opened it and handed bosch a thin stack of papers thats all we have in the last ten days capetillo said your mexicans chicanos a lot dont report their missings to police a cultural thing most just dont trust the cops lot of times when people dont turn up they just figure they went south a lot of people are here illegally they wont call the cops bosch made it through the stack in five minutes none of the reports fit the description of juan doe what about telexes inquiries from mexico now thats something different we keep official correspondence separate i could look why dont you tell me what youre pushing im pushing a hunch i have a body with no identification i think the man may have come from down there maybe mexicali this is a guess more than anything else hang tight capetillo said and he left the cubicle again bosch studied the poster again noticing how the matadors face betrayed no sign of indecision or fear only concentration on the horns of death the bullfighters eyes were flat and dead like a sharks capetillo was back quickly nice hunch i have three reports received in the last two weeks they all concern men that sound like your guy but one more than the others i think we got lucky he handed a single piece of paper to bosch and said this one came from the consulate on olvera street yesterday it was a photocopy of a telex to the consulate by a state judicial police officer named carlos aguila bosch studied the letter which was written in english seeking information regarding the disappearance of fernal gutierrezllosa day laborer mexicali whereabouts unknown last sighting mexicali description foot pounds brown eyes brown hair some gray tattoo right upper chest blue ink ghost symbolcity of lost souls barrio contact carlos aguila mexicali bc bosch reread the page there wasnt much there but it was enough fernal gutierrezllosa disappeared in mexicali on the seventeenth and early the next morning the body of juan doe was found in los angeles bosch looked quickly at the other two pages capetillo had but they dealt with men who were too young to be juan doe he went back to the first sheet the tattoo was the clincher i think this is it he said can i get a copy of course you want me to call down there see if they can send some prints up nah not yet i want to check a few other things out actually he wanted to limit capetillos involvement to just the help he had given theres one thing bosch said you know what this city of lost souls description means this reference to the tattoo yeah basically the tattoo is a barrio symbol fernal gutierrezllosa resided in the barrio ciudad de los personas perdidoscity of lost souls many of the barrio dwellers down there do this mark themselves its similar to graffiti up here only down there they mark themselves and not the frigging walls as much the police down there know what tattoos symbolize what barrios it is fairly common in mexicali when you contact aguila he can tell you maybe he can send you a photo if you need it bosch was silent for a moment as he pretended to reread the consulate paper city of lost souls he thought a ghost he tumbled this piece of information in his mind the way a boy who has found a baseball turns it in his hands to study the seams for wear he was reminded of the tattoo on moore s arm the devil with a halo was that from a mexicali barrio you say the cops there keep track of these tattoos thats right its one of the few decent jobs they do how dyou mean i mean have you ever been down there on a detail its third world man the police uh apparatus i guess youd call it is very primitive by our standards fact it would not surprise me if they have no fingerprints on this man to send you im surprised they even sent anything to the consul here in the first place this aguila he mustve had a hunch like you bosch took one last look at the poster on the wall thanked capetillo for his help and the copy of the consulates telex and then left the office he got on an elevator to go down and saw sheehan already on it the car was crowded and sheehan was at the back behind the pile they didnt talk until they got off on three hey frankie bosch said didnt get a chance to talk to you christmas night whatre you doing here harry im waiting for you you must be running late or do you check in on the fifth floor nowadays that was a little poke at sheehan the iad squads were on the fifth floor it was also to let sheehan know that harry had an idea of what was going on with the moore case since sheehan was going down he had come from either the fifth or sixth floors that was either iad or irving s office or maybe both dont fuck with me bosch reason i havent been in is ive been busy this morning thanks to the games you like to play what do you mean dont worry about it look i dont like you being seen with me in here anyway irving gave me specific instructions about you you are not in this investigation you helped out the other night but it ended there they were in the hallway outside the rhd offices bosch didnt like the sound of sheehans tone he had never known frankie to bow his head to the brass like this cmon frankie lets go get a cup you can tell me whats bugging you nothings bugging me man you forget i worked with you i know how you get your teeth on something and wont let go well im telling you where things stand you were there the night we found him it ended there go back to hollywood bosch took a step toward him and lowered his voice he said but we both know it didnt end there frankie and its not going to end there so if you feel you gotta do it go tell irving i said its so sheehan stared at him for a few seconds and then bosch saw the resolve fade away awright harry cmon in im going to be kicking myself for this later they walked to sheehans desk and bosch pulled a chair from another desk alongside it sheehan took off his coat and put it on a hanger on a rack next to the desk after he sat down adjusted his shoulder holster and folded his arms he said know where ive been all morning the mes trying to work out a deal to keep a lid on this a few hours seems overnight we sprang a leak and already this morning irving s getting calls that we are sitting on a homicide of one of our own officers you wouldnt know anything about this would you harry said only thing i know is ive been thinking about the scene out at the motel and the autopsy being inconclusive like they say and im not thinking suicide anymore youre not thinking anything youre not on it remember and what about this he opened a drawer and brought a file up it was the zorrillo file rickard had shown him the day before dont bother telling me you havent seen this before because then i might take it over to sid and have em run prints on it id bet my wifes diaphragm id find yours youd lose frankie then id have more kids but i wouldnt lose harry bosch waited a beat for him to settle down all this huffin and puffin at me tells me one thing you dont see a suicide either so quit with the bullshit youre right i dont but i got an assistant chief sitting on my ass and hes gotten the bright idea of sticking me with an iad suit on this so its like i got both my feet in buckets of shit before i even start off you saying they dont want this to go anywhere no i am not saying that what are they going to tell thetimes press conference this afternoon irving s going to give it to everybody hell say we are looking at the possibilitythepossibility of homicide fuck giving it to thetimes who said it was thetimes making the noise anyway lucky i guess yeah be careful bosch you slip like that with irving and hell fry your ass hed love to with your record and all the history going back with you i already have to figure out about this file you told irving you didnt know the guy and now we have a file that shows he was doing some digging for you bosch realized he had forgotten to remove the postit tag moore had placed on the file tell irving whatever you want think i care bosch looked down at the file what do you think about this file i think nothing out loud cmon frankie i ask moore to look around on this dope killing and he ends up in a motel with his head in the tub in small pieces it was a very smooth job right down to not a single lift belonging to anybody else being found in that room so what if it was smooth and theres no other prints in my book some guys deserve what they got coming you know there was the break in sheehans defense whether intentional or not he was telling bosch that moore had crossed i need more than that he said in a very low voice you got the weight on you but i dont im a free agent and im going to put it together moore mightve crossed yeah but nobody shouldve put him down on the tiles like that we both know that besides there are other bodies harry could see this had grabbed sheehans attention we can trade bosch said quietly sheehan stood up and said yeah lets go get that coffee five minutes later they were at a table in the secondfloor cafeteria and bosch was telling him about jimmy kapps and juan doe he outlined the connections between moore and juan doe juan doe and mexicali mexicali and humberto zorillo zorillo and black ice black ice and jimmy kapps on and on it went sheehan asked no questions and took no notes until harry was done so what do you think he asked then i think what you think bosch said that moore had crossed maybe he was fronting up here for zorillo the ice man and got so deep he couldnt get out i dont know how it all ties up yet but i still have some ideas i am playing with im thinking a number of things maybe he wanted out and the ice man whacked him maybe he was working that file going to give me something and they whacked him possibilities theres also the possibility that word of the iad investigation your partner chastain was conducting got around and they saw moore as a danger and whacked him sheehan hesitated it was the moment of truth if he discussed the iad investigation he would be breaking enough departmental regs to get shipped permanently out of rhd like harry i could get busted for talking about that sheehan said could end up like you out there in the cesspool its all a cesspool man doesnt matter if youre on the bottom or the top youre still swimming in shit sheehan took a sip of his coffee iad had taken a report this was about two months ago that moore was some way involved in the traffic on the boulevard possibly offering protection possibly a deeper involvement the source was not clear on that two months ago bosch asked didnt they get anything i mean moore was still working the street all this time wasnt there enough to at least put him on a desk look youve got to remember that irving put chastain with me on this but im not with chastain he doesnt do much talking to me all he would tell me was the investigation was in its infancy when moore disappeared he had no proof substantiating or discrediting the claim you know how hard he worked it i assume very hard hes iad hes always looking for a badge to pull and this looked like more than just departmental charges this would have gone to the da so i assume he had a hardon for it he just didnt get anything moore mustve been very good not good enough bosch thought obviously who was the source you dont need that you know i do if im going to be a free agent on this i have to know whats what sheehan hesitated but didnt make a good show of it it was anonymousa letter but chastain said it was the wife thats what he figured she turned him in hows he so sure the details of the letter whatever they were chastain said they would only be known by someone close to him he told me it wasnt unusual it often comes from the spouse but he said that a lot of times its bogus a wife or husband will report something totally false you know if they are going through a divorce or something just to fuck the other up with work so he spent a lot of time just seeing if that was the case here cause moore and his wife were splitting up he said she never admitted it but he was sure she sent it he just never got very far with substantiating what was in it bosch thought of sylvia he was sure they were wrong did you talk to the wife tell her the id was confirmed no irving did that last night he tell her about the autopsy bout it not being suicide i dont know about that see i dont get to sit down with irving like you with me here and ask him everything that comes into my head bosch was wearing out his welcome just a few more frankie did chastain focus on black ice no when we got this file of yours yesterday he about shit his pants i got the feeling he was hearing about all that side of it for the first time i kind of enjoyed that harry if there was anything to enjoy about any of this well now you can tell him all the rest i told you no chance this conversation didnt take place i gotta try to put it all together like it was my own before i hand anything over to him bosch was thinking quickly what else was there to ask what about the note thats the part that doesnt fit now if it was no suicide then wheres this note come from yeah thats the problem thats why we gave the coroner such a hard time far as we can guess he either had it all along in his back pocket or whoever did him made him write it i dont know yeah bosch thought a moment would you write a note like that if somebody was about to put you down on the floor i dont know man people do things youd never expect when theyve got the gun on them they alwaysve got hope that things might turn out all right thats the way i see it bosch nodded but he didnt know if he agreed or not i gotta go sheehan said let me know what comes up bosch nodded and sheehan left him there with two cups of coffee on the table a few moments later sheehan was back you know i never told you it was too bad about what happened with you we could use you back here harry ive always thought that bosch looked up at him yeah frankie thanks the medfly eradication project center was at the edge of east la on san fernando road not far from countyusc med center which housed the morgue bosch was tempted to drop by to see teresa but he figured he should give her time to cool he also figured that decision was cowardly but he didnt change it he just kept driving the project center was a former county psychiatric ward which had been abandoned to that cause years earlier when supreme court rulings made it virtually impossible for the governmentin the form of the policeto take the mentally ill off the streets and hold them for observation and public safety the san fernando road ward was closed as the country consolidated its psych centers it had been used since for a variety of purposes including a set for a slasher movie about a haunted nuthouse and even a temporary morgue when an earthquake damaged the facility at countyusc a few years back bodies had been stored in two refrigerated trucks in the parking lot because of the emergency situation county administrators had to get the first trucks they could get their hands on painted on the side of one of them had been the words live maine lobsters bosch remembered reading about it in the only in la column in thetimes there was a checkin post at the entry manned by a state police officer bosch rolled down the window badged him and asked who the head medfly eradicator was he was directed to a parking space and an entrance to the administration suite the door to the suite still said no unescorted patients on it bosch went through and down a hallway nodding to and passing another state officer he came to a secretarys desk where he identified himself again to the woman sitting there and asked to see the entomologist in charge she made a quick phone call to someone and then escorted harry into a nearby office introducing him to a man named roland edson the secretary hovered near the door with a shocked look on her face until edson finally told her that would be all when they were alone in the office edson said i kill flies for a living not people detective is this a serious visit edson laughed hard and bosch forced a smile to be polite edson was a small man in a shortsleeved white shirt and pale green tie his bald scalp had been freckled by the sun and was scarred by misjudgments he wore thick rimless glasses that magnified his eyes and made him somewhat resemble his quarry behind his back his subordinates probably called him the fly bosch explained that he was working a homicide case and could not tell edson a lot of the background because the investigation was of a highly confidential nature he warned him that other investigators might be back with more questions he asked for some general information about the breeding and transport of sterile fruit flies into the state hoping that the appeal for expert advice would get the bureaucrat to open up edson responded by giving him much of the same information teresa corazón had already provided but bosch acted as if it was all new to him and took notes heres the specimen here detective edson said holding up a paperweight it was a glass block in which a fruit fly had been perpetually cast like a prehistoric ant caught in amber bosch nodded and steered the interview specifically toward mexicali the entomologist said the breeding contractor there was a company called envirobreed he said envirobreed shipped an average of thirty million flies to the eradication center each week how do they get here bosch asked in the pupal stage of course of course but my question is how this is the stage in which the insect is nonfeeding immobile it is what we call the transformation stage between larva and imagoadult this works out quite well because it is an ideal point for transport they come in incubators if you will environment boxes we call them and then of course shortly after they get here metamorphosis is completed and they are ready to be released as adults so when they get here they have already been dyed and irradiated that is correct i said that and they are in the pupal stage not larva larvae is the plural detective but yes that is essentially correct i said that also bosch was beginning to think edson was essentially an officious prick he was sure they definitely called him the fly around here okay harry said so what if here in la i found a larvae i mean a larva that was dyed but not irradiated is that possible edson was silent a moment he didnt want to speak too soon and be wrong bosch was getting the idea that he was the type of guy who watched jeopardy on the tube each night and barked out the answers ahead of the contestants even if he was alone well detective any given scenario is possible i would however say the example you just gave is highly unlikely as i said our suppliers send the pupae packages through an irradiation machine before they are shipped here in these packages we often find larvae mixed with the pupae because it would generally be impossible to completely separate the two but these larvae samplings have been through the same irradiation as the pupae so no i dont see it so if i had a person who on their body carried a single pupa that had been dyed but not irradiated that person would not have come from here right yes that would be my answer would yes detective thatis my answer then where would this person have come from edson gave it some thought first he used the eraser end of a pencil he had been fiddling with to press his glasses up on the bridge of his nose i take it this person is dead you having introduced yourself as a homicide detective and obviously being unable to ask the person this question yourself you should be on jeopardy mr edson its doctor anyway i couldnt begin to guess where the person would have picked up this specimen you speak of he could have been from one of the breeders you mentioned down in mexico or over in hawaii couldnt he yes thats a possibility one of them and whats another well mr bosch you saw the security we have around here frankly there are some people who are not happy with what we are doing some extremists believe nature should take its course if the medfly comes to southern california who are we to try to eradicate it some people believe we have no business being in this business there have been threats from some groups anonymous but nevertheless threats to breed nonsterile medflies and release them causing a massive infestation now if i were going to do that i might dye them to obfuscate my opponent edson was pleased with himself on that one but bosch didnt buy it it did not fit with the facts but he nodded indicating to edson that he would give it some consideration and thought then he said tell me how do these deliveries from the breeders get here for example how do they get here from the place down in mexicali you deal with edson said that at the breeding facility thousands of pupae were packed into plastic tubes resembling sixfootlong sausages the tubes were then strung in cartons complete with incubators and humidifiers the environment boxes were sealed at the envirobreed lab under the scrutiny of a usda inspector and then trucked across the border and north to los angeles the deliveries from envirobreed came two to three times a week depending on availability of supply the cartons are not inspected at the border bosch asked they are inspected but not opened it could endanger the product if the cartons were opened each carton contains a carefully controlled environment you understand but as i said the cartons are sealed under the eye of government inspectors and each carton is reinspected upon the breaking of such seals at the eradication center to make sure there has been no tampering um at the border the border patrol checks the seal numbers and cartons against the drivers bill of lading and our separate notification of transport crossing its very thorough detective bosch the system was all hashed out at the highest levels bosch said nothing for a while he wasnt going to debate the security of the system but he wondered who designed it at the highest levels the scientists or the border patrol if i was to go down there to mexicali could you get me into envirobreed impossible edson said quickly you have to remember these are private contractors we get all our bred flies from privately owned facilities though we have a state usda inspector at each facility and state entomologists such as myself make routine visits we cannot order them to open their doors to an inquiry by police or anyone for that matter without showing notice of an infraction of our contract in other words detective bosch tell me what they did and i will tell you if i can get you in there bosch didnt answer he wanted to tell edson as little as possible he changed the subject these environment boxes that the bug tubes come in how big are they he asked oh theyre a pretty decent size we generally use a forklift when unloading deliveries can you show me one edson looked at his watch and said i suppose that is possible i dont know what has come in if anything bosch stood up to force the issue edson finally did too he led harry out of the office and down another hallway past more offices and labs that had once been the holding pens for the insane the addicted and the abandoned harry recalled that once while a patrolman he had walked down this same hallway escorting a woman he had arrested on mount fleming where she was climbing the steel frame behind the firsto of the hollywood sign she had a nylon cord with her already tied into a noose at one end a few years later he read in the newspaper that after getting out of patton state hospital she had gone back to the sign and done the job he had interrupted must be tough edson said working homicides bosch said what he always said when people said that to him sometimes its not so bad at least the victims i deal with are out of their misery edson didnt say anything else the hall ended at a heavy steel door which he pushed open they walked out onto a loading dock that was inside a large hangarlike building about thirty feet away there were a half dozen or so workers all latinos placing white plastic boxes on wheeled dollies and then pulling them through a set of double doors on the other side of the unloading area bosch noted that each of the boxes was just about the size of a coffin the boxes were first being removed from a white van with a miniforklift on the side of the van the word envirobreed was painted in blue the drivers door was open and a white man stood watching the work another white man with a clipboard was at the end of the truck bending down to check numbers on the seals of each of the boxes and then making notes on the clipboard were in luck edson said a delivery in process the environment boxes are taken into our lab where the m ampm process thats what we call metamorphosis around here is completed edson pointed through the open garage doors to a row of six orange pickup trucks parked outside in the lot the mature flies are placed in covered buckets and we use our fleet to take them to the attack areas they are released by hand right now the attack zone is about one hundred square miles we are dropping fifty million sterile flies a week more if we can get them ultimately the steriles will overwhelm the wild fly population and breed it out of existence there was a note of triumph in the entomologists voice would you like to speak with the envirobreed driver edson said i am sure he would be ha no bosch said i just wanted to see how it is done id appreciate it doctor if you kept my visit confidential as he said this bosch noticed the envirobreed driver was looking right at him the mans face was deeply lined and tanned and his hair was white he wore a straw plantation hat and smoked a brown cigarette bosch returned the stare knowing full well that he had been made he thought he saw a slight smile on the drivers face then the man finally broke away his stare and went back to watching the unloading process then is there anything else i can do for you detective edson said no doc thanks for your cooperation im sure you know your way out edson turned and went back in through the steel door harry put a cigarette in his mouth but left it unlit he waved a nattering of flies probably pink medflies he thought away from his face went down the loadingdock stairs and walked out through the garage door driving back toward downtown bosch decided to get it over with and face teresa he pulled into the countyusc parking lot and spent ten minutes looking for a spot big enough to put the caprice in he finally found one in the back where the lot is on a rise overlooking the old railroad yard he sat in the car for a few moments thinking about what to say and smoking and looking down at all the rusted boxcars and iron tracks he saw a group ofcholos in their oversized white tshirts and baggy pants making their way through the yard the one carrying a spray can dropped back from the others and along one of the old boxcars sprayed a scrip it was in spanish but bosch understood it it was the gangs imprimatur its philosophy laugh now cry later he watched them until they had moved behind another line of boxcars he got out and went into the morgue through the rear door where the deliveries are made a security guard nodded after seeing his badge today was a good day inside the smell of disinfectant had the upper hand over the odor of death harry walked past the doors to refrigeration rooms one and two and then through a door to a set of stairs that led up to the secondfloor administration offices bosch asked the secretary in the chief medical examiners office if dr corazón could see him the woman whose pale skin and pinkish hair made her resemble some of the clients around the place spoke quietly on the phone and then told him to go in teresa was standing behind her desk looking out the window she had the same view bosch had of the railroad yard and may have even seen him coming but from the second floor she also had a view that spanned the area from the towers of downtown to mt washington bosch noticed how clear the towers were in the distance it was a good day outside as well im not talking to you teresa announced without turning around cmon im not then whyd you let me in to tell you i am not talking to you and that i am very angry and that you have probably compromised my position as chief medical examiner cmon teresa i hear you have a press conference later today it will work out he couldnt think of anything else to say she turned around and leaned back against the windowsill she looked at him with eyes that couldve carved his name on a tombstone he could smell her perfume all the way across the room and of course i have you to thank for that not me i heard irving called the press con dont fuck with me harry we both know what you did with what i told you and we both know that little shit irving automatically thinks i did it i now have to consider myself seriously fucked as far as the permanent job goes take a good look around the office harry last time youll ever see me here bosch had always noticed how many of the professional women he encountered mostly cops and lawyers turned profane when arguing he wondered if they felt it might put them on the same level as the men they were battling it will work out he said what are you talking about all he has to do is tell a few commissioners that i leaked information from a confidential uncompleted investigation to the press and that will eliminate me completely from consideration listen he cant be sure it was you and hell probably think it was me bremmer thetimes guy who stirred this all up we go back some irving will know so quit worrying about it i came to see if you want to have lunch or something wrong move he saw her face turn red with pure anger lunch or something are you kidding are youyou just told me we are the two likely suspects on this leak and you want me to sit with you in a restaurant do you know what could hey teresa have a nice press conference bosch cut in he turned around and headed to the door on the way into downtown his pager went off and bosch noticed the number was ninetyeights direct line he must be worried about his statistics harry thought he decided to ignore the page he also turned the motorola radio in the car off he stopped at amariscos truck parked on alvarado and ordered two shrimp tacos they were served on corn tortillas baja style and bosch savored the heavy cilantro in the salsa a few yards from the truck stood a man reciting scripture verses from memory on top of his head was a cup of water that nestled comfortably in his seventiesstyle afro and did not spill he reached up for the cup and took a drink from time to time but never stopped bouncing from book to book of the new testament before each quote he gave his listeners the chapter and verse numbers as a reference at his feet was a glass fishbowl half full of coins when he was done eating bosch ordered a coke to go and then dropped the change into the fishbowl he got a god bless you back the hall of justice took up an entire block across from the criminal courts building the first six floors housed the sheriffs department and the top four the county jail anyone could tell this from the outside not just because of the bars behind the windows but because the top four floors looked like an abandoned burnedout shell as if all the hate and anger held in those unairconditioned cells had turned to fire and smoke and stained the windows and concrete balustrades forever black it was a turnofthecentury building and its stoneblock construction gave it an ominous fortresslike appearance it was one of the only buildings in downtown that still had human elevator operators an old black woman sat on a padded stool in the corner of each of the woodpaneled cubicles and pulled the doors open and worked the wheel that leveled the elevator with each floor it stopped at seven thousand bosch said to the operator as he stepped on it had been some time since he had been in the hall and he could not remember her name but he knew she had been working the elevators here since before harry was a cop all of the operators had she opened the door on the sixth floor where bosch saw rickard as soon as he stepped out the narc was standing at the glass window at the checkin counter putting his badge case into a slide drawer here you go bosch said and quickly put his badge in the drawer hes with me rickard said into the microphone the deputy behind the glass exchanged the badges for two visitor clearance badges and slid them out bosch and rickard clipped them to their shirts bosch noticed they were cleared to visit the high power block on the tenth floor high power was where the most dangerous criminal suspects were placed while awaiting trial or to be shipped out to state prisons following guilty verdicts they began walking down a hall to the jail elevator you got the kid in high power bosch asked yeah i know a guy told him one day thats all we needed the kids going to be shitless hes going to tell you everything he knows about dance they took the security elevator up this one operated by a deputy bosch figured it had to be the worst job in law enforcement when the door opened on ten they were met by another deputy who checked their badges and had them sign in then they moved through two sets of sliding steel doors to an attorneys visiting area which consisted of a long table with benches running down both sides of it there was also a foothigh divider running lengthwise down the table at the far end of the table a female attorney sat on one side leaning toward the divider and whispering to a client who cupped his ears with his hands to hear better the muscles on the inmates arms bulged and stretched the sleeves of his shirt he was a monster on the wall behind them was a sign that readno touchingkissingreaching across the divider there was also another deputy at the far end leaning against the wall his own massive arms folded and watching the lawyer and her client as they waited for the deputies to bring out tyge bosch became aware of the noise through the barred door behind the visiting table he could hear a hundred voices competing and echoing in a metallic din there were steel doors banging somewhere and occasionally an unintelligible shout a deputy walked up to the barred door and said itll be a few minutes fellas we have to get him out of medical the deputy was gone before either of them could ask what happened bosch didnt even know the kid but felt his stomach tighten he looked over at rickard and saw he was smiling well see how things have changed now the narc cop said bosch didnt understand the delight rickard seemed to take in this for bosch it was the low end of the job dealing with desperate people and using desperate tactics he was here because he had to be it was his case but he didnt get it with rickard so how come youre doing this what do you want rickard looked over at him what do i want i want to know whats going on i think youre the only one that might know so if i can help out ill help out if it costs this kid his asshole then thats the cost but what i want to know from you is what is happening here what did cal do and whats going to be done about it bosch leaned back and tried to think for a few moments about what to say he heard the monster at the end of the table start to raise his voice something about not accepting the offer the deputy took a step toward him dropping his arms to his sides the inmate went quiet the deputys sleeves were rolled up tight to reveal his impressive biceps on his bulging left forearm bosch could see the cl tattoo almost like a brand on his white skin harry knew that publicly deputies who had the tattoo claimed the letters stood for club lynwood after the sheriffs station in the ganginfested la suburb but he knew the letters also stood forchango luchador monkey fighter the deputy was a gang member himself albeit one sanctioned to carry weapons and paid by the county bosch looked away he wished he could light a cigarette but the county had passed a nosmoking code even in the jail it had nearly caused an inmate riot look he said to rickard i dont know what to tell you about moore im working on it but im not you know what i mean thing is it runs across two cases i do have so its unavoidable if this kid can give me dance then its a help i could look at dance for my two cases maybe even moores but i dont know that i do know and they will go public with this today that moore looks like a homicide what they wont go public with is that he crossed thats why iad was sniffing around he crossed cant be rickard said but there was no conviction in it idve known you cant know people that well man everybodys got a private room so whats parker center going to do i dont know i dont think they know what to do i think they wanted to let it go as suicide but the me started making waves so theyll call it homicide but i dont think they are going to put the dirty laundry basket out there on spring street for every reporter in town to pick through well they better get their shit together im not going to stand by i dont care if he crossed man ive seen him do things he was a good cop ive seen him go into a gallery and take out four dealers without a backup ive seen him step between a pimp and his property and take the punch meant for her pop his teeth right onto the sidewalk i been with him when he blew nine stoplights trying to get a wretched old hype to the hospital before he went out on a heroin overdose those arent things a cop on the pad does so what im saying is that if he crossed then i think he was trying to cross back and thats why somebody did him he stopped then and bosch didnt interrupt the silence they both knew that once you cross you can never come back bosch could hear footsteps coming toward the bars rickard said they better show me something down there at parker not let this thing go or ill show them something bosch wanted to say something but the deputy was at the door with tyge he looked like he had aged ten years in the last ten hours now he had a distance in his eyes that reminded bosch of men he had seen and known in vietnam there was also a bruise high on his left cheekbone the door was slid open by means of unseen electronics and the boyman walked to the bench after the deputy pointed the way he sat down tentatively and seemed purposely to keep his eyes away from rickard hows it hanging kerwin rickard asked now the boy looked at rickard and his eyes made boschs stomach knot he remembered the first night he had spent in mclaren youth hall as a boy the pure fear and screaming loneliness and there he had been surrounded by kids most of them nonviolent this boy had been surrounded for the last twelve hours by wild animals bosch felt ashamed to be part of this but said nothing it was rickards show look my man i know youre probably having a notsofun time in there thats why we came by tsee if you changed your mind any about what we discussed last night rickard was speaking very low so the monster at the end would not hear when the boy said nothing gave no indication that he even heard rickard pressed on kerwin you want out of here heres your man mr harry bosch hell let me drop the whole thing even though it was a righteous bust if you talk to us about this cat dance here lookit here rickard unfolded a piece of white paper from his shirt pocket it was a standard casefiling form from the district attorneys office man i have fortyeight hours to file a case on you cause of the weekend thats puts it over til monday this here is the paperwork about you i havent done nothing with it cause i wanted to check with you one more time to see if you wanted to help yourself out if you dont then ill go file it and this will be your home for the nextprobably youre looking at a year with good time rickard waited and nothing happened a year what do you think youll be like after a year back in there kerwin the boy looked down for a moment and then the tears rolled down his cheeks go to hell he managed to say in a strangled voice bosch already was there he would remember this one for a long time he realized that he was clenching his teeth and tried to relax his jaw he couldnt rickard leaned forward to say something to the boy but bosch put his hand on his shoulder to stop him fuck it bosch said cut him loose what were dropping it the fuck you talking about the boy looked over at bosch an expression of skepticism on his face but it was no act with bosch he felt sick at what they had done look rickard said we got two ounces of pcp off this asshole hes mine if he dont want to help out then too fucking bad he goes back into the zoo no he doesnt and then bosch leaned close to rickard so the deputy behind the boy could not hear no he doesnt rickard were taking him out now do it or im going to fuck you up what did you say ill go to the fifth floor with it this boy shouldve never been up here with that charge thats on you rickard ill make the complaint your connection in here will get burned too you want that just because you couldnt get this kid to talk you think iads going to give a shit about a little punk pusher no but theyll give a shit about bagging you theyll love you youll come out walking slower than this boy harry leaned back away from him nobody said anything for a few moments and bosch could see rickard thinking it through trying to decide if it was a bluff a guy like you going to iad i cant see it thats the risk you take rickard looked down at the paper in his hand and then slowly crumpled it okay my man but you better put me on the list what list the one you got of people you have to watch your back with bosch stood up and so did rickard were cutting him loose rickard said to the guard bosch pointed to the boy and said i want an escort with this man until he is out of there got it the deputy nodded the boy said nothing it took an hour to get him out after rickard signed the appropriate papers and they got their badges back they waited wordlessly by the glass window on the seventh floor bosch was disgusted with himself he had lost sight of the art solving cases was simply getting people to talk to you not forcing them to talk he had forgotten that this time you can go if you want he said to rickard as soon as he walks out that door and youve got him im gone want nothing to do with him but i want to see him leave with you bosch in case any of this comes back on me yeah thats smart yes it is but you stillve got a lot to learn rickard everything isnt black and white not everybody has to be ground into the sidewalk you take a kid like that and spare me the lesson bosch i might have a lot to learn but it wont be from you youre a class a fuckup think the only thing you could teach me is how to climb down the ladder no thanks sure bosch said and walked to the other side of the room where there was a bench he sat down and fifteen minutes later the boy came out he walked between rickard and bosch to the elevator outside the hall of justice rickard headed off to his car after simply saying to bosch fuck you right bosch said he stood on the sidewalk lit a cigarette and offered one to the boy he declined im not telling you anything the boy said i know thats cool you want me to take you anywhere a real doctor a lift back to hollywood hollywoods fine they walked to boschs car which was parked two blocks away at parker center and he took third street toward hollywood they were halfway there before either one spoke you have a place where do you want me to drop you anywhere no place no family nope what will you do whatever harry turned north on western they were silent for another fifteen minutes or so until bosch pulled to a stop in front of the hideaway whats this sit tight ill only be a minute inside the office the manager tried to rent bosch room seven but harry flipped him his badge and told him try again the manager who was still wearing a dingy sleeveless tshirt gave him the key to room thirteen he went back to the car and got in and gave the boy the key he also took out his wallet youve got a room in there for a week bosch said for what its worth which you probably dont think is much my advice is that you think about things and then get as far away from this town as you can there are better places to live than this the boy looked at the key in his hand bosch then handed him all the money he had which was only what you give me a room and money and you think im going to talk to you ive seen tv man the whole thing was a hoax you and that guy dont misunderstand kid im doing this because its something that i need to do it doesnt mean i think what you do for a living is okay i dont if i ever see you out on the street again im going to come down on you its a pretty fucking desperate chance but its a chance just the same do with it what you want you can go its no hoax the boy opened the car door and got out he looked back in at bosch then whyre you doing it i dont know i guess cause you told him to go to hell i shouldve said that and i didnt i gotta go the boy looked at him a moment before speaking you know man dances gone i dont know why youre all worried about him look kid i didnt do i know harry just looked at him he left man left town he said our source split and so he went down to see if he could get the thing going again you know he wants to step up and be the source now down he said mexico but thats all i know hes gone thats why i was doing sherms the boy closed the door and disappeared into the courtyard of the motel bosch sat there thinking and rickards question came back to him where would the boy be in a year then he thought of himself staying in rundown motels so many years ago bosch had made it through had survived there was always the chance he restarted the car and pulled out talking to the kid sealed it bosch knew he was going to mexico all the spokes on the wheel pointed to the hub the hub was mexicali but then hed known that all along he drove to the station on wilcox trying to determine a strategy he knew he would have to contact aguila the state judicial police officer who had sent the letter identifying juan doe to the consulate he would also have to contact the dea which had provided the intelligence report to moore he would have to get the trip cleared by pounds but he knew that might end it right there he would have to work around that in the bureau the homicide table was empty it was after four on a friday and a holiday week as well with no new cases the detectives would clear out as soon as possible to go home to families and lives outside the copshop harry could see pounds in his glass booth his head was down and he was writing on a piece of paper using his ruler to keep his sentences on a straight line bosch sat down and checked through a pile of pink message slips at his spot nothing needing an immediate return there were two from bremmer at thetimes but he had left the name jon marcusa code they had once worked out so it would not become known that the reporter was calling for bosch there were a couple from das who were prosecuting cases harry had worked and needed information or the location of evidence there was a message that teresa had called but he looked at the time on the note and saw that he had seen her since then he guessed that she had called to tell him she wasnt talking to him there was no message from porter and no message from sylvia moore he took out the copy of the inquiry from mexicali that the missingpersons detective capetillo had given him and dialed the number carlos aguila had provided the number was a general exchange for the sjp office his spanish was unconfident despite his recent refresher and it took bosch five minutes of explanations before he was connected to the investigations unit and asked once again for aguila he didnt get him instead he got a captain who spoke english and explained that aguila was not in the office but would return later and would also be working saturday bosch knew that the cops in mexico worked sixday weeks can i be of help the captain asked bosch explained that he was investigating a homicide and was answering the inquiry aguila had sent to the consulate in los angeles the description was similar to the body he had the captain explained that he was familiar with the case that he had taken the report before handing the case to aguila bosch asked whether there were fingerprints available to confirm the identification but the captain said there were none chalk one up for capetillo bosch thought perhaps you have a photograph from your morgue of this man that you could send to us the captain said we could make identification from the family of mr gutierrezllosa yes i have photos the letter said gutierrezllosa was a laborer yes he found day work at the circle where employers come to find workers beneath the statue of benito juarez do you know if he worked at a place a business called envirobreed it does business with the state of california there was a long silence before the mexican replied i am sorry i do not know of his work history i have taken notes and will discuss this with investigator aguila upon his return if you send the photographs we will act promptly on securing positive identification i will personally expedite this matter and contact you now bosch let silence fill the phone connection captain i didnt get your name gustavo grena director of investigations mexicali captain grena please tell aguila that he will have the photos tomorrow that soon yes tell him im bringing them down myself investigator bosch this is not necessary i believe dont worry captain grena bosch cut him off tell him i will be there by early afternoon no later as you wish bosch thanked him and hung up he looked up and saw pounds staring at him through the glass in his office the lieutenant raised his thumb and his eyebrows in an inquiring pleading way bosch looked away a laborer bosch thought fernal gutierrezllosa was a day laborer who got jobs at the circle whatever that was how did a day laborer fit perhaps he was a mule who brought black ice across the border and perhaps he had not been a part of the smuggling operation at all perhaps he had done nothing to warrant his death other than to be somewhere he should not have been seen something he should not have seen what bosch had were just parts of the whole what he needed was the glue that would correctly hold them together when he had first received his gold shield he had a partner on the robbery table in van nuys who told him that facts werent the most important part of an investigation the glue was he said the glue was made of instinct imagination sometimes guesswork and most times just plain luck two nights earlier bosch had looked at the facts that lay inside a rundown motel room and from them extrapolated a cops suicide he now knew hed been wrong he considered the facts again along with everything else he had collected and this time he saw a cops murder as one of several connected murders if mexicali was the hub of the wheel with so many spokes then moore was the bolt that held the wheel on he took out his notebook and looked up the name of the dea agent who was listed on the intelligence report moore had put in the zorrillo file he then got the deas local number out of his rolodex and dialed it the man who answered asked who was calling when bosch asked for corvo tell him its the ghost of calexico moore one minute later a voice said whos this corvo look you want to talk give me an id otherwise i hang up bosch identified himself whats with the ruse man never mind i want to meet you havent given me a reason yet you want a reason okay tomorrow morning im going to mexicali im going after zorrillo i could use some help from somebody who knows his shit i thought you might want to talk first being that you were cal moores source who says i even knew the guy you took my call didnt you you also were passing dea intelligence to him he told me bosch i spent seven years under you trying to bluff me uhuh try some of the eightball dealers on hollywood boulevard they might buy your line look man at seven oclock ill be at the code seven in the back bar after that ill be heading south its your choice if i see you i see you and if i decide to show up how will i know you dont worry ill know you youll be the guy who still thinks hes undercover when he hung up harry looked up and saw pounds hovering near the homicide table standing there reading the latest cap report another sore subject for the divisions statisticians crimes against persons meaning all crimes of violence were growing at a rate faster than the overall crime rate that meant not only was crime going up but the criminals were becoming meaner more prone to violence bosch noticed the white dust on the upper part of the lieutenants pants it was there often and was cause for great comical debate and derision in the squad room some of the dicks said he was probably blowing coke up his nose and was just sloppy about it this was especially humorous because pounds was one of the departments bornagains others said the mystery dust was from sugar doughnuts that he secretly scarfed down in the glass booth after closing the blinds so no one would see bosch though figured it out once he identified the odor that was always about pounds harry believed the lieutenant had the habit of putting baby powder on in the morning before he put on his shirt and tiebut after putting on his pants pounds looked away from his report and said in a phoney matteroffact voice so hows it looking getting anywhere with the cases bosch smiled reassuringly and nodded but said nothing hed make pounds work for it well whats up oh some things have you heard from porter today porter no why forget about him bosch hes a mutt he cant help you what have you got you havent filed any updates i just went through the box nothing from you there ive been busy lieutenant i got something going on jimmy kapps and i got an id and possible death scene on porters last case the one dumped in the alley off sunset last week im close to knowing who and why maybe tomorrow on both of them im going to work through the weekend if thats okay with you excellent by all means take the time you need ill fill the overtime authorization out today thanks but why juggle the cases why dont you pick the one you think is easier to complete we need to clear a case i think the cases are related thats why are you then pounds held up his hand signaling bosch not to speak better come into my office for this after sitting down behind his glasstopped desk pounds immediately picked up his ruler and began manipulating it in his hand okay harry whats going on bosch was going to wing it he tried to make his voice sound as though he had hard evidence to back everything he was saying truth was it was all a lot of speculation and not a lot of glue he sat down in the chair in front of the lieutenants desk he could smell the baby powder on the other man jimmy kapps was a payback found out yesterday that he set up a bust on a competitor named dance he was putting black ice out on the street jimmy apparently didnt like that cause hes trying to make hawaiian ice the growth market so he snitched dance off to the bang guys only after dance got taken down the da kicked the case a bad bust he walked four days later kapps gets the whack okay okay pounds said sounds good dance is your suspect then until i come up with something better hes in the wind okay now how does this tie in with the juan doe case the dea says the black ice that dance was putting out comes from mexicali i got a tentative id from the state police down there looks like our juan doe was a guy named gutierrezllosa he was from mexicali a mule possibly couple things dont fit with that the state police down there carried him as a day laborer maybe he went for the big money a lot of them do maybe and you think he got whacked back a payback for kapps maybe pounds nodded so far so good bosch thought they were both silent for a few moments pounds finally cleared his throat thats quite a lot of work for two days harry very good now where do you go from here i want to go after dance and get the juan doe id confirmed he trailed off he wasnt sure how much to give pounds he knew he was going to keep his trip to mexicali out of it you said dance is in the wind im told that by a source im not sure i plan to go looking this weekend fine bosch decided to open the door a little further theres more to it if you want to hear it its about cal moore pounds put the ruler down on the desk folded his arms and leaned back his posture signaled caution they were stepping into an area where careers could be permanently damaged arent we getting on thin ice here the moore case is not ours and i dont want it lieutenant ive got these two but it keeps coming up if you dont want to know fine i can deal with it no no i want you to tell me i just dont like this kind of uh entanglement thats all yeah entanglement is a good word anyway like i said it was the bang crew that made the dance bust moore wasnt there until after it went down but it was his crew after that you have moore finding the body on the juan doe case cal moore found the body pounds said i didnt see that in porters book hes in there by badge number anyway he was the one that found the body dumped there so youve got his presence around both of these cases then the day after he finds juan doe in the alley he checks into that motel and gets his brains splattered in the bathtub i suppose youve heard rhd now says it was no suicide pounds nodded but he had a paralysed look on his face he had thought he was going to get a summary of a couple of case investigations not this somebody whacked him too bosch continued so now you have three cases you have kapps then juan doe then moore and you have dance in the wind bosch knew he had said enough he could now sit back and watch poundss mind go to work he knew that the lieutenant knew that he should probably pick up the phone and call irving to ask for assistance or at least direction but pounds knew that a call like that would result in rhd taking jurisdiction over the kapps and juan doe cases and the rhd dicks would take their sweetass time about it pounds wouldnt see any of the cases closed out for weeks what about porter whats he say about all of this bosch had been doing his best to keep porter clear he didnt know why porter had fallen and had lied but somewhere inside bosch still felt something maybe it was that last questionharry you going to take care of me on this i havent found porter bosch lied no answer on his phone but i dont think hed had much time to put all of this together pounds shook his head disdainfully of course not he probably was on a drunk bosch didnt say anything it was in poundss court now listen harry youre not youre being straight with me here right i cant afford to have you running around like a loose cannon ive got it all right bosch knew that what he meant was he wanted to know how badly he could be fucked if this went to shit bosch said you know what i know there are two cases probably three including moore out there to be cleared you want em cleared in six eight weeks then ill write up the paper and you can ship it to parker center if you want to get them cleared by the first like you said then let me have the four days pounds was staring off somewhere above boschs head and using the ruler to scratch himself behind the ear he was making a decision okay he finally said take the weekend and see what you can do well see where things stand monday we might have to call in rhd then meantime i want to hear from you tomorrow and sunday i want to know your movements whats happening what progress has been made you got it bosch said he stood up and turned to leave he noticed that above the door was a small crucifix he wondered if that had been what pounds had been staring at most said he was a political bornagain there were a lot in the department they all joined a church up in the valley because one of the assistant chiefs was a lay preacher there bosch guessed they all went there sunday mornings and gathered around him told him what a great guy he was ill talk to you tomorrow then pounds said from behind right tomorrow a short while after that pounds locked his office and went home bosch hung around the office alone drinking coffee and smoking and waiting for the six oclock news there was a small blackandwhite television on top of the file cabinet behind the autos table he turned it on and played with the rabbit ears until he got a reasonably clear picture a couple of the uniforms walked down from the watch office to watch cal moore had finally made the top of the news channel led with a report on the press conference at parker center in which assistant chief irvin irving revealed new developments the tape showed irving at a cluster of microphones teresa stood behind him irving credited her with finding new evidence during the autopsy that pointed to homicide irving said a fullscale homicide investigation was underway the report ended with a photograph of moore and a voiceover from the reporter investigators now have the task and they say the personal obligation to dig deep into the life of sergeant calexico moore to determine what it was that led him to the beatup motel room where someone executed him sources tell me the investigators do not have much to start with but they do start with a debt of thanks to the acting chief medical examiner who discovered a murder that had been written off as a cops lonely suicide the camera zoomed in closer on moores face here and the reporter ended it and so the mystery begins bosch turned the tv off after the report the uniforms went back down the hall and he went back to his spot at the homicide table and sat down the picture they had shown of moore had been taken a few years back harry guessed his face was younger the eyes clearer there was no portent of a hidden life thinking about it brought to mind the other photographs the ones sylvia moore had said her husband had collected over his life and looked at from time to time what else had he saved from the past bosch didnt have one photo of his mother he hadnt known his father until the old man was on his deathbed what baggage did cal moore carry with him it was time for him to head for the code seven but before heading out to the car harry walked down the hall to the watch office he picked up the clipboard that hung on the wall next to the wanted flyers and carried the stations duty roster clipped to it he doubted that it would have been updated in the last week and he was correct he found moores name and address in los feliz on the page listing sergeants he copied the address into his notebook and then headed out bosch dragged deeply on a cigarette and then dropped the butt into the gutter he hesitated before pulling the billy club that was the door handle of the code seven he stared across first street to the grass square that flanked city hall and was called freedom park beneath the sodium lights he saw the bodies of homeless men and women sprawled asleep in the grass around the war memorial they looked like casualties on a battlefield the unburied dead he went inside walked through the front restaurant and then parted the black curtains that hid the entrance to the bar like a judges robes the place was crowded with lawyers and cops and blue with cigarette smoke they had all come to wait out the rush hour and either gotten too comfortable or too drunk harry went down to the end of the bar where the stools were empty and ordered a beer and a shot it was seven on the dot according to the miller clock over the bar he scanned the room in the mirror behind the bar but saw nobody he could assume was the dea agent corvo he lit another cigarette and decided he would give it until eight the moment he decided that he looked back in the mirror and saw a short dark man with a full black beard split the curtain and hesitate as his eyes focused in the dim bar he wore blue jeans and a pullover shirt bosch saw the pager on his belt and the bulge the gun made under his shirt the man looked around until their eyes met in the mirror and harry nodded once corvo came over and took the stool next to him so you made me corvo said and you made me i guess we both need to go back to the academy you want a beer look bosch before you start getting friendly on me i gotta tell you i dont know about this i dont know what this is about i havent decided whether to talk to you harry took his cigarette from the ashtray and looked at corvo in the mirror i havent decided if certs is a breath mint or a candy corvo slid back off his stool have a good one cmon corvo have a beer why dont you relax man i checked you out before i came over the line on you is that youre just another head case youre on the fast track to nowhere rhd to hollywood the next stop probably riding shotgun in a wells fargo truck no the next stop is mexicali and i can go down there blind maybe walk in on whatever you got going with zorrillo or you can help me and yourself by telling me whats what whats what is that you arent going to do anything down there i leave here i pick up the phone and your trip is over i leave here and im gone on my way too late to stop have a seat if ive been an asshole im sorry its the way i am sometimes but i need you guys and you guys need me corvo still didnt sit down bosch what are you gonna do go down to the ranch put the pope over your shoulder and carry him back up here that it something like that shit actually i dont know what im going to do im just going to play it as it comes maybe i never see the pope maybe i do you want to risk it corvo slid back onto the stool and signaled the bartender he ordered the same as bosch in the mirror bosch noticed a long thick scar cutting through the right side of corvos beard if he had grown the beard to cover the purplishpink slug on his cheek it hadnt worked then again maybe he didnt want it to most dea agents bosch knew or had worked with had a macho swagger about them a scar couldnt hurt it was a life of bluffing and bluster scars were worn like badges of courage but bosch wondered if the guy could do much undercover work with such a recognizable physical anomaly after the bartender put down the drinks corvo threw back the shot like a man used to it so he said what are you really going down there for and why should i trust you the least bit bosch thought about it for a few moments because i can give you zorrillo shit bosch didnt say anything he had to give corvo his due had to let him run out his string after he was done posturing they would get down to business bosch thought at the moment that the one thing the movies and tv shows didnt get wrong or overexaggerate was the relationship of jealousy and distrust that existed between local and federal cops one side always thought it was better wiser more qualified usually the side that thought that was wrong okay corvo said ill bite what have you got before i get into it i have one question who are you man i mean youre up here in la why are you the one in moores files how come youre the expert on zorrillo thats about ten questions the basic answer to all of them is im a control agent on an investigation in mexicali that is being jointly worked by mexico city and la offices we are equidistant we are splitting the case im not telling you anything else until i know youre worth talking to talk bosch told him about jimmy kapps juan doe and the ties between their deaths and dance and moore and the zorrillo operation lastly he said that he had information that dance had gone to mexico probably mexicali after moore was murdered corvo drained his beer glass and said tell me something because its a big fucking hole in your scenario how come you think this juan doe was whacked out down there and then how come his body was taken all the way up here doesnt make sense to me the autopsy puts his death six to eight hours before moore found it or said he found it up here there were things about the autopsy that tie it to mexicali to a specific location in mexicali i think they wanted to get it out of mexicali to make sure it was not connected to that location it got sent to la because there was already a truck heading this way it was convenient youre talking jigsaws bosch what location are we talking about we arent talking thats the problem im talking you havent said shit but im here to trade i know your record you guys havent taken down one of zorrillos shipments i can give you zorrillos pipeline what can you give me corvo laughed and shot a peace sign at the bartender he brought two more beers know something i like you believe it or not i did check you out but i do like what i know of you but something tells me you dont have shit worth trading for you ever check out a place down there called envirobreed corvo looked down at the beer placed in front of him and seemed to be composing his thoughts bosch had to prompt him yes or no envirobreed is a plant down there they make these sterile fruit flies to set loose around here its a government contractor they have to breed the bugs down there cause i know all of that how come you know the only reason is that i was involved in setting plans on our operation down there we wanted a ground observation point on the targets ranch we went into the industrial parks that border the ranch to look for candidates envirobreed was obvious americanmanaged it was a government contractor we went to see if we could set up an op maybe on the roof or an office or something the ranch property starts just across the street but they said no no actually they said yes we said no how come radiation bugsthey got those damned flies buzzing all over the goddamn place but most of all the view was obscured we went up on the roof and we could see the ranch all right but the barn and stablesthe whole bullbreeding facilitywas in line between envirobreed and the main ranch facilities we couldnt use the place we told the guy there thanks but no thanks what was your cover or did you just come out and say dea nah we cooked something up said we were from the national weather service on a project tracking desert and mountain wind systems some bullshit like that the guy bought it right corvo wiped his mouth with the back of his hand so how does envirobreed figure into it from this end my juan doe he had those bugs you were talking about in his body i think he was probably killed there corvo turned so he was looking directly at bosch harry continued to watch him in the mirror behind the bar okay bosch lets say youve got my attention go ahead and spin the tale bosch said he believed that envirobreed which he didnt even know was across from zorrillos ranch until corvo told him was part of the black ice pipeline he told corvo the rest of his theory that fernal gutierrezllosa was a day laborer who either hired on as a mule and didnt make the grade or had worked at the bug breeding plant and seen something he should not have seen or done something he should not have done either way he was beaten to death his body put in one of the white environment boxes and taken with a shipment of fruit flies to los angeles his body was then dumped in hollywood and reported by moore who probably handled everything on this end they had to get the body out of there because they couldnt bring an investigation into the plant there is something there at least something that was worth killing an old man for corvo had his arm up on the bar and his face in the palm of his hand he said what did he see i dont know i do know that envirobreed has a deal with the feds not to have their shipments across the border bothered with opening those boxes could damage the goods who have you told this to nobody nobody you have told no one about envirobreed ive made some inquiries i havent told anyone the story i just told you who have you made inquiries with you called the sjp yeah they put out a letter to the consulate on the old man thats how i put it together i still have to make a formal id of the body when im down there yeah but did you bring up envirobreed i asked if they ever heard of him working at envirobreed corvo spun back toward the bar with an exasperated sigh who did you talk to there a captain named grena i dont know him but youve probably spoiled your lead you just dont go to the locals with this sort of thing they pick up the phone tell zorrillo what you just said and then pick up a bonus at the end of the month maybe its spoiled maybe it isnt grena brushed me off and may think thats it at least i didnt go walking into the bug place and ask to set up a weather station neither spoke each one thinking about what the other had said so far im going to get down on this right away corvo said after a while you have to promise me you wont go fucking around with it when you get down there im not promising anything and so far ive done all the giving here you havent said shit what do you want to know about zorrillo all you really gotta know is that weve wanted his ass for a long time this time bosch signaled for two more beers he lit a cigarette and saw the smoke blur his reflection in the mirror only thing you have to know about zorrillo is that he is one smart fucker and like i said it wouldnt surprise me in the least if he already knows youre coming fuckin sjp we only deal with thefederales even them you can trust about as much as an exwife bosch nodded meaningfully just hoping corvo would continue if he doesnt know now hell know before you get there so youve got to watch your ass and the best way of doing that is not to go with you i know that isnt an option the second best way is to skip the sjp altogether you cant trust em the pope has people inside there okay bosch nodded at him in the mirror he decided to stop nodding all the time now i know everything i just said went in your ears and out your asshole corvo said so what im willing to do is put you with a guy down there work it from there names ramos you go down say your howdydos with the local sjps act like everything is nice and then hook up with ramos if this envirobreed thing pans out and you make a move on zorrillo i want to be there you will just hang with ramos okay bosch thought it over a few moments and said yeah now tell me about zorrillo you keep going off on other shit zorrillos been around a long time weve got intelligence on him going back to the seventies at least a career doper one of the bounces on the trampoline id guess youd call him bosch had heard the term before but was confident corvo would get around to explaining it anyway black ice is just his latest thing he was amarijuanito when he was a kid pulled out of the barrio by someone like himself today he took backpacks of grass over the fence when he was twelve made the truck runs when he was older and just worked his way up by the eighties when we had most of our efforts concentrated on florida the colombians contracted with the mexicans they flew cocaine to mexico and the mexicans took it across the border using the same old pot trails mexicali across to calexico was one of them they called the route the trampoline the shit bounces from colombia to mexico and then up to the states and zorrillo became a rich man from the barrio to that nice big ranch with his own personalguardia and half the cops in baja on his payroll and the cycle started over he pulled most of his people out of the slums he never forgot the barrio and it never forgot him a lot of loyalty thats when he got the name el papa so once we shifted our resources a little bit to address the cocaine situation in mexico the pope moved on to heroin he had tar labs in the nearby barrios always had volunteers to mule it across for one trip hed pay one of those poor suckers down there more than theyd make in five years doing anything else bosch thought of the temptation that much money for what amounted to so little risk even those who were caught spent little time in jail it was a natural transition to go from tar heroin to black ice zorrillos an entrepreneur obviously this is a drug that is in its infancy as far as awareness in the drug culture goes but we think he is the countrys main supplier weve got black ice showing up all over the place new york seattle chicago all your large cities whatever operation you stumbled over in la that was just a drop in the bucket one of many we think hes still running straight heroin with his barrio mules but the ice is his growth product its the future and he knows it hes shifting more and more of his operation into it and hes going to drive hawaiians out his overhead is so low his stuff is selling twenty bucks a cap below the going rate for hawaiian ice or glass or whatever they call it this week and zorrillos stuff is better hes putting the hawaiians out of business on the mainland then when the demand for this thing really starts to escalateconceivably as fast as crack did in the mideightieshell bump the price and have a virtual monopoly until the others catch up with him zorrillos kinda like one of those fishing boats with the tenmile net behind it hes circling around and hes going to pull that sucker closed on all the fish an entrepreneur bosch said just to be saying something yeah thats what id call him you remember a couple years ago the border patrol found the tunnel in arizona went from a warehouse on one side of the border to a warehouse on the other in nogales well we think that he was an investor in that one of them at least it was probably his idea but the bottom line is youve never touched him nope whenever wed get close somebodyd end up dead i guess youd say hes a violent sort of entrepreneur bosch envisioned moores body in the dingy motel bathroom had he been planning to make a move to go against zorrillo zorrillos tied in with theeme corvo said word is he can have anybody anywhere whacked out supposedly back in the seventies there was all kinds of slaughter going on for control of the pot trails zorrillo emerged on top it was like a gang war barrio against barrio he has since united all of them but back then his was the dominant clan saints and sinners a lot of theeme came out of that theeme was the mexican mafia a latino gang with control over inmates in most of mexicos and californias prisons bosch knew little about them and had had few cases that involved members he did know that allegiance to the group was strictly enforced infractions were punishable by death how do you know all of that he asked informants over the years the ones that lived to talk about it weve got a whole history on our friend the pope i even know hes got a velvet painting of elvis in his office at the ranch did his barrio have a sign what do you mean a sign a symbol its the devil with a halo bosch emptied his beer and looked around the bar he saw a deputy district attorney he knew was part of a team that rubberstamped investigations of police shootings he was sitting alone at a table with a martini there were a few cops bosch recognized huddled at other tables they all were smoking dinosaurs all harry wanted to leave to go somewhere he could think about this information the devil with a halo moore had it tattooed on his arm he had come from the same place as zorrillo harry could feel his adrenaline kicking up a notch how will i get together with ramos down there hell come to you wherere you staying i dont know stay at the de anza in calexico its safer on our side of the border waters better for you too okay ill be there another thing is you cant take a weapon across i mean its easy enough to do you flash your badge at the crossing and nobodys going to check your trunk but if something happens down there the first thing that will be checked is whether you checked your gun in at the police station in calexico he nodded meaningfully at bosch they have a gun locker at calexico pd where they check weapons for crossing cops they keep a log you get a receipt professional courtesy so check a weapon dont take it across and then think you can say you left it up here at home check it in down there get it on the log then you dont have a problemcomprende its like having an alibi for your gun in case something happens bosch nodded he knew what corvo was telling him corvo took out his wallet and gave bosch a business card call anytime and if im not in the office they will locate me just tell the operator its you ill leave your name and word that you are to be put through corvos speech pattern had changed he was talking faster bosch guessed this was because he was excited about the envirobreed tip the dea agent was anxious to get on it harry studied him in the mirror the scar on his cheek seemed darker now as if it had changed color with his mood corvo looked at him in the mirror knife fight he said fingering the scar zihuatenajo i was under working a case carrying my piece in my boot guy got me here before i could get to the boot down there they dont have hospitals for shit they did a bad job on it and i ended up with this i couldnt go under anymore too recognizable bosch could tell he liked telling the story he was stoked with bravado as he told it it was probably the one time he had come close to his own end bosch knew what corvo was waiting for him to ask he asked anyway and the guy who did it what did he get a state burial i put him down once i got to my piece corvo had found a way to make killing a man who brought a knife to a gunfight sound heroic at least to his own ears he probably told the story a lot every time he caught someone new looking at the scar bosch nodded respectfully and slipped off his stool and put money on the bar remember our deal you dont move on zorrillo without me make sure you tell ramos oh weve got a deal corvo said but im not guaranteeing it will happen when youre down there we arent going to rush anything besides weve lost zorrillo temporarily im sure what are you talking about youve lost him i mean we havent had a bona fide sighting in about ten days or so we think hes there on the ranch though hes just laying low changing his routine routine the pope is a man who likes to be seen he likes to taunt us usually he rides the ranch in a jeep hunting coyotes shooting his uzi admiring his bulls there is one bull in particular a champion that once killed a matador el temblar he is called zorrillo often goes out to watch this bull its like him i guess very proud anyway zorrillo has not been seen on the ranch or the plaza de toros which was his sunday custom he hasnt been seen cruising the barrios reminding himself of where he came from hes a wellknown figure in them all he gets off on this pope of mexicali shit bosch tried to imagine zorrillos life a celebrity in a town that celebrated nothing he lit a cigarette he wanted to get out of there so when was the last bona fide if he is still there he hasnt come out of the compound since december fifteenth that was a sunday he was at the plaza watching his bulls thats the last bona fide after that we have some informants who move that up to the eighteenth they say they saw him at the compound dicking around outside but thats it hes either split or he is laying low like i said maybe because he ordered a cop blown away corvo nodded bosch left alone after that corvo said he was going to use the pay phone harry stepped out of the bar felt the brisk night air and took the last drag on his cigarette he saw movement in the darkness of the park across the street then one of the crazies moved into the cone of light beneath a streetlight it was a black man highstepping and making jerking movements with his arms he made a crisp turn and began moving back into the darkness he was a trombone player in a marching band in a world somewhere else the apartment building where cal moore had lived was a threestory affair that stuck out on franklin about the same way cabs do at the airport it was one of the many stuccoed postworld war ii jobs that lined the streets in that area it was called the fountains but they had been filled in with dirt and made into planters it was about a block from the mansion that was headquarters for the church of scientology and the complexs white neon sign threw an eerie glow down to where bosch was standing on the curb it was near ten oclock so he wasnt worried about anyone offering him a personality test he stood there smoking and studying the apartment building for a half hour before finally deciding to go ahead with the breakin it was a security building but it really wasnt bosch slipped the lock on the front gate with a butter knife he kept with his picks in the glove compartment of the caprice the next door the one leading to the lobby he didnt have to worry about it needed to be oiled and showed this by not snapping all the way closed bosch went through the door checked a listing of tenants and found moores name listed next to number seven on the third floor moores place was at the end of a hallway that split the center of the floor at the door harry saw the police evidence sticker had been placed across the jamb he cut it with the small pen knife attached to his key chain and then knelt down to look at the lock there were two other apartments on the hallway he heard no tv sound or talking coming from either the lighting in the hall was good so he didnt need the flashlight moore had a standard pin tumbler dead bolt on the door using a curved tension hook and sawtooth comb he turned the lock in less than two minutes with his handkerchiefwrapped hand on the knob ready to open the door he wondered again how prudent he was in coming here if irving or pounds found out hed be back on the street in blue before the first of the year he looked down the hall behind him once more and opened the door he had to go in nobody else seemed to care what had happened to cal moore and that was fine but bosch did care for some reason he thought maybe he would find that reason here once inside the apartment he closed and relocked the door he stood there a couple of feet inside letting his eyes adjust the place smelled musty and was dark except for the bluishwhite glow of the scientology light that leaked through the sheer curtains over the living room window bosch walked into the room and switched on the lamp on an end table next to an old misshapen sofa the light revealed that the place had come furnished in the same decor it had maybe twenty years ago the navy blue carpet was worn flat as astroturf in pathways from the couch to the kitchen and to the hallway that went off to the right he moved farther in and took quick glances in the kitchen and the bedroom and the bathroom he was struck by the emptiness of the place there was nothing personal here no pictures on the walls no notes on the refrigerator no jacket hung over the back of a chair there wasnt even a dish in the sink moore had lived here but it was almost as if he hadnt existed he didnt know what he was looking for so he started in the kitchen he opened cabinets and drawers he found a box of cereal a can of coffee and a threequartersempty bottle of early times in another cabinet he found an unopened bottle of sweet rum with a mexican label inside the bottle was a stalk of sugar cane there was some silverware and cooking tools in the drawers several books of matches from hollywood area bars like ports and the bullet the freezer was empty except for two trays of ice on the top shelf in the refrigerator section below there was a jar of mustard a halffinished package of nowrancid bologna and a lone can of budweiser its plastic sixpack collar still choking it on the lower shelf on the door was a twopound bag of domino sugar harry studied the sugar it was unopened then he thought what the hell ive come this far he took it out and opened it and slowly poured it into the sink it looked like sugar to him it tasted like sugar to him there was nothing else in the bag he turned on the hot water and watched as the white mound was washed down the drain he left the bag on the counter and went into the bathroom there was a toothbrush in the holder shaving equipment behind the mirror nothing else in the bedroom bosch first went into the walkin closet an assortment of clothes was on hangers and more filled a plastic laundry basket on the floor on the shelf there was a green plaid suitcase and a white box with the word snakes printed on it bosch first dumped the basket over and checked the pockets of the dirty shirts and pants they were empty he picked through the hanging clothes until he reached the back of the closet and found moores dress uniform wrapped in plastic once you left patrol there was really only one reason to save it to be buried in bosch thought saving it was a bad omen a lack of confidence as required by the department he kept one uniform to be worn in time of civil crisis such as a major earthquake or riot but he had dumped his dress blues ten years ago he brought down the suitcase it was empty and smelled musty it had not been used for some time he pulled down the boot box but could tell it was empty before he opened it there was some tissue paper inside it bosch put it back up on the shelf remembering how he had seen moores one boot standing upright on the tile in the bathroom at the hideaway he wondered if moores killer had had difficulty pulling it off to complete the suicide scene or had he ordered moore to take it off first probably not the blow to the back of the head that teresa found meant moore probably hadnt known what hit him bosch envisioned the killer his identity cloaked in shadow coming up from behind and swinging the stock of the shotgun against the back of moores head moore goes down the killer pulls off the boot drags him into his bathroom props him against the tub and pulls both triggers wipe off the triggers press the dead mans thumb against the stock and rub his hands on the barrels to make convincing smears then set the boot upright on the tile add the splinter from the stock and the scene was set suicide the queensized bed was unmade on the night table was a couple of dollars in change and a small framed photograph of moore and his wife bosch bent over and studied it without touching it sylvia was smiling and appeared to be sitting in a restaurant or perhaps at a banquet table at a wedding she was beautiful in the picture and her husband was looking at her as if he knew it you fucked up cal harry said to no one he moved to the bureau which was so old and scarred by cigarettes and knifecut initials that the salvation army might even reject it in the top drawer were a comb and a cherrywood picture frame lying face down bosch picked up the frame and saw that it was empty he considered this for a few moments the frame had a floral design carved into it it would have been expensive and obviously did not come with the apartment moore had brought it with him why was it empty he would have liked to be able to ask sheehan if he or anybody else had taken a photograph from the apartment as part of the investigation but he couldnt without revealing he had been here the next drawer contained underwear and socks and a stack of folded tshirts nothing else there were more clothes in the third drawer all having been neatly folded at a laundry beneath a stack of shirts was a skin magazine which announced on the cover that nude photos of a leading hollywood actress were provided inside bosch leafed through the magazine more out of curiosity than belief there would be a clue inside he was sure the magazine had been pawed over by every dick and blue suit who had been in the apartment during the investigation into moores disappearance he put the magazine back after seeing that the photos of the actress were dark grainy shots in which it could just barely be determined that she was barebreasted he assumed they were from an early movie made before she had enough clout to control the exploitation of her body he imagined the disappointment of the men who bought the magazine only to discover those shots were the payoff on the covers lurid promise he imagined the actresss anger and embarrassment and he wondered what they did for cal moore a vision of sylvia moore flashed in his head he shoved the magazine under the shirts and closed the drawer the last drawer of the bureau contained two things a folded pair of faded blue jeans and a white paper bag that was crumpled and soft with age and contained a thick stack of photographs it was what he had come for bosch instinctively knew this when he picked the bag up he took it out of the bedroom hitting the switch turning off the ceiling light as he went through the door sitting on the couch next to the light he lit a cigarette and pulled the stack of photos from the bag immediately he recognized that most of them were faded and old these photographs somehow seemed more private and invasive than even those in the skin mag they were pictures that documented cal moores unhappy history the photos seemed to be in some kind of chronological order bosch could tell this because they moved from faded black and white to color other benchmarks like clothing and cars also seemed to prove this the first photo was a blackandwhite shot of a young latina in what looked like a white nurses uniform she was dark and lovely and wore a girlish smile and a look of mild surprise as she stood next to a swimming pool her arms behind her back bosch saw the edge of a round object behind her and then realized she was holding a servant tray behind her back she had not wanted to be photographed with the tray she wasnt a nurse she was a maid a servant there were other photographs of her in the stack extending over several years age was kind to her but it still exacted its toll she retained an exotic beauty but worry lines formed and her eyes lost some of their warmth in some of the photographs bosch leafed through she held a baby then she posed with a little boy bosch looked closely and even with the print being black and white he could see that the boy with dark hair and complexion had lightcolored eyes green eyes bosch thought it was calexico moore and his mother in one of the photos the woman and the small boy stood in front of a large white house with a spanishtile roof it looked like a mediterranean villa rising behind the mother and boy but unclear because of the focus was a tower two darkly blurred windows like empty eyes were near the top bosch thought about what moore had said to his wife about growing up in a castle this was it in another of the photos the boy stood rigidly next to a man an anglo with blond hair and darkly tanned skin they stood next to the sleek form of a latefifties thunderbird the man held one hand on the hood and one on the boys head they were his possessions the photo seemed to say the man squinted into the camera but bosch could see his eyes they were the same green eyes of his son the mans hair was thinning on top and by comparing photos of the boy with his mother taken at about the same time bosch guessed that moores father had been at least fifteen years older than his mother the photo of the father and son was worn around the edges from handling much more worn than any of the others in the stack the next grouping of photos changed the venue they were pictures from what was probably mexicali there were fewer photos to document a longer period of time the boy was growing by leaps and the backgrounds of the photos had a thirdworld quality to them they were shot in the barrio more often than not there were crowds of people in the background all mexicans all having that slight look of desperation and hope bosch had seen in the ghettos of la and now there was another boy he was the same age or slightly older he seemed stronger tougher he was in many of the same frames with cal a brother maybe bosch thought it was in this grouping of photos that the mother began to show clearly the advance of age the girl who hid the servants tray was gone a mother used to the harshness of life had replaced her the photos now took on a haunting quality it bothered harry to study them because he believed that he understood the hold the pictures had on moore the last blackandwhite photo showed the two boys shirtless and sitting back to back on a picnic table laughing at a joke preserved forever in time calexico was a young teenager with a guileless smile on his face the other boy maybe a year or two older looked like trouble he had a hard sullen look in his eyes in the picture cal had his right arm cocked and was making a muscle for the photographer bosch saw the tattoo was already there the devil with a halo saints and sinners in the photos after that the other boy never appeared again these were color shots taken in los angeles bosch recognized city hall shooting up in the background of one of them and the fountain in echo park in another moore and his mother had come to the united states whoever the other boy was he had been left behind toward the end of the stack the mother dropped out of the photos as well harry wondered if that meant she was dead the final two pictures were of moore as an adult the first was his graduation from the police academy there was a shot of a class of newly sworn officers gathered on the grass outside what was later renamed the daryl f gates auditorium they were throwing their hats into the air bosch picked moore out of the crowd he had his arm around the shoulder of another probee and there was genuine joy in his face and the last photo was of moore in dress uniform pulling a young sylvia close in a smiling cheektocheek embrace her skin was smoother then her eyes brighter and her hair longer and fuller but she was still very much the same as now still a beautiful woman he pushed the photographs back into the bag and put it on the couch next to him he looked at the bag and was curious why the photos had never been mounted in an album or put on display they were just glimpses of a lifetime kept in a bag and ready to go but he knew the reason at his home he had stacks of his own pictures that he would never mount in a book that he felt the need to hold when he looked at them they were more than pictures of another time they were parts of a life a life that could not go forward without knowing and understanding what was behind bosch reached up to the lamp and turned it off he smoked another cigarette the glow of its tip floating in the dark he thought about mexico and calexico moore you fucked up he whispered again he had told himself he had to come here to get a feel for moore that was how he had sold it to himself but sitting there in the dark he knew there was more to it he knew he had come because he wanted to understand a lifes course that could not be explained the only one with all the answers to all of the questions was cal moore and he was gone he looked at the white neon glow on the curtains across the room and they looked like ghosts to him it made him think of the worn photo of the father and son fading to white he thought of his own father a man he never knew and did not meet until he was on his death bed by then it had been too late for bosch to change his own lifes course he heard a key hit the dead bolt on the other side of the front door he was up with his gun out moving quickly across the room to the hallway he went into the bedroom first but then went back into the hall and into the bathroom because it afforded a better view of the living room he dropped his cigarette into the toilet and heard it hiss as it died he heard the front door open and then a few seconds of silence then a light went on in the living room and he stepped back into the dark recesses of his hiding spot in the medicine cabinet mirror he saw sylvia moore standing in the middle of the living room looking around as if it was her first time in the apartment her eyes fell on the white bag on the couch and she picked it up bosch watched her as she looked through the photographs she lingered over the last one it was the one of her she held her hand to her cheek as if charting the changes of time when she was done she put the photographs back in the bag and placed it back on the couch she then started for the hallway and bosch moved further back silently stepping into the bathtub now a light came from the bedroom and he heard the closet door open hangers scraping on the bar bosch holstered his gun and then stepped out of the tub and the bathroom and into the hallway mrs moore sylvia he called from the hall unsure how to get her attention without scaring her whos that came the highpitched frightened reply its me detective bosch its okay she came out of the bedroom closet then the fright wide in her eyes she carried the hanger with her dead husbands dress uniform on it jesus you scared me what are you doing here i was going to ask you the same thing she held the uniform up in front of her as if bosch had walked in on her while she was undressed she took one step back toward the bedroom door you followed me she said whats going on no i didnt follow you i was already here in the dark yes i was thinking when i heard somebody opening the door i went into the bathroom then when i saw it was you i didnt know how to come out without scaring you sorry you scared me i scared you she nodded once seeming to accept his explanation she was wearing a light blue denim shirt and unbleached blue jeans her hair was tied behind her head and she wore earrings made of a pinkish crystal her left ear had a second earring it was a silver crescent moon with a star hooked on its bottom point she put on a polite smile bosch became aware that he had not shaved in a day did you think it was the killer she said when he said nothing else kind of like coming back to the scene of the crime maybe something like that actually no i dont know what i thought this isnt the scene of the crime anyway he nodded toward the uniform she carried i have to take this by mcevoy brothers tomorrow she must have read the frown on his face its a closedcasket service obviously but i think he wouldve liked it this way wearing the dress blues mr mcevoy asked me if i had it harry nodded they were still in the hallway he backed out into the living room and she followed what do you hear from the department how are they going to handle it the funeral i mean who knows but as of now they are saying he went down in the line of duty so hes going to get the show i think so a heros farewell bosch thought the department wasnt into selfflagellation it wasnt going to announce to the world that a bad cop was put down by the bad people he had done bad things for not unless it had to and not when it could throw a heros funeral at the media and then sit back and watch sympathetic stories on seven different channels that night the department needed all the sympathy it could get he also realized that a lineofduty death meant the widow would get full pension rights if sylvia moore wore a black dress dabbed at her eyes with a tissue at appropriate times and kept her mouth shut shed get her husbands paycheck for the rest of her life not a bad deal either way if sylvia was the one who tipped iad she now stood to lose the pension if she pressed it or went public the department could claim cal had been killed because of his extracurricular activities no pension bosch was sure this didnt have to be explained to her so whens the funeral he asked its monday at one at the san fernando mission chapel the burial is at oakwood up in chatsworth well bosch thought if they are going to put on the show thats the place to do it a couple hundred motor cops coming in in procession on curving valley circle boulevard always made a good frontpage photo mrs moore why did you come here athe looked at his watch it was so late to get your husbands dress blues call me sylvia sure to tell you the truth i dont know why now i havent been sleepingi mean at allsince it since he was found i dont know i just felt like taking a drive i just got the key to the place today anyway who gave it to you assistant chief irving he came by said they were through with the apartment and if there was anything i wanted i could take it trouble is there isnt i had hoped id never see this place then the man at the funeral home called and said he needed the dress uniform if i had it here i am bosch picked the bag of photographs up off the couch and held it out to her what about these do you want them i dont think so ever see them before i think some of them at least some of them seemed familiar some of them i know i never saw why do you think that is a man keeps photographs his whole life and never shows some of them to his wife i dont know strange he opened the bag and while he was looking through the photos said what happened to his mother do you know she died before i knew him had a tumor in her head he was about twenty he said what about his father he told me he was dead but i told you i dont know if that was true because he never said how or when when i asked he said he didnt want to talk about it we never did bosch held up the photo of the two boys on the picnic table whos this she stepped close to him and looked at the photo he studied her face he saw flecks of green in her brown eyes there was a light scent of perfume i dont know who it is a friend i guess he didnt have a brother not one he ever told me about he told me when we got married he said i was his only family he said said he was alone except for me now bosch looked at the photo kinda looks like him to me she didnt say anything what about the tattoo what about it he ever tell you where he got it what it means he told me he got it in the village he grew up in he was a boy actually it was a barrio i guess they called it saints and sinners thats what the tattoo means saints and sinners he said that was because the people that lived there didnt know which they were which they would be he thought of the note found in cal moores back pocketi found out who i was he wondered if she realized the significance of this in terms of the place he grew up where each young boy had to find out who he was a saint or a sinner sylvia interrupted his thoughts you know you didnt really say why you were already here sitting in the dark thinking you had to come here to do that i came to look around i guess i was trying to shake something loose get a feel for your husband that sound stupid not to me good and did you did you shake something loose i dont know yet sometimes it takes a little while you know i asked irving about you he said you werent on the case he said you only came out the other night because the other detectives had their hands full with the reporters and and the body like a schoolboy bosch felt a tingling of excitement she had asked about him it didnt matter that now she knew he was freelancing on the case she had made inquiries about him well he said thats true to a degree technically i am not on the case but i have other cases that are believed to be tied in with the death of your husband her eyes never left his he could see she wanted to ask what cases but she was a cops wife she knew the rules in that moment he was sure she did not deserve what she had been handed none of it he said it really wasnt you was it the tip to iad the letter she shook her head no but they wont believe you they think you started the whole thing i didnt what did irving say when he gave you the key to this place told me that if i wanted the money the pension i should let it go not get any ideas as if i did as if i cared anymore i dont i knew that cal went wrong i dont know what he did i just knew he did it a wife knows without being told and that as much as anything else ended it between us but i didnt send any letter like that i was a cops wife to the end i told irving and the guy who came before him that they had it wrong but they didnt care they just wanted cal you told me before it was chastain who came it was him what exactly did he want you said something about he wanted to look inside the house he held up the letter and said he knew i wrote it he said i might as well tell him everything well i told him i didnt write it and i told him to get out but at first he wouldnt leave what did he say he wanted specifically hei dont really remember it all he wanted bank account statements and he wanted to know what properties we had he thought i was sitting there waiting for him to come so i could give him my husband he said he wanted the typewriter and i told him we didnt even have one i pushed him out and closed the door he nodded and tried to compute these facts into those he already had it was too much of a whirlwind you dont remember anything about what the letter said i didnt really get the chance to read it he didnt show it to me to read because he thoughtand he and the others still believethat it came from me so i only read a little before he put it back in his briefcase it said something about cal being a front for a mexican it said he was giving protection it said something along the lines that he had made a faustian pact you know what this is right a deal with the devil bosch nodded he was reminded that she was a teacher he also realized that they had been standing in the living room for at least ten minutes but he made no move to sit down he feared that any sudden movement would break the spell send her out the door and away from him well she said i dont know if i would have gotten so allegorical if i had written it but essentially that letter was correct i mean i didnt know what he had done but i knew something happened i could see it was killing him inside oncethis was before he lefti finally asked him what was happening and he just said he had made a mistake and he would try to correct it himself he wouldnt talk about it with me he shut me out she sat down on the edge of an upholstered chair holding the dress blues on her lap the chair was an awful green color and there were cigarette burns on its right arm bosch sat down on the couch next to the bag of photos she said irving and chastain they dont believe me they just nod their heads when i tell them they say the letter had too many intimate details it had to be me meanwhile i guess somebody is happy out there their little letter brought him down bosch thought of kapps and wondered if he could have known enough details about moore to have written the letter he had set up dance maybe he had tried to set up moore first it seemed unlikely maybe the letter had come from dance because he wanted to move up the ladder and moore was in the way harry thought of the coffee can he had seen in the kitchen cabinet and wondered if he should ask her if she wanted some he didnt want the time with her to end he wanted to smoke but didnt want to risk having her ask him not to do you want any coffee there is some in the kitchen i could make she looked toward the kitchen as if its location or cleanliness had a role in her answer then she said no she wasnt planning to stay that long i am going to mexico tomorrow bosch said mexicali yes its the other cases yes then he told her about them about black ice and jimmy kapps and juan doe and he told her of the ties to both her husband and mexicali it was there he hoped to unravel the whirlwind he finished the story by saying as you can tell people like irving they want this to go by they dont really care who killed cal because he had crossed they write him off like a bad debt they are not going to pursue it because they dont want it to blow up in their faces you understand what im saying i was a cops wife remember right so you know the thing about this is i care your husband was putting a file together for me a file on black ice it makes me think like maybe he was trying to do something good he might have been trying to do the impossible to cross back it mightve been what got him killed and if it is then im not letting it go by they were quiet a long time after that her face looked pained but her eyes remained sharp and dry she pulled the suit up higher on her lap bosch could hear a police helicopter circling somewhere in the distance it wouldnt be la without police helicopters and spotlights circling at night black ice she said after a while in a whispery voice what about it its funny thats all she was quiet a few moments and seemed to look around the room realizing this was the place her husband had come to after leaving her black ice i grew up in the bay areasan francisco mostlyand that was something we always were told to watch out for but you know it was the other black ice we were told about she looked at him then and must have read his confusion in the winter on those days when it really gets cold after a rain when the rain freezes on the road thats black ice its there on the road on the black asphalt but you cant see it i remember my father teaching me to drive and he was always saying watch out for the black ice girl you dont see the danger until you are in it then its too late youre sliding out of control she smiled at the memory and said anyway that was the black ice i knew at least while i was growing up just like coke used to be a soda the meaning of things can change on you he just looked at her he wanted to hold her again touch the softness of her cheek with his own didnt your father ever tell you to watch out for the black ice she asked i didnt know him i sorta taught myself to drive she nodded and didnt say anything but didnt look away it took me about three cars to learn by the time i finally got it down nobody would dare lend me a car nobody ever told me about the black ice either well i did thank you are you hung up on the past too harry he didnt answer i guess we all are whats that saying through studying the past we learn our future something like that you seem to me to be a man still studying maybe her eyes seemed to look into him they were eyes with great knowledge and he realized that for all of his desires the other night she did not need to be held or healed of pain in fact she was the healer how could cal moore have run from this he changed the subject not knowing why only that he must push the attention away from himself theres a picture frame in the bedroom carved cherrywood but no picture you remember it ill have to look she stood leaving her husbands suit on the chair and moved into the bedroom she looked at the frame in the top drawer of the bureau a long time before saying she didnt recognize it she didnt look at bosch until after she said this they stood there next to the bed looking at each other in silence bosch finally raised his hand then hesitated she took a step closer to him and that was the sign that his touch was wanted he caressed her cheek the way she had done it herself when she had studied the photograph earlier and thought she was alone then he dropped his hand down the side of her throat and around the back of her neck they stared at each other then she came closer and brought her mouth up to his her hand came to his neck and pulled him to her and they kissed she held him and pressed herself against him in a way that revealed her need he saw her eyes were closed now and at that moment bosch realized she was his reflection in a mirror of hunger and loneliness they made love on her husbands unmade bed neither of them paying mind to where they were or what this would mean the next day or week or year bosch kept his eyes closed wanting to concentrate on other sensesher smell and taste and touch afterward he pulled himself back so that his head lay on her chest between her freckled breasts she had her hands in his hair and was drawing her fingers through the curls he could hear her heart beating in rhythm with his it was after oneam by the time bosch turned the caprice onto woodrow wilson and began the long winding ascent to his house he saw the spotlights tracing eights on the lowlying clouds over universal city on the road he had to navigate his way around cars doubleparked outside holiday parties and a discarded christmas tree a few strands of lonely tinsel still clinging to its branches that had blown into his path on the seat next to him were the lone budweiser from cal moores refrigerator and lucius porters gun all his life he believed he was slumming toward something good that there was meaning in the youth shelter the foster homes the army and vietnam and now the department he always carried the feeling that he was struggling toward some kind of resolution and knowledge of purpose that there was something good in him or about him it was the waiting that was so hard the waiting often left a hollow feeling in his soul and he believed people could see this that they knew when they looked at him that he was empty he had learned to fill that hollowness with isolation and work sometimes drink and the sound of the jazz saxophone but never people he never let anyone in all the way and now he thought he had seen sylvia moores eyes her true eyes and he had to wonder if she was the one who could fill him i want to see you he had said when they separated outside the fountains yes was all she said she touched his cheek with her hand and got into her car now bosch thought about what that one word and the accompanying touch could mean he was happy and that was something new as he rounded the last curve slowing for a car with its brights on to pass he thought of the way she had looked at the picture frame for so long before saying she did not recognize it had she lied what were the chances that cal moore would have bought such an expensive frame after moving into a dump like that not good was the answer by the time he pulled the caprice into the carport he was full of confusing feelings what had been in the picture what difference did it make that she had held that back if she did still sitting in the car he opened the beer and drank it down quickly some of it spilling onto his neck he would sleep tonight he knew inside he went to the kitchen put porters gun in a cabinet and checked the phone machine there were no messages no call from porter saying why he had run no call from pounds asking how it was going no call from irving saying he knew what bosch was up to after two nights with little sleep bosch looked forward to his bed as he did on few other nights it was most often this way part of a routine he kept nights of fleeting rest or nightmares followed by a single night when exhaustion finally drove him down hard into a dark sleep as he gathered the covers and pillows about him he noticed there was still the trace of teresa corazóns powdery perfume on them he closed his eyes and thought about her for a moment but soon her image was pushed out of his mind by sylvia moores face not the photo from the bag or the night stand but the real face weary but strong her eyes focused on boschs own the dream was like others harry had had he was in the dark place a cavernous blackness enveloped him and his breath echoed in the dark he sensed or rather he knew in the way he had knowledge of place in all his dreams that the darkness ended ahead and he must go there but this time he was not alone that was what was different he was with sylvia and they huddled in the black their sweat stinging their eyes harry held her and she held him and they did not speak they broke from each others embrace and began to move through the darkness there was dim light ahead and harry headed that way his left hand was extended in front of him his smith amp wesson in its grasp his right hand was behind him holding hers and leading her along and as they came into the light calexico moore was waiting there with the shotgun he was not hidden but he stood partially silhouetted by the light that poured into the passage his green eyes were in shadow and he smiled then he raised the shotgun who fucked up he said the roar was deafening in the blackness bosch saw moores hands fly loose from the shotgun and up away from his body like tethered birds trying to take flight he backstepped wildly into the darkness and was gone not fallen but disappeared gone only the light at the end of the passage remained in his wake in one hand harry still gripped sylvias hand in the other the smoking gun he opened his eyes then bosch sat up on the bed he saw pale light leaking around the edges of the curtains on the windows facing east the dream had seemed so short but he realized because of the light he had slept until morning he held his wrist up to the light and checked his watch he had no alarm clock because he never needed one it was six oclock he rubbed his face in his palms and tried to reconstruct the dream this was unusual for him a counselor at the sleep dysfunction lab at the va had once told him to write down what he remembered from his dreams it was an exercise she said to try to inform the conscious mind what the subconscious side was saying for months he kept a notebook and pen by the bed and dutifully recorded his morning memories but bosch had found it did him no good no matter how well he understood the source of his nightmares he could not eliminate them from his sleep he had dropped out of the sleep deprivation counseling program years ago now he could not recapture the dream sylvias face disappeared in the mist harry realized he had been sweating heavily he got up and pulled the bed sheets off and dumped them in a basket in the closet he went to the kitchen and started a pot of coffee he showered shaved and dressed in blue jeans a green corduroy shirt and a black sport coat driving clothes he went back to the kitchen and filled his thermos with black coffee the first thing he took out to the car was his gun he removed the rug that lined the trunk and then lifted out the spare tire and the jack that were stowed beneath it he placed the smith amp wesson which he had taken from his holster and wrapped in an oilcloth in the wheel well and put the spare tire back on top of it he put the rug back in place and laid the jack down along the rear of the trunk next he put his briefcase in and a duffel bag containing a few days changes of clothes it all looked passable though he doubted anyone would even look he went back inside and got his other gun out of the hallway closet it was a fortyfour with grips and safety configured for a righthanded shooter the cylinder also opened on the left side bosch couldnt use it because he was lefthanded but he had kept it for six years because it had been given to him as a gift by a man whose daughter had been raped and murdered bosch had winged the killer during a brief shootout during his capture near the sepulveda dam in van nuys he lived and was now serving life without parole but that hadnt been enough for the father after the trial he gave bosch the gun and bosch accepted it because not to take it would have been to disavow the mans pain his message to harry was clear next time do the job right shoot to kill harry took the gun and he could have taken it to a gunsmith and had it reconfigured for lefthand use but to do that would be to acknowledge the father had been right harry wasnt sure he was ready to do that the gun had sat on a shelf in the closet for six years now he took it down checked its action to make sure it was still operable and loaded it he put it in his holster and was ready to go on his way out he grabbed his thermos in the kitchen and bent over the phone machine to record a new message its bosch i will be in mexico for the weekend if you want to leave a message hang on if its important and you want to try to reach me ill be at the de anza hotel in calexico it was still before seven as he headed down the hill he took the hollywood freeway until it skirted around downtown the office towers opaque behind the early morning mixture of fog and smog he took the transition road to the san bernardino freeway and headed east out of the city it was miles to the border town of calexico and its sister city of mexicali just on the other side of the fence harry would be there before noon he poured himself a cup of coffee without spilling any and began to enjoy the drive the smog from la didnt clear until bosch was past the yucaipa turnoff in riverside county after that the sky turned as blue as the oceans on the maps he had next to him on the seat it was a windless day as he passed the windmill farm near palm springs the blades of the hundreds of electric generators stood motionless in the morning desert mist it was eerie like a cemetery and harrys eyes didnt linger bosch drove through the plush desert communities of palm springs and rancho mirage without stopping passing streets named after golfing presidents and celebrities as he passed bob hope drive bosch recalled the time he saw the comedian in vietnam he had just come in from thirteen days of clearing charlies tunnels in the cu chi province and thought the evening of watching hope was hilarious years later he had seen a clip of the same show on a television retrospective on the comedian this time the performance made him feel sad after rancho mirage he caught route and was heading directly south the open road always presented a quiet thrill to bosch the feeling of going someplace new coupled with the unknown he believed he did some of his best thinking while driving the open road he now reviewed his search of moores apartment and tried to look for hidden meanings or messages the ragged furniture the empty suitcase the lonely skin mag the empty frame moore left behind a puzzling presence he thought of the bag of photos again sylvia had changed her mind and taken it bosch wished he had borrowed the photo of the two boys and the one of the father and son bosch had no photographs of his own father he had told sylvia that he hadnt known him but that had been only partially true he had grown up not knowing and not at least outwardly caring who he was but when he returned from the war he came back with a sense of urgency to know about his origins it led him to seek out his father after twenty years of not even knowing his name harry had been raised in a series of youth shelters and foster homes after authorities took him from his mothers custody in the dormitories at mcclaren or san fernando or the other halls he was comforted by his mothers steady visits except during the times she was in jail she told him they couldnt send him to a foster home without her consent she had a good lawyer she said trying to get him back on the day the housemother at mcclaren told him the visits were over because his mother was dead he took the news unlike most boys of eleven outwardly he showed nothing he nodded that he understood and then walked away but that day during the swimming period he dove to the bottom of the deep end and screamed so loud and long that he was sure the noise was breaking through the surface and would draw the attention of the lifeguard after each breath on top he would go back down he screamed and cried until he was so exhausted he could only cling to the pools ladder its cold steel tubes the arms that comforted him somehow he wished he could have been there that was all he somehow wanted to have protected her he was termed ata after that available to adopt he began to move through a procession of foster homes where he was made to feel as though he was on tryout when expectations were not met it was on to the next house and the next pair of judges he was once sent back to mcclaren because of his habit of eating with his mouth open and once before he was sent to a home in the valley the choosers as they were called by the atas took harry and several other thirteenyearolds out to the rec field to throw a baseball around harry was the one chosen he soon realized it was not because he exhibited the sterling virtues of boyhood it was because the man had been looking for a lefthander his plan was to develop a pitcher and lefthanders were the premium after two months of daily workouts pitching lessons and oral education on pitching strategies harry ran away from the home it was six weeks before the cops later picked him up on hollywood boulevard he was sent back to mcclaren to await the next set of choosers you always had to stand up straight and smile when the choosers came through the dorm he began his search for his father at the county recorders office the birth records of hieronymus bosch at queen of angels hospital listed his mother as margerie philips lowe and his fathers name as his own hieronymus bosch but harry of course knew this was not the case his mother had once told him he was the namesake of an artist whose work she admired she said the painters fivehundredyearold paintings were apt portraits of present la a nightmarish landscape of predators and victims she told him she would tell him his true fathers name when the time was right she was found dead in an alley off hollywood boulevard before that time came harry hired a lawyer to petition the presiding judge of the juvenile dependency court to allow him to examine his own custody records the request was granted and bosch spent several days in the county hall of records archive the voluminous documents given to him chronicled the unsuccessful lengths his mother had gone to keep custody of him bosch found it spiritually reassuring but nowhere in the files was the name of the father bosch was at a dead end but wrote down the name of the lawyer who had filed all the papers in his mothers quest j michael haller in writing it down bosch realized he knew the name mickey haller had been one of las premier criminal defense attorneys he had handled one of the manson girls in the late fifties he had won an acquittal for the socalled highwayman a highway patrol officer accused of raping seven women he had stopped for speeding on lonely stretches of the golden state what was j michael haller doing on a child custody case on nothing more than a hunch bosch went to the criminal courts building and ordered all of his mothers cases from archives in sorting through them he found that in addition to the custody battle haller had represented margerie p lowe on six loitering arrests between and that was well into hallers time as a top trial lawyer in his gut harry knew then the receptionist in the fivename law office on the top floor of a pershing square tower told bosch that haller had retired recently because of a medical condition the phone book didnt list his residence but the roll of registered voters did haller was a democrat and he lived on canon drive in beverly hills bosch would always remember the rosebushes that lined the walkway to his fathers mansion they were perfect roses the maid who answered the door said mr haller was not seeing visitors bosch told the woman to tell mr haller it was margerie lowes son come to pay his respects ten minutes later he was led past members of the lawyers family all of them standing in the hallway with strange looks on their faces the old man had told them to leave his room and send bosch in alone standing at the bedside harry figured him for maybe ninety pounds now and he didnt need to ask what was wrong because he could tell cancer was eating away at him from the inside out i guess i know why youve come he rasped i just wanted to i dont know he stood there in silence for quite a time watching how it wore the man out just to keep his eyes open there was a tube from a box on the bedside that ran under the covers the box beeped every once in a while as it pumped painkilling morphine into the dying mans blood the old man studied him silently i dont want anything from you bosch finally said i dont know i think i just wanted to let you know i made it by okay im all right in case you ever worried you have been to the war yes im done with that my sonmy other son he i kept him away from that what will you do now i dont know after some more silence the old man seemed to nod he said you are called harry your mother told me that she told me a lot about you but i could never do you understand different times and after it went by so long i couldnt i couldnt reverse things bosch just nodded he hadnt come to cause the man any more pain more silence passed and he heard the labored breathing harry haller the old man whispered then a broken smile on the thin peeling lips burned by chemotherapy that could have been you did you ever read hesse bosch didnt understand but nodded again there was a beep sound he watched for a minute until the dosage seemed to take some effect the old mans eyes closed and he sighed i better get going harry said you take care he touched the mans frail bluish hand it gripped his fingers tightly almost desperately and then let go as he stepped to the door he heard the old mans rasp im sorry what did you say i said i did i did worry about you there was a tear running down the side of the old mans face into his white hair bosch nodded again and two weeks later he stood on a hill above the good shepherd section at forest lawn and watched them put the father he never knew in the ground during the ceremony he saw a grouping that he suspected was his half brother and three half sisters the half brother probably born a few years ahead of bosch was watching harry during the ceremony at the end bosch turned and walked away near ten oclock bosch stopped at a roadside diner called el oasis verde and ate huevos rancheros his table was at a window that looked out at the bluewhite sheath called the salton sea and then farther east to the chocolate mountains bosch silently reveled in the beauty and the openness of the scene when he was done and the waitress had refilled his thermos he walked out into the dirt parking lot and leaned against the fender of the caprice to breathe the cool clean air and look again the half brother was now a top defense lawyer and harry was a cop there was a strange congruence to that that bosch found acceptable they had never spoken and probably never would he continued south as ran along the flats between the salton sea and the santa rosa mountains it was agricultural land that steadily dropped below sea level the imperial valley much of it was cut in huge squares by irrigation ditches and his drive was accompanied by the smell of fertilizer and fresh vegetables flatbed trucks loaded with crates of lettuce or spinach or cilantro occasionally pulled off the farm roads in front of him and slowed him down but harry didnt mind and waited patiently to pass near a town called vallecito bosch pulled to the side of the road to watch a squad of lowflying aircraft come screaming over a mountain that rose to the southwest they crossed and flew out over the salton bosch knew nothing about identifying war aircraft in the modern era these jets had evolved into faster and sleeker machines than those he remembered from vietnam but they had flown low enough for him to clearly see that beneath each crafts wings hung the hardware of war he watched the three jets bank and come about in a tight triangle pattern and retrace their path back to the mountain after they crossed above him harry looked down at his maps and found blocks marked off to the southwest as closed to the public it was the us naval gunnery range at superstition mountain the map said it was a live bombing area keep out bosch felt a dull vibration rock the car slightly and then the following rumble he looked up from the map and thought he could make out the plume of smoke beginning to rise from the base of superstition then he felt and heard another bomb hit then another as the jets the silvery skin of each reflecting a diamond of sunlight passed overhead again to begin another run bosch pulled back onto the road behind a flatbed truck with two teenagers in the back they were mexican fieldworkers with weary eyes that seemed already knowledgeable about the long hard life ahead of them they were about the same age as the two boys on the picnic table in the photo that had been in the white bag they stared at bosch with indifference in a few moments it was clear to pass the slowmoving truck bosch heard other explosions from superstition mountain as he moved away he went on to pass more farms and momandpop restaurants he passed a sugar mill where a line painted at the top of its huge silo marked sea level the summer after he had talked to his father bosch had picked up the books by hesse he was curious about what the old man had meant he found it in the second book he read harry haller was a character in it a disillusioned loner a man of no real identity harry haller was the steppenwolf that august bosch joined the cops he believed he felt the land rising the farmland gave way to brown brush and there were dust devils rising in the open land his ears popped as he ascended and he knew the border was nearing long before he passed the green sign that told him calexico was twenty miles away calexico was like most border towns dusty and built low to the ground its main street a garish collision of neon and plastic signage the inevitable golden arches being the recognizable if not comforting icon amid the drivethrough mexican auto insurance offices and souvenir shops in town route connected with and dropped straight down to the border crossroad traffic was backed up about five blocks from the exhauststained concrete auto terminal manned by the mexicanfederales it looked like the five oclock lineup at the broadway entrance to the in la before he got caught up in it bosch turned east on fifth street he passed the de anza hotel and drove two blocks to the police station it was a onestory concreteblock affair that was painted the same yellow as the tablets lawyers used from the signs out front bosch learned it was also town hall it was also the town fire station it was also the historical society he found a parking space in front as he opened the door of the dirty caprice he heard singing from the park across the street on a picnic bench five mexican men sat drinking budweisers a sixth man wearing a black cowboy shirt with white embroidery and a straw stetson stood facing them playing a guitar and singing in spanish the song was sung slowly and harry had no trouble translating i dont know how to love youi dont even know how to embrace youbecause what never leaves meis this pain that hurts me so the singers plaintive voice carried strongly across the park and bosch thought the song was beautiful he leaned against his car and smoked until the singer was done the kisses that you gave me my loveare the ones that are killing mebut my tears are now dryingwith my pistol and my heartand here as always i spend my lifewith the pistol and the heart at the songs end the men at the picnic table gave the singer a cheer and a toast inside the glass door marked police was a soursmelling room no larger than the back of a pickup truck on the left was a coke machine straight ahead was a door with an electronic bolt and on the right was a thick glass window with a slide tray beneath it a uniformed officer sat behind the glass behind him a woman sat at a radiodispatch console on the other side of the console was a wall of squarefootsized lockers you cant smoke in there sir the uniform said he wore mirrored sunglasses and was overweight the plate over his breast pocket said his name was gruber bosch stepped back to the door and flicked the butt out into the parking lot you know its a hundreddollar fine for littering in calexico sir gruber said harry held up his open badge and id wallet you can bill me he said i need to check a gun gruber smiled curtly revealing his receding purplish gums i chew tobacco myself then you dont have that problem i can tell gruber frowned and had to think about that a moment before saying well lets have it man says he wants to check a gun has to turn the gun in to be checked he turned back to the dispatcher to see if she thought that he now had the upper hand she showed no response bosch noticed the strain grubers gut was putting on the buttons of his uniform he pulled the fortyfour out of his holster and put it in the slide tray foedee foe gruber announced and he lifted the gun out and examined it you want to keep it in the holster bosch hadnt thought about that he needed the holster otherwise hed have to jam the smith in his waistband and hed probably lose it if he ended up having to do any running nah he said just checking the gun gruber winked and took it over to the lockers opened one up and put the gun inside after he closed it he locked it took the key out and came back to the window let me see the id again i have to write up a receipt bosch dropped his badge wallet into the tray and watched as gruber slowly wrote out a receipt in duplicate it seemed that the officer had to look from the id card to what he was writing every two letters howd you get a name like that you can just write harry for short its no problem i can write it just dont ask me to say it looks like it rhymes with anonymous he finished and put the receipts into the tray and told harry to sign them both harry used his own pen lookee there a lefty signing for a righthanded gun gruber said somethin you dont see round here too often he winked at bosch again bosch just looked at him just talking is all gruber said harry dropped one of the receipts into the tray and gruber exchanged it for the locker key it was numbered dont lose it now gruber said as he walked back to the caprice he saw that the men were still at the picnic table in the park but there was no more singing he got into the caprice and put the locker key in the ashtray he never used it for smoking he noticed an old man with white hair unlocking the door below the historical society sign bosch backed out and headed over to the de anza it was a threestory spanishstyle building with a satellite dish on the roof bosch parked in the brick drive up in front his plan was to check in drop his bags in his room wash his face and then make the border crossing into mexicali the man behind the front desk wore a white shirt and brown bow tie to match his brown vest he could not have been much older than twenty a plastic tag on the vest identified him as miguel assistant front desk manager bosch said he wanted a room filled out a registration card and handed it back miguel said oh yes mr bosch we have messages for you he turned to a basket file and pulled out three pink message forms two were from pounds one from irving bosch looked at the times and noticed all three calls had come in during the last two hours first pounds then irving then pounds again wait a minute he said to miguel is there a phone around the corner sir to your right bosch stood there with the phone in his hand wondering what to do something was up or both of them wouldnt have tried to reach him something had made one or both of them call his house and they heard the taped message what could have happened using his pacbell card he called the hollywood homicide table hoping someone was in and that he might learn what was going on jerry edgar answered the call on the first ring jed whats up ive got phone calls from the weight coming out my ass there was a long silence too long jed harry where you at im down south man where down south what is it jed wherever youre at pounds is trying to recall you he said if anybody talks to you ttell you to get your ass back here he said why whats going on its porter man they found him this morning up at sunshine canyon somebody wrapped a wire round his neck so tight that it was the size of a watchband jesus bosch pulled out his cigarettes jesus yeah what was he doing up there sunshine thats the landfill up in foothill division right shit harry he was dumped there of course bosch should have realized that of course he wasnt thinking right right right what happened what happened was that they found his body out there this morning a rag picker come across it he was covered in garbage and shit but rhd traced some of the stuff they got receipts from some restaurants they got the name of the hauler the restaurants use and theyve got it traced to a particular truck and a particular route its a downtown run was made yesterday morning hollywoods working it with them im fixing to go start canvassing on the route well find the dumpster he came from and go from there bosch thought of the dumpster behind poes porter hadnt run out on him he had probably been garroted and dragged out while bosch was having his say with the bartender then he remembered the man with the tattooed tears how had he missed it he had probably stood ten feet from porters killer i didnt go out to the scene but i hear hed been worked over before they did him edgar said his face was busted up nose broke stuff like that a lot of blood i hear man what a pitiful way to go it wouldnt be long before they came into poes with photos of porter the bartender would remember the face and would gladly describe bosch as the man who had come in said he was a cop and attacked porter bosch wondered if he should tell edgar now and save a lot of legwork a survival instinct flared inside him and he decided to say nothing about poes why do pounds and irving want me dont know all i know is first moore gets it then porter think maybe theyre closing ranks or something i think they want everybody in where its nice and safe word going round here is that those two cases are one word is those boys had some kinda deal going irvings already doubled them up hes running a joint op on both of them moore and porter bosch didnt say anything he was trying to think this put a new spin on everything listen to me jed you havent heard from me we didnt talk understand edgar hesitated before saying you sure you want to play it that way yeah for now ill be talking to you watch your back watch out for the black ice bosch thought as he hung up and stood there for a minute leaning against the wall porter how had this happened he instinctively moved his arm against his hip but felt no reassurance the holster was empty he had a choice now go forward to mexicali or go back to la he knew if he went back it would mean the end of his involvement in the case irving would cut him out like a bad spot on a banana therefore he realized he actually had no choice he had to go on bosch pulled a twentydollar bill out of his pocket and went back to the front desk he slid the bill across to miguel yes sir id like to cancel my room miguel no problem there is no charge you never got the room no thats for you miguel i have a slight problem i dont want anybody to know i was here understand miguel was young but he was wise he told bosch his request was no problem he pulled the bill off the counter and tucked it into a pocket inside his vest harry then slid the phone messages across if they call again i never showed up to get these right thats right sir in a few minutes he was in line for the crossing at the border he noticed how the us customs and border patrol building where incoming traffic was handled dwarfed its mexican counterpart the message was clear leaving this country was not a difficulty coming in though was another matter entirely when it was boschs turn at the gate he held his badge wallet open and out the window when the mexican officer took it harry then handed him the calexico pd receipt your business the officer asked he wore a faded uniform that had been army green once his hat was sweatstained along the band official i have a meeting at the plaza justicia ah you know the way bosch held up one of the maps from the seat and nodded the officer then looked at the pink receipt you are unarmed he said as he read the paper you leave your fortyfour behind huh thats what it says the officer smiled and bosch thought he could see disbelief in his eyes the officer nodded and waved his car on the caprice immediately became engulfed in a torrent of automobiles that were moving on a wide avenue with no painted lines denoting lanes at times there were six rows of moving vehicles and sometimes there were four or five the cars made the transitions smoothly harry heard no horns and the traffic flowed quickly he had gone nearly a mile before a red light halted traffic and he was able to consult his maps for the first time he determined he was on calzado lopez mateos which eventually led to the justice center in the southern part of the city the light changed and the traffic began moving again bosch relaxed a little and looked around as he drove careful to keep an eye on the changing lane configuration the boulevard was lined with old shops and industrial businesses their pastelpainted facades had been darkened by exhaust fumes from the passing river of metal and it was all quite depressing to bosch several large chevrolet school buses with multicolor paint jobs moved on the road but they werent enough to bring much cheer to the scene the boulevard curved hard to the south and then rounded a circular intersection with a monument at its center a golden man upon a rearing stallion he noticed several men many wearing straw cowboy hats standing in the circle or leaning against the base of the monument they stared into the sea of traffic day laborers waiting for work bosch checked the map and saw that the spot was called benito juarez circle in another minute bosch came upon a complex of three large buildings with groupings of antennas and satellite dishes on top of each a sign near the roadway announcedayuntamiento de mexicali he pulled into a parking lot there were no parking meters or attendants booth he found a spot and parked while he sat in the car studying the complex he couldnt help but feel as though he were running from something or someone the death of porter shook him he had been right there it made him wonder how he had escaped and why the killer had not tried to take him as well one obvious explanation was that the killer did not want to risk taking on two targets at once but another explanation was that the killer was simply following orders a hired assassin instructed to take down porter bosch had the feeling that if that were so the order had come from here in mexicali each of the three buildings in the complex fronted one side of a triangular plaza they were of modern design with brownandpink sandstone facades all the windows on the third floor of one of the buildings were covered from the inside with newspaper to block the setting sun bosch assumed it gave the building a shabby look above the main entranceway to this building chrome letters saidpolicia judicial del estado de baja california he got out of the car with his juan doe file locked the car door and headed that way walking through the plaza bosch saw several dozen people and many vendors selling food and crafts but mostly food on the front steps of the police building several young girls approached him with hands out trying to sell him chewing gum or wristbands made of colorful threads he said no thanks as he opened the door to the lobby a short woman balancing a tray on her shoulder that contained six pies almost collided with him inside the waiting room contained four rows of plastic chairs that faced a counter on which a uniformed officer leaned almost every chair was taken and every person watched the uniform intently he was wearing mirrored glasses and reading a newspaper bosch approached him and told him in spanish that he had an appointment with investigator carlos aguila he opened his badge case and placed it on the counter the man behind it did not seem impressed but he slowly reached under the counter and brought up a phone it was an old rotary job much older than the building they were in and it seemed to take him an hour to dial the number after a moment the desk officer began speaking rapidfire spanish into the phone harry could make out only a few words captain gringo yes lapd investigator he also thought he heard the desk man say charlie chan the desk officer listened for a few moments and then hung up without looking at bosch he jerked his thumb toward the door behind him and went back to his newspaper harry walked around the counter and through the door into a hallway that extended both right and left with many doors each way he stepped back into the waiting room tapped the desk officer on the shoulder and asked which way to the end last door the officer said in english and pointed to the hallway to the left bosch followed the directions and came to a large room where several men milled around standing and others sat on couches there were bicycles leaning on the walls where there was not a couch there was a lone desk at which a young woman sat typing while a man apparently dictated to her harry noticed the man had a barretta mm wedged in the waistband of his doubleknit pants he then noticed that some of the other men wore guns in holsters or also in their waistbands this was the detective bureau the chatter in the room stopped when bosch walked in he asked the man closest to him for carlos aguila this caused another man to call through a doorway at the back of the room again it was too fast but bosch heard the word chan and tried to think what it meant in spanish the man who had yelled then jerked his thumb toward the door and bosch went that way he heard quiet laughter behind him but didnt turn around the door led to a small office with a single desk behind it a man with gray hair and tired eyes sat smoking a cigarette a mexican newspaper a glass ashtray and a telephone were the only items on the desk a man with mirrored aviator glasseswhat else was newsat in a chair against the far wall and studied bosch unless he was sleeping buenos dias the older man said in english he said i am captain gustavo grena and you are detective harry bosch we spoke yesterday bosch reached across the desk and shook his hand grena then indicated the man in the mirrors and investigator aguila is who you have come to see what have you brought from your investigation in los angeles aguila the officer who had sent the inquiry to the los angeles consulate was a small man with dark hair and light skin his forehead and nose were burned red by the sun but bosch could see his white chest through the open collar of his shirt he wore jeans and black leather boots he nodded to bosch but made no effort to shake his hand there was no chair to sit down on so harry walked up close to the desk and placed the file down he opened it and took out morgue polaroids of juan doe s face and the chest tattoo he handed them to grena who studied them a moment and then put them down you also look for a man then the killer perhaps grena asked there is a possibility that he was killed here and his body taken to los angeles if that is so then your department should look for the killer perhaps grena put a puzzled look on his face i dont understand he said why why would this happen i am sure you must be mistaken detective bosch bosch shook his shoulders he wasnt going to press it yet well id like to at least get the identification confirmed and then go from there very well grena said i leave you with investigator aguila but i have to inform you the business you mentioned on the phone yesterday envirobreed i have personally interviewed the manager and he has assured me that your juan doe did not work there i have saved you that much time grena nodded as if to say his efforts were no inconvenience at all think nothing of it how can they be sure when we dont have the id yet grena dragged on his cigarette to give him time to think about that one he said i provided the name fernal gutierrezllosa to him no such employee at any time this is an american contractor we must be careful you see we do not wish to step on the toes of the international trade grena stood up dropped his cigarette in the ash tray and nodded to aguila then he left the office bosch looked at the mirrored glasses and wondered if aguila had understood a word of what had just been said dont worry about the spanish aguila said after grena was gone i speak your language bosch insisted that he drive saying he did not want to leave the capriceit wasnt his he explainedin the parking lot what he didnt explain was that he wanted to be near his gun which was still in the trunk on their way through the plaza they waved away the children with their hands out in the car bosch said howre we going to make the id without prints aguila picked the file up off the seat his friends and wife will look at the photos we going to his house i can lift prints take em back to la to have someone take a look it would confirm it it is not a house detective bosch it is a shack bosch nodded and started the car aguila directed him farther south to boulevard lazaro cardenas on which they headed west for a short while before turning south again on avenida canto rodado we go to the barrio aguila said it is know as ciudad de los personas perdidos city of lost souls thats what the tattoo means right the ghost lost souls yes that is correct bosch thought a moment before asking how far is it from lost souls barrio to saints and sinners it is also in the southwest sector not far from lost souls i will show it to you if you wish yeah maybe is there a reason you ask bosch thought of corvos admonition not to trust the local police just curious he said its another case he immediately felt guilty at not being truthful with aguila he was a cop and bosch felt he deserved the benefit of the doubt but not according to corvo they drove in silence for a while after that they were moving away from the city and the comfort of buildings and traffic the commercial businesses and the shops and restaurants gave way to more shacks and cardboard shanties harry saw a refrigerator box near the side of the road that was somebodys home the people they passed sitting on rusted engine blocks oil drums stared at the car with hollow eyes bosch tried to keep his eyes on the dusty road they called you charlie chan back there how come he asked primarily because he was nervous and thought conversation might distract him from his uneasiness and the unpleasantness of the journey they were making yes aguila said it is because i am chinese bosch turned and looked at him from the side he could look behind the mirrors and see the slight rounding of the eyes it was there partly i should say one of my grandfathers there is a large chinesemexican community in mexicali detective bosch oh mexicali was created around by the colorado river land company they owned a huge stretch of land on both sides of the border and they needed cheap labor to pick their cotton their vegetables aguila said they established mexicali across the border from calexico like mirror images i suppose at least according to plan they brought in ten thousand chinese all men and they had a town a company town bosch nodded he had never heard the story but found it interesting he had seen many chinese restaurants and signs on his drive through the city but did not recall seeing many asians they all stayedthe chinese he asked most of them yes but like i said ten thousand chinamen no women the company wouldnt allow it thought it would take away from the work later some women came but most of the time the men married into mexican families the blood was mixed but as you probably have seen much of the culture was preserved we will enjoy some chinese food at siesta okay sure okay police work has largely remained the domain of the traditional mexicans there are not many like me in the state judicial police for this reason i am called charlie chan i am considered an outsider by the others i think i know how you feel you will reach a point detective bosch where you will be able to trust me i am comfortable waiting to discuss this other case you mentioned bosch nodded and felt embarrassed and tried to concentrate on his driving soon aguila directed him onto a narrow unpaved road that cut through the heart of a barrio there were flatroofed concreteblock buildings with blankets hung in open doorways additions to these buildings were constructed of plywood and sheets of aluminum there was trash and other debris scattered about haggard gauntlooking men milled around and stared at the caprice with california plates as it went by pull to the building with the painted star aguila instructed bosch saw the star it was handpainted on the block wall of one of the sad structures above the star was painted personas perdidos scrawled beneath it were the words honorable alcade y sheriff bosch parked the caprice in front of the hovel and waited for instructions he is neither a mayor or sheriff if thats what you may be thinking aguila said arnolfo munoz de la cruz is simply what you would call a peacekeeper here to a place of disorder he brings order or tries he is the sheriff of the city of lost souls he brought the missing man to our attention this is where fernal gutierrezllosa lived bosch got out carrying the juan doe file with him as he walked around the front of the car he again rubbed his hand against his jacket where it hung over his holster it was a subconscious move he made every time he got out of the car and was on the job but this time when the comforting feel of the gun beneath was not there he became acutely aware that he was an unarmed stranger in a strange land he could not retrieve his smith from the trunk while in the presence of aguila at least not until he knew him better aguila rang a clay bell that hung near the doorway of the structure there was no door just a blanket that was draped over a wood slat hammered across the top of the passage a voice inside called abierto and they went inside munoz was a small man deeply tanned and with gray hair tied in a knot behind his head he wore no shirt which exposed the sheriffs star tattooed on the right side of his chest the ghost on the left he looked at aguila and then at bosch staring curiously at him aguila introduced bosch and told munoz why they had come he spoke slowly enough so that bosch could understand aguila told the old man that he needed to take a look at some photographs this confused munozuntil bosch slipped the morgue shots out of the file and he saw that the photographs were of a dead man is it fernal gutierrezllosa aguila inquired after the man had studied the photographs long enough it is him munoz now looked away bosch looked around for the first time the oneroom shack was very much like a large prison cell just the necessities a bed a box of clothes a towel hung over the back of an old chair a candle and a mug with a toothbrush in it on top of a cardboard box next to the bed it had a squalid smell and he felt embarrassed that he had intruded where was his place he asked aguila in english aguila looked at munoz and said i am sorry for the loss of your friend mr munoz it will be my duty to inform his wife do you know if she is here munoz nodded and said the woman was at her dwelling would you like to come with us to help munoz nodded again picked a white shirt up off the bed and put it on then he went to the door parted the curtain over the opening and held it for them bosch first went to the trunk of the caprice and got the print kit from his briefcase then they walked farther down the dusty street until they came to a plywood shack with a canvas canopy in front of it aguila touched bosch on the elbow señor munoz and i will deal with the woman we will bring her out here you go in and collect the fingerprints you need and do whatever else you need to do munoz called out the name marita and a few moments later a small woman peeked through the white plastic shower curtain hung across the doorway when she saw munoz and aguila she came out bosch could tell by her face that she already knew the news that the men were there to deliver women were always that way harry thought of the first night he had seen sylvia moore she knew they all knew bosch handed the file to aguila in case the woman demanded to see the photos and ducked into the room the woman and the juan doe had shared it was a room with spare furnishings no surprise there a queensized mattress lay on top of a wooden pallet there was a single chair on one side of it and on the other a bureau had been made out of a wood and cardboard shipping crate a few articles of clothing hung inside the box the back wall of the room was a large piece of uncut aluminum with the tecate beer trademark printed on it woodslat shelves went across this holding coffee cans a cigar box and other small items bosch could hear the woman crying quietly outside the shack and munoz trying to console her he looked around the room quickly trying to decide which was a likely spot to lift prints he was unsure if he even needed to do this the womans tears seemed to confirm the identity he walked to the shelves and used a fingernail to flip open the cigar box it contained a dirty comb a few pesos and a set of dominoes carlos he called out aguila stuck his head in past the shower curtian ask if she has handled this box lately it looks like it was her husbands stuff if its his ill try some lifts on it he heard the questioning in spanish outside and the woman said she did not touch the box ever because it was her husbands using his nails harry put the box on top of the makeshift bureau he opened the print kit and took out a small spray bottle a vial of black powder a sablehair brush a wide roll of clear tape and a stack of cards he laid all of these out on the bed and set to work he picked up the spray bottle and pumped four sprays of ninhydrin mist over the box after the mist settled he took out a cigarette lit it and then moved the stillburning match along the edge of the box about two inches from the surface the heat brought up the ridges of several fingerprints in the ninhydrin bosch bent over the table and studied them looking for complete examples there were two he uncapped the vial of black powder and lightly brushed some onto the prints clearly defining the ridges and bifurcations he then unrolled a short length of tape held it down on one of the prints and lifted it he pressed the tape against a white card he did it again with the other print he had two good prints to take back with him aguila came into the room then did you get a print a couple hopefully they are his and not hers doesnt seem to matter much sounded like she made an id too she look at the pictures aguila nodded and said she insisted did you search the room for what i do not know i looked around not much here did you take fingerprints from the coffee cans bosch looked at the shelves there were three old maxwell house cans he said nah i figured her prints are on them i dont want to have to print her to clear her for comparisons its not worth putting her through that aguila nodded but then looked puzzled why would a poor man and his wife have three cans of coffee it was a good point bosch went to the shelves and took down one can it rattled and when he opened it he found a handful of pesos inside the can the next one he pulled down was about a third full of coffee the last one was the lightest inside he found papers a baptismal certificate for gutierrezllosa and a marriage license the couple had been married thirtytwo years it depressed him to think about it there was also a polaroid photo of gutierrezllosa and bosch could see it was juan doe identity confirmed and there was a polaroid of his wife and lastly there was a stack of check stubs held together in a rubber band bosch looked through these finding them all for small amounts of money from several businessesthe financial records of a day laborer the businesses that didnt pay their day laborers in cash paid with checks the last two in the stack were receipts for sixteen dollars each for checks issued by envirobreed inc bosch put the check stubs into his pocket and told aguila he was ready to go while aguila expressed condolences again to the new widow bosch went to the trunk of the car to put away the fingerprint kit and the cards with the lifts he had taken he looked over the trunk lid and saw aguila still standing with munoz and the woman harry quickly lifted up the rug on the right side of the trunk pulled up the spare tire and grabbed his smith he put the gun in his holster and slid it around on his waist so that the gun would be on his back it was under his jacket but an eye looking for such things could see it however bosch was no longer worried about aguila he got in the car and waited aguila got in a few moments later bosch watched the widow and the sheriff in the rear view mirror as they drove away what will happen with her now he asked aguila you dont want to know detective bosch her life was difficult before now her hardships will only multiply i believe she cries for herself as much as her lost husband and rightly so bosch drove in silence until they were out of lost souls and back on the main road that was clever what you did back there he said after a while with the coffee cans aguila didnt say anything he didnt have to bosch knew he had been in there before and had seen the envirobreed stubs grena was scamming and aguila didnt like it or approve of it or maybe he was just unhappy because he hadnt been cut in on the deal whatever the reason he was pointing bosch in the right direction aguila wanted bosch to find the stubs he wanted bosch to know grena was a liar did you go to envirobreed check it out on your own no aguila said this would be reported to my captain i could not go there after he had made the appropriate inquiry envirobreed is involved in international business it holds contracts with government agencies in the united states you must understand it is a delicate situation yes this is true im familiar with those i understand you cant buck grena but i can where is envirobreed not far from here to the southwest where the land is mostly flat until it rises into the sierra de los cucapah there are many industrial concerns there and large ranches and how close is it between envirobreed and the ranch owned by the pope the pope zorrillo the pope of mexicali i thought you wanted to know about the other case im working they drove a little bit in silence bosch looked over and saw that aguilas face had clouded even with the mirrors bosch could see this his mention of zorrillo probably confirmed a suspicion the mexican detective had held since grena had tried to derail the investigation bosch already knew from corvo that envirobreed was just across the highway from the ranch his question was merely one more test of aguila it was a while before aguila finally answered the ranch and envirobreed are very close im afraid good show me let me ask you a question bosch said how come you sent that inquiry to the consuls office i mean you dont have missing persons down here somebody turns up missing they crossed the border but you dont send out inquiries what made you think this was different they were heading toward the range of mountains that rose high above a layer of light brown smog from the city they were going southwest on avenida val verde and were moving through an area where ranch lands extended to the west and industrial parks lined the roadway to the east the woman convinced me aguila said she came to the plaza with the sheriff and made the report grena gave me the investigation and her words convinced me that gutierrezllosa would not cross the border willinglywithout her so i went to the circle aguila said the circle below the golden statue of benito juarez on calzado lopez mateos was where men went to wait for work other day laborers interviewed at the circle said the envirobreed vans came two or three times a week to hire workers the men who had worked at the bugbreeding plant had described it as difficult work they made food paste for the breeding process and loaded heavy incubation cartons into the vans flies constantly flew in their mouths and eyes many who had worked there said they never went back choosing to wait for other employers to stop at the circle but not gutierrezllosa others at the circle had reported seeing him get into the envirobreed van compared to the other laborers he was an old man he did not have much choice in employers aguila said that when he learned the product made at envirobreed was shipped across the border he sent out missingperson notices to consulates in southern california among his theories was that the old man had been killed in an accident at the plant and his body hidden to avoid an inquiry that could halt production aguila believed this was a common occurrence in the industrial sectors of the city a death investigation even accidental death can be very expensive aguila said la mordida yes the bite aguila explained that his investigation stopped when he discussed his findings with grena the captain said he would handle the envirobreed inquiry and later reported it to be a dead end and that was where it stood until bosch called with news of the body sounds like grena got his bite aguila did not answer this they began to pass a ranch protected by a chain metal fence topped with razor wire bosch looked through it to the sierra de los cucapah and saw nothing in the vast expanse between the road and mountains but soon they passed a break in the fence an entrance to the ranch where there was a pickup truck parked lengthwise across the roadway two men were sitting in the cab and they looked at bosch and he looked at them as he drove by thats it isnt it he said thats zorrillos ranch yes the entrance zorrillos name never came up before you heard it from me not until you said it aguila offered no other comment in a minute they were coming up to some buildings inside the ranchs fence line but close to the road bosch could see a concrete barnlike structure with a garage door that was closed there were corrals on either side of it and in these he saw a half dozen bulls in single pens he saw no one around he breeds bulls for the ring aguila said i heard that lot of money in that around here huh all from the seed of one prized bull el temblar a very famous animal in mexicali the bull that killed meson the famous torero he lives here now and roams the ranch at his will taking the heifers as he wishes a champion animal the tremble he said yes it is said that man and earth tremble when the beast charges that is the legend the death of meson a decade ago is very well known a story recalled each sunday at the plaza and the tremble just runs around in there loose like a watchdog or something a bulldog sometimes people stand at the fence waiting for a glimpse of the great animal the bulls his seed produces are considered the most game in all of baja pull over here bosch turned onto the shoulder he noticed aguila was looking across the street at a line of warehouses and businesses some had signs on them most in english they were companies that used cheap mexican labor and paid low taxes to make products for the united states there were furniture manufacturers tile makers circuit board factories see the mexitec furniture building aguila said the second structure down with no sign that is envirobreed it was a white building and aguila was right no sign or other indication of what went on there it was surrounded by a tenfoot fence topped with razor wire signs on the fence warned in two languages that it was electrified and there were dogs inside of it bosch didnt see any dogs and decided they were probably only put in the yard at night he did see two cameras on the front corners of the building and several cars parked inside the compound he saw no envirobreed vans but the two garage doors at the front of the building were closed bosch had to press a button state his business and hold his badge up to a remote camera before the fence gate automatically rolled open he parked next to a maroon lincoln with california tags and they walked across the dusty unpaved lot to the door marked office he brushed his hand against the back of his hip and felt the gun under his jacket a small measure of comfort the door was opened as he reached for the doorknob and a man wearing a stetson to shade his acnescarred and sunhardened face stepped out lighting a cigarette he was an anglo and bosch thought he might have been the van driver he had seen at the eradication center in la last door on the left the man said hes waiting whos he him the man in the stetson smiled and bosch thought his face might crack bosch and aguila stepped through the door into a woodpaneled hallway it went straight back with a small reception desk on the left followed by three doors at the end of the hall there was a fourth door a young mexican woman sat at the reception desk and stared at them silently bosch nodded and they headed back the first door they passed was closed and letters on it said usda the next two doors had no letters the one at the end of the hall had a sign that said danger radiation no unauthorized admittance harry saw a hook next to the door that had goggles and breathing masks hanging on it he opened the last door on the left and they stepped into a small anteroom with a secretarys desk but no secretary in here please a voice said from the next room bosch and aguila stepped into a large office that was weighted in the center by a huge steel desk a man in a light blue guayaberra shirt sat behind it he was writing something in a ledger book and there was a styrofoam cup of steaming coffee on the desk enough light came through the jalousie window behind him so that he didnt need a desk light he looked about fifty years old with gray hair that showed streaks of old black dye he also was a gringo the man said nothing and continued writing bosch looked around and saw the fourpicture closedcircuit television console on a low shelf against the wall next to the desk he saw the blackandwhite images from the gate and front corners the fourth image was very dark and was an interior look at what harry assumed was the cargoloading room he saw a white van with its rear doors open two or three men loading large white boxes into it yes the man said he still hadnt looked up quite a lot of security for flies now he looked up excuse me didnt know they were so valuable what can i do for you he threw his pen down on the desk to signal that the wheels of international commerce were grinding to a halt because of bosch harry bosch los angeles po you said that at the gate what can i do for you i am here to talk about one of your employees name he picked up the pen again and went back to work on the ledger you know something i would think that if a cop had come three hundred miles crossed the border just to ask you a few questions then it might rate a little interest but not with you that bothers me the pen went down harder this time and bounced off the desk into the trash can next to it officer i dont care whether it bothers you or not i have a shipment of perishable material i must get on the road by four oclock i cant afford to show the interest you seem to think you rate now if you want to give me the employees namethat is if he was an employeei will answer what i can what do you mean was an employee what you said was just then so so whats it mean you saidyoure the one who came in here with these questions i and your name is what what is your name the man stopped thoroughly confused and drank from the cup he said you know mister you have no authority here you said even if the guy was an employee and i never said anything about was makes me think you already know we are talking about an individual that was who is dead now i just assumed okay a cop comes all the way down from la i just assumed we were talking about a dead guy dont try to put wordsyou cant come in here with that badge that isnt worth the tin its made of once you cross that border and start pushing me i dont have you want some authority this is carlos aguila of the state judicial police here you can consider that he is asking the same questions as me aguila nodded but said nothing thats not the point the man behind the desk said the point is this typical bullshit american imperialism you bring with you i find it very distasteful my name is charles ely i am proprietor of envirobreed i do not know anything about the man you said worked here i didnt tell you his name it doesnt matter you understand now you made a mistake you played this game wrong bosch took the morgue photo of gutierrezllosa out of his pocket and slid it across the desk ely did not touch the photo but looked down at it he showed no reaction that bosch could see then bosch put down the pay stubs same thing no reaction name is fernal gutierrezllosa bosch said a day laborer i need to know when he worked here last what he was doing ely retrieved his pen from the trash can and flicked the photo back toward bosch with it afraid i cant help day laborers we dont carry records on we pay them with pay to bearer checks at the end of each day different people all the time i wouldnt know this man from adam and i believe we already answered questions about this man from the sjp a captain grena i guess i will have to call him now to see why that wasnt sufficient bosch wanted to ask whether he meant the payoff ely had given grena or the information wasnt sufficient but he held back because it would come back on aguila instead he said you do that mr ely meantime somebody else around here might remember this man i am going to take a look around ely became immediately agitated no sir you are not going to have free range of this facility portions of this building are used to irradiate material and are considered dangerous and off limits to all but certified personnel other areas are subject to usda monitoring and quarantine and we cannot allow anyone access again you have no authority here who owns envirobreed ely bosch asked ely seemed startled by the change in subject who he sputtered who is the man ely i dont have to answer that you have no the man across the street is the pope the man ely stood up and pointed at the door i dont know what you are talking about but youre leaving and i will be contacting both the sjp and the american and mexican authorities we will see if this is how they want police from los angeles to operate on foreign soil bosch and aguila moved back into the hall and closed the door harry stood there for a moment and listened for the sound of a telephone or steps he heard nothing and then turned to the door at the end of the hall he tried it but it was locked in front of the door marked usda he leaned his head forward and listened but heard nothing he opened the door without knocking and a man with bureaucrat written all over him looked up from behind a small wooden desk the room was about a quarter the size of elys suite the man wore a shortsleeved white shirt with a thin blue tie he had closecropped gray hair a mustache that looked like the end of a toothbrush and small dead eyes that looked out from behind bifocals that squeezed against his pudgy pink temples the plastic ink guard in his pocket had his name printed on the flap jerry dinsmore he had a halfeaten bean burrito on his desk sitting on oilstained paper can i help you he said with a mouthful bosch and aguila moved into the room bosch showed him his id and let him have a good look at it then he put the morgue photo on the desk next to the burrito dinsmore looked at it and folded up the paper around his halffinished meal and put it in a drawer recognize him bosch said just a routine check infectious disease alert guy took it with him up to la and croaked we are retracing him so we can get anybody who had contact inoculated we still got plenty of time we hope dinsmore was chewing his food much slower now he looked down at the polaroid and then up over his glasses at bosch was he one of the men who worked around here we think so we are checking with all the regular employees we thought you might recognize him it depends on how close you got as far as whether you need to be quarantined well i never get close to the laborers im in the clear but what is the disease that you are talking about i dont see why lapd isthis man looks like he was beaten im sorry mr dinsmore thats confidential until we determine if you are at risk if you are well then we have to put our cards on the table now how do you mean you never get close to the laborers are you not the inspection officer for this facility bosch expected ely to burst in any moment i am the inspector but i am only interested in the finished product i inspect samples directly from the travel cases then i seal the cases this is done in the shipping room you have to remember this is a private facility and consequently i do not have free reign of the breeding or sterilization labs therefore i do not interface with the workers you just said samples so that means you dont look in all of the boxes wrong i dont look in all of the larvae cylinders in each of the transport cases but i do inspect and seal the cases i dont see what this has to do with this man he didnt i dont see it either never mind youre in the clear dinsmores small eyes widened slightly bosch winked at him to further confuse him he wondered if dinsmore was part of what was going on here or whether like a mole he was in the dark he told him to go back to his burrito and then he and aguila stepped back into the hall just at that moment the door at the end of the hall opened and through it stepped ely he pulled a breathing mask and goggles off his face and charged down the hall coffee slopping over the sides of the styrofoam cup i want you two out of here unless you have a court order he was right up to bosch now and anger was etching red lines on his face it was the act he might have used to intimidate others but bosch was not impressed he looked down into the shorter mans coffee cup and smiled as a small piece of the puzzle slipped into place the stomach contents of juan doe had included coffee that was how he had swallowed the medfly which had brought bosch here ely followed his eyes down and saw the medfly floating on the surface of the hot liquid fuckin flies he said you know bosch said ill probably get that court order he couldnt think of anything else to say and didnt want to leave ely with the satisfaction of throwing him out he and aguila headed for the exit dont count on it ely said this is mexico you arent jackshit here bosch stood at the window of his thirdfloor room in the hotel colorado on calzado justo sierra and looked out at what he could see of mexicali to his left the view was obscured by the other wing of the hotel but looking out to the right he saw the streets were clogged with cars and the colorful buses he had seen earlier he could hear a mariachi band playing somewhere there was the smell of frying grease in the air from a nearby restaurant and the sky above the ramshackle city was purple and red in the days dying light in the distance he could see the buildings of the justice center and near them to the right the rounded shape of a stadium plaza de los toros he had called corvo in los angeles two hours earlier left his number and location and was waiting for a call back from his man in mexicali ramos he walked away from the window and looked at the phone he knew it was time to make the rest of the calls but he hesitated he grabbed a beer out of the tin ice bucket on the bureau and opened it he drank a quarter of it and sat on the bed next to the phone there were three messages on the phone tape at his home all of them from pounds saying the same thing call me but he didnt instead he called the homicide table first it was saturday night but the chances were it would still be all hands on deck because of porter jerry edgar answered whats the situation shit man you gotta come in he was speaking in a very low voice everybodys looking for you rhds got the lead on this thing so i dont know exactly whats happening im just one of the gofers but i think uh i dont know man what say it its like they think you either did porter or you might be next its hard to gauge what the fuck theyre doing or thinking whos there everybody this is the command post irvings in there in the box with ninetyeight now bosch knew he couldnt let it go on much further he had to call in he might have already damaged himself beyond repair okay he said im going to call them i have to make one other call first thanks bosch hung up and dialed another number hoping he had remembered it correctly and that she would be home it was near seven and he thought maybe she had gone out for dinner but then she picked up on the sixth ring its bosch a bad time what do you want teresa said where are you everybodys looking for you you know i heard but im outta town i was just calling cause i heard they found my friend lucius porter yeah they did sorry i just got back from the cut yeah i figured youd do it and then silence before she said harry why do i get the feeling you wantthat you arent calling just because he was your friend well oh shit here we go again right no i just wanted to know how he got it is all he was a friend i worked with him never mind i dont know why i let you do this to me shit mexican necktie harry there you happy got all you need now garrote yes steel baling wire wrapped at the ends around two wooden pegs im sure youve seen it before do i get to read this in thetimes tomorrow too he was silent until he was sure she was done he looked from the bed to the open window and saw the daylight was now completely gone the sky was a deep red wine he thought of the man at poes three tears did you do a compar comparison to the jimmy kapps case yes were way ahead of you but it wont be done for a few days how come because it takes that long to do woodfiber testing between the dowel pegs and alloycontent analysis on the baling wire we did do a cut analysis on the wire though it looks very good meaning meaning it looks like the wire on the garrote used to kill porter was cut from the same length of wire used to kill kapps the ends match its not one hundred percent because similar pliers will leave similar cut tracings so we are doing the metalalloy comparison well know in a few days she seemed so matteroffact about it all he was surprised she was still angry with him the television reports of the night before seemed to be in her favor he didnt know what to say he had gone from being at ease in bed with her to being nervous on the phone with her thanks teresa he finally said ill see you harry she said before he could hang up yeah when you get back i dont think you should call me again i think we should keep it professional if we see each other in the suite then thats fine but lets leave it there he didnt say anything okay sure they hung up bosch sat without moving for several minutes finally he picked the phone up again and dialed the direct line into the glass box pounds picked up immediately its bosch where are you mexicali you left messages i called the hotel on your tape they said you never checked in i decided to stay on the other side of the border never mind the bullshit porter is dead what bosch tried his best to make it seem real what happened i just saw him yesterday he never mind the bullshit bosch what are you doing down there you told me to go where the case followed it led here i never told you to go to mexico he was yelling i want you back here ten minutes ago this does not look good for you we have a bartender that so help me christ is ready to put your dick in the dirt on this hehang on bosch a new voice on the line said assistant chief irving here what is your location im in mexicali i want you in my office at oh eight hundred tomorrow bosch didnt hesitate he knew he could not show any weakness cant do that chief i have some unfinished business here thatll probably take me through tomorrow at least we are talking about a fellow officers murder here detective i dont know if you realize this but you could be in danger yourself i know what i am doing its a fellow officers murder that brings me here remember or doesnt moore matter irving ignored that you are refusing my direct order to return look chief i dont care what some bartender is telling you you know i wasnt the doer i never said that but your conversation already reveals that you know more about this than you should if you were not involved all im saying is that the answer to a lot of questionsabout moore porter and the restare down here its all down here im staying detective bosch i was wrong about you i gave you a lot of rope this time because i thought i detected a change in you i see now that i was wrong you fooled me again you chief i am doing my dont interrupt me you may be unwilling to follow my explicit commands to return but dont you interrupt me i am telling you that you dont want to return fine dont but you might as well never return bosch think about that what you had before wont be waiting when you get back after irving hung up bosch picked a second bottle of tecate from the bucket and lit a cigarette at the window he didnt care about irvings threats not that much at least hed probably draw a suspension maybe five days max he could handle that but irving wouldnt move bosch where could he send him there werent very many places lower than hollywood instead bosch thought about porter he had been able to put it off put it out of his mind but now he had to think about porter strangled with baling wire left in a dumpster poor bastard but something in bosch refused to let him grant the dead cop sympathy nothing about it touched his heart the way he thought it would or should it was a pitiful end of life but he felt no pity porter had made fatal mistakes bosch promised himself that he would not and that he would go on he tried to focus on zorrillo harry was sure that it was the pope who was manipulating things who had sent the assassin to clean up the loose ends if it was likely the same man had killed both kapps and porter it was then easy to add moore in as a victim as well and possibly even fernal gutierrezllosa the man with three tears did that leave dance off the hook bosch doubted it it might have taken dance to lure moore to the hideaway his thoughts reassured him that he was doing the right thing staying the answers were here not in la he went to his briefcase on the bureau and took out the mug shot of dance that had been in the file moore had put together he looked at the practiced sulk of a young man who still had a boyish face and bleached blond hair now he wanted to move up the ladder and had come south of the border to make his case bosch realized that if dance was in mexicali he would not blend in easily hed have to have help the knock on the door startled him bosch quietly put down the bottle and took the gun off the night table through the peephole he saw a man of about thirty with dark hair and a thick mustache he was not the room service waiter who had brought the beer si bosch its ramos bosch opened the door on the chain and asked for some identification are you kidding i dont carry id around here let me in corvo sent me how do i know because you called la operations two hours ago and left your address i tell you i really get fucking paranoid having to explain all of this while standing out in the hallway bosch closed the door flipped off the chain and reopened it he kept the gun in his hand but down at his side ramos walked past him into the room he walked up to the window and looked out then he walked away and began pacing near the bed he said smells like shit out there somebody cooking tortillas or some shit got any more brew and by the way thefederales catch you with that piece and you might have trouble trying to get back across how come you didnt stay in calexico like corvo told you to man if he had been anyone other than a cop bosch would have figured he was coked to the eyelids but he decided it was probably something else something he didnt know about yet that made ramos seem wired bosch picked up the phone and ordered a sixpack from room service never taking his eyes off the man in his room after he hung up he put the gun in his waistband and sat down in the chair by the window i didnt want to deal with the lines at the border he said in answer to one of ramoss many questions you didnt want to put your trust in corvo is what you mean i dont blame you not that i dont trust him i do but i can see the need to want to go your own way they got better food over here anyway but calexico theres a wild little town its one of those places you never know what kind of shit is going down you hit that place the wrong way and you go into a slide man i like it better over here myself did you eat for a moment bosch thought about what sylvia moore had said about the black ice ramos was still pacing the room and bosch noticed he had two electronic pagers on his belt the agent was hyped on something bosch was sure of it i already ate bosch said and moved his chair near the window because the room had taken on the tang of the agents body odor i know the best chinese food in two countries we could pop over for hey ramos sit down youre making me nervous just sit down and tell me whats going on ramos looked around himself as if seeing the room for the first time he dragged a chair away from the wall near the door and straddled it backward in the middle of the room whats going on man is that we are not too impressed with the shit you pulled at envirobreed today bosch was surprised the dea knew so much so fast but tried not to show it that was not cool at all ramos was saying so i came here to tell you to quit the oneman show corvo told me that was your bag but i didnt expect to see it so soon whats the problem bosch said it was my lead from what corvo said you people didnt know shit about that place i went in there to shake em up a little bit thats all these people dont shake bosch thats what i am saying now look enough said i just wanted to say my little piece and to see what you have going besides the bug place what im asking is what are you doing here before bosch could answer there was a loud knock on the door and the dea agent jumped off the chair coming down in a crouched position its room service bosch said whats wrong with you always get this way before we jam bosch got up looking curiously at the dea agent and went to the door through the peephole he saw the same man who had delivered the first two beers he opened the door paid for the delivery and gave ramos a bottle from the new bucket ramos chugged half the bottle before sitting back down bosch took a beer back to his seat what do you mean by before we jam well ramos said after another swallow the stuff you gave corvo was good info but then you canceled that out by cowboying it over there today you nearly fucked things up you said that what did you find out envirobreed we ran down the info and its a direct hit we traced ownership through a bunch of blinds to a gilberto ornelas thats a known alias for a guy named fernando ibarra one of zorrillos lieutenants we are working with thefederales on getting search approvals they are cooperating on this one this new attorney general they got down here is clean and mean hes working with us so its going to be a major jam if we get the approval when will you know any time one last piece has to fall whats that if hes moving black ice across the border in envirobreed shipments then how is he getting it from the ranch to the bug house see weve been watching the ranch and wouldve seen it and were pretty sure its not manufactured at envirobreed too small too many people around too close to the road et cetera et cetera all our intelligence says its made on the ranch underground in a bunker we got aerials that show the heat patterns from the ventilation anyway the question is then hows he get it across the street to envirobreed bosch thought about what corvo had said at the code that zorrillo was suspected of helping to finance the tunnel that went under the border at nogales he doesnt take it across the street he takes it under exactly ramos said we are working our informants on it right now we get it confirmed we get our approval from the attorney general and we go in we hit the ranch and envirobreed simultaneously joint operation the ag sends the federal militia we send clet bosch hated all the acronyms law enforcement agencies cling to but asked what clet was anyway clandestine laboratory enforcement team these guys are fuckin ninjas bosch thought this information over he didnt understand why it was happening so quickly ramos was leaving something out there had to be new intelligence on zorrillo youve seen him havent you zorrillo or somebody has you got it and that other little white squirrel you came down looking for dance where when we have a ci inside the fence who saw the both of them outside the main compound shooting at targets this morning and then we how close was he the informant close enough not close enough to say howdy do mr pope but close enough to make the id ramos cackled loudly and got up to get another beer he threw a bottle to bosch who wasnt yet done with his first where had he been bosch asked christ who knows only thing i care about is that he is back and he is going to be there when the clets come through the door and by the way you better not bring that gun with you or thefederales will hook you up too they are giving a special weapons privilege to the clets but that is it the ag is going to sign itgod i hope this guy never gets bought off or assassinated anyway like im saying if they want you to have a gun theyll give you something from their own armory and how am i going to know when it goes down ramos was still standing he jerked his head back and poured down half the bottle of beer his odor had totally filled the room bosch held his bottle up near his mouth and nose so hed smell the beer instead of the dea agent well let you know ramos said take this and wait he tossed bosch one of the pagers off his belt you put that on and ill give you a buzz when we are ready to rock it will be soon at least before new years im hoping we gotta move on this there is no telling how long the target is going to stay in place this time he finished the beer and put the bottle on the table he didnt pick up another the meeting was done what about my partner bosch asked who the mex forget it hes state you cant tell him about this bosch the pope has the sjp and the other locals wired its a given dont trust anybody over there dont tell anybody over there just wear the pager like i said and wait for the beep go to the bullfights hang by the pool or something hell man look at yourself you could use the color i know aguila better than i know you did you know he works for a man who is a regular guest of zorrillos at the bullfights each sunday no bosch said he thought of grena did you know that to become a detective in the sjp the promotion is bought for an average of two thousand dollars not based on any skill in investigative technique no i know you didnt but thats the way it is here youve got to understand that trust no one you may be working with the last honest cop in mexicali but why bet your life on it bosch nodded and said one more thing i want to come in tomorrow and check your mug books you have zorrillos people most of them what do you want im looking for a guy with three tattooed tears hes zorrillos hit man he hit another cop yesterday in la jesus okay in the morning call me at this number well set it up if you make an id well get the word to the ag itll help us get the search approval he gave bosch a card with a phone number on it nothing else then he was gone harry put the chain back on the lock bosch sat on the bed with his beer thinking about the reappearance of zorrillo he wondered where he had been and why he had left the safety of his ranch in the first place harry poked at the idea that maybe zorrillo had been in la and that it had taken his presence there to lure moore to the motel room where he was put down on the bathroom floor maybe zorrillo was the only one moore would have gone there for the sharp sound of squealing brakes and crashing metal shot through the window before he even got up he heard voices arguing in the street below the words grew harsher until they were threats being yelled so fast bosch could not understand them he went to the window and saw two men standing chests out beside two cars one had rearended the other as he turned away he detected a small flash of blue light to his left before he had time to look the bottle in his hand shattered and beer and glass exploded in all directions he instinctively took a step back and launched himself over the bed and down onto the floor he braced himself for more shots but none came his heartbeat rapidly increased and he felt the familiar rush of mental clarity that comes only in situations of life and death he crawled along the floor to the table and pulled the lamp plug out of the wall dropping the room in darkness as he reached up to the table for his gun he heard the two cars speeding away in the street a beautiful setup he thought but they missed he moved beneath the window opening and then stood up while pressing his back to the wall all the while he was realizing how stupid he had been to literally pose in the window he looked through the opening into the darkness where he believed he had seen the muzzle flash there was no one there several of the windows of the other rooms were open and it was impossible to pinpoint where the shot had come from bosch looked back into his room and saw the headboard of the bed splintered at the spot where the bullet had impacted by imagining a line from the impact point though the position he had held the bottle and then out the window he focused on an open but dark window on the fifth floor of the other wing he saw no movement there other than the curtain swaying gently with the breeze finally he put his gun in his waistband and left the room his clothes smelling of beer and with small slivers of glass embedded in his shirt and pricking his skin he knew he had at least two slight glass cuts one on his neck and one on his right hand which had been holding the bottle he held his cut hand to his neck wound as he walked he had judged that the open window belonged to the fourth room on the fifth floor he now had his gun out and pointed in front of him as he moved slowly down the fifthfloor hallway he was debating whether he should kick the door open but found the decision academic a cool breeze from the open window flowed out through the open door of room the room was dark and bosch knew he would be silhouetted by the lighted hallway so he hit the rooms entrancelight switch as he moved quickly through the doorway he covered the room with his smith and found it empty the smell of burned gunpowder hung in the air harry looked out the window and followed the imaginary line down to his own thirdfloor rooms window it had been an easy shot it was then that he heard the screeching of tires and saw the taillights of a large sedan pull out of the hotel parking lot and then speed away bosch put the gun in his waistband and pulled his shirt out over it he looked quickly around the room to see if the shooter had left anything behind him the glint of copper from the fold of the bedspread where it was tucked beneath the pillows caught his eye he pulled the bedspread out straight and lying there was a shell casing that had been ejected from a thirtytwo rifle he got an envelope out of the desk drawer and scooped the shell inside it as he left room and walked down the hallway no one looked out a door no house detectives came running and no approaching sirens blared in the distance no one had heard a thing except maybe a bottle breaking bosch knew that the thirtytwo fired at him had had a silencer screwed to the end of its barrel whoever it had been he had taken his time and waited for the one shot but he had missed had that been intentional he decided it wasnt to make a shot that close but intend to miss was too chancy he had simply been lucky his turn from the window at the last moment had probably saved his life bosch headed back to his room to dig the slug out of the wall bandage his wounds and check out along the way he started running when he realized he had to warn aguila back in his room he quickly dug through his wallet for the piece of paper on which aguila had written his address and phone number aguila picked up almost immediately bueno its bosch someone just took a shot at me yes where are you injured i am okay in my room they shot through the window im calling to warn you yes we were together today carlos i dont know if its just me or the both of us are you okay yes i am bosch realized he didnt know if aguila had a family or was alone in fact he realized he knew the mans ancestry but little else what will you do aguila asked i dont know im leaving here come here then okay yes no can you come here i wont be here but i want you to come and find out whatever you can about the person who rented room thats where the shot came from you can get the information easier than me i am leaving now well meet at your place i have something to do first a moon like the smile of the cheshire cat hung over the top of the ugly silhouette of the industrial park on val verde it was ten oclock bosch sat in his car in front of the mexitec furniture factory he was about two hundred yards from envirobreed and he was waiting for the last car to leave the bug plant it was a maroon lincoln that he suspected was elys on the seat next to him was a bag containing the items he had bought earlier the smell of the roasted pork was filling the car and he rolled down the window as he watched the envirobreed lot he was still breathing hard and the adrenaline continued to course through his arteries like amphetamine he was sweating though the evening air was quite cool he thought of moore and porter and the others not me he thought not me at he saw the door to envirobreed open and a man came out accompanied by the blur of two black figures ely dogs the dark shapes bobbed up and down at his waist as he walked ely then scattered something in the lot but the dogs stayed by his side he then slapped his hip and yelled chow and the dogs scattered and chased each other to varying points in the lot where they fought over whatever it was ely had thrown ely got in the lincoln after a few moments bosch saw the taillights flare and the car backed away from its space at the front of the lot bosch watched as the headlights traced a circle in the lot and then led the car to the gate the gate slowly rolled open and the car slipped through then the driver hesitated on the fringe of the roadway though it was clear to pull out he waited until the gate had trundled closed the dogs safely inside the fenced compound and then pulled away bosch slipped down in his seat even though the lincoln had headed the other way north toward the border bosch waited a few minutes and watched nothing moved anywhere no cars no people he didnt expect there to be any dea surveillance because they would pull back when planning a raid so as not to tip their hand he hoped they would at least he got out with the bag his flashlight and his lock picks then he leaned back into the car and pulled out the rubber floor mats which he rolled up and put under his arm boschs take on envirobreeds security measures from when he had been there during the day were that they were strictly aimed at deterring entry not sounding an alert once security had been bridged dogs and cameras a twelvefoot fence topped with electrified razor wire but inside the plant bosch had seen no tape on the windows in elys office no electric eyes not even an alarm key pad inside the front door this was because an alarm brought police the breeders wanted to keep people out of the bug plant but not if it drew the attention of authorities it didnt matter if those authorities could be easily corrupted and paid to look the other way it was just good business not to involve them so no alarms this of course did not mean an alert would not be sent somewhere elsesuch as the ranch across the streetif a breakin occurred but that was the risk bosch was taking bosch cut down the side of the mexitec factory to an alley that ran behind the buildings that fronted val verde he walked to the rear of envirobreed and waited for the dogs they came around quickly but silently they were sleek black dobermans and they moved right up to the fence one made a low guttural sound and the other followed suit bosch walked along the fence line looking up at the razor wire the dogs walked along with him saliva dripping from their lagging tongues bosch saw the pen they were caged in during the day in the back there was a wheelbarrow leaning up against the rear wall of the building and nothing else except the dogs bosch crouched to the ground in the alley and opened up the bag first he took out and opened the plastic bottle of sueño mas then he opened the wrapped paper bundle of roast pork he had bought at the chinese takeout near the hotel the meat was almost cold now he took a chunk about the size of a babys fist and pressed three of the extrastrength sleeping pills into it he squeezed it in his hand and then lofted it over the fence the dogs raced to it and one took a position over it but did not touch it bosch repeated the process and threw another piece over the other dog stood over it they sniffed at the pork and looked at bosch sniffed some more they looked around to see if their master might be nearby to help with a decision finding no help they looked at each other one dog finally picked his chunk up in its teeth and then dropped it they both looked at bosch and he yelled chow the dogs did nothing bosch yelled the command a few more times but nothing changed then he noticed they were watching his right hand he understood he slapped his hand on his hip and issued the command again the dogs ate the pork bosch quickly made two more drugladen snacks and threw them over the fence they were eaten quickly bosch started pacing alongside the fence in the alley the dogs stayed with him he went back and forth twice hoping the exercise would hurry their digestion harry ignored them for a while and looked up at the spiral of thin steel that ran along the top of the fence he studied the glint it gave off in the moonlight he also saw the electrical circuits spaced every twelve feet along the top and thought he heard a soft buzzing sound the wire would tear a climber up and fry him before he got one leg over but he was going to try he had to duck behind a dumpster in the alley when he saw lights and a car came slowly down the alley when it got closer he saw that it was a police car he froze with momentary fear of how he would explain himself he realized he had left the rolled car mats in the alley by the fence the car slowed even more as it went by the envirobreed fence the driver made a kissing sound at the dogs who still stood by the fence the car moved on and bosch came out of hiding the dobermans stood on their side of the fence watching him for nearly an hour before one dropped into a sitting position and the other quickly did the same the leader then worked its front paws forward until it was lying down the follower did likewise bosch watched as their heads almost in unison bowed and then dropped onto their outstretched front legs he saw urine forming in a puddle next to one of them both dogs kept their eyes open when he took the last chunk of pork out of the wrapper and tossed it over the fence he saw one of the dogs strain to raise his head and follow the arc of the falling food but then the head dropped back down neither dog went for the offering bosch laced his fingers in the fence in front of the dogs and shook it the steel making a whining sound but the animals paid little attention it was time bosch crumpled the greasestained paper and threw it in the dumpster he took a pair of work gloves out of the bag and put them on then he unfurled the front floor mat and held it by one end in his left hand he took a high grip on the fence with his right raised his right foot as high as he could and pointed his shoe into one of the diamondshaped openings in the fence he took a deep breath and in one move pulled himself up the fence using his left hand and arm to swing the rubber mat up and over the top so that it hung down over the spiral of razor wire like a saddle he repeated the maneuver with the rear mat they hung there side by side their weight pressing the spiral of razor wire down it took him less than a minute to get to the top and gingerly swing one leg over the saddle and then pull the other over the electric buzz was louder on top and he carefully moved his hand grips until he was able to drop down next to the still forms of the dogs he took the small penlight from his pick set and put it on the dogs their eyes were open and dilated their breathing heavy he stood a moment watching their bodies rise and fall on the same beat then he moved the light around on the ground until he found the uneaten piece of pork he threw it over the fence down the alley then gripping the dogs by the collars he dragged their bodies into their pen and latched the gate the dogs were no longer a threat bosch ran quietly up the side of the building and looked around the corner to make sure the parking lot was still empty then he came back down the side to the window of elys office he studied the window doublechecking to be sure he was correct about there being no alarm he ran the light along all four sides of the louvered window and saw no wires no vibration tape no sign of an alarm he opened the blade on his knife and pried back one of the metal strips that held the bottom pane of glass in place he carefully slid the pane out of the window and leaned it against the wall he moved the light through the opening and swung its beam around inside the room was empty he saw elys desk and other furnishings the panel of four video tubes was black the cameras were off after taking five glass sections out of the window and stacking them neatly against the outside wall there was enough room for him to hoist himself up and crawl into the office the top of the desk was clear of paperwork and other clutter the glass paperweight took the beam from the penlight and shot prism colors around the room bosch tried the drawers of the desk but found them locked he opened them with a hook pick but found nothing of interest there was a ledger in one drawer but it seemed to pertain to incoming breeding supplies he directed the light into the wastebasket on the floor inside the desk well and saw several crumpled pieces of paper he emptied the basket on the floor he reopened each piece of trash and then recrumpled it and dropped it back into the basket as he determined it was meaningless but not all of it was trash he found one piece of crumpled paper that had several scribbles on it including one that said colorado what to do with this he thought the paper was evidence of the effort to kill bosch but bosch had discovered it during an illegal search it was worthless unless found later during a legitimate search the question was when would that be if bosch left the crumpled paper in the trash can there was a good chance the can would be emptied and the evidence lost he crumpled the paper back up and then took a long piece of tape off the dispenser on the desk he attached one piece to the paper ball which he then put in the trash can pressing the other end of the tape down on the bottom of the can now he hoped if the can was emptied the crumpled paper would remain attached and inside the can and maybe the person who emptied the can wouldnt notice he moved out of the office into the hall by the lab door he took goggles and a breathing mask off the hook and put them on the door had a common threepin lock and he picked it quickly the doorway opened into blackness he waited a beat and then moved into it there was a cloying sickly sweet smell to the place it was humid he moved the flashlight beam around what looked like the shipping room he heard a fly buzzing in his ear and another insect was nattering around his masked face he waved them off and moved farther through the room at the other end of the room he passed through a set of double doors and into a room where the humidity was oppressive it was lit by red bulbs that were spaced above rows of fiberglass bug bins the warm air surrounded him he felt a squadron of flies bumping and buzzing around his mask and forehead again he waved them away he moved to one of the bins and put his light into it there was a brownishpink mass of insect larvae moving like a slowmotion sea under the light he then cast the light about the room and saw a rack containing several tools and a small stationary cement mixer that he guessed was what the day laborers used to mix the food paste for the bugs several shovels rakes and brooms hung on pegs in a row at the back of the room there were pallets containing large bags of pulverized wheat and sugar and smaller bags of yeast the markings on the bags were all in spanish he guessed this could be called the kitchen he played the light over the tools and noticed that one of the shovels stood out because it had a new handle the wood was clean and light while all of the other tools had handles that had darkened over time with dirt and human sweat looking at the new handle bosch knew that fernal gutierrezllosa had been killed here beaten so hard with a shovel that it broke or became so bloodstained it had to be replaced what had he seen that required his death what had the simple day laborer done bosch swung the light around again until it came upon another set of doors at the far side of the room on these a sign said danger radiation keep out peligro radiacion he used his picks once again to open the door he flashed the light around and saw no other doors this was the terminus of the building it was the largest of the three rooms in the complex and was divided in two by a partition with a small window in it a sign on the partition said in english only protection must be worn bosch stepped around the partition and saw that this space was largely taken up by a large boxlike machine attached was a conveyor belt that carried trays into one side of the machine and then out the other side where the trays would be dumped into bins like the ones he saw in the other room there were more warning signs on the machine this was where the larvae were sterilized by radiation he moved around to the other side of the room and saw large steel worktables with cabinets overhead these were not locked and inside he saw boxes of supplies plastic gloves and the sausagelike casings the larvae were shipped in batteries and heat sensors this was the room where the larvae were packed into casings and placed in the environment boxes the end of the line there was nothing else here that seemed significant bosch stepped backward toward the door he turned the flash off and there was only the small red glow from the surveillance camera mounted in the corner near the ceiling what have i missed he asked himself what is left he put the light back on and walked back around the partition to the radiation machine all of the signs in the building were designed to keep people away from this spot this would be where the secret was he focused on the floortoceiling stacks of the wide steel trays used for moving larvae he put his shoulder against one of the stacks and began to slide it on the floor beneath was only concrete he tried the next stack and looked down and saw the edge of a trapdoor the tunnel but at that moment it hit him the red light on the surveillance camera the video panel in elys office had been off and earlier when bosch had visited he had noticed that the only interior view ely had on video was of the shipping room it meant someone else was watching this room he looked at his watch trying to estimate how long he had been in the room two minutes three minutes if they were coming from the ranch he had little time he looked down at the outline of the door in the floor and then up at the red eye in the darkness but he couldnt take the chance that no one was watching he quickly pushed the stack back over the door in the floor and moved out of the third room he retraced his path through the complex hooking the mask and goggles on the peg by elys office then he went through the office and out the window he quickly put the glass panes back in place bending the metal strips back with his fingers the dogs were still lying in the same spot their bodies pumping with each breath bosch hesitated but then decided to drag them out in case the monitor at the end of the cameras cable line was not being watched and he hadnt been seen he grabbed them by the collars and dragged them out of the pen he heard one try to growl but it sounded more like a whine the other did likewise he hit the fence on the run climbed it quickly but then forced himself to go slow over the floor mats when he was at the top he thought he heard the sound of an engine above the sound of the electric buzz as he was about to drop over he jerked the mats up off the razor wire and dropped down with them into the alley he checked his pockets to make sure he had not dropped the picks or flashlight or his keys his gun was still in its holster he had everything there was the sound of a vehicle now maybe more than one he definitely had been seen as he ran down the alley toward mexitec he heard someone shouting pedro y pablo pedro y pablo the dogs he realized peter and paul were the dogs he crawled into his car and sat crouched in the front seat watching envirobreed there were two cars in the front lot and three men that he could see they were holding guns and standing beneath the spotlight over the front door then a fourth man came around the corner speaking in spanish he had found the dogs something about the man looked familiar but it was too dark and bosch was too far away to be able to see any tattoo tears they opened the door and like cops with their guns up they went inside the building that was boschs cue he started the caprice and pulled out onto the road as he sped away he realized he was once again shaking with the release of tension the high of a good scare sweat was running down out of his hair and drying in the cool night air on his neck he lit a cigarette and threw the match out of the window he laughed nervously into the wind on sunday morning bosch called the number ramos had given him from a pay phone at a restaurant called casa de mandarin in downtown mexicali he gave his name and number hung up and lit a cigarette two minutes later the phone rang and it was ramos qué pasa amigo nothing i want to look at the mugs you got remember right right tell you what ill pick you up on my way in give me a half hour i checked out leaving are you no i just checked out i usually do that when somebody tries to kill me what somebody with a rifle ramos ill tell you about it anyway im in the wind at the moment you want to pick me up im at the mandarin in downtown half an hour i want to hear about this they hung up and bosch went back to his table where aguila was still finishing breakfast they had both ordered scrambled eggs with salsa and chopped cilantro fried dumplings on the side the food was very good and bosch had eaten quickly he always did after a sleepless night the night before after he drove laughing from envirobreed they had met at aguilas small house near the airport and the mexican detective reported on his findings at the hotel the desk clerk could offer little description of the man who rented other than to say he had three tears tattooed on his cheek below the left eye aguila had not asked where bosch had been seeming to know that an answer would not be given instead he offered harry the couch in his sparsely furnished house harry accepted but didnt sleep he just spent the night watching the window and thinking about things until bluish gray light pushed through the thin white curtains much of the time lucius porter had been in his thoughts he envisioned the detectives body on the cold steel table naked and waxy teresa corazón opening him up with the shears he thought of the pinpricksized blood hemorrhages she would find in the corneas of his eyes the confirmation of strangulation and he thought of the times he had been in the suite with porter watching others be cut up and the gutters on the table filling with their debris now it was lucius on the table a piece of wood under his neck propping his head back into position for the bone saw just before dawn harrys thoughts became confused with fatigue and in his mind he suddenly saw it was himself on the steel table teresa nearby readying her equipment for the cut he had sat up then and reached for his cigarettes and he made a vow to himself that it would never be himself on that table not that way drug enforcement aguila asked as he pushed his plate away huh aguila nodded to the pager on his belt he had just noticed it yeah they wanted me to wear it bosch believed he had to trust this man and that he had earned that trust he didnt care what ramos had said or corvo all his life bosch had lived and worked in societys institutions but he hoped he had escaped institutional thinking that he made his own decisions he would tell aguila what was happening when the time was right im going over there this morning look at some mugs and stuff lets get together later aguila agreed and said he would go to the justice plaza to complete paperwork on the confirmation of fernal gutierrezllosas death bosch wanted to tell him about the shovel with the new handle he had seen in envirobreed but thought better of it he planned to tell only one person about the breakin bosch drank coffee and aguila drank tea for a while without speaking bosch finally asked have you ever seen zorrillo in person at a distance yes where was that the bullfights yes at the plaza de los toros el papa often attends to see his bulls but he has a box in the shade reserved each week for him i have afforded only seats on the sun side of the arena this is the reason for the distance from which i have viewed him he pulls for the bulls huh excuse me he goes to see his bulls win not the fighters no he goes to see that his bulls die honorably bosch wasnt sure what that meant but let it go i want to go today can we get in i want to sit in a box near the popes i dont know these are expensive sometimes they cannot sell them even so they keep them locked how much you would need at least two hundred dollars american im afraid it is very expensive bosch took out his wallet and counted out he left a ten on the table for the breakfast and pushed the rest across the faded green tablecloth to aguila it occurred to him it was more money than aguila made in a sixday week on the job he wished he had not been so quick to make a decision that would have taken aguila hours of careful consideration get us a box near the pope you must understand there will be many men with him he will be i just want a look at him is all just get us the box they left the restaurant then and aguila said he would walk to the justice plaza a couple blocks away after he left harry stood in front of the restaurant waiting for ramos he looked at his watch and saw it was eight oclock he was supposed to be in irvings office at parker center he wondered if the assistant chief had initiated disciplinary action against him yet bosch would probably be put on a desk as soon as he got back into town unless unless he brought back the whole package in his back pocket that was the only way he would have any leverage with irving he knew he had to come out of mexico with everything tied together it dawned on him that it was stupid to be standing like a target on the sidewalk in front of the restaurant he stepped back inside and watched for ramos through the front door the waitress approached him and bowed effusively several times and walked away it mustve been the threedollar tip he thought it took ramos nearly an hour to get there bosch decided he didnt want to be without a car so he told the agent he would follow him they drove north on lopez mateos at the circle around the statue of juarez they went east into a neighborhood of unmarked warehouses they went down an alley and parked behind a building that had been tagged dozens of times with graffiti ramos looked furtively around after he got out of the beatup chevy camaro with mexican plates he was driving welcome to our humble federal office he said inside it was sunday morning quiet no one else was there ramos put on the overhead lights and bosch saw several rows of desks and file cabinets toward the back were two weapons storage lockers and a twoton cincinnati safe for storing evidence okay let me see what we got while you tell me about last night you are sure somebody tried to do you right only way to be surer was if i got hit the bandaid bosch had used on his neck was covered by his collar there was another on his right palm which also was not very noticeable bosch told ramos about the hotel shooting leaving out no detail including that he had recovered a shell from room what about the slug recoverable i assume its still in the headboard i didnt hang around long enough to check no i bet you went running to warn your pal the mexican bosch i am telling you to wise up he may be a good guy but you dont know him he mighta been the one that set the whole thing up actually ramos i did warn him but then i left and did what you wanted me to do whatre you talking about envirobreed i went in last night what are you crazy bosch i didnt tell you to cmon man dont fuck with me you told me all that shit last night so i would know what was needed to get the search okayed dont bullshit me were alone here i know thats what you wanted and i got it put me down as a ci ramos was pacing in front of the file cabinets he was making a good show of it look bosch i have to clear any confidential informant i use with my supe so thats not going to fly i cant make it fly bosch i do you want to know what i found there or should we just drop it that quieted the dea agent for a few moments do you have your ninjas thewhat did you call them the clits in town yet clets bosch and yeah they came in last night good youre going to have to get going i was seen bosch watched the agents face grow dark he shook his head and dropped down into a chair fuck how do you know there was a camera i didnt see it until it was too late i got out of there but some people came looking i wasnt identifiable i was wearing a mask but still they know somebody was inside okay bosch you arent leaving me many options what did you see there it was ramos was acknowledging the illegal search he was sanctioning it bosch would not have it come back on him now he told the agent about the trapdoor hidden beneath the stack of bug trays in the radiation room you didnt open it didnt have time but i wouldnt have done it anyway i worked tunnels in vietnam every trapdoor was just that a trap the people that came after i got out of there came by car not through the tunnel that tells you right there that there might be a rig in the tunnel he then told ramos that his application for a search warrant or approval or whatever they called them in mexico should include requests to seize all tools and debris from trash cans why because the stuff you will find will help me make one of the murder cases i came down here for there is also evidence of a conspiracy to murder a law enforcement officerme ramos nodded and didnt ask for further explanation he wasnt interested he got up and went to a file cabinet and pulled out two large black binders bosch sat down at an empty desk and ramos put the binders down in front of him these are kosknown operativesassociated with humberto zorrillo we have some bio info on some of them others its just surveillance stuff we might not even have a name bosch opened the first binder and looked at the picture on top it was a fuzzy eightbyten blowup of a surveillance shot ramos said it was zorrillo and bosch had guessed as much dark hair beard intense stare through dark eyes bosch had seen the face before younger no beard a smile instead of the long empty gaze it was the grownup face of the boy who had been in the pictures with calexico moore what do you know about him bosch asked ramos you know anything about his family none that we know of not that we looked real hard we dont give a shit where he came from just what hes doing now and where hes going bosch turned the plastic page and began looking at the mugs and surveillance shots ramos went back to his desk rolled a piece of paper into a typewriter and began typing im working up a ci statement here ill get it by somehow about twothirds through the first book bosch found the man with three tears there were several photos of himmugs and surveillancefrom all angles and over several years bosch saw his face change as the tears were added from a smiling wiseass to a hardened con the brief biographical data said his name was osvaldo arpis rafaelillo and that he was born in they said his three stays in thepenitenciaro were for murder as a juvenile murder as an adult and drug possession he had spent half his life in prisons the data described him as a lifelong associate of zorrillos here i got him bosch said ramos came over he recognized the man also youre saying he was up in la whacking out cops yeah at least one i think he might have done the job on the first one too i think he also took down a courier for the competition a hawaiian named jimmy kapps he and one of the cops were strangled the same way mexican necktie right right and the laborer the one you think got it at the bug house he couldve done them all i dont know this guy goes way back arpis yeah he just got out of thepenta a year or so ago hes a stonecold killer bosch one of the popes main men an enforcer in fact people round here call him alvin karpis you know after that killer with the machine gun in the thirties the ma barker gang arpis was put away for a couple hits but they say that doesnt do him service hes really down for more than you can count bosch stared at the photos and said thats all you got on him this stuff here theres more around someplace but thats all you have to know most of it is just he saidshe said informant stuff the main story about al karpis is that when zorrillo first made his move to the top this guy was a oneman front line doing the heavy stuff every time zorrillo had a piece of work to do hed turn to his buddy arpis from the barrio hed get the job done and like i said they only bagged him a couple times he probably paid his way out of the rest bosch began writing some of the information from the bio in a notebook ramos kept talking those two they came from a barrio south of here some saints and sinners yeah saints and sinners some of the local cops the ones i trust about as far as i can throw em said arpis had a real taste for killing in the barrio they had a sayingquien eres means who are you it was a challenge it means what side are you on you know are you with us or against us saint or sinner and when zorrillo rose to power he had arpis taking out the people that were against them the locals said that after they whacked somebody theyd spread the word around the barrioel descubrio quien era means he found out who he was right it was good pr made the natives fall in behind him supposedly they really got into it got to the point they were leaving messages with the body you know theyd kill a guy and write out he found out who he was or whatever and leave it pinned to his shirt bosch said nothing and wrote nothing another piece of the puzzle dropped into place sometimes you still see it on graffiti around the barrio ramos said its part of the folklore surrounding zorrillo its part of what makes him the pope harry finally closed his notebook and stood up i got what i need all right be careful out there bosch nothing that says they wont try again especially if arpis is on the job you just want to hang out here today its safe nah ill be okay he nodded and took a step toward the door he touched the pager on his belt i will get a call yeah youre in corvos coming down for the show so i gotta make sure youre there where you gonna be later today i dont know i think im going to make like a tourist go to the historical society take in a bullfight just be cool youll get a call i better he walked out to the caprice thinking only about the note that had been found in cal moores back pocket i found out who i was it took bosch thirty minutes to get across the border the line of cars extended nearly half a mile back from the drab brown border patrol port of entry while waiting and measuring his progress in one or two carlength movements he ran out of change and onedollar bills as an army of peasants came to his window holding up their palms or selling cheap bricabrac and food many of them washed the windshield unbidden with their dirty rags and held up their hands for coins each progressive washing smeared the glass more until bosch had to put on the wipers and use the cars own spray when he finally made it to the checkpoint the bp inspector in mirrored shades just waved him through after seeing his badge he said hose up there on the right if you want to wash the shit off your windshield a few minutes later he pulled into one of the parking spaces in front of the calexico town hall bosch parked and looked out across the park while smoking a cigarette there were no troubadours today the park was almost empty he got out and headed toward the door marked calexico historical society not sure what he was looking for he had the afternoon to spend and all he knew was that he believed there was a deeper line running through cal moores deathfrom his decision to cross to the note in his back pocket to the photo of him with zorrillo so many years ago bosch wanted to find out what happened to the house he had called a castle and the man he had posed with the one with the hair white as a sheet the glass door was locked and bosch saw that the society didnt open until one on sundays he looked at his watch and saw he still had fifteen minutes to wait he cupped his hands to the glass and looked in and saw no one inside the tiny space that included two desks a wall of books and a couple of glass display cases he stepped away from the door and thought about using the time to get something to eat he decided it was too early instead he walked down to the police station and got a coke from the machine in the minilobby he nodded at the officer behind the glass window it wasnt gruber today while he stood leaning against the front wall drinking the soda and watching the park harry saw an old man with a latticework of thin white hair on the sides of his head unlock the door to the historical society he was a few minutes early but bosch headed down the walk and followed him in open he said might as well be the old man said im here anything in particular i can help you with bosch walked into the center of the room and explained he was unsure what he wanted im sort of tracing the background of a friend and i believe his father was a historical figure in calexico i mean i want to find their house if its still standing find out what i can about the old man whats this fellows name i dont know actually i just know his last name was moore hell boy that name dont much narrow it down moores one of the big names around here big family brothers cousins all over the place tell you what let me you have pictures you know books with photos of the moores ive seen pictures of the father i could pick yeah thats what im saying let me set you up here with a couple things well find your moore im kinda curious now myself whatre you doing this for your friend for anyway trying to trace the family tree put it all together for him a few minutes later the old man had him sitting at the other desk with three books in front of him they were leatherbound and smelled of dust they were the size of yearbooks and they wove photographic and written history together on every page randomly opening one of the books he looked at a blackandwhite photo of the de anza hotel under construction then he started them in order the first was calledcalexico and mexicali seventyfive years on the border and as he scanned the words and photos on the pages bosch picked up a brief history of the two towns and the men who built them the story was the same one aguila had told him but from the white mans perspective the volume he read described the horrible poverty in tapai china and told how the men facing it gladly came to baja california to seek their fortunes it didnt say anything about cheap labor in the s and s calexico was a boomtown a company town with the colorado river land companys managers the lords of all they surveyed the book said many of these men built opulent homes and estates on bluffs rising on the outskirts of town as bosch read he repeatedly saw the names of three moore brothers anderson cecil and morgan there were other moores listed as well but the brothers were always described in terms of importance and had highlevel titles in the company while leafing through a chapter called a dirt road town paves its streets in gold bosch saw the man he was interested in he was cecil moore there amidst the description of the riches the cotton brought to calexico was a photograph of a man with prematurely white hair standing in front of a mediterraneanstyle home the size of a school it was the man in the photo moore had kept in the crumpled white bag and rising like a steeple on the lefthand side of the home was a tower with two arched windows side by side at its uppermost point the tower gave the house the appearance of a spanish castle it was cal moores childhood home this is the man and this is the place bosch said taking the book over to the old man cecil moore the man said is he still around no none of those brothers are he was the last to go though last year about this time went in his sleep cecil did i think youre mistaken though whys that cecil had no children bosch nodded maybe youre right what about this place that gone too youre not working on any family tree are you now no im a cop i came from la im tracing down a story somebody told me about this man will you help me the old man looked at him and bosch regretted not being truthful with him in the first place i dont know what its got to do with los angeles but go ahead what else you want to know is this place with the tower still there yes castillo de los ojos is still there castle of the eyes gets its name from those two windows up in the tower when they were lit at night it was said that they were eyes that looked out on all of calexico where is it its on a road called coyote trail west of town you take out there past pinto wash to an area called crucifixion thorn turn onto anza roadlike the hotel here in town thatll take you to coyote trail the castles at the end of the road you cant miss it who lives there now i dont think anyone does he left it to the city you know but the city couldnt handle the upkeep on a place like that they sold iti believe the man came down from los angeles matter of fact but as far as i know he never moved in its a pity i was hoping to have maybe made a museum out of it bosch thanked him and left to head out to crucifixion thorn he had no idea whether castillo de los ojos was anything more than a dead rich mans estate with no bearing on his case but he had nothing else going and his impulse was to keep moving forward state road was a twolane blacktop that stretched west from calexicotown proper running alongside the border into farmland delineated into a huge grid by irrigation ditches as he drove he smelled green pepper and cilantro and he realized after running alongside a field planted in cotton that this wide expanse was all once the companys huge acreage ahead the land rose into hills and he could see calexico moores boyhood home long before he was near castillo de los ojos the two arched windows were dark and hollow eyes against the peachcolored stone face of the tower rising from a promontory on the horizon bosch crossed a bridge over a dry bed that he assumed was pinto wash though there was no sign on the road glancing down into the dusty bed as he passed harry saw a limegreen chevy blazer parked below he caught just a glimpse of a man behind the wheel with binoculars held to his eyes border patrol the driver was using the beds low spot as a blind from which he could watch the border for crossers the wash marked the end of the farmland almost immediately the earth began to rise into brownbrush hills there was a turnout in the road by a stand of eucalyptus and oak trees that were still in the windless morning this time there was a sign marking the location crucifixion thorn natural area danger abandoned mines bosch remembered seeing a reference in the books at the historical society to the turnofthecentury gold mines that pockmarked the border zone fortunes had been found and lost by speculators the hills had been heavy with bandits then the company came and brought order he lit a cigarette and studied the tower which was much closer now and rose from behind a walled compound the stillness of the scene and the tower windows like soulless eyes somehow seemed morbid the tower was not alone on the hill though he could see the barreltile roofs of other homes but something about the tower rising singularly above them with its empty glass eyes seemed lonely dead anza road came up in another half mile he turned north and the singlelane road curved and bumped and rose along the circumference of the hill to his right he could look down on the farmland basin extending below he turned left onto a road marked coyote trail and was soon passing large haciendas on sprawlng estates he could see only the second floors of most of them because of the walls that surrounded almost every property coyote trail ended in a circle that went around an ancient oak tree with branches that would shade the turnaround in the summer castillo de los ojos was here at the end of the road from the street an eightfoothigh stone wall eclipsed all but the tower only through a black wroughtiron gate was there a fuller view bosch pulled onto the driveway and up to the gate heavy steel chain and lock kept it closed he got out looked through the bars and saw that the parking circle in front of the house was empty the curtains inside every front window were pulled closed on the wall next to the gate were a mailbox and an intercom he pushed the ringer but got no response he wasnt sure what he would have said if someone had answered he opened the mailbox and found that empty too bosch left his car where it was and walked back down coyote trail to the nearest house this was one of the few without a wall but there was a white picket fence and an intercom at the gate and this time when he rang the buzzer he got a response yes a womans voice asked yes maam police i was wondering if i can ask a few questions about your neighbors house which neighbor the voice was very old the castle nobody lives there mr moore died some time ago i know that maam i was wondering if i could come in and talk to you a moment i have identification there was a delay before he heard a curt very well over the speaker and the gate lock buzzed the woman insisted that he hold his id up to a small window set in the door he saw her in there whitehaired and decrepit straining to see it from a wheelchair she finally opened up why do they send a los angeles police officer maam im working on a los angeles case it involves a man who used to live in the castle as a boy long ago she looked up at him through squinting eyes as if she was trying to see past a memory are you talking about calexico moore yes you knew him is he hurt bosch hesitated then said im afraid hes dead up there in los angeles yes he was a police officer i think it had something to do with his life down here thats why i came out here i dont really know what to ask he didnt live here long but you remember him yes he didnt live here long but that doesnt mean i never saw him again quite the contrary i saw him regularly over the years hed ride his bicycle or hed drive a car and come and sit out there on the road and just watch that place one time i had marta bring him out a sandwich and a lemonade he assumed marta was the maid these estates came with them hed just watch and remember i guess the old woman was saying terrible thing that cecil did to him hes probably paying for it now that cecil what do you mean terrible sending the boy and his mother away like that i dont think he ever spoke to that boy or the woman again after that but id see the boy and id see him as a man come out here to look at the place people round here say thats why cecil put that wall up did that twenty years ago they say its because he got tired of seeing calexico in the street that was cecils way of doing things you dont like what you see out your window you put up a wall but id still see young cal from time to time one time i took a cold drink out to him myself i wasnt in this chair then he was sitting in a car and i asked him why do you come out here all the time and he just said aunt mary i like to remember thats what he said aunt mary yes i thought that was why you came here my anderson and cecil were brothers god rest their souls bosch nodded and waited a respectful five seconds before speaking the man at the museum in town said cecil had no children course he said that cecil kept it a secret from the public big secret he didnt want the company name blemished calexicos mother was the maid yes sheit sounds like you know all of this already just a few parts what happened why did he send her and the boy away she hesitated before answering as if to compose a story that was more than thirty years old after she became pregnant she lived therehe made herand she had the baby there afterward four or five years he discovered she had lied to him one day he had some of his men follow her across when she went to mexicali to visit her mother there was no mother just a husband and another son this one older than calexico that was when he sent them away his own blood he sent away bosch thought about this for a long moment the woman was staring off at the past when was the last time you saw calexico oh let me see must have been years now he eventually stopped coming around do you think he knew of his fathers death he wasnt at the funeral not that i blame him i was told cecil moore left the property to the city yes he died alone and he left everything to the city not a thing to calexico or any of the exwives and mistresses cecil moore was a mean man even in death of course the city couldnt do anything with that place too big and expensive to keep up calexico isnt a boomtown like it once was and cant keep a place like that there was a thought that it would be used as a historical museum but you couldnt fill a closet with the history of this town never mind the museum the city sold the place i heard for more than a million maybe theyll operate in the black for a few years who bought it i dont know but they never moved in they got a caretaker comes around i saw lights on over there last week but nope nobodys ever moved in as far as i know it must be an investment in what i dont know were sitting out here in the middle of nowhere one last question was there ever anybody else with moore when he would watch the place always alone that poor boy was always out there alone on the way back into town bosch thought about moores lonely vigils outside the house of his father he wondered if his longings were for the house and its memories or the father who had sent him away or both boschs mind touched his memory of his brief meeting with his own father a sick old man on his death bed bosch had forgiven him for every second he had been robbed he knew he had to or he would face the rest of his life wasting his pain on it the line of traffic to go back into mexico was longer and slower than the day before bosch figured this was because of the bullfight which drew people from the entire region it was a sunday evening tradition as popular here as raiders football was in la bosch was two cars from the mexican border officer when he realized he still had the smith in its holster on his back it was too late to do anything about it when he got to the man he simply said bullfight and was waved on through the sky was clear over mexicali and the air cool it looked like it would be perfect weather harry felt the tingle of anticipation in his throat it was for two things seeing the ritual of the fight and maybe seeing zorrillo the man whose name and lore had surrounded his last three days so thoroughly that bosch found himself buying into his myth he just wanted to see the pope in his own element with his bulls with his people bosch took a pair of surveillance binoculars out of the glove compartment after parking at the justice plaza the arena was only three blocks away and he figured theyd walk after showing id to the frontdesk officer and being approved to go back he found aguila sitting behind the lone desk in the investigators squadroom he had several handwritten reports in front of him did you get the tickets yes i have them we have a box on the sun side this will not be a problem because the boxes get little sun is it close to the pope almost directly acrossif he is there today yeah if well see you done yes i have completed the reports on the fernal gutierrezllosa investigation until a suspect is charged which will probably never happen down here this is correct i believe we should go now bosch held up the binoculars im ready you will be so close you will not need those these arent for looking at bulls as they walked toward the arena they moved into a steady stream of people heading the same way many of them carried little square pillows on which they would sit in the arena they passed several young children holding armfuls of pillows and selling them for a dollar each after entering the gate bosch and aguila descended a set of concrete stairs to an underground level where aguila presented their box tickets to an usher they were then led through a catacomblike passageway that curved as it followed the circumference of the ring there were small wooden doors marked with numbers on their left the usher opened a door with the number seven on it and they went into a room no larger than a jail cell its floor walls and ceiling were all unpainted concrete the vaulted ceiling sloped downward from the back to a sixfootwide opening that looked out into the ring they were directly on the outer ring where matadors toreros and other players in the fights stood and waited bosch could smell the dirt ring its horse and bull odors its blood there were six steel chairs folded and leaning against the rear wall they opened two and sat down after aguila thanked the usher and closed and locked the door this is like a pillbox bosch said as he looked through the window slot into the boxes across the ring he did not see zorrillo what is a pillbox never mind bosch said realizing he had never been in one either its like a jail cell perhaps aguila said bosch realized he had insulted him these were the best seats in the house carlos this is great well see everything from here it was also loud in the concrete box and in addition to the smells from the ring there was the pervasive odor of spilled beer the little room seemed to reverberate with a thousand steps as the stadium above them filled a band played from seats high up in the stadium bosch looked out into the ring and saw the toreros being introduced he felt the growing excitement of the crowd and the echo in the room grew louder with the cheers as the matadors bowed i can smoke in here right bosch asked yes aguila said as he stoodcervesa i like that tecate if they have it of course lock the door i will knock aguila nodded and left the room harry locked the door and wondered if he was doing it to protect himself or simply to keep uninvited observers out of the box he realized once he was alone that he did not feel protected in the fortresslike surroundings it was not like a pillbox after all he held the binoculars up and viewed the openings into the other boxes across the ring most of these were still empty and he did not see anyone among those already in place who he believed was zorrillo but he noticed that many of these boxes were customized he could see shelves of liquor bottles or tapestries on the back walls padded chairs these were the shaded boxes of the regulars soon aguila knocked and bosch let him in with the beers and the spectacle began the first two fights were uneventful and uninspired aguila called them sloppy the matadors were heartily booed by those in the arena when their final sword thrusts into each bulls neck failed to kill and each fight became a prolonged bloody display that had little resemblance to art or a test of bravery in the third fight the arena came alive and the noise thundered in the box where bosch and aguila sat when a bull black as pitchexcept for the whitish z branded on its backcharged violently into the side of one of the picadors horses the tremendous power of the beast pushed the horses padded skirt up to the riders thigh the horseman drove his ironpointed lance down into the bulls back and leaned his weight on it but this seemed only to enrage the beast further the animal found new strength and made another violent lunge into the horse the confrontation was only thirty feet from bosch but still he lifted the binoculars for a closer look in what was like a slowmotion tableau captured in the scope of the binoculars frame he saw the horse rear against its masters rein and the picador topple off into the dust the bull continued its charge its horns impaling the padded skirt and the horse went over on top of the picador the crowd became even louder cheering wildly as the banderilleros flooded the ring waving capes and drawing the bulls attention from the fallen horse and rider others helped the picador to his feet and he limped to the ring gate he then shrugged their hands away refusing any further help his face was slick with sweat and red with embarrassment and the cheers of the arena had a jeering quality with the binoculars bosch felt as though he was standing next to the man a pillow came down from the stands and glanced off the mans shoulder he did not look up for to do that would be to invite more the bull had won this crowd and in a few minutes they respectfully cheered its death a matadors sword deeply embedded in its neck the animals front legs buckled and its huge weight collapsed a torero a man who was older than all the other players quickly moved in with a short dagger and stabbed it into the base of the bulls skull instant death after the prolonged torment bosch watched the man wipe the blade on the dead animals black coat and then walk away replacing the dagger in a sheath strapped to his vest three mules in harness were brought into the ring a rope was looped around the black bulls horns and the body was dragged around in a circle and then out bosch saw a red rose fall from above and hit the dead beast as it made a flattened path in the rings dirt floor harry studied the man with the dagger applying the coup de grâce seemed to be his only role in each fight bosch couldnt decide if his job was administering mercy or more cruelty the man was older his black hair was streaked with gray and his face had a worn impassive look he had soulless eyes in a face of worn brown stone bosch thought of the man with three tear drops on his face arpis what look did he have when he choked the life out of porter when he held the shotgun up to moores face and pulled the trigger the bull was very brave and beautiful aguila said he had said little through the first three fights other than to pronounce the skills of the matadors as expert or sloppy good or bad i guess zorrillo would have been very proud bosch said if he had been here it was true zorrillo had not come bosch had found himself checking the empty box aguila had pointed out but it had remained empty now with one fight to go it seemed unlikely that the man who bred the bulls for this days fights would arrive do you wish to leave harry no i want to watch good then this match will be the finest and most artful silvestri is mexicalis greatest matador anothercervesa yeah ill get this one what do you no it is my duty a small means of repaying whatever bosch said lock the door he did then he looked at his ticket on which the names of the bullfighters were printed cristobal silvestri aguila had said he was the most artful and bravest fighter he had ever seen a cheer went up from the crowd as the bull another huge black monster charged into the ring to confront his killers the toreros began moving about him with green and blue capes opening like flowers bosch was struck by the ritual and pageantry of the bullfights even the sloppy ones it was not a sport he was sure of this but it was something a test a test of skills and yes bravery resolve he believed that if he had the opportunity he would want to go often to this arena to be a witness there was a knock on the door and bosch got up to let aguila in but when he opened the door there were two men waiting one he did not recognize the other he did but it took him a few moments to place him it was grena the captain of investigations from what little he could see past their two figures there was no sign of aguila señor bosch may we come in bosch stepped back but only grena entered the other man turned his back as if to guard the doorway grena closed and locked it so we wont be disturbed yes he said as he scanned the room he did this at length as if it were the size of a basketball court and needed careful study in determining there was no one else present it is my custom to come for the last fight señor bosch particularly you see when silvestri is in the ring a great champion i hope you will enjoy this bosch nodded and casually looked out into the ring the bull was still lively and moving about the ring while the toreros sidestepped and waited for it to slow carlos aguila he has gone cervesa but you probably already know that captain so why dont you tell me whats up what is up how do you mean i mean what do you want captain what are you doing here ahsi you want to watch our little pageant and do not wish to be bothered by business get to the point is the way it is said i believe yeah that works there was a cheer and both men looked out into the ring silvestri had entered and was stalking the bull he wore a whiteandgold suit of lights and he walked in a regal manner his back straight and his head canted downward as he sternly studied his adversary the bull was still game as it charged about the ring whipping the blue and yellow banderillas stuck in its neck from side to side bosch pulled his attention back to grena the police captain was wearing a black jacket of soft leather its right cuff barely covering his rolex my point is i want to know what you are doing señor bosch you dont come down here for bullfights so why are you here i am told identification of señor gutierrezllosa has been made why do you stay why do you bother carlos aguila with your time bosch was not going to tell this man anything but he did not want to endanger aguila bosch would be leaving eventually but not aguila i am leaving in the morning my work is completed then you should leave tonight eh an early start maybe grena nodded you see i have had an inquiry from a lieutenant pounds of the lapd he is very anxious at your return he asked me to tell you this personally why is that bosch looked at him and shook his head i dont know you would have to ask him there was a long silence during which grenas attention was drawn to the ring again bosch looked that way too just in time to see silvestri leading the charging bull past him with his cape grena looked at him for a long time and then smiled probably the way ted bundy had smiled at the girls on campus you know the art of the cape bosch didnt answer and the two just stared at each other a thin smile continued to play across the captains dark face el arte de la muleta grena finally said it is deception it is the art of survival the matador uses the cape to fool death to make death go where he is not but he must be brave he must risk himself over the horns of death the closer death comes the braver he becomes never for a moment can he show fear never show fear to do so is to lose it is to die this is the art my friend he nodded and bosch just stared at him grena smiled broadly now and turned to the door he opened it and the other man was still there as he turned to reclose the door he looked at bosch and said have a good trip detective harry bosch tonight eh bosch said nothing and the door was closed he sat there for a moment but his attention was drawn by the cheers to the ring silvestri had dropped to one knee in the center of the ring and had lured the bull to a charge he remained stoically fixed in position until the beast was on him he then moved the cape away from his body in a smooth flow the bull rushed by within inches and silvestri was untouched it was beautiful and the cheers rose from the stadium the unlocked door to the box opened and aguila stepped in grena what did he want bosch didnt answer he held the binoculars up and checked zorrillos box the pope wasnt there but now grena was staring back at him with the same thin smile on his lips silvestri felled the bull with a single thrust of his sword the blade diving deep between its shoulders and slicing through the heart instant death bosch looked over at the man with the dagger and thought he saw a trace of disappointment on his hardened face his work wasnt needed the cheering for silvestris expert kill was deafening and it did not let up as the matador made a circuit around the ring his arms up to receive the applause roses pillows womens highheeled shoes showered down into the ring the bullfighter beamed in the adulation the noise was so loud that it was quite some time before bosch realized that the pager on his belt was sounding its call to him at nine oclock bosch and aguila turned off avenida cristobal colon onto a perimeter road that skirted rodolfo sanchez taboada aeropuerto internacional the roadway passed several old quonsethut hangars and then a larger grouping of newer structures on one of these was a sign that said aero carga the huge bay doors had been spread a few feet and the opening was lit from the inside it was their destination a dea front bosch pulled into the lot in front and parked near several other cars he noticed that most of them had california plates as soon as he stepped out of the caprice he was approached by four dea types in blue plastic windbreakers he showed his id and evidently passed muster after one of them consulted a clipboard and you the clipboard man said to aguila hes with me bosch said we have you down as a solo entry detective bosch now we have a problem i guess i forgot to rsvp that id bring a date bosch said its not very funny detective bosch of course not but hes my partner he stays with me clipboard had a distressed look on his face he was an anglo with a ruddy complexion and hair that had been bleached almost white by the sun he looked as though he had been watching the border a long time he turned to look back at the hangar as if hoping for direction on how to handle this on the back of his windbreaker bosch saw the large yellowdea letters better get ramos bosch said if my partner goes i go then wheres the integrity of the operations security he looked over at aguila who was standing stiffly with the three other agents around him like bouncers ready to toss somebody out of a nightclub on the sunset strip think about it bosch continued anybody whos come this far has to go the distance otherwise you got someone outside the circle out there and unaccounted for go ask ramos clipboard hesitated again then told everybody to stay cool and took a radio from the pocket of his jacket he radioed to someone called staff leader that there was a problem in the lot then everybody stood around for a few moments in silence bosch looked over at aguila and when their eyes met he winked then he saw ramos and corvo the agent from la walking briskly toward them whats this shit bosch ramos started before he got to the car do you know what youve done youve compromised the whole fucking operation i gave explicit instru hes my partner on this ramos he knows what i know we are together on this if hes out then so am i and when we leave i go across the border to la i dont know where he goes how will that hold with your theory on who can be trusted in the light from the hangar bosch could see the pulse beating in an artery on ramoss neck see bosch said if you let him leave you are trusting him so if you trust him you might as well let him stay fuck you bosch corvo put his hand on ramoss arm and stepped forward bosch if he fucks up or this operation in any way becomes compromised i will make it known you know what i mean itll be known in la that you brought this guy in he made a signal across the car to the others and they stepped away from aguila the moonlight reflected on corvos face and bosch saw the scar that split his beard on the right side he wondered how many times the dea agent would be telling the story of the knife fight tonight and another thing ramos threw in he goes in naked we only have one more vest thats for your ass bosch so if he gets hit its on you right bosch said i get it no matter what goes wrong its my ass i got it i also have a vest in my trunk he can use yours i like my own briefings at twentytwo hundred ramos said as he walked back toward the hangar corvo followed and bosch and aguila fell in behind him the other agents brought up the rear inside the cavernous hangar bosch saw there were three black helicopters sitting side by side in the bay area there were several men most in black jumpsuits milling about and drinking coffee from white cups two of the helicopters were widebodied personnel transport craft bosch recognized them they were uhns hueys the distinctive whopwhop of their rotors would forever be the sound of vietnam to him the third craft was smaller and sleeker it looked like a craft manufactured for commercial use like a news or police chopper but it had been converted into a gunship bosch recognized the gun turret mounted on the right side of the copters body beneath the cockpit another mount held an array of equipment including a spotlight and nightvision sensor the men in the black jumpsuits were stripping the white numbers and letters off the tail sections of the craft they were preparing for a total blackout a night assault bosch noticed corvo come up next to him we call it the lynx he said nodding to the smallest of the three craft mostly use em in central and south america ops but we snagged this one on its way down its for night work youve got total night vision set upinfrared heatpattern displays it will be the inair command post tonight bosch just nodded he was not as impressed with the hardware as corvo was the dea supervisor seemed more animated than during their meeting at the code his dark eyes were darting around the hangar taking it all in bosch realized that he probably missed fieldwork he was stuck in la while guys like ramos got to play the war games and thats where youre going to be you and your partner corvo said nodding at the lynx with me nice and safe observers you in charge of this show or is ramos im in charge hope so then looking at the war chopper bosch said tell me something corvo we want zorrillo alive right thats right okay then when we get him whats the plan hes a mexican citizen you cant take him over the border you just going to give him to the mexicans hell be running the penitentiary they put him in within a month that is if they put him in a pen it was a problem every cop in southern california had come up against mexico refused to extradite its citizens to the united states for crimes committed there but it would prosecute them at home the problem was that it was well known that the countrys biggest drug dealers turned penitentiary stays into hotel visits women drugs alcohol and other comforts could be had as long as the money was paid one story was that a convicted drug lord had actually taken over the wardens office and residence at a prison in juarez he had paid the warden for the privilege about four times what the warden made in a year now the warden was an inmate at the prison i know what youre saying corvo said but dont worry about it we got a plan for that only things you have to worry about are your own ass and your partners you better watch him good and you better get some coffee its going to be a long night bosch rejoined aguila who was standing at the workbench where the coffee had been set up they nodded at some of the agents who were milling about the bench but the gestures were rarely returned they were the invited uninvited from where they stood they could see into a suite of offices off the aircraft bays there were several mexicans in green uniforms sitting at desks and tables drinking coffee and waiting militia aguila said from mexico city is there no one in mexicali that the dea trusts well after tonight theyll trust you bosch lit a cigarette to go with the coffee and took an expansive look around the hangar what do you think he said to aguila i think the pope of mexicali is going to have a wakeup call tonight looks that way they moved away from the coffee bench to let others have at it and leaned against a nearby counter to watch the raid equipment being prepared bosch looked over toward the back of the hangar and saw ramos standing with a group of men wearing bulky black jumpsuits harry walked over and saw that the men were wearing nomex fireretardant suits beneath the jumpsuits some of them were smearing bootblack around their eyes and then pulling on black ski masks the clet squad they couldnt wait to get in the air to get going bosch could almost smell their adrenaline there were twelve of them they were reaching into black trunks and laying out the equipment they would need for the nights mission bosch saw kevlar helmets and vests sounddisorientation grenades holstered already on one mans hip was a mm p with an extended magazine that would just be for backup he guessed he could see the barrel of a long gun protruding from one of the trunks ramos noticed him then and reached into the trunk and brought the weapon over there was a strange leer spreading on his face check this shit out ramos said colt only makes em for the dea man the ro its a suppressed version of the standard nine submachine uses onefortysevengrain subsonic hollow points you know what one of them will do itll go through three bodies before it even thinks about slowing down its got a suppressed silencer means no muzzle flash these guys are always jumping labs you get ether fumes and the muzzle flash could set it off boomyou land about two blocks away but not with these no muzzle flash its beautiful i wish i was going in with one of these tonight ramos was holding and ogling the weapon like a mother with her first baby you were in vietnam werent you bosch ramos asked bosch just nodded i could tell something about you i always can tell ramos handed the gun back to its owner there was still an odd smile on his face i was too young for nam and too old for iraq aint that a pisser the raid briefing did not start until nearly tenthirty ramos and corvo gathered all the agents the militia officers and bosch and aguila in front of a large bulletin board on which a blowup of an aerial photo of zorrillos ranch had been tacked bosch could see that the ranch contained vast areas of open unused land the pope had found security in space to the west of his property were the cucapah mountains a natural boundary while in the other directions he had created a buffer zone of thousands of acres of scrubland ramos and corvo stood on either side of the bulletin board and ramos conducted the meeting by using a yardstick as a pointer he delineated the boundaries of the ranch and identified what he called the population centera large walled compound that included a hacienda ranch house and adjoining bunkertype building he then circled the breeding corrals and barn located about a mile from the population center along the perimeter of the ranch that fronted val verde highway he also pointed out the envirobreed compound across the highway next ramos tacked up another blowup this one detailing about a quarter of the ranchranging from the population center to the breeding centerenvirobreed compound area this shot was close enough that tiny figures could be seen on the roofs of the bunker building in the scrubland behind the buildings there were black figures against the light brown and green earth the bulls bosch wondered which one of them was el temblar he could hear one of the militia officers translating the meeting for a group of the guardsmen gathered around him okay these photos are about thirty hours old ramos said we had nasa do a flyover in a uthirtyfour we also had them shoot heat resonance strips and thats where this gets good the reds you see are the hot spots he tacked a new blowup next to the other this was a computergenerated graphic that had red squaresthe buildingsagainst a sea of blues and greens there were small dots of red outside the square and bosch assumed these were the bulls these photos were taken at the same second yesterday ramos said by jumping back and forth between the graphic and the live shot we can pinpoint certain anomalies these squares become the buildings and most of these smaller red blotches become the bulls he used the yardstick to refer back and forth between the two blowups bosch realized that there were more red spots on the graphic than there were bulls on the photo now these marks do not correspond with animals on the photo ramos said what they do correspond with is the feed boxes with corvos help they pinned up two more enlargements these were the closest shots so far bosch could clearly make out the tin roof of a small shed there was a black steer standing near it in the corresponding graphic both the steer and the shed were bright red these basically are little shelters to keep rain off the hay and feed for the livestock nasa says these shelters would emit some residual heat that the resonance photos would pick up but nasa said it clearly would not be what we are seeing here so what we think this means is that these feed boxes are decoys we think they are exhaust vents for an underground complex we believe there is some kind of entrance somewhere in the population center structures that leads to the underground lab back here he let it sink in for a few moments nobody asked any questions also he said there is awe have information from a confidential informant that there is a tunnel system we believe it runs from the breeding center here to this complexa business called envirobreedhere we believe it has allowed zorrillo to circumvent surveillance and is one of the possible means of moving product from the ranch to the border ramos went on to detail the raid the plan was to strike at midnight the mexican militia would have a twopart responsibility a single unmarked car would be sent to the ranch gate swerving as if driven by a drunk on the gravel road using this ruse the three guardsmen in the car would take custody of the two gate sentries after that half of the remaining militia would move down the ranch road to the population center while the other half would advance to the envirobreed compound surround it and await developments on the ranch the success of the operation largely relies on the two men on the gate being taken before issuing a warning to the pc corvo said his first words during the briefing if we fail that we lose the element of surprise after the ground attack was underway the three air squads would come the two transport craft would put down on the north and east sides of the pc to drop the clet team the clets would perform initial entry to all structures the third helicopter the lynx would remain airborne and act as a flying command post lastly ramos said the ranch had two rovers twoman jeep patrols ramos said they followed no set patrol or pattern and they would be impossible to pinpoint until the raid began they are the wild cards ramos said that is what we have a mobile air command for they warn us when the jeeps are spotted coming in or the lynx will just take them out ramos was pacing back and forth in front of the bulletin board swinging the yardstick bosch could tell he liked this the feeling of being in charge of something maybe it made up for vietnam or iraq okay gentlemen ive got a few more things here ramos said as he pinned another photo up our target is the ranch we have search warrants for drugs if we find manufacturing apparatus we are gold if we find narcotics we are gold but the thing we really want is this man here the photo was a blowup from the mug book bosch had looked at that morning this is our main man ramos said humberto zorrillo the pope of mexicali if we dont get him this whole operation goes down the tubes hes the mastermind hes the one we want it might interest you to know that in addition to his activities related to narcotics he is a suspect in the killing of two la cops not to mention a couple other killings up there in the last month or so this is a man who doesnt think twice about it if he doesnt do it himself he has plenty of people working for him who will hes dangerous anybody we encounter on the ranch has to be considered armed and dangerous questions one of the militia asked a question in spanish good question ramos replied we are not going into envirobreed initially because of two reasons one our prime target is the ranch and we would have to initially deploy more resources to envirobreed if we were to make simultaneous entry to the compound and the ranch secondly our ci indicates the tunnel on that side may be rigged boobytrapped we dont want to chance it when we get the ranch secured well go in then or well follow the tunnel over he waited for more questions there were none the men in front of him were shifting their weight from foot to foot or chewing their nails or flicking their thumbs on their knees the adrenaline rush was just beginning to kick bosch had seen it before in vietnam and since so he approached his own rising excitement with an uneasy sense of dread all right then ramos yelled i want everybody locked and loaded in one hour at midnight we jam the gathering broke up with some adolescent howls from the younger agents bosch moved toward ramos as he was taking the photos off the board sounds like a plan man yeah just hope it goes down close to the way we said it they never go down exactly right right corvo told me youve got another plan the one to get zorrillo across the border yeah weve got something cooked up you gonna tell me he turned around from the board all the photos in a nice stack in his hands yeah ill tell you youll like this bosch since it will get him up to la to face trial on your guys whats going to happen is that after the little fuck is captured he will resist arrest and injure himself probably facial injuries and they are going to look worse than they really are but we will want to get him immediate medical attention the dea will offer the use of one of the helicopters the commander of the militia unit will gratefully accept but you see the pilot will become confused and mistake the lights of imperial county memorial hospital on the other side of the border with the mexicali general clinic which is just on this side of the border when the chopper lands at the wrong hospital and zorrillo gets off on the wrong side of the border he will be subject to arrest and the american justice system tough break for him we might have to put a notice of reprimand in the pilots personnel file ramos had that leering smile on his face again he winked at bosch and then walked away the lynx was crossing over the carpet of mexicalis lights heading southwest toward the dark shape of the cucapah mountains the ride was smoother and quieter than anything he remembered from vietnam or his dreams after bosch was in the rear compartment huddled next to the left window the cold night air was somehow getting in through a vent somewhere aguila was on the seat next to him and in the forward compartment were corvo and the pilot corvo was air leader handling communications and directions on the ranch assault ramos was ground one in charge on the surface looking into the forward compartment bosch could see the dim reflection of the cockpits green dials on the visor of corvos helmet the helmets of all four of the men in the chopper were connected through electronic umbilical cords to a center console port the helmets had airtoground and onboard radio twoway and nightvision capabilities after they had flown for fifteen minutes the lights through the windows became fewer without the glare of the brightness from below harry could make out the silhouette of one of the other helicopters about two hundred yards to the left side the other black ship would be on the right side they were flying in formation eta two minutes a voice said in his ear the pilot bosch took the kevlar vest he held in his lap and slipped it underneath him onto the seat a protection against ground fire he saw aguila do the same thing with the dea loaner the lynx began a sharp descent and the voice in his ears said here we go bosch snapped the night vision apparatus down and looked into the lenses the earth moved quickly below a yellow river of scrub brush and little else they passed over a road and then a turnoff the helicopter banked in the direction of the turn he saw a car a pickup truck and a jeep stopped on the road and then several other vehicles moving on the dirt road yellow clouds of dust billowing behind them the militia was in and speeding toward the population center the battle had been engaged looks like our friends have already taken care of one of the patrol jeeps corvos voice said in boschs earpiece thats a tenfour came a returning voice apparently from one of the other choppers the lynx overtook the militia vehicles bosch was staring at open road in the nightvision scope the crafts descent continued and then leveled off at what bosch estimated was an elevation of about three hundred yards in the yellow vision field he could now see the hacienda and the front of the bunker he saw the other two helicopters looking like black dragonflies set down on their assigned sides of the house then he felt the lynx pull up slightly as if hovering on an air pocket one down a voice shouted in the headset two down came another men in black began spilling from the side doors of the landed craft one group of six went immediately to the front of the hacienda the sixman group from the other helicopter moved toward the bunker building militia cars now began pulling into the field of view bosch saw more figures leap from the helicopters that would be ramos and the backup it all appeared surrealistic in the scope to bosch the yellow tint the tiny figures it seemed like a badly filmed and edited movie switching to ground com corvo said bosch heard the click as the frequencies were switched almost immediately he began to pick up radio chatter and the heavy breathing of men running then there was a loud banging sound but bosch could tell it was not weapon fire it was the ram used to open the door over the air there were now panicked shouts of policiadea corvos voice cut through a momentary lull in the shouting ground one talk to me what have we got lets talk to the mothership there was some static and then ramoss voice came back we have entry at point a we haveim going ramos was cut off point a was the hacienda the plan had been to hit the hacienda and the bunker point b at once ground two do we have entry yet at point b corvo asked no answer it was a few long moments of silence and then ramos came back up on the air air leader cant tell on ground two at this time target team has approached entry point and we before the transmission was cut off bosch heard the unmistakable sound of automatic gunfire he felt adrenaline begin to flood his body yet he could do nothing but sit and listen to the dead radio air and watch the murky yellow night vision display he saw what he believed were muzzle flashes from the front of the bunker then ramos came back up on the air were hot were hot the helicopter lurched as the pilot took them up higher as the craft rose the night scope offered a larger view of the scene below the entire pc became visible now bosch could see figures on the roof of the bunker moving toward the front of the structure he pushed the switch on the side of his helmet and said into the mouthpiece corvo theyve got people on the roof warn them stay off corvo shouted then to below he radioed ground two ground two you have weapons on the roof of the bunker count two positions approaching northside copy bosch could hear no shooting over the sound of the rotor but he could see the muzzle flash from automatic weapons from two locations at the front of the bunker he saw sporadic flashes from the vehicles but the militia was pinned down he heard a radio transmission open and heard the sound of fire but then it was closed and no one had spoken ground two copy corvo said into the voice there was just the initial strain of panic in his voice there was no reply ground two do you copy a hardbreathing voice came back ground two yeah were pinned down in the point b entry were in a crossfire here would like some help ground one report corvo barked there was a long moment of silence then ramos came on the air his words were partially obscured by gunfire here weve the house have three suspects down no others present looks like theyre fucking bunker get to the bunker two needs backup that way bosch noticed how the voices on the radio were higher and more urgent the code words and formal language had been stripped away fear did that he had seen it in the war hed seen it on the streets when he was in uniform fear though always unspoken nevertheless stripped men of their carefully orchestrated poses the adrenaline roars and the throat gurgles with fear like a backedup drain sheer desire for survival takes over it sharpens the mind pares away all the bullshit a oncemodulated reference to point b becomes the almost hysterical expletive from four hundred yards up and looking down through the night scope bosch could also see the flaw in the plan the dea agents had hoped to outrun the militia in their helicopters charge the population center and secure things before the ground troops arrived but that hadnt happened the militia was there and now one of the clet groups was pinned down between the militia and the people in the bunker there was a sudden increase in the shooting from the bunker bosch could tell this by the flaring of repeated muzzle flashes then on the scope he saw a jeep suddenly begin speeding from the back of the bunker it smashed through a gate in the wall that surrounded the compound and began moving across the scrubland in a southeasterly direction bosch pushed his transmit button again corvo we have a runner jeep heading southeast have to let him go for now its going to shit down there and i cant move anybody stay off the fucking line the jeep was now well out of the scopes field of vision he flipped the lenses up off his face and looked out the window there was nothing only darkness the jeep was running without lights he thought of the barn and stables out near the highway that was where the runner was going ramos corvo said over the radio do you want lights no return ground one ground two do you want lights ights would be good but youd be a sit the ground two voice said better hold it a few until we eaned up thats a copy ramos are you copying there was no answer the shooting ended quickly after that the popes guardians put down their weapons after apparently determining that their odds of survival in a prolonged firefight were not good air leader give us that light now ramos radioed from below the tone of his voice back to being calmly modulated and confident three powerful beams from the belly of the lynx then illuminated the ground below men with hands laced together on the tops of their heads were walking out of the bunker and into the hands of the militia there were at least a dozen bosch saw one of the clets drag a body out of the bunker and leave it on the ground outside were secure down here ramos radioed corvo signaled with his thumb to the pilot and the craft began to descend bosch felt tension drift out of him as they went down in thirty seconds they were on the ground next to one of the other helicopters in the yard in front of the bunker the prisoners were kneeling while some of the militia officers used plastic disposable handcuffs to bind their wrists others were making a stack of confiscated weapons there were a couple of uzis and aks but mostly shotguns and ms ramos was standing with the militia captain who had his radio to his ear bosch did not see a recognizable face among the prisoners he left aguila and went to ramos wheres zorrillo ramos held up his hand in a donotdisturb gesture and didnt answer he was looking at the captain corvo walked up then too there was a report over the captains radio and then he looked at ramos and said nada okay nothings happening at envirobreed ramos said nobody in or out since this went down here the militia is maintaining a watch over there ramos saw corvo and in a lower voice meant just for him said weve got a problem weve lost one yeah we saw him bosch said he was in the jeep and headed southeast out of he stopped when he realized what ramos had meant whod we lose corvo asked kirth one of the clets but thats not the whole problem bosch stepped back from the two men he knew he had no place in this what the fuck do you mean corvo said come on ill show you the two agents headed off around the hacienda bosch trailed at a discreet distance behind a covered porch ran the length of the rear of the house ramos crossed it to an open door a clet agent his mask pulled up to expose his blood and sweatstreaked face was on the floor three feet inside the door it looked to bosch like four rounds two in the upper chest just above the vest and two in the neck a nice tight pattern all of them throughandthrough wounds blood was still leaking out from beneath the body into a pool the dead agents eyes and mouth were open he had died quickly bosch could see the problem it was friendly fire kirth had been hit with fire from one of the s the wounds were too big too devastating and bunched too close together to have come from the weapons stacked near the prisoners looks like he came running out this back door when he heard the shooting ramos was saying ground two was already in a crossfire someone from twos unit must have opened on the door hit kirth here god damn it corvo yelled then in a lower voice he said all right come over here ramos they huddled together and this time bosch could not hear what was said but didnt have to he knew what they would do careers were at stake here got it ramos said returning to a normal voice and breaking away from corvo good corvo said when you are done with that i want you to get to a secure line and call laoperations we are going to need public info officers down here and up there to work on this asap the media is going to be crawling all over this from all over you got it corvo started to go into the house but came back another thing keep the mexicans away from this he meant the militia ramos nodded and then corvo stalked off ramos looked over at bosch standing in the shadows of the porch a silent acknowledgement passed between them bosch knew that the media would be told that kirth had been fatally wounded by zorrillos men nobody would say anything about friendly fire you got a problem ramos said i dont have a problem with anything good then im not going to have to worry about you right bosch bosch stepped to the door ramos wheres zorrillo were still searching still a lot of space in these buildings to cover all i can tell you is weve cleared the hacienda and he isnt here only three inside are dead and he aint one of them so no ones talking but your cop killers in there bosch the man with the tears bosch silently stepped around ramos and the body and into the hacienda he was careful not to step into the blood as he passed he looked down into the dead mans eyes they were already filming and looked like chips of dirty ice he followed a hallway to the front of the house where he heard voices from a doorway at the bottom of the stairs in the front entry as he approached he could see the room beyond was an office there was a large polished wood desk its center drawer open behind the desk was a wall of bookshelves inside the room were corvo and one of the clet agents and two bodies one was on the floor next to an overturned couch the other was in a chair near the rooms only window off to the right of the desk cmon in here bosch corvo said we can probably use your expertise here the body in the chair held boschs attention the mans expensive black leather jacket was open revealing a gun still holstered on the belt it was grena though this was not easy at first to tell because a bullet fired into the police captains right temple had obliterated much of the face when it exited beneath the left eye blood had flowed down both shoulders and ruined the jacket bosch pulled his eyes away and looked at the man on the floor one leg was over the back of the couch which had been knocked backwards he had at least five holes in his chest that bosch could make out in the blood the three teardrops tattooed on the cheek were also unmistakable arpis the man he had seen at poes there was a chromeplated fortyfive on the floor next to his right leg that your man corvo asked one of em yeah good dont have to worry about him then the other one is sjp hes a captain named grena yeah i just pulled the id out of his pocket he also had six grand in his wallet not bad since sjp captains make about three hundred bucks a week take a look over here he moved to the other side of the desk bosch followed and saw that the rug had been folded back exposing a floor safe about the size of a hotel refrigerator its thick steel door was propped open and the interior was empty this is how it was found when the clets came in what do you think these stiffs dont look too old i think we got here just a little late for the show huh bosch studied the scene for a few moments hard to say looks like the end of a business deal maybe grena got greedy asked for more than he deserved maybe he was making some kind of play with zorrillo some kind of scam and it went to shit i saw him a few hours ago at the bullfight yeah what did he say that he was heading over to the popes for a shot corvo didnt laugh and neither did bosch no he just told me to get out of town so who shot him looks like a fortyfive to me just guessing that would make arpis over here a likely candidate then who shot arpis got me but if i was guessing it looks like zorrillo or whoever was behind the desk pulls a gun out of the drawer there and starts popping him right here in front of the desk he goes backwards and over the couch why would he shoot him i dont know maybe zorrillo didnt like what he did to grena maybe zorrillo was starting to get scared of him maybe arpis made the same play grena did couldve been a lot of things well never know i thought ramos said it was three bodies across the hall bosch crossed the hall into a long and wide living room it had deeppile white shag carpet and a white piano there was a painting of elvis on the wall above a white leather couch the rug was stained with blood from the third man who was lying in front of the couch it was dance bosch recognized him from the mug shot even with the bullet wound in his forehead and the blond hair now dyed black the practiced sulk had been replaced on his face with a look of wonder his eyes were open and almost seemed to be looking up at the hole in his forehead corvo walked in behind him what do you think i think it looks like the pope had to get out of here in a hurry and he didnt want to leave these three behind to talk about it shit i dont know corvo corvo raised the handheld radio to his mouth search teams he said status search leader here weve got the underground lab entrance is through the bunker structure its major we have product sitting in the drying pans multiweight were home were gold what about the priority suspect negative at this time no suspects in the lab shit corvo said after signing off he rubbed the edge of the motorola against the scar on his cheek as he thought about what to do next the jeep bosch said we have to go after it if hes heading to envirobreed the militia is there waiting at the moment i cant cut people loose to go running around the ranch its six thousand fucking acres ill go wait a minute bosch this is not your action fuck it corvo im going bosch came out of the house looking in the dim light for aguila and finally saw him standing near the prisoners and the militia bosch realized he probably felt more like an outsider here than harry did himself i am going after the jeep we saw i think it was zorrillo i am ready the mexican said before they could move corvo came running up but it was not to stop them bosch ive got ramos in the chopper its all i can spare the silence that followed was punctuated by the sound from the other side of the hacienda of the helicopters rotor beginning to turn go corvo yelled or hell go without you they ran around the building and climbed back into their spots in the lynx ramos was in the cockpit with the pilot the craft abruptly lifted off and bosch forgot about the seatbelt he was too busy putting on his helmet and nightvision equipment there was nothing in the scope yet no jeep no runner they were heading southwest from the ranchs population center as he watched the yellow land go by in the nightvision lenses harry realized he still hadnt informed aguila of his captains demise when we are done here he decided in two minutes they came upon the jeep it was parked in a copse of eucalyptus trees and tall brush a tumbleweed as big as a truck had blown up against it or been put up against it as a meager disguise the vehicle was about fifty yards from the corrals and barn the pilot put on the spots and the lynx began circling there was no sign of the driver the runner zorrillo looking between the front seats bosch saw ramos give the pilot the thumbs down sign and the craft began its descent the lights were cut off and until harrys eyes adjusted it felt like they were dropping through the depths of a black hole he finally felt the impact of the ground and his muscles relaxed slightly he heard the engine cut and there was just the chirping and whupping sound of the freeturning rotor winding down through the window bosch could see the western side of the barn there were no doors or windows on this exposure and he was thinking that they could approach with reasonable cover when he heard ramos yell what thehold on there was a hard impact and the helicopter lurched violently and began sliding bosch looked out his window and could only see that they were being pushed sideways the jeep someone had been hidden in the jeep the lynxs landing rails finally caught on something in the earth and the craft tipped over bosch covered his face and ducked when he saw the still spinning rotor start biting into the ground and splintering then he felt aguilas weight crash down on him and heard yelling in the cockpit that he could not decipher the helicopter rocked in this position for only a few seconds before there was another loud impact this time from the front bosch heard tearing metal and shattering glass and gunfire then it was gone bosch could feel the vibration in the ground dissipating as the jeep sped away i think i got him ramos yelled did you see that all bosch could think of was their vulnerability the next hit would probably be from behind where they could not see to shoot he tried to reach his smith but his arms were trapped under aguila the mexican detective finally began to crawl off him and they both tentatively moved into crouches in the now sideways compartment bosch reached up and tried the door which was now above them it slid about halfway open before catching on something a torn piece of metal they took off their helmets and bosch went out first then aguila handed him the bulletproof vests bosch didnt know why but took them aguila followed him out the smell of fuel was in the air they moved to the crushed front of the helicopter where ramos gun in one hand was trying to slide through the hole where the front window used to be help him bosch said ill cover he pulled his gun and turned in a full circle but saw no one then he saw the jeep parked where he had seen it from the air the tumbleweed still pressed against it this made no sense to bosch unless the pilot is trapped aguila said harry looked into the cockpit ramos was shining a flashlight on the pilot whose blond mustache was inked with blood there was a deep slash on the bridge of his nose his eyes were wide and bosch could see the flight control apparatus was crushed in on his legs wheres the radio bosch said weve got to get help out here ramos stuck his upper body back through the cockpit window and came back out with the handheld radio corvo corvo come up weve got an emergency here while waiting for a response ramos said to bosch do you believe this shit that fucking monster comes outta nowhere i didnt know what the whats happening corvos voice came back on the radio weve got a situation here we need a medevac out here tools the lynx is wrecked corcoran is pinned inside has injuries cation of the crash its not a crash man a goddamn bull attacked it on the ground its wrecked and we cant get corcoran out our location is one hundred yards northeast of the breeding center the barn stay there helps on the way ramos clipped the radio to his belt held the flashlight under his arm and reloaded his handgun lets each take a side of a triangle the chopper in the middle and watch for this thing i know i hit it but it didnt show a thing no bosch said ramos you and aguila take sides of it and wait for help im going to clear the barn zorrillos getting no no no we dont do it like that bosch you arent calling any of the shots here we wait here and when help he stopped in midsentence and made a full turn then bosch realized he heard it too or rather felt it a rhythmic vibration in the ground growing stronger it was impossible to place the direction he watched ramos turn in circles with the flashlight he heard aguila say el temblar what ramos yelled what and then the bull appeared at the edge of vision a huge black beast it came at them undeterred by their number this was his turf to defend the bull seemed to bosch in that moment to have come from within the darkness an apparition of death its head down and jagged horns up it was less than thirty feet away when it locked on a specific target bosch in one hand he held the smith in the other the vest with the wordpolice on it in reflective yellow tape in the seconds he had left he realized the tape had caught the beasts attention and singled him out he also came to the conclusion that his gun was useless he could not fell the animal with bullets it was too big and powerful it would take a perfect shot on a moving target wounding it as ramos had would not stop it he dropped the gun and held the vest up bosch heard yelling and shooting from his right side it was ramos but the bull stayed on him as it came closer he swept the vest to his right its yellow letters catching the light of the moon he let it go as the animal closed in the bull like a blur of black in darkness hit the vest before it left his hand bosch tried to jump out of the way but one of the massive shoulders of the animal brushed him and sent him tumbling from the ground he looked up to see the animal cut to its left like a gifted athlete and close in on ramos the agent was still firing and bosch could see the reflection of the moon off the shells as they were ejected from his gun but the bullets did not stop the beasts charge they did not even slow it bosch heard the guns ejector go dry and ramos was pulling the trigger on an empty chamber his last cry was unintelligible the bull hit him low in the legs and then raised its brutish and bloodied neck up ejecting him into the air ramos seemed to tumble in slow motion before coming down headfirst and unmoving the bull tried to stop its charge but momentum and damage from bullets finally left it unable to control its huge weight its head dipped and it cartwheeled onto its back it righted itself and prepared for another charge bosch crawled to his gun picked it up and aimed but the animals front legs faltered and it went down then it slowly turned onto its side and lay unmoving save for the hesitant rise and fall of its chest then that stopped too aguila and bosch took off for ramos at the same time they huddled over him but did not move him he was on his back and his eyes were still open and caked with dirt his head lolled at an unnatural angle his neck appeared to have been cleanly broken in the fall in the distance they could hear the sound of one of the hueys flying their way bosch stood up and could see its spotlight sweeping over the scrubland looking for them im going to the tunnel bosch said when they land come in with backup no aguila said im going with you he said it in a way that invited no debate he leaned down and took the radio off ramoss belt and picked up the flashlight he gave the radio to bosch tell them we are both going bosch radioed corvo wheres ramos we just lost ramos me and aguila are going to the tunnel alert the militia at envirobreed that we are coming through we dont want to get shot he turned the radio off before corvo could reply and dropped it on the ground next to the dead dea agent the other helicopter was almost on them now they ran to the barn their weapons held up and ready and moved slowly around the outside until they were at the front and could see the bay door had been slid open wide enough for a man to pass through they went through and crouched in the darkness aguila began to sweep the flashlights beam around it was a cavernous barn with stalls running along both sides to the back there were crates used for trucking bulls to arenas stacked in the back along with towers made of bales of hay bosch saw a line of overhead lights running down the center of the building he looked around and found the switch near the bay door once the interior was lighted they moved down the aisle between the rows of stalls bosch taking the right and aguila the left the stalls were all empty the bulls set free to roam the ranch it was when they reached the back that they saw the opening to the tunnel a forklift was parked in the corner holding a pallet of hay bales four feet off the ground there was a fourfootwide hole in the concrete floor where the pallet had sat zorrillo or whoever the runner had been had used the forklift to lift the pallet but there had been no one to drop it back down to hide his escape bosch crouched down and moved to the edge of the hole and looked down he saw a ladder leading about twelve feet down to a lighted passageway he looked up at aguila ready the mexican nodded bosch went first he climbed a few steps down the ladder and then dropped the rest of the way bringing up his gun and ready to shoot but there was no one in the tunnel as far as he could see it wasnt even like a tunnel it was more of a hallway it was tall enough to stand in and an electrical conduit ran along the ceiling feeding lights in steel cages every twenty feet there was a slight curve to the left and so he could not see where it ended he moved into the passageway and aguila dropped down behind him okay bosch whispered lets stay to the right if there is shooting ill go low and you go high aguila nodded and they began to move quickly through the tunnel bosch trying to figure his bearings believed they were heading east and slightly north they covered the ground to the curve quickly and then pressed themselves hard against the wall as they moved into the second leg of the passage bosch realized that the bend in the passage was too wide for them to still be on line with envirobreed he stared down the last segment of the tunnel and saw that it was clear he could see the exit ladder maybe fifty yards ahead and he knew they were going somewhere other than envirobreed he wished he hadnt left the radio with ramoss body shit harry whispered what aguila whispered back nothing cmon they began to move again covering the first twentyfive yards quickly and then slowing to a cautious and quieter approach to the exit ladder aguila switched to the right wall and they came upon the opening at the same time both with guns extended upward sweat getting in their eyes there was no light from the opening above them bosch took the flashlight from aguila and put its beam through the hole he could see exposed wooden rafters of a low ceiling in the room above no one looked down at them no one shot at them no one did a thing harry listened for any sound but heard nothing he nodded to aguila to cover and holstered his gun he started climbing the ladder one hand holding the flashlight he was scared in vietnam leaving one of charlies tunnels always meant the end of fear it was like being born again you were leaving the darkness for safety and the hands of comrades out of the black and into the blue but not this time this time was the opposite when he reached the top before rising through the opening he flashed the beam around again but saw nothing then like a turtle he slowly moved his head out of the opening the first thing he noticed in the beam was the sawdust everywhere on the floor he climbed farther out taking in the rest of the surroundings it was some kind of storage room there were steel shelves stocked with saw blades boxes of sanding belts for industrial machinery there were some hand tools and carpentry saws one group of shelves were stacked with wooden dowel pegs with different sizes on different shelves bosch immediately thought of the pegs attached to the baling wire that had been used to kill kapps and porter he moved fully into the room now and signaled to aguila that it was safe to come up then harry approached the storage rooms door it was unlocked and it opened into a huge warehouse with lines of machinery and work benches on one side and the completed productunfinished furniture tables chairs chests of drawersstacked on the other light came from a single bulb that hung from a cross support beam it was the nightlight aguila came up behind him then they were in mexitec bosch knew at the far end of the warehouse were sets of double doors one of these was open and they moved to it quickly it led to a loadingdock area that was off the back alley bosch had walked through the night before there was a puddle at the bottom of the parking bay and he saw wet tire tracks leading into the alley there was no one in sight zorrillo was long gone two tunnels bosch said unable to hide the dejection in his voice two tunnels corvo said ramoss informant fucked us bosch and aguila were sitting on chairs of unfinished pine watching corvo pacing and looking like shit like a man in charge of an operation that had lost two men a helicopter and its main target it had been nearly two hours since they had come up through the tunnel how dyou mean bosch asked i mean the ci had to have known about the second tunnel hows he know about one and not the other he set us up he left zorrillo the escape route if i knew who he was id charge him with accessory in the death of a federal agent you dont know ramos didnt register this one with me hadnt gotten around to it bosch breathed a little easier i cant fucking believe this corvo was saying i might as well never go back im done man done least you got your cop killer bosch i got a shit sandwich have you put out a telex bosch said to change the subject already out to all stations all law enforcement agencies but it doesnt matter hes long gone hell probably go to the interior lie low for a year and then start over right where he left off probably michoacan maybe farther down maybe he went north bosch said no way hed try to cross he knows if we get him up there hell never see daylight again he went south wheres hes safe there were several other agents in the factory with clipboards cataloging and searching they had found a machine that hollowed out table legs so that they could be filled with contraband recapped and sent across the border earlier they had found the second tunnel opening in the barn and followed it through to envirobreed there had been no explosives on the trapdoor and they had gone in the place was empty except for the two dogs outside they killed them the operation had closed down a major smuggling network agents had left for calexico to arrest the head of envirobreed ely there were fourteen arrests made on the ranch others would follow but all of that wasnt enough for corvo or anybody not when agents were dead and zorrillo was in the wind corvo had been wrong if he thought bosch would be satisfied that arpis was dead bosch wanted zorrillo too he was the man who had called the hits bosch got up so he wouldnt have to witness the agents anguish anymore he had enough of his own aguila must have felt the same he too stood and began to walk listlessly around the machines and the furniture basically they were waiting for one of the militia cars to take them back to the airport to boschs car the dea would be here until well after sunup but bosch and aguila were finished harry watched aguila go back into the storage room and approach the tunnel entrance he had told him about grena and the mexican had simply nodded he hadnt shown a thing now aguila dropped to his haunches and seemed to be studying the floor as if the sawdust were a spread of tea leaves in which he could read zorrillos location after a few moments he said the pope has new boots bosch walked over and aguila pointed to the footprints in the sawdust there was one that was not from aguilas or boschs shoes it was very clear in the dust and harry recognized the elongated heel of a bulldog boot inside it was the letter s formed by a curving snake the edges of the print were sharp in the dust the head of the snake clearly imprinted aguila had been right the pope had new boots all the way to the border crossing bosch contemplated how it had been done how all the parts now seemed to fit and how it might have gone unnoticed if not for aguila noticing the footprint he thought about the snakes box in the closet of the apartment in los feliz a clue so obvious yet he had missed it he had seen only what he wanted to see it was still early just the first hint of dawns light was fighting its way up the eastern horizon and there was not yet much of a line at the crossing nobody was cleaning windshields nobody was selling junk nobody was there at all bosch badged the boredlooking border patrol agent and was waved through he needed a phone and some caffeine he drove two minutes to the calexico town hall got a coke from the machine in the police departments cramped lobby and took it out to the pay phone on the front wall he looked at his watch and knew she would be at home probably awake and getting ready for work he lit a cigarette and dialed charging the call to his own pactel card while he waited for it to go through he looked across the street into the fog he saw the shapes of sleeping figures under blankets scattered about the park the ground fog gave the images a ghostly lonely resonance teresa picked up after two rings she sounded like she had been awake already hi harry what is it sorry to wake you up you didnt whats the matter are you getting dressed up to go to moores funeral today yes what is this you called me at ten minutes before six to ask that isnt moore theyll be putting in the ground there was a long silence during which bosch looked into the park and saw a man standing there a blanket wrapped around his shoulders staring back at him in the fog harry looked away what are you saying harry are you all right im tired but never better what im saying is hes still alive moore i just missed him this morning are you still in mexico at the border that doesnt make sense what you said there were matches made on the latents we got dental and his own wife idd a photograph of the tattoo on the body his identification was confirmed its all bullshit he set it up why harry are you calling me now and telling me this i want you to help me teresa i cant go to irving only you you help me and youll help yourself if im right thats a big if harry bosch looked back into the park and the man in the blanket was gone just tell me how it could be possible she said convince me bosch was silent a moment like a lawyer composing himself before a crossexamination he knew that every word he spoke now had to stand the test of her scrutiny or he would lose her besides the prints and dental sheehan told me they also matched his handwriting to the ifoundoutwhoiwas note he said they compared it to a changeofaddress card moore had put in his personnel file a few months ago after he and his wife separated he took a deep drag on the cigarette and she thought he had finished so i dont seewhat about it one of the concessions the protective league won a few years back during contract negotiations was guaranteed access to your personnel file so cops could check if there were beefs on their record commendations letters of complaint anything like that so moore had access to his pfile he went into personnel a few months back and asked for it because he had just moved and needed to update it with his new address bosch held it there a moment to compose the rest of it in his mind okay okay she said the pfiles also contain print cards moore had access to the print card irving took to you on the day of the autopsy that was the card your tech used to identify the prints you see while moore had the file he could have switched his card for someone elses then you used the bogus card to identify his body but see it wasnt his body it was the other persons who i think it was a man from down here named humberto zorrillo this seems too farfetched there were other ids i remember that day in the suite whats his name sheehan he got a call from sid saying they matched prints in the motel room to moore they used a different set than we did its a doubleblind confirmation harry then we have the tattoo and the dental how do you explain all of that look teresa listen to me it all can be explained it all works the dental you told me you only found one usable fragment part of a root canal that meant no root was left it was a dead tooth so you could not tell how long it had been out only that it matched his dentists charts thats fine but one of moores crew told me he once saw moore get punched during a boulevard brawl and he lost a tooth that couldve been it i dont know okay what about the prints in the room explain that easy those were his prints donovan the sid guy told me he pulled prints from the department of justice computer those would have been moores real prints that meant he was really in the room it doesnt mean its his body normally one set of exemplarsthe ones from the doj computerwould be used to do all the match work but irving screwed it up by going to the pfile and thats the beauty of moores plan he knew irving or someone in the department would do it this way he could count on it because he knew the department would put a rush on the autopsy the id everything because it was a fellow officer its been done before and he knew they would do it for him donovan never did a crossmatch between our prints and the set he pulled nope because it wasnt the routine he mightve gotten around to it later when he thought about it but things were happening too fast on this case shit she said he knew he was winning her over what about the tattoo its a barrio insignia a lot of people could have had them i think zorrillo had one who is he he grew up with moore down here they might be brothers i dont know anyway zorrillo became the local drug kingpin moore went to la and became a cop but somehow moore was working for him up there the story goes on from there the dea raided zorrillos ranch last night he got away but i dont think it was zorrillo it was moore you saw him i didnt need to is anyone looking for him the dea is looking theyre concentrating in interior mexico then again theyre looking for zorrillo moore may never turn up again it all seems youre saying moore killed zorrillo and then traded places with him yeah somehow he got zorrillo to la they meet at the hideaway and moore puts him downthe trauma to the back of the head you found he puts his boots and clothes on the body then he blows the face away with the shotgun he makes sure to leave some of his own prints around to make donovan bite and puts the note in the back pocket i think the note worked on a number of levels it was taken as a suicide note at first authenticating the handwriting helped add to the identification on another level i think it was something personal between moore and zorrillo goes back to the barrio who are you i found out who i was that part of it is a long story they were both silent for a while rethinking all of what bosch had just said he knew there were still a lot of loose ends a lot of deception why all the killings she asked porter and juan doe what did they have to do with anything this is where he had few answers i dont know they were somehow in the way i guess zorrillo had jimmy kapps killed because he was an informant i think moore was the one who told zorrillo after that juan doehis name by the way is gutierrezllosagets beaten to death down here and taken up there i dont know why then moore pops zorrillo and takes his place why he had to do porter i dont know i guess he thought lou might figure it out thats so cold yeah how could it happen she asked then more to herself than bosch they are about to bury him this drug dealer full honors the mayor and chief there the media and youll know the truth she thought about that for a long time before asking the next question why did he do it i dont know were talking about different lives the cop and the drug dealer but there mustve been something still between them that bondwhatever it isfrom the barrio and somehow one day the cop crosses over starts watching out for the dealer on the streets of la who knows what made him do it maybe money maybe just something he had lost a long time ago when he was a kid what do you mean i dont know im still thinking if they were that close why did he kill him i guess well have to ask him if we ever find him maybe hemaybe like you said it was just to take zorrillos place all that money or maybe it was guilt he got in too far and he needed a way to end it moore wasor ishung up on the past his wife said that maybe he was trying to recapture something go back i dont know yet there was silence on the line again bosch took a last drag on his cigarette the plan seems almost perfect he said he leaves a body behind in circumstances he knew would make the department not want to come looking but you did harry yeah and here i am he thought he knew what he had to do now he had to finish it he could see the ghostly figures of several people in the park now they were waking to another day of desperation why did you call me harry what do you want me to do i called because i have to trust someone i could only think of you teresa then what do you want me to do you have access to the doj prints in your office right thats how we make most of our ids thats how we will make all of them after this i have irving by the balls now do you still have the print card he brought over for the autopsy um i dont know but im sure the techs made a copy of it to keep with the body you want me to do the crosscheck yeah do a cross and youll see they dont match youre so sure yeah im sure but you might as well confirm it then what then i guess ill see you at the funeral ive got one more stop to make and then im heading up what stop i want to check out a castle its part of the long story ill tell you later you dont want to try to stop the funeral harry thought a few moments before answering he thought of sylvia moore and the mystery she still held for him then he thought about the idea of a drug lord getting a cops farewell no i dont want to stop it do you no way he knew her reasons were far different from his but he didnt care about that teresa was well on her way to winning her assignment as permanent chief medical examiner if irving got in her way now hed end up looking like one of the customers in the autopsy suite in that case more power to her he thought ill see you in a little bit he said be careful harry bosch hung up and lit another cigarette the morning sun was up now and beginning to burn the ground fog off the park people were moving around over there he thought he heard a woman laughing but at the moment he felt very much alone in the world bosch pulled his car up to the front gate at the end of coyote trail and saw that the circular driveway in front of castillo de los ojos was still empty but the thick chain that had secured the two halves of the iron gate the day before hung loose and the lock was open moore was here harry left his car there blocking the exit and slipped through the gate on foot he ran across the brown lawn in a crouched uneasy trot mindful that the windows of the tower looked down at him like the dark accusing eyes of a giant he pressed himself against the stucco surface of the wall next to the front door he was breathing heavily and sweating though the morning air was still quite cool the knob was locked he stood there unmoving for a long period listening for something but hearing nothing finally he ducked below the line of windows that fronted the first floor and moved around the house to the side of the fourbay garage there was another door here and it too was locked bosch recognized the rear of the house from the photographs that had been in moores bag he saw the sliding doors running along the pool deck one door was open and the wind buffeted the white curtain it flapped like a hand beckoning him to come in the open door led to a large living room it was full of ghostsfurniture covered by musty white sheets nothing else he moved to his left silently passing through the kitchen and opening a door to the garage there was one car which was covered by more sheets and a pale green panel van it saidmexitec on the side bosch touched the vans hood and found it still warm through the windshield he saw a sawedoff shotgun lying across the passenger seat he opened the unlocked door and took the weapon out as quietly as he could he cracked it open and saw both barrels were loaded with doubleought shells he closed the weapon holstered his own and carried it with him he pulled the sheet off the front end of the other car and recognized it as the thunderbird he had seen in the fatherandson photo in moores bag looking at the car bosch wondered how far back you have to go to trace the reason for a persons choices in life he didnt know the answer about moore he didnt know the answer about himself he went back to the living room and stopped and listened there was nothing the house seemed still empty and it smelled dusty like time spent slowly and painfully in wait for something or someone not coming all the rooms were full of ghosts he was considering the shape of a shrouded fan chair when he heard the noise from above like the sound of a shoe dropping on a wood floor he moved toward the front and in the entry area he saw the wide stone staircase bosch moved up the steps the noise from above was not repeated on the second floor he went down a carpeted hallway looking through the doors to four bedrooms and two bathrooms but finding each room empty he went back to the stairs and up into the tower the lone door at the top landing was open and harry heard no sound he crouched and moved slowly into the opening the sawedoff leading the way like a water finders divining rod moore was there standing with his back to the door and looking at himself in the mirror the mirror was on the back of a closet door which was open slightly angling the glass so that it did not catch harrys reflection he watched moore unseen for a few moments then looked around there was a bed in the center of the room with an open suitcase on it next to it was a gym bag that was zipped closed and already appeared to be packed moore still had not moved he was intently staring at the reflection of his face he had a full beard now and his eyes were brown he wore faded blue jeans new snakeskin boots a black tshirt and a black leather jacket with matching gloves he was melrose avenue cool from a distance he could easily pass for the pope of mexicali bosch saw the wood grips and chrome handle of an automatic tucked into moores belt you going to say something harry or just stare without moving his hands or head moore shifted his weight to the left and then he and bosch were staring at each other in the mirror picked up a new pair of boots before you put zorrillo down didnt you now moore turned completely to face him but he didnt say anything keep your hands out front like that bosch said whatever you say harry you know i kinda thought that if somebody came youd be the one you wanted somebody to come didnt you some days i did some days i didnt bosch moved into the room and then took a step sideways so he was directly facing moore new contacts beard you look like the popefrom a distance but howd you convince his lieutenants hisguardia they were just going to stand back and let you move in and take his place money convinced them theyd probably let you move in there if you had the bread harry see anything is negotiable when you have your hands on the purse strings and i did moore nodded slightly toward the duffel bag on the bed how about you i have money not much about a hundred and ten grand there i figured youd be running away with a fortune oh i am i am whats in the bag is just what i have on hand you caught me a little short but i can get you more its in the banks guess youve been practicing zorrillos signature as well as his looks moore didnt answer who was he who you know who half brother different fathers this place this is what it was all about wasnt it its the castle you lived in before you were sent away something like that decided to buy it after he was gone but its falling apart on me its so hard to take care of something you love these days everything is a chore bosch tried to study him he looked tired of it all what happened back at the ranch bosch asked you mean the three bodies yes well i guess you could say justice happened grena was a leech who had been sucking zorrillo for years arpis detached him you could say then who detached arpis and dance i did that harry he said it without hesitation and the words froze bosch moore was a cop he knew never to confess you didnt talk until there was a lawyer by your side a plea bargain in place and a deal that was signed harry adjusted his sweating hands on the sawedoff he took a step forward and listened for any other sound in the house there was only silence until moore spoke again im not going back harry i guess you know that he said it matteroffactly as if it was a given something that had been decided a long time ago howd you get zorrillo up to la and then into that motel room howd you get his prints for the personnel file you want me to tell you harry then what moore looked down at the gym bag briefly then nothing were going back to la you havent been advisednothing you can say now can be used against you its just you and me here the prints were easy i was making him ids he had three or four so he could come across when he liked one time he told me he wanted a passport and full wallet spread i told him i needed prints took em myself and the motel like i said he crossed over all the time hed go through the tunnel and the dea would be out there sitting on the ranch thinking he was still inside he liked to come up to see the lakers sit down on court level near that blonde actress who likes to get on tv anyway he was up there and i told him i wanted to meet he came and you put him down and took his place what about the old man the laborer what did he do he was just in the wrong place zorrillo told me he was there when he came up through the floor on the last trip he wasnt supposed to be in that room but i guess he couldnt read the signs zorrillo said he couldnt take the chance hed tell someone about the tunnel whyd you dump him in the alley why didnt you just bury him out in joshua tree someplace hed never be found the desert wouldve been good but i didnt dump him bosch dont you see they were controlling me they brought him up here and dumped him there arpis did that night i get a call from zorrillo telling me to meet him at the egg and i he says park in the alley i did and there was the body i wasnt going to move the fucking thing i called it in you see it was one more way for him to keep his hold on me and i went along porter caught the case and i made a deal with him to take it slow bosch didnt say anything he was trying to envision the sequence moore had just described this is getting boring man you going to try to cuff me take me in be the hero why couldnt you let it go bosch asked what this place your father the whole thing you should have let the past go i was robbed of my life man he kicked us right out my motherhow do you let go of a past like that fuck you bosch you dont know bosch said nothing but he knew he was allowing this to go on too long moore was taking control of the situation when i heard he was dead it did something moore said i dont know i decided i wanted this place and i went to see my brother that was my mistake things started small but they never stopped soon i was running the show for him up there i had to get out from under it there was only one way it was the wrong way dont bother bosch i know the song bosch was sure moore had told the story the way he believed it but it was clear to bosch he had fully embraced the devil he had found out who he was why me bosch asked why you what why did you leave the file for me if you hadnt done that i wouldnt be here youd be in the clear bosch you were my backup you dont see i needed something in case the suicide play didnt work i figured youd get that file and take it from there i knew with just a little misdirection you would sound the alarm murder thing is i never thought youd get this far i thought irving and the rest of them would crush you because they wouldnt want to know what it was all about theyd just want the whole thing to die with me and porter yeah well porter was weak hes probably better off now anyway and me would i be better off if arpis had hit me with the bullet in the hotel room bosch you were getting too close had to take the shot harry had nothing more to say or ask moore seemed to sense that they were at a final point he tried one more time bosch in that bag i have account numbers theyre yours not interested moore were going back moore laughed at that notion do you really think anybody up there gives a rats ass about all of this bosch said nothing in the department moore said no fucking way they care they dont want to know about something like this bad for business man but see youyoure not in the department bosch youre in it but not of it see what im saying theres the problem theresyou take me back man and theyre gonna look at you as being just as bad as me because youll be pulling this wagon full of shit behind you i think youre the only one who cares about it bosch i really think you are so just take the money and go what about your wife you think she cares that stopped him for a few moments at least sylvia he said i dont know i lost her a long time ago i dont know if she cares about this or not i dont care anymore myself bosch watched him looking for the truth water under the bridge moore said so take the money i can get more to you later i cant take the money i think you know that yeah i guess i know that but i think you know i cant go back with you either so wheres that leave us bosch shifted his weight on to his left side the butt of the shotgun against his hip there was a long moment of silence during which he thought about himself and his own motives why hadnt he told moore to take the gun out of his pants and drop it in a smooth quick motion moore reached across his body with his right hand and pulled the gun out of his waistband he was bringing the barrel around toward bosch when harrys finger closed over the shotguns triggers the doublebarrel blast was deafening in the room moore took the brunt of it in the face through the smoke bosch saw his body jerk backward into the air his hands flew up toward the ceiling and he landed on the bed his handgun fired but it was a stray shot shattering one of the panes of the arched windows the gun dropped onto the floor pieces of blackened wadding from the shells floated down and landed in the blood of the faceless man there was a heavy smell of burned gunpowder on the air and bosch felt a slight mist on his face that he also knew by smell was blood he stood still for more than a minute then he looked over and saw himself in the mirror he quickly looked away he walked over to the bed and unzipped the duffel bag there were stacks and stacks of money inside it most of it in onehundreddollar bills there was also a wallet and passport he opened them and found they identified moore as henry maze age forty of pasadena there were two loose photos held in the passport the first was a polaroid that he guessed had come from the white bag it was a photo of moore and his wife in their early twenties they were sitting on a couch maybe at a party sylvia was not looking at the camera she was looking at him and bosch knew why he had chosen this photo to take the loving look on her face was beautiful the second photo was an old black and white with discoloration around the edges indicating it had come from a frame it showed cal moore and humberto zorrillo as boys they were playfully wrestling both shirtless and laughing their skin was bronze blemished only by the tattoos each boy had the saints and sinners tattoo on his arm he dropped the wallet and passport back into the duffel bag but put the two photos in his coat pocket he walked over to the window with the broken pane and looked out onto coyote trail and the lowlands leading to the border no police cars were coming no border patrol no one had even called for an ambulance the thick walls of the castle had held the sound of the man dying inside the sun was high in the sky and he could feel its warmth through the triangular opening in the broken glass bosch did not begin to feel whole again until he reached the smogged outskirts of la he was back in the nastiness again but he knew that it was here that he would heal he skirted downtown on the freeway and headed up through cahuenga pass midday traffic was light looking up at the hills he saw the charred path of the christmasnight fire but he even took some comfort in that he knew that the heat of the fire would have cracked open the seeds of the wildflowers and by spring the hillside would be a riot of colors the chaparral would follow and soon there would be no scar on the land at all it was after one he was going to be too late for moores funeral mass at the san fernando mission so he drove through the valley to the cemetery the burial of calexico moore killed in the line of duty was to be at eternal valley in chatsworth the police chief the mayor and the media presiding bosch smiled as he drove we gather here to honor and bury a drug dealer he got there before the motorcade but the media were already set up on a bluff near the entrance road men in black suits white shirts and black ties with funeral bands around their left arms were in the cemetery drive and signaled him to a parking area he sat in the car using the rearview mirror to put on a tie he was unshaven and looked crumpled but didnt care the plot was near a stand of oak trees one of the armbands had pointed the way harry walked across the lawn stepping around plots the wind blowing his hair in all directions he took a position a good distance away from the green funeral canopy and accompanying bank of flowers and leaned against one of the trees he smoked a cigarette while he watched cars start to arrive a few had beaten the procession but then he heard the approaching sound of the helicoptersthe police air unit that flew above the hearse and the media choppers that started circling the cemetery like flies then the first motorcycles cut through the cemetery gate and bosch watched as the tv cameras on the bluff followed the long line in there must have been two hundred cycles bosch guessed the best day to run a red light break the speed limit or make an illegal uturn in the city was on a cops funeral day nobody was left minding the store the hearse and attendant limousine followed the cycles then came the rest of the cars and pretty soon people were parking all over the place and walking across the cemetery from all directions toward the plot bosch watched one of the armbands help sylvia moore out of the limo she had been riding alone though he was maybe fifty yards away harry could tell she looked lovely she wore a simple black dress and the wind gusted hard against it pressing the material against her and showing her figure she had to hold a black barrette in place in her hair she wore black gloves and black sunglasses red lipstick he couldnt take his eyes off her the armband led her to a row of folding chairs beneath the canopy and alongside the hole that had been expertly dug into the earth along the way her head turned slightly and bosch believed she was looking at him but was not sure because the glasses hid her eyes and her face showed no sign after she was seated the pallbearers composed of rickard the rest of moores narcotics unit and a few others bosch didnt know brought the grayishsilver steel casket so you made it back a voice said from behind bosch turned to see teresa corazón walking up behind him yeah just got in you could use a shave and a few other things hows it going teresa never better good to hear what happened this morning after we talked about what you expected we pulled doj prints on moore and compared them to what irving had given us no match two different people that isnt moore in the silver bullet over there bosch nodded of course by now he didnt need her confirmation he had his own he thought of moores faceless body lying on the bed what are you going to do with it he asked ive already done it what i had a little discussion with assistant chief irving before the funeral mass wish you could have seen his face but he didnt stop the funeral hes playing the percentages i guess chances are moore if he knows whats good for him wont ever show up again so he is hoping that all it costs him is a recommendation on the medical examiners office he volunteered to do it i didnt even have to explain his position to him i hope you enjoy the job teresa youre in the belly of the beast now i will harry and thanks for calling me this morning does he know how you came up with all of this did you tell him i called no but im not sure i had to she was right irving would know bosch was in the middle of this somehow he looked past teresa to look at sylvia again she was sitting quietly the chairs on either side of her empty no one was going to come near her im going over to the group teresa said i told dick ebart i would meet him here he wants to set up a date to call for the commissions full vote bosch nodded ebart was a county commissioner of twentyfive years in office and closing in on seventy years old he was her informal sponsor for the job harry i still want to keep things on just a professional basis i appreciate what you did for me today but i want to keep things at a distance for a while at least he nodded and watched her walk toward the gathering her footing unsteady in high heels on the cemetery turf for a moment bosch envisioned her in a carnal coupling with the aged commissioner whose photos in the newspaper were most notable because of his drooping crepepaper neck he was repulsed by the image and by himself for imagining it he blanked it out of his mind and watched teresa mingling in the crowd shaking hands and becoming the politician she would now have to be he felt a sense of sadness for her the service was a few minutes away and people were still arriving in the crowd he picked up the gleaming head of assistant chief irvin irving he was in full uniform carrying his hat under his arm he was standing with the chief of police and one of the mayors front men the mayor was apparently late as usual irving then saw bosch broke away and started walking toward him he seemed to be taking in the vista of the mountains as he walked he didnt look at bosch until he was next to him under the oak tree detective chief when did you get in just now could use a shave yeah i know so what do we do what do we do the way he said it was almost wistful and bosch didnt know whether irving wanted an answer from him or not you know detective yesterday when you did not come to my office as ordered i opened a onepointeightyone on you i figured you would chief am i suspended no action taken at the moment im a fair man i wanted to speak with you first you spoke with the acting chief medical examiner this morning bosch wasnt going to lie to him he thought this time he held all of the high cards yes i wanted her to compare some fingerprints what happened down there in mexico to make you want to do that nothing i care to talk about chief im sure it will all be on the news im not talking about that illfated raid undertaken by the dea i am talking about moore bosch i need to know if i need to walk over there and stop this funeral bosch watched a blue vein pop high on irvings shaven skull it pulsed and then died i cant help you there chief its not my call weve got company irving turned around to look back toward the gathering lieutenant harvey pounds also in dress uniform was walking toward them probably wanting to find out how many cases he could close from boschs investigation but irving held up a hand like a traffic cop and pounds abruptly stopped turned and walked away the point i am trying to make with you detective bosch is that it appears we are about to bury and eulogize a mexican drug lord while a corrupt police officer is running around loose do you have any idea what embarrassdamn it i cant believe i just spoke those words out loud i cannot believe i spoke those words to you dont trust me much do you chief in matters like these i do not trust anyone well dont worry about it i am not worried about who i can and cannot trust i mean about burying a drug lord while a corrupt cop is running around loose dont worry about it irving studied him his eyes narrowing as if he might be able to peer through boschs own eyes into his thoughts are you kidding me dont worry about it this is a potential embarrassment to this city and this department of unimaginable proportions this could look man i am telling you to forget about it understand i am trying to help you out here irving studied him again for a long moment he shifted his weight to the other foot the vein on his scalp pulsed with new life bosch knew it would not sit well with him to have someone like harry bosch keeping such a secret teresa corazón he could deal with because they both played on the same field but bosch was different harry rather enjoyed the moment though the long silence was getting old i checked with the dea on that fiasco down there they said this man they believe to be zorrillo escaped they dont know where he is it was a halfassed effort to get bosch to open up it didnt work they never will know irving said nothing to this but bosch knew better than to interrupt his silence he was working up to something harry let him work watching as the assistant chiefs massive jaw muscles bunched into hard pads bosch i want to know right now if there is a problem on this even a potential problem because i have to know in the next three minutes whether to walk over there in front of the chief and the mayor and all of those cameras and put a stop to this whats the dea doing now what can they do they are watching the airports contacting local authorities putting his photo and description out there is not a lot they can do he is gone at least they say i want to know if he is going to stay gone bosch nodded and said theyre never going to find the man they are looking for chief convince me bosch cant do that and why not trust goes two ways so does the lack of trust irving seemed to consider this and bosch thought he saw an almost imperceptible nod bosch said the man they are looking for who they believe to be zorrillo is in the wind and he isnt coming back thats all you need to know bosch thought of the body on the bed at castillo de los ojos the face was already gone another two weeks and the flesh would go no fingerprints no identification other than the bogus credentials in the wallet the tattoo would stay intact for a while but there were plenty who had that tattoo including the fugitive zorrillo he had left the money there too an added precaution enough there maybe to convince the first finder not to bother calling the authorities just take the money and run using a handkerchief he had wiped the shotgun of his prints and left it he locked the house wrapped the chain through the black bars of the gate and closed the hasp on the lock careful to wipe each surface then he had headed home to la the dea are they putting a nice spin on things yet he asked irving theyre working on it irving said i am told the smuggling network has been closed down they have ascertained that the drug called black ice was manufactured on the ranch taken through tunnels to two nearby businesses then moved across the border the shipment would make a detour probably in calexico where it would be removed and the delivery van would go on both businesses have been seized one of them a contractor with the state to provide sterile medflies will probably prove embarrassing envirobreed yes by tomorrow they will finish comparisons between the bills of lading shown by drivers at the border and the receipt of cargo records at the eradication center here in los angeles i am told these documents were altered or forged in other words more sealed boxes passed through the border than were received at the center inside help most likely the onsite inspector for the usda was either dumb or corrupt i dont know which is worse irving brushed some imaginary impurity off the shoulder of his uniform it could not be hair or dandruff since he had neither he turned away from bosch to face the coffin and the thick gathering of officers around it the ceremony was about to begin he squared his shoulders and without turning back he said i dont know what to think bosch i dont know whether you have me or not bosch didnt answer that would be one irving would have to worry about just remember irving said you have just as much to lose as the department more the department can always come back always recover it might take a good long time but it always comes back the same cant be said for the individual who gets tarred with the brush of scandal bosch smiled in a sad way never leave a thing uncovered that was irving his parting shot was a threat a threat that if bosch ever used his knowledge against the department he too would go down irving would personally see to it are you afraid bosch asked afraid of what detective of everything of me yourself that it wont hold together that i might be wrong everything man arent you afraid of everything the only thing that i fear are people without a conscience who act without thinking their actions through i dont think you are like that bosch just shook his head so lets get down to it detective i have to rejoin the chief and i see the mayor has arrived what is it you want provided it is within my authority to provide i wouldnt take anything from you bosch said very quietly thats what you just dont seem to get irving finally turned around to face him again you are right bosch i really dont understand you why risk everything for nothing you see it raises my concerns about you all over again you dont play for the team you play for yourself bosch looked steadily at irving and didnt smile though he wanted to irving had paid him a fine compliment though the assistant chief would never realize it what happened down there had nothing to do with the department he said if i did anything at all i did it for somebody and something else irving stared back blankly his jaw flexing as he ground his teeth there was a crooked smile below the gleaming skull it was then that bosch recognized the similarity to the tattoos on the arms of moore and zorrillo the devils mask he watched as irvings eyes lit on something and he nodded knowingly he looked back at sylvia and then returned his gaze to bosch a noble man is that it all of this to insure a widows pension bosch didnt answer he wondered if it was a guess or irving knew something he couldnt tell how do you know she wasnt part of it irving said i know but how can you be sure how can you take the chance the same way youre sure the letter what about it bosch had done nothing but think about moore on his way back he had had four hours of driving on the open road to put it together he thought he had it moore wrote the letter himself he began he informed on himself you could say he had this plan the letter was the start he wrote it he stopped to light a cigarette irving didnt say a word he just waited for the story for reasons that i guess go back to when he was a boy moore fucked up he crossed and after he was already on the other side he realized there is no crossing back but he couldnt go on he had to get out somehow his plan was to start the iad investigation with that letter he put just enough in the letter so chastain would be convinced there was something to it but not enough that chastain would be able to find anything the letter would just serve to cloud his name put him under suspicion he had been in the department long enough to know how it would go hed seen the way iad and people like chastain operate the letter set the stage made the water murky enough so that when he turned up dead at the motel the department meaning you wouldnt want to look too closely at it youre an open book chief he knew youd move quickly and efficiently to protect the department first find out what really happened second so he sent the letter he used you chief he used me too irving turned toward the grave site the ceremony was about to begin he turned back to bosch go ahead detective quickly please layer after layer remember you told me he had rented that room for a month that was the first layer if he hadnt been discovered for a month decomp wouldve taken care of things there would have been no skin left to print that would leave only the latents he left in the room and hedve been home free but he was found a few weeks early irving helpfully interjected yeah that brings us to the second layer you moore had been a cop a long time he knew what you would do he knew youd go to personnel and grab his package thats a big gamble bosch you ask me it was a betterthaneven bet christmas night when i saw you there with the file i knew what it was before you said so i can see moore taking the gamble and switching the print cards like i said he was gambling it would never come to that anyway you were the second layer and you you were the third yeah the way i figure it he used me as a sort of last backup in case the suicide didnt wash he wanted somebody whod look at it and see a reason for moore to have been murdered that was me i did that he left the file for me and i went for it thought hed been killed over it it was all a deflection he just didnt want anybody looking too closely at who was actually on the tile floor in the motel he just wanted some time but you went too far bosch he never planned on that i guess not bosch thought about his meeting with moore in the tower he still hadnt decided whether moore had been expecting him even waiting for him waiting for harry to come kill him he didnt think hed ever know that was calexico moores last mystery time for what irving asked what you said he just wanted some time i think he wanted time to go down there take zorrillos place and then take the money and run i dont think he wanted to be the pope forever he just wanted to live in a castle again what its nothing they were silent a moment before bosch finished up most of this i know you already have chief i do yeah you do i think you figured it out after chastain told you that moore sent the letter himself and how did detective chastain know that he wasnt going to give bosch anything that was okay though harry found that telling the story helped clarify it it was like holding it up to inspect for holes after he got the letter chastain thought it was the wife who sent it he went to her house and she denied it he asked for her typewriter because he was going to make sure and she slammed the door in his face but she didnt do it before saying she didnt even have a typewriter so then after moore turns up dead chastain starts thinking about things and takes the machine out of moores office at the station my guess is he matched the keys to the letter from that point it wouldnt be difficult to figure out the letter came from either moore or somebody in the bang squad my guess is that chastain interviewed them this week and concluded they hadnt done it the letter was typed by moore irving didnt confirm any of it but didnt have to bosch knew it all fit moore had a good plan chief he played us like cheaters solitaire he knew every card in the deck before it was turned over except for one irving said you he didnt think youd come looking bosch didnt reply he looked over at sylvia again she was innocent and she would be safe he noticed irving turn his gaze on her too shes clear bosch said you know it i know it if you make trouble for her ill make trouble for you it wasnt a threat it was an offer a deal irving considered it a moment and nodded his head once a blunt agreement did you speak to him down there bosch harry knew he meant moore and he knew he couldnt answer what did you do down there after a few moments of silence irving turned and walked as upright as a nazi back to the rows of chairs holding the vips and top brass of the department he took a seat his adjutant had been saving in the row behind sylvia moore he never looked back at bosch once through the entire service bosch had watched her from his position next to the oak tree sylvia moore rarely raised her head even to watch the line of cadets fire blanks into the sky or when the air squad flew over the helicopters arranged in the missingman formation one time he thought she glanced over at him or at least in his direction but he couldnt be sure he thought of her as being stoic and he thought of her as being beautiful when it was over and the casket was in the hole and the people were moving away she stayed seated and bosch saw her wave away an offer from irving to be escorted back to the limousine the assistant chief sauntered off smoothing his collar against his neck finally when the area around the burial site was clear she stood up glanced once down into the hole and then started walking toward bosch her steps were punctuated by the slamming of car doors all across the cemetery she took the sunglasses off as she came you took my
