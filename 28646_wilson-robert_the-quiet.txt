robert s wilson the quiet for anyone whos ever been alone in that dark place the garage door rose slowly as james benton rushed to his car on the morning after the first darkness had passed once in the car and backing out he lit a cigarette he took note that it was one of those rare days when none of his neighbors appeared to be leaving at the same time he flipped his ashes outside the window as he pulled out of the cul de sac then he leaned over and turned on the radio the speakers crackled out white noise he changed the station and found that anywhere he moved the dial nothing came through but static he shut off the radio and muttered to himself wondering what would go wrong next with the old junker when he got to the main road at the entrance of the housing complex he stared in shock at the empty road for a moment he peeled out thinking it was one of those lucky times when he might be able to gun it the whole way and barely make it he crossed under and took the next right as he always did this road was always empty but as he pulled up to the light at state road with its large grocery store many restaurants and other businesses he started to wonder what was going on had he forgotten a holiday he looked at the calendar on his phone as he stopped september he looked back up at the road ahead of him to his right the exit would take him over the bridge hed just crossed underneath even on christmas day some traffic had existed he didnt have time for curiosity and he needed to get to work so he zoomed out onto the empty road he took the west exit looking out for oncoming cars there were none after a moment he saw a car up the hill there he told himself theres nothing weird going on youre just fucking crazy he tried the radio again as he came closer to the car much faster than he expected the radio crackled static as he reached the car he understood immediately the car sat still in the far left lane of the three lane highway with no one in it he looked in his rearview then still not a single car coming he couldnt see any up ahead either his chest tightened he thought about turning back and going home or maybe running off to his brother joels on the east side of town joel he pulled out his cell phone again and quickly scrolled to his brothers name in the contact list and hit send as the fourth ring sounded he saw something moving up ahead beyond the bridge for mann road smoke rose way off in the distance it became clearer as he came around the curve of the highway thick black smoke fought its way up into the atmosphere from something on the ground joels voicemail answered and james closed his phone the smoke came from the bright orange fire engulfing the west exit it must have originally been several cars but now just looked like a burning pile of twisted metal the flames rolled in great waves from within the pileup james found himself veering over to the left as far away from the flames as he could he let off the gas as he tried dialing the phone rang and rang as he came alongside the burning metal sculpture when hed passed the scene he found himself watching the fire roll up into smoke toward the sky in his rearview the sight mesmerized him the fire far behind him he realized the phone was still ringing so he closed it he saw more and more deserted cars as he came closer to his exit some just sat in the middle of the road some had veered off and some had piled into each other half of the latter were on fire he slowed down to exit but instead passed the sam jones expressway he was pretty sure the upsidedown crown victoria would be impossible to get around he continued down the road wondering what to do his eyes refocused from staring at a semi jackknifed into the east washington street exit with a ford explorer wedged underneath its trailer along all the exits and medians of different roads he hadnt seen a single blade of grass where the grass should have been lay rich brown soil he shrugged it aside as simple landscaping at first but now that he came to the sixth or seventh exit he knew it had to be something else he stopped the car and got out after turning off the engine he noticed the piercing silence as he stepped out the air tasted stale he leaned on the concrete railing of the bridge that stood over washington street for a long time other than the distant sounds of factories he heard nothing no cars airplanes people not even birds he looked down at the road below him leaning over the concrete slab to see under the bridge at the edge of the road lay the only thing to be seen shy of road dirt and concrete a single battered doll with one large black eye one empty gash where the other eye should be and curly red hair lay in the earth looking up at him a cool wind fluttered over and he shivered he got back in the car and sped on to the next exit street finding it void of any wreckage going up the ramp he saw nothing different from anywhere else he could see a few cars abandoned randomly off in the distance everywhere grass should be bare land replaced it and then he saw the tree james slammed on the brakes his tires screeching against the pavement the tree stood lonely towering over a grassless landscape the roots showed visibly where they entered the ground it was an unnatural sight making the tree appear naked in some way james put the car back into drive and went over the median making a uturn toward the exit for going the other way once he rolled back onto the highway he began to speed he had a few things he needed to check before he ventured east to joels house this time as he pulled back into the housing edition hed lived in for the past seven years james took notice of the lifeless quiet that had escaped his notice earlier that morning it seemed as if the life had been sucked from the place figuratively and literally not a sound or glimpse of movement caught his attention as he crept down the road his head hung out the window listening and looking around for some sign of something anything alive then it clicked he couldnt remember seeing or hearing anything alive except the tree the tree looked just as alive and healthy as him but only one he looked through the bare dirt yards for another tree he passed his own road continuing the search until after an hour or so hed combed the entire complex with nothing to show for it when he got back home he drug himself out of his car feeling bleak and confused he went straight into the kitchen and turned on the water then he wet his hands splashed the water over his face and ran it through his hair he tried to clear his mind stretching his back his eyes closed and his head back he let a drop of water touch his tongue it tasted stale no it tasted beyond stale he knelt down and took a gulp straight from the source it tasted purer than any bottled water hed ever drank usually his water tasted so vile you could barely drink it it had an odor so strong he found himself taking shorter and shorter showers over the years he leaned down in front of the powered stream and took a long sniff no scent at all a thought occurred to him striking him dumb leaving the water on he ran up the stairs to the loft as soon as he was on the second floor he found himself leaning over the banister completely out of breath when his lungs didnt feel full of razor blades he walked underneath the entrance to the attic gripping the chord that hung from the door he pulled it bringing the door down and revealing the enclosed ladder he experimented with putting his weight on the decrepit ladder it seemed to still hold him he went up reaching blindly for the string hanging from the overhead light bulb when he felt it he tugged lighting up the messy attic the light cast an eerie yellowish hue on the room he knew exactly where to look for the old microscope he hadnt used it since college but he used it enough then to make up for the many years since he took a deep breath and blew the top layer of dust from the top of the box the word olympus appeared in bright orange letters the sight made james smile with nostalgia he was back in his kitchen minutes later with the dusty old microscope set up on the counter he cleaned off its lenses and several slides then he turned the water down until it merely dripped putting the first slide under he collected one good drop then carefully put it in the microscope pulling a small bottle from his pocket he took a second slide opening the bottle he let a drop of the murky liquid inside drop onto the slide he set that one next to the other on the third he lightly spit and slid it into place with the other two he focused in on the first slide it was more transparent than the glass itself he couldnt see a single living organism next he looked at the murky water gathered from the neighborhood pond behind the housing edition aside from murky clouds of soil he saw no evidence of anything that was or had ever been alive the third one interested him the most he expected to see what the other two lacked but found nothing more than thick slimy liquid along with traces of mucus and remnants of food james didnt remember much from microbiology but one thing he did remember the human mouth flourishes with life but the slide with his saliva contained nothing alive at all nothing seemed different as james drove along the highway avoiding the empty cars and collisions the noise of the engine relieved him in place of the dreadful silence hed endured at home for several days now but even still an oppressing fear hung over him as he made his way toward his brothers house not a single person alive or dead appeared at any point who was he kidding hed seen no signs of life save for a tree and his own reflection checking the internet only added to the number of questions swirling in his head about half of the pages he attempted to load brought up nothing and those that did come up hadnt been updated since before everyone disappeared even the roar of the cars engine wasnt distracting enough from the desolation that surrounded him at first he was only nervous he told himself whatever happened was probably localized to the south side of town but as he made his way around the circular highway northeastward his nerves frayed toward panic the pileup along the south exit had really jarred him hed never seen so much carnage hundreds of cars smashed together more than half of them on fire and smoking profusely the heat through the closed window came through in waves even from the far side of the highway the horizon above blurred in and out of focus from the flames but still he saw no bodies not a single one the city streets werent much different on the east side of town those not desolate contained wayward cars and the remains of several explosions one major thing was different here though house fires a lot of them littered the area from what james could tell it looked like some of them had spread from one house to another it was everything he could do to keep from breaking down as he watched the smoke roll up from those houses for terrifying minutes he imagined finding his brothers house burned to the ground joels body the first one for james to find but relief came when he turned down hopkins road and the entire street looked completely unscathed save for the lack of anything green or growing joels red corsica sat in the driveway as james pulled up to the curb he killed the engine and sat there for a long moment studying the house the shades were drawn and the door was closed looking around he didnt see a single house with an empty driveway or any other signs of normal activity it appeared just like his neighborhood just as deathly still after a few deep breaths and a long hard swallow james pulled the keys from the ignition and got out of the car he walked with short strides through the dirt yard taking his time and examining the soil with his shoes with the front step of the porch just a stride away he stopped still and gazed into the front window he could make out the outline of the dining room table and various ceramic decorations cheryl his sisterinlaw had put up he kicked the dirt off his shoes and started up the porch toward the door holding his keychain up in front of his face he stared at it unable to find the key he knew it was there but he just couldnt find it then he snapped himself out of it pulled aside the proper key and used it to unlock the door the door creaked and moaned as he opened it sebastian the familys golden retriever who usually attacked james by throwing his front paws onto jamess chest and smothering him in doggy kisses was nowhere to be seen james called out as he stepped around the dark blue recliner joel cheryl sebastian here boy he headed for the table hed seen in the window looking to the right into the kitchen he saw no one there on the floor he found sebastians food and water bowls both partially empty hed started for the bedroom when he heard a low pitched boom from outside of the house it went on for a moment until finally it rattled the walls and all of the nickknacks for several seconds and then faded away even though james knew the sound had probably been a distant explosion it still made him jump when he heard it he entered the hallway on the right side the guest room door stood ajar while on the left joel and cheryls bedroom door remained closed straight ahead james saw the wide open bathroom door james tried the guest room first looking for any sign of sebastian somewhere in the back of his mind he knew he was stalling but it helped him deal with his fear so he went along with it under the guest bed he saw a sparkle of shiny metal he tapped the object with his foot so that it rolled out from under the bed it was a collar that said sebastian on it he told himself it couldve just been an old collar after confirming the guest room was empty he went to the bathroom flipped on the light and looked in the mirror he turned on the water and ran it over his hands then he ran his hands over his face and through his hair and took a deep breath he dreaded what he would find in that room and didnt want to look anymore if they were gone he wondered if he could convince himself they were merely somewhere else worse yet what if they were in there frozen stiff the different possibilities terrorized him he couldnt take it anymore with tears streaming down his face he burst through the bathroom and flung the bedroom door open joels glasses and two cell phones sat on the nightstand one of them flashing james walked over to them and picked up the flashing one joels he flipped through the menu until he found the recent calls list his own number and no other filled the missed call log james stood alone in the room the blanket lay ruffled on the bed as if whatever it covered had simply dissipated james walked around to the other side of the bed a crunching sound from under his shoe startled him he bent down to take a look little pieces of curved pink plastic lay on the ground some of them shattered from his footfall he picked up the pieces and then flung them when he realized what they were fingernails he gagged for a moment having to grip the dresser to keep from falling over then he realized as he took a deep breath what hed not gathered at first they were fingernails all right but not real fingernails they were presson nails although he lost some of the queasiness james didnt feel any relief from this revelation he gripped the blanket and standing up flung it from the bed on the other side of the bed a long thin dark rod with an adjacent screw at each end lay a third of the way up from the foot of the bed the nausea came back ten fold and james vomited onto the gray carpeted floor he was sure the rod had been in his brothers femur before joels body disappeared standing outside of joels shed in the backyard james stood smoking a cigarette his body convulsing his face red and full of tears he couldnt understand why he kept smoking but still couldnt bring himself to put the cigarette out he moaned in a miserable high pitch as he leaned into the front of the shed weeping when the cigarette ran its course and burnt his hand james threw the butt on the ground and went into the shed when he found joels gas can it was empty kneeling on one knee he chucked it aside and wiped his face it had been worth a try but now he would have to figure out how to get gas from a gas station if he was going to have enough fuel to get wherever he was going as he walked back to his car he thought for a long moment about taking the corsica joel obviously wouldnt be using it but he knew that would only remind him of his loss he got in his car started it and sped off paying little attention to where the road took him he drove around aimlessly for a long time just taking inventory of his surroundings eventually he came to a trashy little gas station the only one that wasnt crowded with cars and hadnt exploded he pulled the car into position beside one of the pumps without even thinking about it he got out and swiped his card in the pumps card machine the small screen said approved and the machine beeped at him he pulled out the nozzle and pumped gas into the car once the tank was full he replaced the nozzle back in its holder and tightened the gas cap back in place at some point james wasnt really sure exactly when hed subconsciously decided he would head west until well until he found something someone and if he found nothing then he would just keep going until he couldnt go any further when he got on the ramp for west he slammed on the gas swerving to avoid random collided and burning cars by the time the skyscrapers of downtown towered to his right he was reaching mph it didnt feel good exactly but it relieved him a little somehow to drive so recklessly but as he neared the west side of town he quickly cut his speed the amount of cars and pileups were staggering the highway ahead of him looked like a warzone with dozens of smoke plumes racing each other for the highest point in the sky as he swerved around a couple of overturned cars something occurred to james compared to typical daytime weekday traffic very few cars covered the road then he remembered how many cars still sat in driveways just about everywhere he had been every house in his housing edition had garages but most of them probably housed automobiles the only time so little traffic came out was in the dead of predawn before the first daily traffic rush it must have happened all at once and likely in the middle of the night out of habit he looked at the time on his cell phone pm he passed the indianapolis airport on his right nothing stirred there at all he usually saw planes either landing or taking off constantly as he drove by he had been worried that once the highway slimmed down to two lanes he would encounter more trouble with stray cars but he found that not to be the case as he came farther and farther from the city he saw less cars and accidents the oncelush fields now stripped of everything but dirt appeared out of place under the clear blue horizon james flipped on the radio as he passed the exit for state road a high pitched squealing mixed with static shot from the speakers he moved the dial up and down the frequency band various other pitches of screeching and static snipped in and out as he did this he flipped it back off and tried to focus on the road ahead across the median the occasional car sat waiting for the end of the world or had it already happened he found himself getting drowsy from the monotony his eyelids drooped heavily when out of the corner of his barelyopen eyes he saw a car zoom past on the eastbound side of the highway he slammed on his brakes and began to swerve the car tires screeching like a banshee as the car itself started leaning when he regained control james blasted over the median onto the eastbound side and sped after the car he had just seen james held his foot all the way down on the gas pedal the car looked like a dot in the distance whoever was driving was in a hurry that much he could tell he felt equal parts relief and fear to know he had found someone else the dot gradually became a slightly larger blur he could make out its red color now whatever it was it looked boxy very european like as he came closer he recognized it to be an old volkswagen van with two things tied down to the top off it that he couldnt quite make out a moment more of holding the gas pedal down and he could see they were surf boards one bright yellow and the other a dull purple when he got close enough that he could read the license plate he saw the face of the woman driving the van she looked back at him in a panic he had thought that anyone he might find would be just as happy as him to see another human being but here he had found one and she was running away they were in the middle lane of the now three lane highway as they passed beside the indianapolis airport the lady took another look at james and then swerved to the right just in time to get on the south exit before he could follow suit unconcerned with traffic as there was none moving he slammed on the brakes squealing tires louder than he could remember then he slammed the car into reverse back into drive and spun around toward the exit when he got onto south he slammed the pedal down and drove for some time no moving vehicles in sight when he got to state road he took the exit and turned back the way he came from he drove back to where hed entered the highway finding no sign of the van he pulled off to the side of the road put the car in park killed the engine and sat there staring into the distance for a few minutes hed missed his chance he was sure of it after some time sitting and feeling sorry for himself james started the car up and drove back to i he pulled onto the ramp and headed west the sun was setting up ahead and he tried to block out the worry in the back of his mind he couldnt stop wondering what it would be like in this desolate new world at night the thought gave him goose bumps and he tried to bury it in his mind he focused on the brilliant hues of gold and lavender the farther away he got from the city the more pitch black outside it became but the clear skies littered with stars were a wonder to james hed forgotten how magical the sight was he had decided to spend the night driving and sleep during the day in order to quell his fears just the thought of closing his eyes in the dark produced images of something animated and out of focus grabbing hold of his shoulder he shuddered a strong wind had been pushing on the car for some time now and it was unnerving to think that all there was consisted of him one other person some trees here and there strong winds and the leftover waste of a civilization he tried to remind himself he still didnt know for sure how far the effects of whatever had happened extended to maintaining a steady miles an hour james watched the dotted lines of the highway blur past in single file hed been driving for three hours and by the clock on his radio it was now pm his headlights reflected off a familiar green sign it was the state road exit for terre haute and riley he checked his gas gauge less than a quarter of a tank he decided he would be better off getting gas somewhere he knew rather than trying somewhere completely unfamiliar to him so he swerved and took the exit he almost couldnt make it due to the semi jackknifed into the curve of the ramp but he managed to get around by driving over the curb on the left side of the ramp he took a right on and swerved another right into the pilot station there were cars pulled up to most of the pumps he found one he could pull up to without having to parallel park and killed the engine the inside of the gas station was well lit and just as empty as everything else he tried his card again and this time the machine produced an error on the screen he sighed and looked at the ominous building he walked up to the main front door and pulled it open inside the place looked as though it were any other day except there were no other people at all against the back wall a single glass door hung open as if a ghost were browsing for a drink for the first time since he woke that morning james began to feel a deep growling in his stomach as he looked at the plastic packaged snacks covering the aisles even the pork rinds looked good he went behind the counter and scrambled around until he found the plastic bags he pulled several out and started filling the bags with a variety of unhealthy snacks then he went back behind the counter and tried to figure out the controls to turn on the gas for pump seemingly by accident he hit the right button and the machine beeped at him when he came back to the car his arms were full between the bags of snacks the two packs of cola the case of beer and the large gas can hed taken from the store he put all the food and drinks in the passenger seat and started filling the gas tank then he filled the can he opened the air hole on the gas can and wedged it in the trunk between a tall stack of old waterlogged magazines and a spare tire he closed the trunk and stood watching inside the empty gas station his hands still sitting on the car a gust of wind blew at him it was strong enough that he had to grab hold of the car to keep upright he looked at the sky above the building faint stars were blurred by the bright light of the gas station in the distant sky beyond the lights of the city he could see something dark obscuring some of the stars probably just a thundercloud he thought once he was back on the highway headed west again he looked in the rearview mirror to see the darkness spreading he hadnt seen any lightning yet but he was sure it would come several minutes later he crossed the illinois state line he cracked open a bag of doritos and loudly crunched on a handful of chips a moment of anxiety came when he realized the electricity in affected places wouldnt last much longer hed seen once on a documentary show that electric plants will eventually need maintenance and without people will shut themselves down as a safety precaution two bags of chips and an apple pie later james was nearing the i junction he still hadnt seen any lightning a while later he found the lines on the road starting to blur in the fuzzy warmth of the car heater he woke up swerving toward the right edge of the highway time for a wake up call he thought he popped open one of the energy drinks and chugged the whole thing down in one gulp belching loudly he crumpled the can and threw it over his shoulder he couldnt help giggling afterwards slaphappy time he thought he turned on the radio hoping the noise would keep him awake static he hit the seek button the first station it went to was a highpitched offtheair tone next a higherpitched static the one after that he hadnt been prepared for strange guttural almost angry sounding noises filled his speakers nearly stopping his heart they werent voices at least he didnt think they were but they certainly werent any kind of natural radio interference either after a while of listening he realized he was holding his breath and had slowed down to mph he stopped the car put it in park and continued listening the sound reminded him of growling if metal could growl he sat listening trying to make sense of the various deep pitches and rhythms then his cell phone rang the air swelled as if static electricity were rising all around him he looked at his caller id message on the outside of the flip phone the screen filled with strange characters after the third ring he opened it and before he could put it to his ear an incredibly loud and highpitched feedback pierced through his brain causing him to drop the phone and hold both ears with his hands several bright flashes lit the world outside with blinding light his skin prickled all over he was sure whatever was happening was the same thing that made everything else disappear whats happening to me he screamed in chorus with the deafening feedback grabbing the cell phone james clamped it shut with a loud clack and tossed it to the floorboard that horrible grumbling from the car radio faded back into his hearing the flashes and the physical sensations continued he hadnt even noticed he was hyperventilating he gripped the steering wheel tightly and put all his concentration into catching his own breath looking up another flash occurred and he could see the darkness had spread far enough that it was visible above him through the windshield it certainly wasnt cloud cover he forced himself to action he started the car and slammed on the gas squealing tires as he sped forward he tried to reconcile what he saw with the same reason that failed to shed light on all he had seen since waking up that morning the darkness wasnt clouds it didnt even look like gas it was something solid yet translucent reflective and looking all around out the windows through the flashes james could see that it covered most of the sky it was heading west covering the eastern horizon as far south and north as james could see he was gaining on mph but the darkness was moving faster and those flashes he could barely see between them and the phantom glow they left behind in his vision each time they started there was that awful crispiness all over his skin it was becoming clear to him as the darkness spread further toward the western horizon that driving even driving west would get him nowhere he found an exit not caring where it was and sped through the offramp the thought of the volkswagen came to mind as he pulled onto a road that probably wouldve been just as desolate before recent events he wondered if the lady driving that van had managed to survive he wondered if he was safe remembering that he had found someone brought him hope maybe there were more people like him still alive after a while of driving the straight two lane country road for a long time seeing nothing more than fields and farmhouses through the bright flashes james looked at his car radio the digital display kept alternating between and the strange symbols just like on his phone if his hunch was correct it was showing the correct time he knew then whatever was covering the sky was blocking the sun he swallowed as he feared the worst what if it never went away tears streamed down his face all he could think about was joel he drove on weeping in the eerie light of the flashes james woke lying in the front seat of the car his legs draped over the back of the seat sunlight came through the windshield above him he sat up and looked outside the darkness was gone no flashing no prickly sensation james had parked the car in an otherwise empty parking lot in front of a small town store he vaguely remembered finding it exhausted and unable to keep his body awake even then the darkness was everywhere and the flashes went on still he wondered what time it was the led on the car radio was dead it took him a while to find his cell phone when reaching down into the pile of trash on the floorboard he felt its familiar smooth plastic shell he plucked it from the mess it was warm to the touch smoke puffed up from behind the blank screen when he opened it he let out a sigh and tossed it back down james stepped out of the car the rubber soles of his shoes slapping onto the warm pavement it was the kind of morning when you woke up to the sound of birds and running cars but now the silence seemed to go on forever james couldnt stop staring at the surreal silverlined clouds swiftly moving through blue currents of sky he closed the door of the car and it echoed back from the store looking around at the empty parking spaces he wondered why there werent any cars then it dawned on him it must have happened in the middle of the night small town stores werent known for hour service he reached into his pocket and pulled out his smooshed pack of cigarettes and opened it to find nothing inside but a pinch of tobacco at the bottom a sort of rage overcame him he flung the empty cigarette pack onto the ground like a madman and stomped on it half yelling half muttering he wasnt angry that he was out of cigarettes he was sure he would find a way into the store and the signs of various cigarette brands with their prices listed assured him the store carried his favorite and many others james went around to the back of the car and opened the trunk he knew his tools were buried inside somewhere he pulled out the gas can and set it on the blacktop then he started digging through the layers of clothes and papers that had accumulated over the years the cool feel of steel shocked the tips of his fingers as he dug several layers deep into the mess pushing his hand in with more confidence he gripped his fingers around the tool and felt its handles grainy texture ratchet good enough he thought it took some tugging and twisting but he pulled the ratchet free closing the trunk he took a deep breath looking at the doors and windows of the store he put the ratchet in his back pocket and racewalked to the automaticsliding front doors obviously locked they stood completely still as james approached he pressed up against the glass and raised up on his toes looking down so he could try and make out the workings of the lock it was a small gray dead bolt that matched its surrounding doors if he busted the glass close enough and made a big enough hole he might be able to reach in and unlock it he took a step back reached around his side and pulled out the ratchet he lifted it above his head and aimed for a spot just above the corner of the glass next to the dead bolt he took a breath counted to three in his head and swung down with all his strength the ratchet slammed into the glass with a hollow clang jolting and vibrating his arm while utterly failing to even scratch the glass he let out a loud yelp from the pain all right you son of a bitch you got that one but this next one is all mine he swung the ratchet again harder this time and the window bit back equally hard the glass reflected the furious look on jamess face in untarnished clarity he bellowed a battle cry and started slamming the ratchet into the glass over and over letting it hit wherever it happened to land the thick glass seemed impenetrable but james was in a fury now beating into the glass harder the more it mocked him with its flawless surface his screaming had risen to a fevered pitch when the blast of a rifle abruptly interrupted him james dropped the ratchet and put his hands in the air as the metal tool jittered against the concrete he slowly turned around his knees buckling as he went a large man in worn overalls stood at the far end of the parking lot in his hands he clutched a shotgun at an angle pointing towards the sky even at that distance james could see the smoke floating from the barrel you best get the hell away from that there store son the mans voice rose in the air and then ricocheted off the wall behind james im not alone he thought he had been longing to find someone for so long he almost didnt recognize the mans intimidating tone i just want some food and water sir maybe some cigarettes if its not too much to ask i have to say its so nice to see someone else alive he could hear his own small voice echo across the lot with a short delay the man gave no reply james moved forward carefully being sure to keep his hands up high the man seemed to stiffen james froze im unarmed i just want to meet you sir the man lowered his shotgun in jamess direction youll stay right there if you know whats good for ya james closed his eyes and swallowed he was about to open them when he heard movement from behind him before he could turn to see what it was two men grabbed him one was dressed in brown overalls his dark hair greased back the other wore a white polo and khaki shorts the sun gleaming off his bald head the man with the shotgun was jogging toward them his shotgun saddled behind him shook with the muscular motion of his body as he ran james could feel the cold sharp stinging pressure of handcuffs being slapped onto his wrists were not taking any chances mister you understand right a young voice asked behind james then he heard the unmistakable sound of pulling duct tape he tried to get away but managed only a squirm as the cool sticky pressure of the threaded tape enclosed his mouth james groaned in reply the jolt of what was happening severed his only remaining nerve since the shotgun blast the men pulled him toward the store as the man with the shotgun arrived just in time to open the sliding door now that james could see him closer the man with the shotgun looked easily well into his s if not just over but he was in better shape than james could ever hope to be the mans hair was a shiny silver greased back in the same style as the other man in overalls james noticed both mens noses sat flat and wide on their faces and both had high foreheads sheltering emerald green eyes if they werent father and son they were definitely related he thought once in the store it was apparent the pair knew their way around the place and the odd man out did not the eldest went straight to instructing the other two jimmy did ya clear out the storage room and set up the camera like i asked ya uhhuh good take our stranger here and lock im up in there but give im some water and some o these he said pointing to the beef jerky rack yes sir and barger stand watch at the door in the meantime ill go warn the others and get back as soon as i can yes mr flannigan mr flannigan turned to leave and then paused shuffling back around oh i almost forgot once hes in the storage room and before ya get is food dont forget to flip on that camera well need to keep an eye on im a couple o days both of the younger men nodded dragging james past the canned vegetable aisle the man with the shotgun ran barefoot through the sliding doors the smell of something rotten filled jamess nose as they pulled him past the produce being carried from behind he got a good view of the store and the way they were taking him there was a flapping sound and then a bump and a change in the texture of the floor below his scraping heels two tall white floppy doors with small circular plastic windows seemed to just miss smacking back into him as they dragged him into the stocking area of the store it was cold and dark compared to the rest of the store after a few twists and turns around corners and stacked pallets of shrinkwrapped boxes his captors came to a stop and whispered amongst themselves he heard metal clicking a familiar squeal then they were pulling him into the storage room james tried to struggle grappling onto the doorjamb with the back of his left shoulder he almost got loose from the men when a burst of sharp solid pain shot through the right side of his head and then a plunging darkness overcame him when he woke james found himself lying on a cot inside the small storage room his head sitting against a pile of cotton ball packages his hands were no longer cuffed but his head was swimming in misery in the middle of the floor sat a minifridge its cable plugged into the wall behind it james opened it and found several bottles of water and a wrapped up sandwich he couldnt identify pieces of jerky and cheese sticks were scattered on top of the tiny fridge looking up james could see that all the shelves in the room were cleaned out as the younger man had said and in the corner above the crudely painted blue door hed come in through sat mounted a security camera pointed down at him sure they were watching james gave the camera the bird and opened a bottle of water taking a long swig eager to have something with meat james tore open the shrinkwrapped sandwich and smelled the distinct aroma of tuna salad his stomach growled he began gnawing at the sandwich until there was nothing left and he was left licking the crumbs from his fingers it had to have been the best damn tuna salad sandwich he ever had but several minutes afterward when the pain in his head began to make him nauseous he thoroughly regretted eating it eventually his headache shrunk to a dull pulsing from time to time and his stomach continued balancing in that halfway point between nausea and heartburn he lay on the cot for a long time remembering the last time he had a shower as if it had been ages ago in some far off magical land now mostly forgotten in a way it had he twirled his finger around loose green canvas thread from the cot as he stared into the ceiling wondering what these men would do next he was sure they were scared of something but of what he had no clue he wanted to believe they werent capable of violence but the pain in his skull kept him in doubt and just what watching him in this room would prove to them baffled james more than any of it before long with nowhere to go and nothing to do he drifted off to sleep two yellow eyes peeked out from the darkness shimmering with internal light whatever they belonged to made only an impression of space a sense of detached scrutiny showed from them then came the metallic growling james had heard from his radio the eyes were coming closer and james could no longer keep still he took off running leaving the shimmering eyes behind him a voice whispered in his ear with an odd featureless accent clear a path in the desert make a straight road for the a loud clunk woke james from the vibration of the door and the sound of the padlock closing from outside he realized someone had been in the room sweat dripped down into his eye from his brow with a sting as he sat up getting rest had alleviated the pain in his head in the back of his mind he could still see those staring eyes a shiver ran down his spine as he tried to clear them from his thoughts opening the fridge he was not surprised to find another sandwich this time he was almost disappointed to find the fresh baked bread filled with salami ham and cheese until he took a bite these people at least had one thing going for them they could make good sandwiches it was so good he almost felt guilty for wanting strangle each and every one of them but he took solace in deciding he would give them a chance to listen to reason when he finished eating james got down to business his head clear of distraction and his claustrophobia coming to a peak he was ready to leave the tiny room and leave these people behind if they only wanted to cage him he tapped his palm against the door strong enough to get someones attention he heard whispering through the door but couldnt make it out what do you want came a voice from beyond the door james leaned closer to the crack in the door i just want some fresh air and to know why you guys locked me in here were not supposed to let you out until mr flannegan says just sit tight and as long as you check out everything will be fine barger said through the door james spent the rest of the day pacing and scanning the room for anything that might help him escape the next morning the testing began james woke to someone knocking on the door well what are you knocking for its not like i can let you in he said as he rubbed his eyes he heard a faint laugh from behind the door and then the sliding of paper from below and looked down to see an envelope under the door james slid his finger along the line of adhesive peeling the envelope open whatever was inside was more durable than paper yet pliable enough to bend he leaned the brown paper pouch so that its contents slid out he noticed a blur of rich glossy colors as the pictures fell from the envelope they were horrible he grimaced at each one as he put it in the back of the stack each picture depicted a person or several people who had apparently been brutally murdered not a single one had been merciful the more he looked at them from one to the next and so on the more he could see a pattern no gunshot wounds no stab wounds not a single hint of any weapon they all appeared to have been ripped apart he looked up at the camera bolted to the wall above the door hey what kind of sick shit is this hey can you people hear me then he looked down at the last picture it was just like the rest except in the far corner of the picture a hand lay palm facing the floor nails gripping at the crack between tiles just below the golden wristwatch torn flesh and bone bordered between the hand and a black puddle of blood something just inside his peripheral vision was trying to get his attention he let his eyes stare at the picture until it blurred into fuzzy colors the cracks in the linoleum tiles blurred as his vision obscured they started to line up with something then it was clear the lines intersected completely with the tiles on the floor in front of him they had the same pattern the exact same pattern just beyond the reach of the severed hand in the picture were the blurry blue sides of the shelf that sat against the wall right in front of james realizing this his heart jumped in his chest and he had to sit down james was sure he was going to be the next person to be photographed his limbs were stiff and his resolve was diminishing he needed to try and escape but he couldnt find the strength to even move he felt the pictures slip from his hand as he leaned back against the wall the padlock outside the door clicked and the door swung open james clung to the cot and raised his arms to protect himself from whatever would come next mr flannigan stood in the doorway he entered the room and leaned down as though james were a wild animal he was trying to calm its okay mr benton were not gonna hurt ya we had to be sure ya werent one o them mr flannigan reached out to put his hand on jamess shoulder james jerked backing farther away and pushing himself even more against the wall what did you do to them james screamed mr flannigans shoulders seemed to deflate awe no mr benton we didnt do anything to them there poor souls some of those folks was friends o mine family it was them mr benton the ones who make the sky turn black the ones whore killin everything a chill run down jamess back he looked at the old man before him with reservation who are they and howd you know i wasnt one of them flannigan seemed to age years as he looked at james with sad eyes dont know mr benton but he looked down at the floor then said they aint human doc barnes can attest to that and i knew ya wasnt one o them cause last one we showed them there photographs to looked right through em like they was blank pieces o paper no sign o eemotion atall then the first doggone chance he got when we tried to feed him he ripped my brother darrell apart james sat up with a shock he knew then who was in that last picture im so sorry mr flannigan the old man nodded his head still facing the floor me too mr benton please sir call me james well james you wont feel quite so tender when you hear the rest i for one know youre not one o them but doc barnes joey torrence pastor williams frankly a lot of the town folks wont wanna go offa just this ol mans whim what wait a minute cant the doctor just look me over james jumped to his feet and several things happened all at once flannigan jumped back in reaction barger seemed to come from nowhere a wild look in his eyes and swung the butt of his rifle connecting it with jamess shoulder james fell to the floor and both barger and flannigan jr dragged the elder mr flannigan out the door and slammed it shut leaving james alone in the room the air knocked from his lungs he tried to get up but a weighted sharp pain in his shoulder prevented him from doing so he let out a scream mr flannigans voice came muffled through the crack under the door im sorry james even if doc barnes could give you a look over wed first have to get him to come in that room with you and we cant do that hes our doctor none o themll risk losin him james bit his tongue to try and quell the pain he kept expecting them to come back through the door and help him but they never came unable to get up he had no choice but to lay there he found if he didnt breathe too deeply he could get some semblance of comfort at this stage comfort was being in pain that wasnt completely excruciating eventually he fell asleep those yellow eyes were waiting for him they cast that yellow glow over him as he lay on a hospital operating table make way the path of righteousness brother benton and we will come a voice said in his head he felt the presence of others coming closer all around the table that sound of growling metal rose as pairs of yellow eyes began to glow in a circle around him their bodies became even harder to see as the glow made everything else in the room darker james tried to move but his shoulder became the center of all pain he pushed through it and was able to lift his torso about an inch from the table when immense pressure like several hands against his chest held him down he looked down at his chest and saw only darkness when he looked back up at those yellow eyes they were closer than they had been and moving in the glow enveloped him and he felt a change within himself inside the glow everything made sense he had to make way the path he had to kill them it was the right thing to do they were in his fathers house he would make way the path he saw a vision then he was strong pulling them apart one at a time his eyes glowing yellow he wanted so much for it to happen they told him then in his head without using any words what would happen his body would change he would put on incorruption a mortal now he would put on immortality and swallow death in victory why was that familiar in his head they told him it was familiar because it was truth but he knew they were lying and just like that they were gone and he was awake his eyes fluttering open it was the most hellish pain james had ever endured but he made himself get up from the floor then he sat down on the cot and stared at the wall it was a bible verse he remembered it from his days in the church first corinthians something he couldnt remember exactly which verse but he remembered the words for this corruptible must put on incorruption and this mortal must put on immortality he didnt completely understand what was going on but he was pretty sure the yelloweyed bastards in his dream were the ones responsible for everything they were making way the path but to what righteousness what was righteousness cleanliness what were they cleansing us theyre cleansing us goddamnit james pulled himself up to his feet too quickly and the stabbing pain nearly knocked him back on the floor he pushed with everything inside himself until he was leaning against the door with his good arm he beat on the door open the door i think i know i know what theyre doing voices grumbled at each other from the other side of the door i think i know what they want the grumbling became louder and then abruptly stopped a good while passed and then he heard the now familiar click of the padlock he had to pull himself away from the door but he managed a man james had never seen before dressed in scrubs eased inside barger and flannigan jr at each side of him youve got five minutes james told them about the dreams and about the bible verse and how it snapped him out of that glowing lunacy he told them about the change he saw about all they had told him he had seen the change in his mind it started like a seed this alien presence inside you then it grew replacing organs one at a time until finally it reached the brain you mean they were human after all flannigan jr asked before james could answer the man he assumed was doc barnes leaned his head toward jr and spoke possibly i still dont trust him then he looked back at james how do i know you arent one of them just telling us what we want to hear eh mr benton im pretty sure you already know the answer to that one a blood test would do it just fine but im not getting any closer to you no sir fine give me the needle you can watch from the goddamned camera for all i care just let me prove im still human to jamess surprise doc barnes not only agreed but decided to watch from the open door he wanted to see the blood with his own eyes to make sure lucky for james he wasnt as squeamish as most people when getting his blood drawn with barger and flannigan jr standing over james rifles pointed at his head doc barnes slid the medical case across the floor his body mostly hidden behind the door with some minor instructions from the good doctor james was able to fill the vial easy as pie by that point he was willing to do just about anything to get out of that room doc barnes took the medical kit and slipped out of the room barger and flannigan backed away slowly and closed the door leaving james alone then the lock clicked into place james laid down on the cot and waited a while later there was a commotion outside barger and junior were grunting just outside the room the door flung open james stood up ready to finally leave the room but he realized quickly they hadnt opened it for him jr and barger rushed inside dragging a tall man in a suit behind them the man kicked and flailed as they brought him inside james bounced over to the far wall away from them the mans screams bounced all around the walls as the two young men tried to get him to stay in the room long enough for them to get out eventually barger had no choice but to knock the man out just like theyd done to james it was understandable given all that james had learned except for one thing barger let a hint of enjoyment show as he cracked the gun butt over the mans head barger noticed james watching him and gave him an intimidating glare james looked away the door slammed shut and he was alone with the unconscious man he couldnt help thinking of those pictures of people ripped apart he slid down to the floor and sat watching the man for any signs of movement when the man woke up james backed himself into the corner wishing they had left him some kind of something to defend himself with he had stayed up all night watching the man and he was exhausted it was a chance the man was only human but james didnt like those odds the man made groggy noises as he held his wounded head jamess stomach growled no one had brought any food nor did anything to help the man like they had with james the man sat up and looked at james his expression a cross between angry and the frown of a hurt puppy the man attempted to get up causing james to squeeze even closer to the wall noticing jamess fear the man raised his hands in a gesture of not meaning any harm he nearly stumbled backward as he got completely to his feet what the hell is going on why are we locked in this fucking place and what the hell is your problem james didnt know where to even begin but before he had a chance the man burst over to the door and started banging his fist against it and yelling hey fuckers let me out of here im a citizen of the goddamn united states i dont have to take this shit he walked away from the door and then charged at it slam he walked back and repeated the attempt several more times before he wore himself out and gave up he went over to james and reached his hand out to him hi names devon who the fuck are you james he said making no effort to shake the mans hand james eh okay james why the fuck do you keep looking at me like im gonna hurt you after what they just did to me he looked at his extended hand and let it falter james looked around the room until he spotted the tan envelope sitting under the cot he pointed to it look at the pictures in that envelope and then ill be glad to explain after devon looked at the photos and james told him what flannigan had said devon sat a long time in silence looking over each picture one at a time he initially had nearly the same reaction to them that james had and it took some effort to calm him down but now that he kept looking at them james was getting nervous a long time passed before he finally spoke this is bullshit has to be you really believe that bozo flannigan well yeah he was pretty upset yeah im pretty upset from what you told me about your arrival youve been pretty upset were all pretty fucking upset still doesnt account for locking us up like monkeys why do you think they didnt let you out once they gave you that blood test james stiffened why werent they letting him out he let the question sit in the back of his head and never answered devon the two men talked for several hours about their families their lives their jobs devon had been a freelance accountant in chicago specializing in small businesses he had a wife and two kids a cat and a goldfish and now he had nothing he turned bright red and crumpled as he talked about them the tears flooded down his face and his body started to shake until james could do nothing else but hold the man devon pushed him away at first but eventually he gripped jamess shoulder in return and sobbed even harder into jamess gray polo shirt and then james thought of joel and started to cry himself after a while the two men awkwardly separated straightened themselves out and wiped the tears from their faces james let devon sleep on the cot that night feeling safe enough to sleep he curled up on the floor and let himself pass out as well he was in the dark abyss of dreamless unconsciousness for what seemed like a long time when he found himself aware of that presence again then came the glow it was only the one this time it told him things again showed him things it showed him faces of other people all over the world cold dead faces it showed him little communities in various parts of the globe infiltrated by some of their own people and murdered by bloody hands far too strong to be human it showed him many groups of people asians africans europeans arabians and others all dying all across the world then it showed him the store and the little community that had trapped him and devon he saw devon and himself busting through the door and ripping the others apart until every last one was dead in between the still contorted faces james saw a flash of something else and knew he wasnt meant to see it in the flash he saw and knew their biggest fears in that solitary second he saw the community grow and flourish into more he saw a strand of dna and knew that those people and plants that had survived were different than the rest he knew that the yelloweyed bastards needed the earth they had come a long way and hadnt taken any chances they used the darkness to make way the path to cleanse away the life that could infect them with disease and bacteria but they hadnt counted on james and the others so they sent down their own virus infected men with a piece of themselves the piece grows until it becomes the man then the cleansing can continue this community was the last all right that part was true but what james had seen him and devon killing the others that part was not because in that single flash he learned the most important thing of all they couldnt infect the others something about their brains kept the yellow eyes out and even though they had infected james something was altogether different about him than anyone else in the human race his body was immune to the virus devon was the wildcard they had infected him the night before after a few days if the infection took he would be the only chance they had of cleansing this last group after several more hours dreaming of murder james woke up to devon yelling and banging on the door again let us out of here you motherfuckers no reply james rubbed his eyes as devon once again tried busting down the door he sat up holding his head in his hands he knew there was something he needed to remember but he could barely concentrate without his head threatening to explode when devon finally stopped and sat down next to james he was covered in sweat and breathing fast he looked at james and then laughed you just gonna sit there and watch while i do all the work james laughed then too devon laughed harder causing james to follow suit until both men were almost to tears from laughing so hard then they heard the first shot ring out in the distance they werent laughing anymore they stood still listening another shot rang out then another before long it sounded like a war had started somewhere within a mile radius of the store devon looked at james as if to confirm that he wasnt the only one hearing the gunfire then a loud sound of radio static came from outside the door and then mr flannigans trebly voice replaced it speaking in quick high tones jimmy son if you can hear me take the truck behind the store and get the hell out of there its barger i dont know whats gotten into him but hes gunned down the whole congregation including pastor williams i barely got out of there but he saw me and hes coming for me oh my god he just shot doc barnes oh my god oh my god oh my god i have to find my gun i have to static flannigan jr began to squeal in misery outside the door devon just sat there staring at the wall james ran to the door and started beating on it with his fists flannigan you have to let us out of here flannigan flannigan the boy outside only sobbed louder james looked back at devon he was still just sitting there staring devon maybe if we both slam into this thing we can get through devon only sat and stared in reply oblivious to jamess very presence a single gunshot went off and jrs sobbing sped up in near hyperventilation james kept watching devon hoping he would snap out of it but he just kept on staring except for jrs sobbing everything was quiet for a long while devon sat and stared and james stood against the far wall waiting for one of the two either jr or devon to snap out of it so he could get out of this place he didnt know who to root for more he didnt want to lose his last friend in the world but if jr didnt come to they would probably both die soon the car engine drawing near seemed to get both of their attentions devon stood up vacantly and flannigan jr seemed to be whimpering something james called to his friend devon you there no reply the engines pitch rose as it became louder devon doubled over moaning in pain james moved closer to console him automatically but when he was close enough to see devons face he backed off quick his eyes glowed yellow and the veins in his head bulged unnaturally the cars brakes screeched outside as devon turned and gazed at james in mindless fury devon its me remember devon please but it was too late and james knew it the man was no longer human outside the door there was a crash of shattering glass and jr screamed the sound seemed to distract devon for the moment and james backed in the corner by the door he leaned against the wall and it creaked redirecting devons attention james jumped when the gunshot went off and jrs screaming abruptly stopped devon took slow deliberate steps in jamess direction james heard the familiar click of the lock and the door flung open followed by another single gunshot and the thud of dead weight hitting the floor he knew it was his only chance lunging forward james slammed into the door knocking it into the man holding it open im gonna enjoy killing you you whiney son of a bitch barger said from behind the door a large rifle and bargers head peaked around the door james pushed the door with all the strength he had wedging barger in the door and knocking the gun to the floor a shot fired ricocheting off the far wall james slammed into the door again harder this time barger let out a yell his head and arms the only thing still in the room james pulled away from the door and barger collapsed in a heap james ran forward picked up the gun from beside barger and poked him in the back with it he let out a moan startling james and causing him to pull the trigger a single shot went into bargers back blowing a huge hole in it blood and bone splattered against the wall and out the open door and his body twitched the world tilted in jamess stomach and he fell back against the cot and sat down devons legs lying still underneath him smoking a cigarette and looking out across the parking lot in front of the store james was not at all surprised to find his car gone at this point what did it matter he was the last of his kind he knew that beyond a doubt he walked through the double doors and out into the empty world the rifle gripped in his hand its barrel resting on his shoulder the darkness was spreading from the east again taking up a third of the sky they were still trying to get the last remaining life he pictured the yelloweyed bastards up there laughing with the knowledge that they didnt even have to kill off the last community remaining of the one species that couldve put up a fight completely human barger had done that for them james remembered that brief vision he had of the people thriving and bit down on the filter of his cigarette he knew from the flash they wouldnt risk coming down from the sky until they had cleansed every speck of life from the world he might be the last man on earth but they would still have to come and take it over his dead body feeling strong and healthy he walked out into the sunset a look of angry determination covering his face he wasnt sure just how long he could survive in this barren world but he was damn well going to find
