john lescroart the th juror we would give her more consideration when we judge a woman if we knew how difficult it is to be a woman p geraldy the fickleness of the women i love is only equaled by the infernal constancy of the women who love me george bernard shaw part one prologue jennifer witt rechecked the table it looked perfect but when you never knew what perfect was it was hard to be sure there were two new red candles larry had a problem with halfburnt candles with guttered wicks in gleaming silver candlesticks she had considered having one red candle and one green candle since it was getting to be christmas time but larry didnt like a jumble of colors the living room was done all in champagne which wasnt the easiest to keep clean especially with a sevenyearold but she wasnt going to change it she remembered when shed bought the van gogh print a print for christs sake youd hand a print in my living room and the colors had really bothered larry he liked things ordered exact he was a doctor lives depended on his judgment he couldnt get clouded up with junk in his own home he told her so she went with the red candlesticks and the china he liked the china but then hed get upset that things were so formal in their own home couldnt she just relax and serve them something plain on the white pottery barn stuff maybe just hot dogs and beans they didnt have to eat gourmet every night she tried hard to please but with larry you never knew one time he wasnt in the mood for hot dogs and beans hed had an especially hard day he said and felt like some adult food and matt had had a bad day at school and was whining and one of the plates had a chip on the side she shook her head to clear the memory tonight she was making up with him or trying to so she decided to go with the china she could feel his dissatisfaction it got worse every time before he blew up and she was trying to keep the explosion off for a few more days if she could so shed fixed his favorite the special veal kidney chops that you had to go get at little city meats in north beach and the december asparagus from petrinis at a pound and shed gotten matt down early to bed she looked at herself in the mirror thinking it odd that so many men thought she was attractive her nose had a hook halfway down the ridge her skin to her looked almost translucent almost like a death mask you could see all the bone structure and she was too thin and her eyes too light a blue for her olive skin deepset somehow foreignlooking as though her ancestors had come from sicily or naples instead of milano as they had she leaned over and looked more closely there was still a broken vein but the eyeshadow masked the last of the yellowish bruise as she waited for him to come home checking and rechecking she had been curling her lower lip into her teeth again thank god shed noticed the speck of coral lipstick on her tooth the slight smear that had run beyond the edge of her liner quickly listening for the front door she stepped out of her shoes and tiptoed over the hardwood floor trying not to wake matt to the bathroom where the light was better taking some kleenex she pressed her lips with it and reapplied the pencil then the gloss larry liked the glossy wet look not too much though too much looked cheap like you were asking for it he said she walked back to the front of the house when she got to the champagne rug she slipped her pumps back on olympia way up by the sutro tower was quiet it was the shortest day of the year the first day of winter and the street lights had been on since she had gotten back from shopping at pm she checked her watch it was dinner would be ready at exactly which was when they always ate larry arrived from the clinic between and every day well almost every day when he got home he liked his two ounces of scotch laphraoig with one ice cube while she finished putting dinner on the table she wondered if she should turn off the oven would he still want his drink first if so what about the dinner she could put it out on the table but then it might be cold before he got around to it larry really hated it when his meal was cold worse he might think she was trying to hurry him what he didnt need after a long day seeing patients was somebody in his home telling him to hurry up the asparagus was the problem what if larry walked in the door in exactly one minute and wanted to go right to the table and the asparagus wasnt ready it had to cook in the steamer for ninety seconds if there was one thing larry really couldnt abide it was soggy limp asparagus maybe if he came in and sat right down she could dawdle over serving the rest of the meal and the asparagus would be perfect just at the right time thats what shed do it was a little risky but better than putting it on now thinking hed get home on time and want to sit down right away and then having him be late and the asparagus be overcooked no sign of his lexus coming up the street no one was coming up the street where was he damn she was biting her lower lip again she turned the heat off under the rice at least that would be all right for a while if she kept it covered each grain separate just the way larry liked it she made sure the water was right at the boil and that there was enough in the steamer everything depended on the asparagus being ready to go as soon as larry walked in the door as soon as she heard him even if the water wasnt boiling or if it ran out underneath that would ruin everything by she had taken the chops out of the oven refilled the water in the steamer three times and added butter to the rice to keep it from sticking but there wasnt any hope now at she had poured larrys scotch and added the ice cube now melted long ago at the hour she poured the diluted drink into the sink she heard the footsteps on the walk outside god she hoped hed found a parking place nearby sometimes if you got home late there wasnt anywhere to park within blocks and that always put him in a real bad mood the dinner could maybe be saved she knew what she could do shed pour him the new scotch now with a new ice cube greet him at the door and let him unwind for twenty minutes until the second round of rice was cooked she could microwave the chops on low power and they probably wouldnt get too dry the asparagus wouldnt be any problem she had the drink in her hand ready for him when he opened the door he was tall and very handsome with his cleft chin and his body still young at fortyone he had all his hair wavy and fashionably long an italian suit colorful tie with a snowwhite shirt colors he said were okay in a tie so long as they didnt clash she put the drink in his hand pecked his cheek smiled up at him where have you been god she hadnt meant to say that it had just come out and right away she wished she could take it back what do you mean where have i been where do you think ive been well i mean its late i thought i was worried you were worried i like that he seemed to notice the drink for the first time whats this its your scotch larry why dont you sit down relax what time is it you know when i get home this late i dont like to drink before dinner id like some food in my belly i know but i thought okay you thought youre trying i appreciate it but im starving lets just go and eat all right she stepped back not too far not as though she were retreating dinnerll just be a few minutes honey he stopped what do you mean a few minutes i walk in the door and theres no dinner i work all day and i come home to no dinner larry there was dinner an hour ago i didnt know you were going to be so late oh so its late now and somehow ive ruined dinner somehow its my fault no larry its not that it just needs to be warmed up its all ready why dont you just have your drink ill call you in a couple of minutes she could use the old rice luckily she hadnt thrown it out maybe he wouldnt notice and if she put the asparagus right in and microd the meat a little higher it should all be ready in five minutes maybe less she saw his jaw tighten his fists clenching shut opening closing opening closing she flinched backward then realizing it gave him a quick smile really she said five minutes itll be no time promise enjoy your drink he looked down at the glass dont tell me what to do jenn all right ive got patients all day giving me their opinions about things they know absolutely nothing about all right okay larry okay im sorry he shook his head and please stop saying youre sorry for everything okay she started to repeat that she was sorry and stopped herself just in time he was sipping his drink his fists had stopped clenching it looked like it was going to work reprieve this time maybe for fortythree workdays in a row dismas hardy had put on his suit and tie and made a point of coming downtown to the office that he had rented the office was an interim setup not a commitment he wasnt quite ready to go to work for a corporate law firm not yet at least not without first seeing if he could work for himself and make a decent living involving the law he was beginning to doubt if he could his landlord was david freeman another attorney who had hung up a shingle to make a go of it except freeman had done it sixty years old and crustier than san franciscos famed sourdough bread the old man had become a legend in the city his shingle now was a burnished brass plate david freeman amp associates riveted to the front of the freeman building a gracious fourstory structure on sutter street in the heart of the financial district freeman and hardy had met as adversaries in a murder case a year before before it was over they had begun grudgingly to admire one another for the traits they shared a certain relentless doggedness a rogue streak regarding how the law game was played a passion for details a personal need for independence the admiration had gradually turned into friendship over the next months freeman had courted hardy subtly counseling him on the perils of life in the big corporate firms oh sure the money was great but there was also the tedium of the paperwork the burden of having to find forty billable hours week after week after week the dependence on some partner youd have to kiss up to who was probably younger than hardys fortyone you lived in a beehive and every decision you made from where you indented the paragraphs in your briefs to what you were going to plead for your clients was subject to some committees approval did hardy want all that why didnt he give his real dream and instincts a chance freeman would let him rent an office upstairs use the library borrow his receptionist pay a nominal rent at least while he made up his mind so fortythree days ago hardy had come in he had been in the courtroom at the hall of justice four times since three of these cases two referred to him by david had been duis driving under the influence where hardys involvement had been at best tangential the clients wound up paying their fines and going home in the fourth case one of hardys acquaintances had a friend evan peterson with fifteen unpaid parking tickets pulled over for gliding through a stop sign peterson had been arrested on the spot on the outstanding warrant peterson had called for his friend whod called hardy and asked if hed come down to the hall and walk him through the administrative maze which hardy had done life on the cutting edge of the law it was the middle of the afternoon at lunchtime he had gone home to see his wife frannie and their two children rebecca and vincent after lunch he had run four miles along the beach through golden gate park back along the avenues to his house on th then giving in to his old catholic guilt what if a client was pounding on his door and he wasnt there he dressed in his suit again and drove back downtown hardy had his feet up reading looking up from the pages he took a breath trying to be philosophical about it telling himself that today was the fortythird day of the rest of his life mr hardy freemans receptionist phyllis stood at the door to his office she was a rigid but hardy thought potentially sweet woman in her midfifties smiling hesitantly hardy took his feet off his desk put down his copy of a year in provenance dreams dreams and motioned her in youre not busy im not interrupting you he allowed as how he had a few minutes he could spare i just got a call from a woman named jennifer witt do you know who she is hardys feet were suddenly on the floor phyllis stepped further into the office she was arrested this morning and wanted to talk to david but hes in court freeman was always in court and none of the associates is here freeman had a small crew of young lawyers working for him and managed to keep them all busy david want me to go down hardy was already up i buzzed him and he just called me back they were having a recess hes afraid mrs witt will go to someone else if we dont get a representative down there in a hurry he asked if you wouldnt mind jennifer witt hardy repeated phyllis nodded i think its maybe a big one she said coverage of the crime itself had been all over the newspapers and television it was the kind of grist that was the lifeblood of local news larry witt a doctor and his sevenyearold son matt had been shot to death in their home the mother had been out excercising a neighbor had heard shots and dialed when the mother returned from jogging a policeman had just arrived at the door and had told her to wait downstairs while he went up he then discovered the carnage in the first couple of weeks news reports had advanced the theory that a professional hit man had for some unknown reason been hired to wipe out the witt family mrs witt had allegedly seen a suspicious man an hispanic or africanamerican in the vicinity on the morning in question jennifer lee witt the wife was hot copy on her own even the worst likenesses of her two columns in the chronicle or frozen as a teaser for the pm news crying or in apparent shock revealed the photogenic face of a young woman just past innocence the good shots tended to be so captivating that she almost appeared to be posing she was dressed in a yellow jumpsuit like all the other prisoners on the seventh floor though her blondish hair was cut short the sides fell slightly forward partially obscuring her face she stared at the floor as she walked through the wire glass window dismas hardy watched her approach the visitors room then turned back and sat at the table and waited until the guard could open the door and present her there was the sound of the key and hardy stood mrs witt mr freeman tentatively she had her hand out no disoriented she now pulled in her hand and stepped backward hardy thought she looked about ready to break down he spoke quickly i work with mr freeman not strictly true hes stuck in court she didnt move what do you lawyers do just pass people around i called my husbands attorneys and they said they couldnt help me but david freeman could hes the best they said hes very good so i agreed they could call him fine and next thing you know her you are id never heard of mr freeman ive never heard of you i cant believe im arrested for larrys murder and my son matts for gods sake they cant think i killed my little boy at the mention of the sons name her lip began to tremble she turned away hand to her face i am not going to cry hardy nodded to the guard who stepped out of the room and closed the door behind her it was a small room fivebyeight with a pitted desk and three metal chairs taking up most of it the window faced the office for the womens side of the jail two uniformed female guards moved in and out of the picture to their cluttered desks up out somewhere then back in the womens common tank was just around the corner when the door had been open noises exploded every minute or so clangs sobs voices now the door filtered most of the sound hardy waited for jennifer witts breathing to slow down finally she turned back to him he was sitting with one leg over the corner of the table you can have mr freeman if youd like but he wont be available for a while this is a grandjury indictment there is not going to be any bail you mean i have to stay here god how long she was struggling with the effort to get words out suddenly she hung her head and sat down hardy felt like an intruder he let an eternal minute pass she took in a deep sigh as though shed been holding her breath im sorry its my fault i just didnt want to get in any more trouble and i thought i should have a lawyer okay hardy had come off the desk and went to sit across the table from her not that it matters it might hardy said she wasnt going to fight about whether having a lawyer was a good thing or not wearily she shook her head i keep thinking somethings going to help somethings going to make it better hardy started to say that the right representation could make all the difference but her gaze was a blank he wasnt getting through mrs witt she wasnt there or rather as far as she was concerned hardy wasnt there she shook her head from side to side eventually a pendulum winding down she stopped no she said i mean matt my baby hardy took in a breath himself and held it a moment he too had lost a son over the years he had gotten better at keeping it out of the front of his mind but he would never forget never even approach forgetting looking at this woman frail now in the jails jumpsuit he found himself feeling a strong connection it was unguarded and maybe unprofessional but thered be no harm in letting the legalities wait a few minutes god knew once they began theyd go on long enough how long has it been he asked she pulled at a strand of her hair i cant accept it her voice was hoarse now her eyes distant nothing seems real anymore you know she gestured around the tiny airless room this place i feel like im sleepwalking in a nightmare i want to wake up i want matt back she swallowed seemed almost to gulp at the air god i dont know what can you do what do you care i do care mrs witt she took that in without a blink not a sigh not a glance at him inside herself again hardy looked down at his hands linked on the table between them jennifer witt wasnt worried about her lawyers and their games about her bail and her baggy yellow jumpsuit shed lost her son and nobody was going to bring him back she was right nothing hardy could do would make that better there was a square of light from an outside window over one of the guards desks it had moved nearly a foot since jennifer had been brought in she had begun to open up to listen the details of hardys proxy representation accepted for the moment they were finally getting down to it she didnt want to spend the rest of her life in jail did she not for something i didnt do mr hardy okay but let me ask you what did you mean when you said you deserved it deserved what in a reaction that struck hardy as pathetic she ducked away as if she were going to be hit nothing anything this what i shouldnt have let it happen i wasnt there maybe if id been there she shook her head again what did happen why do the police think you did this hardy wanted to hear her version never imagining hed have any part in it hed followed the news of the crime casually as it appeared in the papers or on television just another of the many stories of domestic woe that came and went to help sell soap or hamburgers or newspapers i dont know i dont understand when they came to arrest me i asked them and what did they say she shrugged apparently mystified they got to talking about my rights warned me about anything i said that i could have a lawyer that kind of thing but you saw this was coming you must have she stopped him interrupting with a dry noise that sounded bitter when it came out i havent thought about anything dont you understand that ive been trying just to get through the days hardy knew what she meant she scraped a fingernail over the tabletop staring at the yellowing strip of varnish that lifted and flaked away again she swallowed as though keeping herself from breaking down but her voice the tone of it sounded almost matteroffact if weary he was sure the coloring was protective well she would have to try to soften it if her case ever went to trial if she ever testified she would come across as too cool even cold but that if at all was a long way off i was just getting used to the awfulness of it i mean okay there might have been somebody who was robbing the house or had some problem with larry i dont know what and larry gets shot larry jesus but matt she was losing the fight with her tears hardy was with her the papers always said matt must have been an accident he walked in at a bad time something like that she nodded thats what ive been thinking about mr hardy if only he hadnt been there if it had been a school day if matt hadnt walked in or said something or whatever it was he did or if i had stayed home could i have protected him she bit her lip hit the table with her small fist thats what ive been thinking about not the goddamn reasons somebody might have thought it was me and thats all ive been thinking about a tear hit the table and she wiped at it with her hand goddamn it she said goddamn it again sounding tough its okay hardy said meaning the language the loss of control nothings okay hardy sat back in the hard chair she was right and he believed her eventually she came up with something i guess maybe they thought it was the insurance but it wasnt how much insurance well larry he was a doctor and you know maybe you dont but doctors are crazy about insurance they have to be with malpractice and all anyway larry was insured for twoandahalfmillion dollars hardy took that in double for violent or accidental death jennifer nodded larry wanted to be sure that if he died he could have the house paid off and give me and matt security it didnt seem too much when we got it and larry could afford it but now they think i killed she paused fought it again killed for the money which is ridiculous we had enough money i mean larry made six figures but youd have more if he wasnt in the picture testing he felt he had to yes but she reached out to touch his sleeve i guess thats the other thing we were fighting she shrugged her mouth parted closed again id been seeing a psychiatrist and larry anyway wed had some fights but we hadnt even gotten to talking about a separation neither of us wanted that we had matt how long had you been married eight years hardy had taken out his pad but mostly he was listening waiting for a false note now he stopped her realizing theyd been avoiding the main issue they didnt arrest you because you had a couple of fights with your husband mrs witt there has to be something tying you more directly to the crime or theres no case they tell you what that might be she was biting down on her lower lip it must have been the gun but the inspector asked me about that when they found it and i told them i didnt know anything about it what about the gun it was larrys gun he was shot with his own gun but at first they didnt know it was our gun it wasnt found in the house i dont understand we kept it in the headboard but they found it like two weeks later the inspector said somebody found it under a dumpster and it had my fingerprints on it i told him of course it had my fingerprints on it i pick it up to dust inside the headboard every couple of weeks hardy let his silence answer she shook her head id been out jogging we live lived she made a fist and hit the table you know what im trying to say youre doing fine he said just tell me what happened jennifer stared at her hand the balled up fist she covered it with her other hand and brought it back toward her the house is on twin peaks you know pretty far up it was morning maybe ninethirty or ten oclock larry lets me i mean i usually run three times a week when i got home there was a police car in front of the house and the man was standing by the front door which i remember thinking was strange because if he had knocked why wouldnt larry or matt have opened it right right but he was just standing there so i opened the gate and asked if i could help him and he said hed gotten a call about some shots first some yelling and then some shots did you have a fight that morning you and larry she seemed to duck again and hardy found himself getting a little impatient with it but her hand came back to his sleeve tacitly asking for his indulgence how long had you been gone he asked when oh an hour i had to be back within the hour seeing hardys reaction she pushed on larry worried if i wasnt home he knew where i ran and how long it should take so that the hour thing it was like a rule okay lets go on the policeman is waiting at your door so i asked him if hed knocked and he said yes but there wasnt any answer and i told him there had to be i mean i was sure larry hadnt left it was the week after christmas his first week off since last summer anyway by now im starting to get worried but maybe larrys in the shower or matt is so they cant hear or something right but theres still no answer so i take out my key and we go in and im calling larry and matt and i start to go upstairs but this policeman tells me to wait and i go to the couch then hes at the top of the stairs saying dont come up stay right there now and i know god then i know her mouth opened closed opened again finally she gave up the effort she sat with her hands crossed in front of her tears rolling off her cheeks and puddling on the table hardy was not a popular man on the third floor of the hall of justice the previous summer he had gotten caught in some political crossfire with christopher locke his boss at the time the district attorney of the city and county of san francisco they had exchanged a rather unlawyerly bit of badinage after which hardy had quit gone to the defense side and beaten the assistant da who had stolen his case from him and by extension locke himself in court now whenever he had occasion to walk the oncefamiliar halls he felt crosshairs on his neck still he owed it to himself and to david freeman and freemans client if it turned out that she stayed that way to test the waters here at the end of the public hallway he stopped at the doubleglass reception window and asked for art drysdale the chief assistant district attorney with whom he had always had a cordial even friendly relationship although that too had been compromised by the events of the last year is that all she told you drysdale had pushed himself back from his desk and stopped juggling his baseballs but he held three of them in one enormous hand against his cheek i think she left out a little tiny bit art i just spent an hour talking to her she didnt kill her son drysdale more or less expecting this nodded maybe not on purpose what does that mean it means lets say the kid got in the way of what of mrs witt killing her husband hardy turned in a halfcircle please leaning forward drysdale said please yourself diz this indictment is rock solid the kid was there and died while she was committing the crime of murdering her husband as if you didnt know that makes the son a murder one too just like if a bank robber shoots a guard by mistake sorry but murder one have you talked to her oh sure everybody gets arrested i run upstairs and protect their civil rights til theyre processed then i hold their hand until bedtime and make sure they get tucked in give me a break diz hardy knew drysdale was right of course there had been no reason for him to have talked to jennifer witt but hardy couldnt let it go she didnt even do it by mistake art baseballs were getting juggled again a bad sign thats why there are trials my man figure out what really happened but youve charged her again reluctantly drysdale stopped his routine traditionally that precedes an arrest you want you can have a copy of the discovery on larry witt and matt witt read it yourself you want to tell me about it art drysdale his old mentor the man who had hired him back to the das office a year before said id like to diz but its not my case i dont know much about it baloney art drysdale knew the nuts and bolts of every case of any import that got charged especially any murder case its dean powells case you know where his office is dont you in other words byebye and dont stop back on your way out youre on the other side now see you around hardy decided he would rather not talk to dean powell not yet instead he went upstairs to homicide hoping to run into sergeant inspector abe glitsky hardy and abe had started out together as policemen walking a beat while hardy had gone on to law school then to the das office abe had progressed through the sfpd for almost ten years until he made it to homicide the place he called home if drysdale no longer was any kind of inside source hardy had no doubts about abe who was sitting at his desk looking down at some papers and chewing ice out of a styrofoam cup hardy walked through the open room of the homicide detail poured himself a cup of old coffee pulled up a chair and waited after a moment or so he sipped loudly abe looked up then back down with no change of expression the element of surprise he said in the right hands can be a powerful weapon hardy sipped again more loudly than before glitsky raised his head and chewed some ice with his mouth open one of the homicide detectives walked by behind hardy and stopped id give it to glitsky on points he said those are real attractive sounds hardy swallowed his coffee and brought the file up laying it on the desk what do you know about jennifer witt after a last look down at the papers in front of him abe closed the folder i wasnt doing anything hardy smiled youve told me many times that nothing you do when youre in the office is important isnt that a fact glitsky ran a finger around his expressive mouth caressed the scar that ran toptobottom between his lips i like the way you say isnt that a fact instead of isnt that true like the rest of humanity would its very lawyerlike witt isnt my collar you representing her of course you are abe answered himself not completely true forty percent true hardy pretended to be thinking about the answer shes david freemans but hes in court he asked me to go make her feel better which of course you did hardy shrugged its a modest talent glitsky seemed to want to follow it up find out how his friend got even this much involved with this particular client but he resisted the temptation hed no doubt get it sometime he took the folder over his desk and flipped some pages terrell made the arrest he craned his neck checking the room terrell here he called out whos terrell do i know him ofo somebody answered ofo secret police code which im not allowed to reveal under penalty of death he leaned forward whispering out fucking off he went back to the report youve seen terrell around white guy brown hair mustache oh yeah him when i was at school there was a guy like that glitsky himself was halfjewish halfafricanamerican he stood six feet some weighed two hundred something and had blue eyes surrounded by a light brown face terrells okay glitsky said but i didnt say anything i said he was okay i heard a but abe chewed more ice then spoke quietly if gods in the details wally and god arent that close he leaned back spoke in a more conversational tone hes a big picture guy only here in homicide what a year gets and idea a theory a vision i dont know but it seems to keep him running isnt that what all you guys do no what most of us do is talk to people collect evidence maybe some picture starts to form wallys a little heavy into motive and motive only takes you so far i mean any victim worth a second look theres five people with motive to have done him wally finds a couple of motives and starts digging around them rather than the other way round so whys he still here hes been lucky twice hes hauled in perps with nothing frank wrote him up a reprimand the second one was so sloppy and both times guess what it turns out he was right so what are you gonna do bust him itll catch up to him hardy tapped the file it might have here abe glanced down turned a few pages shook his head doubt it he said jennifer witt was righteously arrested see here police reports witnesses physical evidence plus as you might have noticed the public has been introduced to her she seems like a swell person i thought it might be helpful to talk to terrell glitsky raised an eyebrow i dont know if you remember but if youre in defense mode my colleagues here wont tend to view you as an ally maybe you could vouch for me you know character judgment taste generally refined nature sometimes everything doesnt make it to the file you shock me closing the file he pushed it back across the desk ill see what i can do but as always hardy beat him to it dont hold my breath glitsky nodded words of sublime wisdom he said although hardy was not yet legally entitled to it art drysdale had done hardy the favor of arranging for him to pick up the discovery on the witt murders which was basically a copy of the das file on the case drysdale it turned out had been halfwrong and halfright when he said that jennifer witt had left out a few tiny things right about leaving out some things wrong about them being tiny they included the testimony of an eyewitness anthony alvarez a retired fireman with a drawerful of decorations sixtyfour years old he lived with his invalid wife directly across the street from the witts and had heard two shots if there had only been one he might have thought it was a backfire and not even bothered to look as it was he didnt really suspect shots even after he heard them it had been more of a curiosity that kind of noise hed gone to the window and seen jennifer witt in front of the gate to her house looking back toward her door his initial thought was that she had stopped was wondering about the noises herself she stayed there a couple of seconds then began running there was also another witness the nextdoor neighbor mrs barbieto whod also heard the shots and had been the one who had called the police larry and jennifer witt had been fighting for weeks she said their son was an unhappy little thing he cried all the time the night before that morning you should have heard them on christmas three days before it seemed they nearly ruined the barbietos family dinner hardy was taking a shotgun approach to his first reading of the file and had turned right away to the tab marked civilian witnesses apparently there were eyewitnesses from a defense point of view eyewitnesses were not particularly heartening he was sitting on the side of the steps outside the hall of justice at th and bryant the day was cool and sunny with a light breeze that would probably kick into a gale by five oclock now though it was pleasant even with the bus exhaust and the fastfood wrappers beginning to swirl on the steps he turned back to the arresting officers report inspector terrell had begun to suspect jennifer after she had provided him with an inventory of items that might have been missing from her home and had omitted the murder weapon she had carefully searched the house and reported nothing missing this was before their gun had been found under the dumpster after that terrell had questioned jennifer about this oversight and jennifer had said she must have simply overlooked it blocked it somehow hardy didnt remember this fact from any of the news reports and it wasnt a good one to find now he closed the file hardy he squinted up into the sun and stood up a tall man slightly older than hardy himself hovered over him in a light charcoal suit his hand extended hardy stood and took the hand just saw you sitting here diz rumor has it youre defending jennifer witt you know rumors dean they never quite get it right he explained his standin status helping out his landlord the famous defense attorney david freeman dean powell showed a mouthful of teeth he had a glorious mane of white hair ruddy skin and an impressive posture hardy hadnt wanted to go see powell earlier and didnt feel particularly prepared to chat with him now but here he was smiling and talking art wanted to warn me early that you had the case so id take it more seriously some more teeth to flavor the compliment but its freeman huh his face clouded briefly powell might be nice hardy and stroke him about what a good job hed do but the mention of freeman moved things up a big notch freeman didnt lose too often powell motioned downward that her file hardy patted it it seems a little thin on motive for matts death the boys i mentioned it to art and he didnt seem to want to talk about it powells grin faded ill talk to you about it the motive was the husbands money the boy got in the way period hardy turned sideways out of the suns glare you really believe that do i really believe it tell you what i think its inherently believable thats not what i asked you the assistant da ran his hand through the flowing hair do i personally think she shot her boy in cold blood to tell you the truth i dont know weve charged women with that particular crime four times in the last two years so dont tell me its just too heinous to even imagine a woman could do that hardy persisted im saying she jennifer didnt do it i just spent some time with her upstairs she was sad was she powell shook his head remember wanda hayes diz he was referring to a highly publicized case from several months earlier hardy nodded he remembered well wanda was a real wreck crying all the time and she admitted that she killed two of her kids she said she just kind of lost her temper one day felt real sad about it okay dean but but nothing diz im not saying that jennifers plan was to kill her son what she did do and what we can prove was that she planned to kill her husband and didnt take the time or whatever else to make sure her son was out of the way maybe she was just careless i dont know and i dont care the bottom line is the sons dead and shes going down for him too the flash of anger spent powell suddenly exhaled as though surprised at his show of emotion he reined himself in listen he said im just on my way over to lous you feel like a drink lous was lou the greeks the local watering hole for the cops and the das hardy motioned to the file again shaking his head another time the assistant das face tightened powell was said to be considering a run for state attorney general in this years special election and he had obviously been working on his public moves this invitation for a drink had the ring of sincerity for example but it put hardy on guard powell was saying that as hardy knew one of the duties of the prosecutor was to provide full and free disclosure to the defense team you know you might want to drop by arts again we dont want you to have any surprises hardy squinted moved to the side this was unusual i just got the file an hour ago yes well art and i discussed the case after you stopped by and we decided it would be better to lay it all out at the beginning like i said we dont want any surprises what surprises powells face took on a serious expression you havent seen the indictment yet we charged mrs witt with a third count of murder what third murder her first husband died of a suspected drug overdose nine years ago did you know that i dont know how the media hasnt come up with this yet but im sure they will hardy stood still as a pole he wondered whether his onceuponatime friend art drysdale had deliberately given him only half of the discovery there wasnt really any legal advantage in doing so but drysdale had been know to mess with defense lawyers just to keep them off balance it was a good reminder for hardy he really was on the other side in any event powell went on inspector terrell the arresting officer hes been pushing for exhumation and got it through with strout this was john strout the coroner it seems mrs witt made a small bundle on that death too something like seventyfive thousand dollars which back then was a reasonable piece of change terrell found out she was dating a dentist when ned that was husband number one bought it dating this dentist while they were still married bad form anyway when ned died it looked like an overdose so the coroner ran the a scan found coke and alcohol and ruled it an accidental overdose hardy knew the medical examiner ran three levels of tests to scan for poisons in dead people level c included a lot more controlled substances barbiturates methamphetamines then the check for volatiles essentially alcohols that turned up on a level a scan but it also cost a lot more to run and when the apparent cause of death was found at the a level unless there was an investigators report indicating foul play the coroner most often stopped there hardy knew all this but he had to ask he didnt check for anything else why would he they found what they were looking for coke and booze in an overdose situation hell you know and ned had em both so the book got closed but guess what i cant imagine hardy was feeling numb atropine what atropine jimson weed deadly nightshade what about it atropine is what killed him we exhumed him on terrells hunch and there it was so he odd on atropine powell shook his head you dont just od on atropine atropine doesnt make you high its not a recreational drug but ned was loaded with the stuff thats not necessarily murder i think in connection with these latest two it is she didnt do these either powell favored hardy with one of his worldweary looks which said okay thats a defense attorneys answer about his client but between us two professionals we know the truth what he said was your mrs witts a black widow hardy were going for murder one on these a death sentence this is a capital case you cant be serious the color was gone from jennifers face she simply hung her head then after a beat shook herself stood and walked over to the window in the visitors room through which she stared out into the guards office ned killed himself maybe by mistake but somebody else killed larry and matt i swear to god i couldnt have killed my little boy hardy noticed she didnt say the same about her husband he sat with his shoulders hunched over fingers locked together on the table in front of him tell me about anthony alvarez he said she combed her bangs back with her fingers twice still facing the window i dont know any anthony alvarez hardy kept his voice low the police report identifies him as your neighbor lives across the street now she turned mr alvarez oh thats anthony alvarez i never knew his first name what about him what about him is that hes a lot of the reason youre here hardy told her the gist of his testimony while he talked she returned to the end of the table and sat again kittycorner to hardy but i didnt do that i always start out by walking a couple of blocks to warm up i wouldnt have just shut the gate and started out running not only wouldnt have i didnt hardy nodded why do you think he says it was you you have any words with him anything like that i dont believe this jennifer inhaled shook herself let it out in a sigh maybe in four years ive said a hundred words to the man i dont think id recognize him if he wasnt standing near his house why is he doing this to me i dont know hardy said but for now i think wed better concentrate on something that could help you was there anybody that might have seen you walking another neighbor jennifer shut her eyes leaning back in her chair revealing the curve of her body the plane of her cheek hardy suddenly realized how attractive she was even in the jail garb pouty lips a strong nose bones welllimned i passed a man she said eyes still closed an older guy maybe black or mexican dark anyway i read about him hardy sat forward now i dont think hes going to fly what do you mean i did see somebody i think it was i mean it could have been the person hardy was shaking his head she reached a hand across the table to him no no no listen it was the week after christmas no traffic no one around and heres this man walking up the street hes wearing this heavy trenchcoat looking like hes checking house numbers i almost stop and ask can i help him but i didnt want to be late so i keep going by she stopped talking staring at hardy it really could have been him the one i mean somebody had to do it did you notice if this man had a gun no id have do you have any idea why somebody who didnt know larry personally would want to kill him or your son her eyes stared into the space between them if you find a yes to any questions like these jennifer then we can usefully talk about him again but im afraid he isnt going to do us any good right now but it might when it does hardy said then well look at it okay i promise hardy reminded himself that he wasnt here to upset her he had felt though he should tell her they were going capital it was still going to be essentially freemans case but it wouldnt hurt to collect more impressions of jennifer lets go on to anything else about that morning anybody else who might have seen you but that man he might have been hardy patted her hand held it down on the table lets move on okay she pulled her hand away youve got to believe me i didnt do this if it was that man if it was that man he said there could have been somebody all right he might even have shot larry but he also might be anybody a neighbor a tourist a guy just taking a walk she glared at him he had his hands in his pockets both hands he might have been holding a gun hardy almost said forgetting of course that your husband was killed with your own gun he slowed himself down lets stop look were not here to argue well come back to the man later for now weve got to leave him hes not going to help us unless he lives near you and we can find him now im trying to find something to hang your defense on and hes just not it her face went all the way down to the table within the circle of her arms her body was shaking as she rolled her forehead back and forth did you do anything unusual at all on your run anything you might already have told the police or forgotten to tell them she stopped the rocking as though struggling with its weight she raised her head sighing again they didnt ask any questions like this she said i didnt think i mean i didnt know they thought i was a suspect they misled me they never asked any of this hardy said quietly im asking now all right lets try to get something jennifer nodded then recalled that she had stopped at the automatic teller at her bank on haight street which seemed odd to hardy you left to go running and happened to have your atm card with you whats so strange about that and she explained that most of her running outfits had velcro pockets and as a matter of course she grabbed her house key and her change wallet in which she kept her atm card whenever she left the house she told hardy that on that morning she had walked down her block passed the man in the trenchcoat started running for a couple of blocks then stopped for cash it was the monday after christmas we hadnt been to the bank for three days at least it was someplace to start in some ways hardys involvement with jennifer witt was easier to explain to the client than it was going to be to his wife after the successful conclusion of his first murder trial defending former superior court judge andy fowler hardy had been surprised to find himself something of a property in the small world that was san franciscos legal community trial lawyers men and women who were good on their feet in front of a jury were it seemed in great demand even in the large corporate firms the final outcome of all the work done by offices full of bean counters and number crunchers library rats technical brief writers and legal strategists paralegals and lesser staff often came down on the shoulders of the person in the firm who could convincingly present it all in front of a judge or jury or both since most corporate attorneys rarely if ever saw the inside of a courtroom many firms hired trial lawyers the way baseball teams purchased designated hitters the role was limited but if it came up it was far preferable to having the pitcher come to the plate with the game on the line because of the sensational nature of judge fowlers trial and of hardys own role as an unknown underdog firsttime defense attorney it seemed that hardy had unwittingly been auditioning for half the firms in the bay area when the verdict came down in his clients favor his phone had started ringing another event that had coincided with the end of fowlers trial had been the birth of hardys and frannies son vincent so for the first month hardy had begged off many of the interviews pleading his new fatherhood frannies desire to have him at home for a while now three months later he had visited eleven firms riding elevators to plush offices in his only threepiece suit going out to fine lunches with men and women with whom he felt no connection whatever nice people sure smart wellturned out confident financially secure socially aware all of the above but no one to whom he was drawn as a human being seven of the firms had offered him positions with salaries ranging from a low of to a high engle matthews amp jones of all of the offers put him well onto the partner track crediting him with up to six years of previous service this meant that within at the most another three years and at the least one he would become a partner in any of the seven firms and could expect annual compensation in the realm of to frannie had brought an insurance settlement to their marriage hardy aside from the fees in the fowler trial that had run to low six figures owned a onequarter interest in the little shamrock bar their house payment was under sixhundred dollars a month so frannie and hardy were not hurting nevertheless the kind of money the big firms were waving in his face was not pocket change was even tempting their house in the avenues was already with the addition of the two children starting to feel pinched the could see moving up theyd even discussed it casually after hardy had received the first couple of invitations it had become more or less understood that hardy would choose one of the firms get a linear job be an adult but he just hadnt been ready to commit to any of the firms something better might come up some people he felt better about being associated with so in the interim he borrowed an empty office and paid a nominal rent in the building owned by david freeman which was where he had been essentially twiddling his thumbs when david freeman himself had called up with the jennifer witt referral its probably going to be a fair amount of money hardy said but its another case its not a job and im not even really on it its freemans case but theres something here for you hardys hands crossed in front of him at the table came open maybe there might be frannie was trying to understand and he couldnt blame her for being a little upset he might argue to himself and tell her that he wasnt really changing the basic plan theyd discussed but they both know that wasnt true working as a member of a defense team in one potentially lucrative case was not even remotely comparable to going to work as a senior associate in one of the citys prestige law firms and frannie wasnt being conned by it its a case that lasts a year maybe two who knows that could be as long as any of the jobs last frannie lifes uncertain frannie rolled her green eyes as if she had to be told that hardy pressed on mrs witt is worth a couple million dollars maybe more which the insurance company isnt going to release to her now that shes charged with the murders it was a point he had hoped she wouldnt raise stranger things have happened he tried a grin they might do me a favor would you dismas find out you owe us that much dinner finished both kids asleep they were sitting across the dining room table from each other finishing the last of their red wine with chocolate candies on the side frannies latest culinary discovery that had addicted them both a brace of nearly burnedout candles sputtered with fitful light frannie sighed you dont want to work for anybody do you she held up a hand cutting off his response if you dont thats okay but we shouldnt talk about it as if you do its not that i bet it is you call all these people whove been interviewing you corporate rats i think the phrase betrays a certain prejudice hardy popped a chocolate sipped some wine i really dont know what it is this thing with jennifer witt just walked into my life this morning what am i supposed to do freeman has asked me to help hell take over in the morning but you are interested arent you no commitments he said but yes its interesting i looked at the file you mean the file you couldnt get your nose out of that you seem to have memorized hardy gave up yeah that file and what if she did it frannie was grabbing at straws and knew it hardy sat back she still has the right to an attorney frannie gave him a look whats that got to do with you im an attorney they both laughed the tension broken a little one of the candles gave up the ghost a wisp of smoke rising straight in the still room frannie reached a hand across the table and took her husbands look you know im with you i just want you to be sure youre doing something youll be happy with this isnt just one case you know if you take this one thats what youre going to be doing taking cases maybe defending people all the time hardy had once been a cop and on two separate occasions he had worked in the district attorneys office frannie was of the opinion that if anyone was born and bred to the prosecution it was her husband she had heard his tirades against andor scornful dismissal of defense attorneys the ambulance chasers the pond scum who took anybody for their fee upfront it doesnt have to be sleazy hardy said frannie smiled at him i just wonder if thats the life you want the life i want is with you she squeezed his hand you know what i mean he knew what she meant it worried him some too but he knew if david freeman asked him to help with jennifer witt in almost any capacity and off the top of his head he could think of several he was going to do it which meant he wasnt pursuing any of his job possibilities which in turn meant he didnt know the other candle went out lets leave the dishes he said san franciscos hall of justice located near almost under the freeway at the corner of th and bryant is a gray monolith of staggering impersonality its lower stories house various city and county departments including police coroner the office of the district attorney and courtrooms and juryselection waiting rooms the jail on the sixth and seventh floors is administered by the san francisco county sheriff as opposed to the citys police department behind the building a new jail is slowly rising in what used to be a parking lot hardy entered through the back entrance was cleared through the metal detector and deciding to bypass the slowest elevator in america ascended to the third floor by the stairway and into the familiar bedlam that reigned in the wide hallway aside from the usual circus this mornings sideshow featured a convention of perhaps twenty gypsies uniformed policemen were remonstrating with several women about their use of a butagas container to heat their coffee in the hallway hardy first wondered how they had managed to het a portable gas container through the metal detectors then watched for a while fascinated as he often was by the raffish melange one encountered almost daily between these institutional green walls it seemed to be a reasonable discussion no one yet was raising any voices but neither had the flame gone out under the coffeepot while one woman tended to the argument another was pouring liquid into small porcelain cups and passing it to some men who put lumps of sugar into their mouths before they began sipping they should set up a tv camera and run this hall live it was david freeman rumpled as usual in a cheap rack suit looking like he hadnt slept in a week probably pull a thirty share hardy gestured around them youd need a commentator to explain whats happening like here he pointed its a little ambiguous freeman considered it the host is a good idea maybe we could have the judges rotate like they do the calendar this week on calendar weve go marian braun and here in the hallway ladies and gentlemen live its judge oscar thomasino they started toward department the courtroom where jennifer witt was to be arraigned in an hour which was all the time freeman was going to take getting filled in on the case no sense wasting it hows it look he asked theyre talking capital capital powell ought to go and stand in the witness row outside the gas chamber a few times mellow him out a little i think powell might like it freeman thought that was debatable he had witnessed six executions in several states no sane person could like it and he did not think powell was insane not even close well theyve got special circumstances two ways multiple murders and killing for profit you know theyre alleging three counts three like hardy freeman was surprised to learn of the last count against jennifer murdering her first husband ned hollis nine years earlier thats digging pretty deep wouldnt you say you better read the file they got to the twelvefoot solid wood double doors that led into judge oscar thomasinos courtroom department that bad at least theyve got a case its not frivolous but she says she didnt do it freeman pushed his way through the doors well theres a first maybe she didnt maybe freeman agreed on the other hand maybe not in the highceilinged empty courtroom even whispers echoed dismas hardy and david freeman sat in the last pew a long hard cold bench of lightcolored wood freeman legs crossed unlit cigar in his mouth was starting to peruse the file pulling papers and folders from hardys extrawide briefcase youre heartening to talk to anybody ever told you that freeman shrugged scanning pages my clients love me why i get them off do i think theyre guilty do i care probably to both questions most of the time most of the time you think theyre guilty now freeman looked up most of the time they are guilty diz our jobs to get them off so thats what i try to do well hardy said i found myself very much wanting to believe her she was torn up crying really a wreck over her loss or over being caught freeman marked his reading place with a finger i know i know im cruel and cynical but tears fall for all kinds of reasons not the least of which is selfpity and when someones sitting in jail believe me they get to feeling very sorry for themselves it can seriously tear a person up ive seen it happen he went back to reading turned a few pages stopped shes attractive right hardy nodded young the file says twentyeight twentyeights young okay humor me on this one freeman himself was perhaps fiftyfive hardy thought he didnt look a day over eighty okay so shes young and attractive and crying of course you want to believe her and guess what she knows you want to believe her whether or not she did these horrible things to her husbands shes aware of the effect crying has on a normal redblooded male such as yourself and that effect is you want to believe her want to make her feel better you want more than anything to get her to stop crying dont you freeman took the cigar from his mouth spit out some leaf reinserted it and while were at it he said tell me honestly this is my personal publicopinion poll she do it or not i dont know i leaning to not none of it i dont know what part of it dont you know the boy matt and if she didnt kill him the rest of it falls apart doesnt it you dont think she killed her kid i dont see it why and dont tell me you dont think shes the type well two reasons hardy said one she didnt just deny it i thought she seemed genuinely stunned that anybody could think shed done it she didnt even want to talk about it david i mean she acted like it was all a weird mistake that would get cleared up as for killing her own son how could anybody believe that diz diz lets just for arguments sake say she did it and if she did it it was for the insurance money we agree here good okay this is a highrisk position deciding to kill somebody people do it all the time but people who do it for money theyre a different breed jennifer witt decides in cold blood to do this deed shes sure as hell not going to admit it shes taken a risk already taken it and shes going to get the whole banana or go down in flames believe it now whats the other reason hardy had said there were two reasons he thought jennifer might not have done it freeman had given an argument refuting the first and now wanted the second i just dont think shes the type freeman went back to reading i charge by the hour he said and i dont charge enough hardy accepted the reprimand in good humor take out the son matt and the case doesnt look very strong against her we cant take out matt matt was there diz i wish to hell he hadnt been but thats what we got powells not going to let it go its whats putting our girl facetoface with the gas chamber it will influence a judge hardy had had this discussion before even if jennifer did kill her husband larry and hardy was not convinced of that he was at least certain that matts death had somehow been an accident a random tragic wild card but now that card like it or not had been dealt to them it was their hand and they had to play it i still think the right jury could walk her he said the right jury could walk attila the hun but dont count on it in this case freeman leaned forward put an avuncular hand on hardys shoulder for not the first time hardy marveled that freeman was so successful and even downright likeable as always he needed a shave his lips were thick and purplish his rheumy eyes had yellowish whites the skin around them flecked with liver spots he was handsome as a leprous warthog if warthogs got leprosy the smart money doesnt put too much on the jury if i go along with believing shes innocent you know i actually hurt her chances you realize that how do you do that freeman looked around the empty room making sure no one was eavesdropping its a tightrope walk you want to convince yourself that youre defending an innocent person that much is all right its part of it but if you actually start to believe that your client is innocent youre going to assume that the jurys going to see what you see youll convince yourself that they want to believe you your interpretations of the facts hardy picked it up and those arguments because you didnt have to make them to yourself just arent going to be as strong see diz i do believe youve got a knack for this business freeman moved his cigar around if the matter gets to a jury your clients already in big trouble and it behooves you to take it as seriously as you can i do take it seriously david you asked me if i think gut level that she did it at the least im saying im not sure the case is that strong that why theyre going capital that why powells got it with his political ambitions he maybe needs the practice in court i doubt it hardy couldnt help smiling youve got to learn how to express your feelings david its going to eat you up someday holding it all in freeman nodded i know im trying theyd mind if i lit up in here wouldnt they freeman was sitting under the international nosmoking symbol id bet on it hardy said i was assuming all along youd be a part of it to tell you the truth hardy had not decided on a precise strategy to introduce the subject of his continued involvement in jennifer witts defense but as was so often the case with david freeman the question got preempted in california all death penalty trials had two phases before the same jury guilt and penalty in practice the lawyer in the guilt phase never stays on to do the penalty phase juries got cynical about a person when first they argued passionately that their client didnt do it and once it was established that yes they did too then turn around and say in effect okay so my client did it i know i said it wasnt so but i lied but at least now lets talk about what a nice person my client is and why execution would be really too strong so to avoid this appearance of inconsistency there was also always a penaltyphase attorney commonly called the keenan counsel and it was this role freeman had now asked hardy to take should jennifer be found guilty and it came to that assuming of course that she can pay he seemed serious when he said it jennifer witt had the right to counsel but if she did not have the personal funds to cover the costs and in a capital case they would be enormous the court would appoint a public defender and even if the public defender claimed some kind of conflict of interest there was no guarantee that freeman and hardy would be appointed freeman of course was a longstanding courtapproved defense lawyer but hardy had not yet even applied for the list and in any event with this kind of case at stake the other vultures would be circling this looked like it was going to become a highprofile case the very best advertisement in the business but if freeman and hardy were going to defend jennifer she personally was going to have to pay them no getting around it and ill tell you something else freeman said this is private practice i dont care if your client is mother theresa you get your money upfront he seemed very serious and it bothered hardy the clerk entered from the front of the courtroom talking with the court reporter they started setting up their work areas organizing talking in low voices in the gallery what looked to be some of the other attorneys had arrived freeman nodded to a few of them nonlawyers perhaps relatives of defendants or victims were beginning to straggle in this was superior court people coming before the judge in this courtroom were not here for traffic tickets hardy left freeman reading the file and stood wandering up to the rail that separated the gallery from the principals the prosecutor dean powell tapped him on the shoulder i kind of expected you this morning i thought i mentioned that david freemans got this one dean there he is back there doing calisthenics freeman was pulling on an ear studying oblivious to the world im mostly along for the ride freeman decide on a defense no but jennifer has its you r favorite not guilty no insanity justifiable even mrs witt says she did not do any of it powell nodded pokerfaced but hardy had the sense that he was delighted yes she did he said judge oscar thomasino short brushcut hair and swarthy complexion had a nononsense demeanor in the courtroom over which he had presided for ten years he had come in this morning with another of the surprises that marked life behind the rail before we begin today he said is there someone in this courtroom driving a green chevy lumina license number ncv an hispanic male in his midtwenties raised his hand and stood up in the third row of the gallery thomasino motioned him up through the bar rail reluctantly the man complied and the judge frowned down at him did you happen to notice sir the large sign in the space you took outside that read reserved for presiding judge the young man bobbed and halfturned around looking to the gallery for support aw come on im in trouble now because i took your parking space not precisely thomasino said although thats part of it your big problem is that the car is stolen thomasino directed the bailiff to take the man into custody they would figure out what to do with him upstairs the car had been towed to the city lot hardy was still chuckling about it when they called jennifers line her computer number hardy and freeman then came through the bar rail dean powell and a freshfaced young assistant moved over from the jury box and jennifer witt was brought out to the podium that faced the judge hardy thought that jennifer beaten down and deflated looked very much like a defendant but the jumpsuit could do that to cindy crawford he introduced her to freeman she took in her ragged attorney with something less than enthusiasm a reaction he was accustomed to she made a face at hardy this is my lawyer then faced the judge as in all murder cases the clerk read out the complete indictment jennifer lee witt you are charged by indictment with three felony counts filed herein to wit violations of section of the penal code in that you did in the city and county of san francisco state of california on or about the st day of august willfully unlawfully and with malice aforethought murder edward teller hollis the clerk read the special circumstances going on to add the charges regarding larry and matt witt when he had finished thomasino nodded toward the podium and said he assumed by the presence of messrs freeman and hardy that jennifer was represented by counsel he asked jennifer how she was going to plead not guilty your honor making a note on his printout thomasino looked over his reading glasses which were slightly tinted and halfmoon shaped mr powell the people seek to deny bail powell stood up we do your honor this is a special circumstances case the allegations are multiple murders and murder for profit the defendant has already killed your honor freeman was not having any of this to date it was not established that jennifer had killed anybody that was after all what this was about the judge scowled down at the prosecutor mr powell please powell put on a show of contrition but wasted no time getting the needle in im sorry your honor but this is a death penalty case the law provides that this defendant should be held without bail further the people believe there is substantial risk of flight freeman came back matteroffact your honor mrs witt will surrender her passport she has never been accused much less convicted of any crime there is no basis in mrs witts history or in fact for the prosecutions contention that there is a risk of flight she has stayed in the city since december and she must have had some inkling that she was under suspicion during that time she did not resist arrest all right all right thomasino peered over his glasses nevertheless mr freeman at that time she was not yet charged with any crime let alone three counts of capital murder weve got a different situation now wouldnt you agree your honor mrs witt did not commit these crimes and she is anxious to clear her name in court thomasino almost smiled yes well she will get that opportunity but im inclined to agree with the people that facing the possibility of the death penalty she might at least be tempted to forgo that opportunity and without any remaining ties to the community and no immediate family your honor jennifers voice was a surprise to everyone in the courtroom defendants were after all usually so intimidated by these proceedings by being referred to in their own presence in the third person that it rarely occurred to them that they could actually speak up themselves jennifer did i do have family here today hardy turned around in the second row a graying man who might have been thomasinos brother was halfway to his feet another younger man looked as though he was thinking about getting up too between the two sat a middleaged woman hardy also noticed something pass between jennifer and a welldressed bearded man a few rows farther back in the gallery who was he and why didnt jennifer make some kind of friendly gesture to her own father brother mother she pointed them out to thomasino in hopes that they might help her win bail but she didnt so much as nod to any of them thomasino recovered quickly all right thank you you folks back there please be seated if it please the court dean powell was on his feet id like to ask mrs witt about the last time she saw her family your honor please hardy was sure that like himself freeman had no idea what powell was talking about but he wasnt going to let such a request go unchallenged they were a long way from trial here and questioning the defendant was out of line what are you getting at mr powell your honor in the course of our investigation its become clear that mrs witt is not at all close to her family in fact they have been estranged freeman from the hip shot out and thats why theyre here today dean the gavel slapped down mr freeman you will address all your remarks to the court clear of course your honor im sorry like most of freemans moves this one was calculated get off a losing point direct attention anywhere else even if it got him a contempt warning and taking thomasinos reprimand gave him another few moments to think of something else but mr powell should know better mrs witts family is here today obviously supporting her what more do we need thomasino waved him down cradling his hands over his gavel mrs witt your familys presence here is noted but it doesnt change the law this is a no bail case your honor freeman one last time but thomasino had had enough the gavel came up with a judicial glare he tapped it gently then intoned bail is denied in the hallway outside of department the gypsies had disappeared but there was still the usual hum of voices echoing off the bare walls how can they not let her get bail jennifers father phil distephano was saying he was in freemans face not exactly belligerent but certainly not cordial we could appeal freeman said but i warn you well lose and even if we won the judge would set an outrageously high bail the attractive mrs distephano spoke up quietly from behind her husband how much mr freeman phil distephano turned on his wife it doesnt matter nancy its out of our league from appearances it seemed he was right regardless of what bail turned out to be if in fact they won an appeal the distephanos didnt look like they would be able to pay it phil wore a plain black suit that showed no sign of having been recently pressed a white shirt ironed but not new a thin tie the mothers clothes though not the rest of her reminded hardy of pat nixon during the checkers speech she was attractive enough still some might say even beautiful like her daughter but something in her bearing in the pinch of her lips conveyed that her life hadnt been easy the son perhaps twentythree wore jeans work boots longish hair a tuckedin pendleton and an attitude a workingclass family and it surprised hardy a little jennifer had never been portrayed in the media as anything less than upper class and in hardys interviews yesterday she had come across even in her prison garb and through her grief as the comfortably off successful doctors wife her family suggested different roots when freeman went on to tell them they could expect bail of a million dollars or more if they got it at all the son exploded where the fuck she supposed to get that tom freeman held up a calming hand exactly son the point is they dont want her to get out they think shell take a long walk and disappear i dont think she will she has a very solid defense the man who belonged to the new voice moved forward hand out to freeman ken lightner as though the name explained something he added im jennifers psychiatrist it was the other man hardy had noticed in the gallery reasonably goodlooking somewhat burly even in his tailored suit lightner sported a welltrimmed red beard under a head of dark brown hair it was a striking combination that hardy thought might come out of a bottle whats jenny need a shrink for tom distephano said nancy distephano put a hand on her sons arm as lightner stepped in you must be tom no im the queen of england she stepped between them dont be rude tom hardy wondered if tom distephano was in enough control of himself to be anything even rude on purpose whatever the source of his anger it was pretty clearly eating him up he looked about around the hallway as though searching for an exit an escape his mother still held onto his arm but he shook it off and turned to hardy are you guys trying to get her off as crazy is that the deal you think shes crazy no not at all lightner seemed to be striving for an understanding tone trying to include everybody but this was freemans show and he was not about to hand the lead away we havent decided on a defense he said jennifer is innocent until shes proved guilty i trust were all in agreement here it was a multilayered tableau anger positioning concern grief power brother tom was at the center of it perhaps slightly defused but hardy hoped nobody picked that moment to push him further he would lose it now though with no one to direct his anger toward tom stood there flexing his hands feet flat on the floor breathing hard well he paused looking for an answer to something in the broad and echoing linoleum hallway in the high ceilings well just shit well all need to handle this lightner said this is a very trying situation and its certainly okay to get angry we all get angry hardy glanced at freeman all professions had their jargon it probably passed for normal conversation in lightners set but nancy cared neither about anger or jargon theyre not really going to ask for the she couldnt say death penalty for my daughter are they she was close to tears gripping her husbands hand hardy thought he would take some of the focus away from freeman spread the pressure around were a long way from even getting to a trial mrs distephano much less a verdict and a penalty we dont have to worry about that yet we damn well better worry about it tom said we dont take care of it now its going to happen tom you know something i dont hardy said now with a direction tom let it go yeah i know something i know people like us dont get a fair trial thats what i know not against them not against who what people like you poor people working people goddamn it against the people who have money jennifers got some money tom phil said its not her money pop and you know it its larrys money thats what this is all about and the rest is all just bullshit they want their money back who does hardy asked theyre not letting her in she just doesnt fit does she just like we dont like larry cut us out except jen tried to crash her way in didnt she married her fancy doctor drove her fancy car tried to be one of them and they dont forgive you for that do they they go get you for that nobodys trying to get her tom mom you dont see you buy their crap thats whats kept us down tom stop it phil stepped between his son and his wife but tom now turned it on him oh yeah sure and youll take anything pop wont you it happened in an instant phils hand flashed and rocked his son hard openpalmed high on the cheek the noise resounded in the hallway dont dare use that tone with me the men were squared off nancy now between them she had started crying tom backed up glaring at his parents aw screw it he said finally turning running off down the hallway his mother turned to the two attorneys im sorry for my son he thinks the world she let it hang tears in her eyes this was the moment defenses were down freeman figured he could use it he went after phil did you see jennifer often mr distephano i mean do you visit each other well sure shes my daughter isnt she were all close even tom hes just got a hot head like you said in there its why were here today freeman turned to mrs distephano she shook her head we havent seen them in years phil tried to put a face on it hey larry was a busy man it wasnt that he didnt nancy cut him off larry wouldnt let her we never saw any of them never hardy freeman and lightner watched jennifers mother walk off stiffly a step behind her husband a young couple emerged from one of the doors behind them hugging and laughing maybe thomasino had just given one of them a break freeman mr small talk turned to the psychiatrist lightner so whats her defense doctor relaxed hands in his pockets lightner didnt have to think about it he nodded up the hall after jennifers parents slightly dysfunctional wouldnt you say id kind of expect it youd kind of expect it hardy repeated they started moving through the crowd toward the elevators hardy and freeman were going upstairs to see jennifer find out if they had a client lightner was nodding you just saw an object lesson its generational you know father batters mother and children children go on to batter their own whos battering who freeman asked lightner stopped no no i mean larry of course larry was battering jennifer this was news to hardy probably to freeman perhaps not to powell in any event jennifer hadnt mentioned it freeman was a step ahead of them if youre talking burning bed i think the boy is a problem there the burning bed had been gaining a good deal of momentum in legal circles as a valid defense for killing when a spouse had been battered long enough juries in several cases had decided that killing the abusive spouse was justified as a form of selfdefense even if the actual event took place during a period of relative calm as for example when the abuser was asleep this was far beyond the usual legal standard for selfdefense when the person being attacked was in imminent danger of being killed why is matt a problem lightner asked because battered wives dont kill their children freeman said if she was a battered wife she was and it might have been unintentional if it happened while she was defending herself that would be a tough sell to a jury freeman said you think she did it hardy asked abruptly for the first time lightner appeared to think carefully about an answer she had reason to he said hardy didnt like this another person not even in the prosecutions loop with the socalled informed opinion that his client had reason to kill her husband because her husband abused her not of course that having a reason means she did it lightner was quick to add hardy squared around on the psychiatrist what exactly are you saying im certainly not saying she did it mr hardy i am saying you perhaps ought to read the literature people become crazed in the situation jennifer was in understandably so im saying that if that happened to jennifer if she was as horribly abused as i suspect i thought you just said then that should be a central part of her defense and thats all im saying mr hardy covering her both ways hardy thought the elevator arrived were going up freeman dismissed him then softened it thanks for the input youre very welcome please call on me any time and lightner disappeared behind the closing doors they were waiting for jennifer to be brought into the womens visiting room freeman was going over more of the file hardy sat across the small table taking in the view through the window a female guard filing papers in an ancient metal cabinet you know he didnt turn around a man of your sensitivity and experience ought to be able to do this alone hardy had had to be talked into returning to the seventh floor it was not a pleasant place she hasnt met me yet freeman did not stop his reading she just met you downstairs remember department big room judge in the front freeman raised his rheumy eyes hardy came around the table hovering over him you know one of my beliefs is that everybody should try to get some sleep every night i get enough freeman growled beauty rest then you could use more beauty rest look changing tracks we may not be doing this at all i want it dont get me wrong but if theres no fee and then theres the fact that i wouldnt blame her at all if she dumped me right now on her own her reaction to me was something less than warm to combat that eventuality ive asked you to accompany me she seemed to relate to you for some unknown reason maybe you can at least buffer things at the beginning here i explained this once i know i even understood it what then just trying to lighten you up david weve already lost one downstairs we want this case we might want to slap on a little of the suave freeman gave him a face i dont do suave but he forced a weary grin thats why i need you they were getting through the first minutes jennifer tight said nothing while freeman explained the bail situation how there just wasnt much any attorney could do in a capital case such as hers it was also a sales pitch of sorts defense work might be freemans vocation but it was also his livelihood and he felt obliged to nail down the level of his involvement before he proceeded but all she wanted now was for him to appeal the bail denial you cant want me to stay in here hardy stood back to the door hands in his pockets after a night in jail jennifers feelings about the relative importance of bail had only escalated and understandably so freeman folded his hands on the table in front of him speaking very quietly of course not mrs witt but we have got realities to deal with and im afraid one of them involves money money its always money isnt it for a moment hardy thought she almost sounded like her brother freeman spread his hands in fact he thought it often was money he felt obliged to lay it out for her now however unpleasant it might be you might get a milliondollar bail on appeal thats a hundred thousand to the bondsman plus the cost of the appeal if you cant manage that youll have to go with a public defender at trial her glance quick and frightened went to the door why not you and mr hardy freemans hands came back together frankly our retainer its my decision is going to be two hundred thousand dollars and anybody else would require as much so if you cant raise the money you go with the public defender in addition to believing it was better to be even brutally frank up front freeman also held the view that it was actually better for the client to show your tough side on the theory that if you could be this difficult with your own think how youd eat up your enemies he had long since stopped asking himself if this were a rationalization he couldnt afford such thoughts he told himself but isnt a public defender just anyone no they have to be approved by the court and in capital cases theres a substantial level of competency a level of competency she muttered shaking her head im very sorry but those are the facts of the matter but this is my life david hardy felt he had to break in here all of what freeman was saying might be important and even true but the money wasnt the point for hardy and he suspected that at bottom it wasnt really for freeman either though he put on a convincing act to the contrary now the old man lifted his baggy eyes what lets go outside for a minute they left jennifer sitting at the table in the tiny room outside in the start hallway the jail noises now much louder hardy got to it how about we come back to the money later when later its got to get settled diz she doesnt want to change attorneys he scratched at the lines around his right eye she doesnt have enough then ethically weve got no business starting im just trying to find out get things clear youre grilling her is what youre doing freeman waved that off grill schmill we need to know and we need to know now he patted hardys shoulder look i know its a good case hell we could do it pro bono for advertising but i want to know what were dealing with and this is the time to find out after that well ill make it up to her he inclined his head lets go back in ill make it short and sweet promise freeman sat across from jennifer mr hardy and i are sorry to have to put you through this jennifer but we do need to know your financial situation that will help clarify where we go from here the muscles in jennifers jaw were working her face blank well i dont think moneys a problem the insurance you know freeman was shaking his head no jennifer theyll hold it until youre finished with this if youre found guilty they wont pay hardy couldnt believe it was she actually trying to smile but youll keep them from finding me guilty freeman shook his head im afraid i dont gamble with my own money jennifer hardy was thinking that his partner hadnt lied he didnt do suave so lets leave that aside freeman was saying what else i mean besides the insurance they had lived in their house for five years she said but they had bought high just as the market was slowing down equity was probably at seventy thousand or a little less providing she could sell it the house account was around twenty thousand they had had some stocks another sixtyfive thousand furniture some jewelry two cars garage sale prices freeman figured what happens if you get bail and what do they say jump it jennifer asked then at freemans glare i mean in theory dont even think about it and dont let anybody hear you ask about it in fact dont talk to anybody here in jail about anything thats good free advice now if you jump first you lose the money you put up all of it and then they will catch you believe me they will youll never ever get a bondsman again finally youve got the entire judiciary a convinced youre guilty and two b hardy interjected and two prejudiced like hell against you its a bad bad idea dont even think about it not that shes got any bail to jump anyway hardy reminded him do you guys rehearse this she asked freeman was scribbling on his pad he looked up heres what i get even if you dont do the bail appeal and if you sell your house and completely tap out youre still short we want to help you but im afraid ill have to tell the judge were withdrawing jennifer faced them theres more she said theres another account freeman stopped gathering his papers hardy pulled a chair around and straddled it what do you mean another account freeman asked jennifer looked down swallowing obviously nervous sometimes i just didnt think larry and i were going to make it you know and i thought well if i had to go out on my own with matt i mean she looked from one man to the other i mean i just felt i had better have something of my own for matt and me just in case just in case what freeman was staring at her well you know like i said in case it didnt work out in case i had to get away or something get away from what freeman was remembering what the psychiatrist lightner had said about abuse are you saying your husband beat you hardy asked you never jennifer brought her hand up to her face as though feeling for remembered bruises no he didnt not really but you know still if i really needed it she stammered it out she had been squirreling money away for some nine years in spite of larrys tight grip on everything she had found ways to take a little from here some from there pad about what she spent on matt toys clothes makeup decorating anything she could manage the amounts had grown to almost a thousand a month and she had learned to invest it in highrisk stocks so that the account now totaled close to threehundredthousand dollars unencumbered and liquid well said freeman allowing himself a smile if you still want us mrs witt youve got us hardy did not smile jennifers revelation however justifiable she might make it seem still bothered him hed rather not have known to tell the truth tell me about larry witt jennifer and freeman sat across the table from one another hardy was a fly on the wall against the inside of the door freeman had produced a thermos of coffee from his briefcase and three styrofoam cups now steamed on the table what do you want to know about him and me i want to know everything freeman had his coat and one arm draped over the back of his chair he slouched his shirt was half untucked but i suppose we should start with how often he beat you up jennifer blinked then recovered her eyes widened went to freeman then settled on hardy i said we were fighting not that larry beat me freeman put out his hand back toward hardy keeping him from responding he spoke soothingly but he did beat you i dont see why that would matter freeman kept his voice low persuasive it matters jennifer because it gives you a defense it gives the jury something they can hold onto hardy couldnt help noticing this was not what freeman had told dr lightner downstairs when he had characterized the batteredwife defense given the death of matt as a hard sell to the jury in fact though he did beat you she took a moment the muscle in her jaw working i didnt kill larry mr freeman i dont care what reason you come up with why i might have i didnt what about matt my god are they going to say i killed matt too theyre already saying that jennifer her laugh was so brittle it broke and whats their reason for me to do that have you thought about it how are they saying i killed my son freeman kept his voice flat quiet matts not what were talking about jennifer right now were talking about larry i dont care about larry jennifer slapped the table i didnt kill matt dont you understand that she looked up at hardy he felt he had to answer her theyre going to say that matt just showed up by accident that you panicked or he got in the way of you shooting larry she closed her eyes breathing heavily now but but if it was an accident its not first degree murder is it i mean it didnt happen but if they say it did its not the same as larry her face was deathly pale hardy was tempted to explain it as drysdale and powell had put it to him he resisted but it worried him some that she had even asked followed by a quick denial at the same time as though he had just confirmed something to himself freeman nodded straightened himself and sat forward cradling his hands on the table his voice again was carefully modulated but it was a masters instrument and this time beneath the soothing tone thrummed a hint of a threat i want you to be very clear on something here jennifer i am not accusing you of anything but you should know that i will neither believe nor disbelieve anything you tell me anything whether you did it or didnt do it why or why not but i didnt freeman held up a flat palm you must believe me that if your husband in fact did hit you the prosecution will hammer that point again and again as one motive for you to have killed him now if one time you and larry had a fight and he struck you that isnt going to satisfy most juries that he gave you a reason to kill him but if we can come back and show that this was a recurring event in your marriage that you were living in a state of constant fear and stress then at least weve countered their argument regardless of whether or not you killed him jennifer was shaking her head i didnt kill him but if i did i was justified is that it hardy straightened up he had been thinking the same thing that you could not have it both ways reason or no reason either she killed him or she didnt jennifer understood and cared about this distinction good hardy thought but then he had to face another countering thought an embezzler with a logical mind capable of longrange planning and execution was jennifer witt the kind of person who might just get away with murder but freeman wasnt backing away were going to find some defense out of all of this but wed damn well better be prepared for all the arguments and to just keep repeating i didnt do it will not im afraid be effective hardy moved forward to the table jennifers face was hard her eyes angry tears threatened suddenly freeman reached across the table and covered jennifers hands with his own lets just talk all right jennifer did larry hit you she nodded but it wasnt i mean there were a couple of times he got physical but i guess they were my fault how could it have been your fault hardy said well i messed up i would just i dont know make a mistake and and your husband would beat you freeman who had heard it all from many clients still sounded incredulous jennifer balled a fist and pounded the table was that an act hardy couldnt figure it look please stop saying he beat me maybe he did hit me a couple of times but it wasnt like he he beat me up hed get mad yes but he loved me and it just disappointed him that i didnt live up to what i should have and then what freeman said and then what what what happened next after larry beat hit you he didnt add for your own good he waited this was getting serious she hunched her head down again the mannerism suggesting a cowed beaten state of mind and it was becoming almost familiar he felt terrible i know i couldnt believe id made him feel that way you made him feel that way how did you do that by messing up if i hadnt he wouldnt have hit you yes do you see hardy and freeman exchanged a look then freeman continued so larry felt bad after he hit you awful really he did love me you know i can see what youre thinking and its just not true hes the only one who knew the real me afterward hed be so affectionate bring me flowers the next day now something seemed to embarrass her sometimes those were the best times afterward i mean after he hit you but it was only a couple of times wasnt it you just said that and a couple is two might it have been three freeman said she didnt cave no no it was two i didnt mean sometimes i mean both times she nodded it seemed they had hit the bottom of that well but her reluctance to acknowledge the abuse was still hard to understand freeman glanced at the folder on the table in front of him lets talk about who did kill larry if you didnt i mean since you didnt any ideas she took a minute to change gears then reached for the coffee her eyes were getting better he worked hard he was a doctor yes but did he have any enemies anybody who might have it in for him well maybe his first wife i mean this sounds so ridiculous i dont want to accuse his first wife or anything i know she didnt kill him how do you know that jennifer well i mean she just wouldnt not after all this time it wouldnt have made any sense might it have earlier playing with the styrofoam picking at it she shifted herself on the hard chair well you know it was one of those situations where she worked while he went to medical school and then he graduated and they just didnt get along i guess she was pretty unhappy about it at the time did you figure in that she let herself pout which struck hardy as somewhat affected an act jennifer witt was not easy to figure out freeman prodded so larrys exwife what was her name molly and i ask again were you in the picture when she and larry broke up well they were already having problems which answered that did you mention molly to the police no i told you she wouldnt have just covering bases jennifer freeman jotted something on his pad and hardy came and sat back down anybody else who didnt care for larry what about tom jennifers hottempered younger brother had left an impression again that near jump that blink sitting up as though freeman had slapped her what about tom how do you know about tom freeman ignored the reaction what about him and larry she shrugged larry and i never saw tom a lot hes got such a chip on his shoulder over money i dont know what it is exactly jealous of larry maybe at freemans look she hastened to correct herself no not that kind of jealous really what do you think i am freeman leaned forward again i dont know jennifer thats what im trying to figure out you tell me how tom was jealous jealous enough to kill larry the acting if it was suddenly stopped and so did the fidgeting tom is mad at his life i think he didnt have money didnt go to college he feels like he doesnt have a chance and never did but that doesnt mean like your father i guess thats what toms afraid of that hell wind up like dad except my dad never wanted as much also it was a lot easier to get a house in those days even if you were blue collar and the house was enough for dad but i think tom saw it as as a sort of prison i did too in a way but i got out what does he do tom i dont think he does anything regularly i know he drives a forklift sometimes does construction whatever he can find i guess and he resented larry and you for having money we didnt have that much but i suppose yes and me for not having worked for it but now you do what have money a good deal of money she bit her lip perhaps not understanding freemans implication perhaps understanding it all too well whats that got to do with tom maybe he tried to borrow some and larry wouldnt go for it if larrys gone hes got a better chance getting some from his sister alone she shook her head no freeman made another note hardy decided hed better check some alibis maybe glitsky could poke around too abe often said that going behind the departments back was just what was needed to spice up the otherwise routine life of the homicide investigator freeman covered jennifers manicured hands with his own gnarled ones you know he said im kinder and gentler than any prosecuting attorney will be these arent even the hard questions jennifer these are in your favor the prosecutors wont be she halfturned stretching the jumpsuit against her body showing a fine profile she smiled thinly was she trying for effect thats really good to know she said i cant wait for the hard ones okay freemans hands came away and his smile was not friendly since you cant wait how about this were you having an affair jennifers shock seemed a nearcaricature what when with who whenever with anybody she drilled freeman with directeye contact no of course not absolutely not when when what when werent you having an affair but they had already done this jennifer withered the old lawyer with another look when did you stop beating your dog right freeman matteroffact sometimes it works she lifted her coffee cup and drained it grimacing at the cold dregs sometimes it doesnt mr freeman again hardy found himself wishing she hadnt said something was she perhaps unintentionally telling them that if it had worked they would have gotten the truth or that she simply saw how the game was played and was telling the truth anyway freeman began arranging his papers putting them into the folder well he said i think weve got enough to get started lets digest this and meet again tomorrow what time she asked freeman shrugged at your convenience jennifer now the fear showed through of being left alone of the ordeal facing her early then okay freeman gave her shoulder a pat crack of dawn he said at seven oclock hardy was nursing a guinness waiting for frannie to arrive by cab at the little shamrock the bar at th and lincoln that he and moses mcguire his brotherinlaw owned wednesday by sacred tradition was the hardys date night before hardy had returned to the practice of law he had been the shamrocks daytime bartender for a decade before that he had been a you red hot with the district attorneys office married to a judges daughter starting out a family hardy and jane fowler and their boy michael michael was not supposed to be able to stand up at five months so neither jane nor hardy paid close attention to whether or not the sides of the crib were pulled all the way or only halfway up that oversight took the boy from them he did manage to climb over the railing and fall onto his head the fall killed him after michaels death hardys world gradually fell apart within and without now remarried to frannie and with two new kids he didnt feel like he was trying to recapture what hed had that was gone for good but there was hope again a future a meaning that wasnt hardys style but not may days passed that he didnt reflect on how empty his life used to be and how now it wasnt it wasnt clear to him where this fit into the professional turnaround he had taken in the last year but there was some kind of a visceral bond that he figured had to be related a year ago for the first time in his life he had found himself taking the defense side of a murder case because hed become convinced that the defendant was innocent several factors played into his hands during that trial an inexperienced judge gave him unusual latitude in his arguments an overambitious prosecutor brought a case that was not really locked up hardy himself had been angry enough at the das bureaucracy that his own motivation went into overdrive for these reasons plus the fact that it turned out someone else had done the murder he had won now after a lifetime during which he had sided with the people he found himself for the second time a lawyer for the defense no need to apologize moses mcguire said youve become a bleeding heart its okay youre still in the family we still like you hardy checked his watch where could frannie be moses swirled his macallan a fixture in the bars gutter shes undoubtedly on her way soon to arrive and save you from having to defend your basically untenable position against someone whos smarter than you whats untenable defense work moses held up a crooked finger uh uh uh youve said the same thing yourself more than once he found himself saying he wasnt sure jennifer was guilty moses snorted again i quote from a reliable source who happens to be sitting across from me at this moment if they get all the way to arrested they did it hardy smiled i was but a callow youth when i said that and now youre mature of course ive married your sister started a family settled down im a model citizen and sometimes people get arrested when they didnt do it how often hardy thought about it twice i think his case won moses nodded to himself then walked the length of the bar schmoozing with the eight paying customers wednesday night didnt get going until after nine when they started the darts tournaments hardy drank stout even if he himself a few years ago would have said he was on the wrong side he no longer felt that he was he could have told moses he had seen what could happen with an overworked and undermanned police department a das office hungry for numbers convictions mistakes got made simple venality or laziness or incompetence snuck in maybe not often but often enough and he was starting to think that thats what he was in it for when the truth needed the hurlyburly showcase of a public trial to get its face out there and sometimes that was the only way it did he wanted to be a part of it balance of power man against machine and thats what the bureaucracy of prosecution was abe glitsky told him he had this tragic flaw of a fundamental need to continually restore order to a chaotic cosmos glitsky could get fancy he wasnt sure hed go that far but maybe there was something to it hardy and frannie sat with their feet in the recess under the table at a tiny place called hiros on judah street a couple of blocks south of the shamrock frannie was drinking tea and eating tempura avoiding the sashimi and sake because she was still breastfeeding but the platter of ahi oni quail eggs and gooeyduck in front of hardy was nearly empty frannie did not need a dim light to be attractive but the candles shadows flattered her wondrously hardy couldnt take his eyes from her face she was holding his hand across the table talking about vinnies day about rebeccas expanding vocabulary he let her ramble on feeling that if the big one the earthquake all of california expected at any moment came right then and swallowed them up into the earth he would die happy also besides thumbnail listen to this she said her first threesyllable word gravity you want to tell me what context she used gravity in the beck rebecca was fourteen months old up to this time she had shown almost no interest in physics her sippy cup fell of the table and she got all upset and i told her it was okay it was just gravity so she nods and stops crying immediately and repeats gravity naturally then she wanted to experiment with it about two hundred more times of course you wouldnt want to just let go of a concept like that what if newton had we didnt get into that i just took the cup away hardy pointed an accusatory finger negative reinforcement fran weve talked about this if later in life she blanks on gravity youll have no one else to blame but yourself frannie sipped at her tea im going to be able to live with that burden suddenly theyd talked about the kids enough the moment was palpable there were other items on the agenda so how was your day are you going to be working with david to the tinkling background music hardy described his involvement with jennifer witts case the bail denial everything or almost everything he did not bring up his nagging doubt that all was not completely as it seemed with his new client he did however tell her about the existence of jennifers bank account so shes got the money to pay us then he tried to explain how shed come by the money frannie stopped sipping tea youre saying she stole it the money shes paying you with no not exactly stole it hardy pointed a finger i like that thing you do with your eyebrows scorn and rejection its good she didnt exactly steal it please he gave up okay so she stole it she had reasons it doesnt mean shes a bad person trying for levity again and again it soared like a tractor anyway he went on its at least a year of work keeps my hand in and if david gets her off which he often does with his clients its a good deal all around what if he doesnt well if he doesnt itll be my job to keep her out of the gas chamber frannie like most people wasnt too clear on how capital trials were handled in california hardy explained that freeman would conduct the first phase the one that would determine jennifers guilt or innocence when that was over if freeman lost there would be a second phase in effect a second trial to determine one of two possible penalties life in prison without the possibility of parole or death hardy was going to argue the second phase if it came to that frannie shook her head disbelieving youre kidding me thats a good deal thats my vision of hell nope itll never get that far dont worry about it can we write this down dismas hardy says it wont get this far i shouldnt worry about it id like a copy for my records hardy carefully picked an oni with quails egg from the plate in front of him and popped it savoring the explosion of flavor ill have my secretary run one for you look frannie davids the best defense lawyer in the city hes throwing me a bone thats all it is a big bone with meat on it and what if she did it then what hardy shook his head she didnt kill her son somebody must think she did ive heard you say that people dont get arrested unless theyve done something i was wrong now ive seen the light fiddling a minute with her glass frannie finally looked up this isnt all that funny after all i mean isnt it true that theres a case to be made that she killed her son even if it was by accident or whatever he had to nod and a good case that she killed her husband well a grandjury indictment isnt necessarily but frannie had heard this song and stopped him and what about her first husband hardy dismissed it with a wave thats just the das numbers game they went back and literally dug that one up they didnt charge it first time around they arent going to prove it now after ten years more famous last words frannie said but what if what if all of the above doesnt happen as your predict then what or worse what if it turns out she really did do it i mean killed both husbands and her child hardy didnt like these questions mostly because hed asked them so recently to himself jennifers acting posing brains and plotting ability were not insignificant he didnt of course want to argue mercy for someone who didnt deserve any and on the offchance that jennifer was guilty of these things she didnt deserve a break today or any other day but turning into a good lawyer he had at least developed an answer he hoped would work in a penalty phase if she killed her husband i can argue that he beat her which he apparently did you know that i think so though she more or less denies it well thats heartening very strong boy this is fun thats cause im a fun guy to be with one minute nothings happening then whammo suddenly its fun city they were in their new honda accord the jeeplike suzuki samurai a sacrifice to small children cruising down haight street at ten oclock at night he took her hand she gently removed it almost done he said it was an apology from hiros they had decided to go back to the shamrock to spend some time with moses frannie has been missing her brother hadnt seen him in a week but first david freeman did not like to use private investigators preferring to do his legwork himself and with his current trial taking much of his time he had asked hardy to check out a few details relating to jennifer witt so before they went down to the shamrock hardy suggested that he and frannie swing by the house jennifer larry and matt had lived in just to get the feel of it his copy of the folder was still in his car so they looked up the address on twin peaks and it took them nearly twenty minutes to find it olympia way then since it was right on the way hardy said he might as well measure the distance from the house to jennifers bank where she had taken money out of her atm unfortunately there were four banks on the revitalized old hippy thoroughfare and all of them had atms so hardy was writing down mileages while frannie commented on the good time they had been having for the past fortyfive minutes the bank on haight closest to the witt house was just over a mile from their front door the furthest all the way down near the border of golden gate park was about two miles hardy had no idea if these facts would ever prove to be important but felt more comfortable having them he liked to operate under the general principle that facts made a difference even if you didnt always know precisely what that difference was good now that we know that frannie exclaimed when he had written down the last numbers ill be able to sleep tonight hardys own crackofdawn was literally that the telephone next to his bed rang at fiveforty as the thinnest line of pink began to show out his bedroom window he got it on the first ring this is walter terrell wake you up sorry abe glitsky asked me to give you a call what can i do for you hardy heard the young voice noting the penchant some cops had for getting to you when you werent ready for them he bet that terrell wasnt really that surprised that hed woken him up nor sorry fiveforty was a little early for anybody except fishermen and most folks seemed to know that even hardys kids still slept but he had him now and this might be the only time so he swung out of bed and padded into the kitchen with the phone i thought we might be able to get together talk a little about jennifer witt there was a pause perhaps glitsky hadnt told terrell exactly who hardy was or his relationship to jennifer but one thing was sure terrell knew hardy wasnt with the das office you doing her defense terrell asked finally keenan counsel hardy was pouring leftover coffee into a mug and pushing buttons on the microwave penalty phase yeah i saw it was going capital you guys got yourself a bitch the case i mean the perp too actually hardy bit back his automatic response of alleged perp hardy recalled when he had walked a beat start saying alleged to cops about people they had arrested pretty soon youd find you werent friends anymore he wanted to keep terrell on his side well this perps maybe got a decent defense but she doesnt want to use it i mean it seems her husband had been beating her this evidently didnt change terrells world view so you knew that hardy almost thought he could hear a shrug guys beat their wives most of them dont get killed what im saying hardy pulled his coffee mug from the microwave put in sugar stirred is she could take the batteredwife defense and have a better chance of getting off and yet she wont terrell was silent to him these were legal shenanigans his job was to deliver someone to the da if there was evidence theyd committed a crime what the das office did after that was not his problem finally he asked so what did you want to see me about i assume youve read the file sure terrell kept up the slow response the files the official record im in it does it say anything about beating it said they were fighting hardy felt rudderless struggling to get his brain moving well there you go anything else i got a big morning did you find anything on this hit man the voice dripped scorn thats right the hit man citys crawling with them no i didnt mention him for the same reason i didnt mention the motorboat what motorboat the one that wasnt there just like the fucking hit man there was a lot of things i didnt put in space aliens for example if you read the report the hit mans there in her statement hell shes got to have something if its her story somebody else did it whats she gonna say its so lame youd think no its just lame all right but that doesnt mean she didnt make it up all the same perps make up dumb lies every day but mrs witt doesnt seem dumb does she no terrell agreed no i dont think shes dumb at least it aint an nhi thats something huh nhi was shorthand for no humans involved cases involving the scum of the earth dope dealers career criminals subhumans of all sorts terrell was still on the line but you know we sent people to a lot of doors and asked and nobody saw a thing except the fedex truck at and the neighbor who saw jennifer after the shots after the two shots what about the driver of the fedex truck this is all in the file what about the fedex guy you think hes some kind of hit man took the driving job as cover for a day no i well as we like to do we checked him too hes been with them for a couple of years probably still is no what i wondered is if he saw mrs witt in the house when he made his delivery what was he delivering by the way its the monday after christmas what do you think probably a late christmas present you can ask him did he see mrs witt i dont know the husband signed for whatever it was hardy could keep following this road until terrell hung up on him in about another six seconds an overworked homicide investigator and a defense attorney was not a natural pair to begin with but he recalled glitskys comment about terrells fondness for theories and figured it was his only shot to get the man if not on his side then away from active hostility you never knew but when an investigator could tell you something important you couldnt otherwise discover as glitsky had noted some things just didnt make the file hardy began again one last thing if you dont mind what clued you to the first husband well maybe its cause bein a cop an all its my job the fuse was getting critically short hardy had to come up with something or this guy was history look terrell i want to know what i need to know i need some help one cop to another at the silence hardy continued i used to be a cop before i was a lawyer ah the glitsky connection hardy admitted he had walked a beat with abe glitsky after vietnam and before law school he felt a little foolish trotting out the old resume but he knew what were likely to be buttons for police officers sometimes it helped to push them anyway this first husband the guy was poisoned ned yeah so what was that story i mean howd you figure it a gun and poison dont exactly point to the same perp the line of pink over downtown had widened to a blue band under low clouds the sun broke over the oakland hills the coffee old and strong was kicking in from the nursery in the back of the house vincent let out his imhungry cry and there was the soft sound of frannies voice settling him against her hardy has missed a few words but picked it up midthought insurance in both cases i just thought ned was worth another look turns out it was pay dirt and you think it was jennifer thats what ties em ned was murdered then larry and the kid her own kid shit i say fry her rebecca came running through the kitchen doorway in her teddybear nightgown attaching herself to hardys leg and announcing her choice for the mornings breakfast menu syrup juice applesauce syrup pancakes syrup and maple syrup sorry hardy said into the phone its the invasion of the twoyearolds but id like to talk about how you got this if its righteous i dont know id just like to find out flattery the great motivator terrell said hardy could pick a good time and theyd see if they could get together when he hung up he asked his daughter if she wanted syrup with her pancakes she said yes she did syrup was her favorite it was all in the file although terrell told hardy that they had sent out lots of people to question neighbors and other witnesses he had interviewed the driver of the federal express truck himself two days after larry witt had been killed frederico rivera was the twentysixyearold hispanic male who had delivered the package to the witt house at am on monday december he knew it was exactly for several reasons first larry witt had signed his name then looked at his watch and written in the time very precise uptight guy next to the time fred had already written on the delivery record so they had two people corroborating but fred had also been listening to holiday madness on kfwb where they were giving away trips to hawaii if you were the ninth caller after they played the solid gold oldie of the day which this day was two faces have i by lou christie and they always played the solid gold oldie at sharp fred remembered all this because it was only two days ago and the dj had made a big deal about how they only had exactly one hour left so it had to be just as hed gotten back to the truck and he had been trying to figure his route so hed be close to a pay phone at that last critical moment hardy sitting at the dining room table with his copy of the report that hed photocopied in freemans office the day before yelled in to ask frannie if she knew who had sung two faces have i and she said it was before her time it was still shy of seven oclock im only twentyseven dismas nobody my age knows that stuff fred rivera does he told her about lou christie about two faces have i one of the great classics of the pop era hed have to play it for her sometime if he could find it among his ancient s she said she couldnt wait he asked her if shed ever hear the long version and then smiling went back to the file and discovered that none of freds or larrys actions had been really necessary to pinpoint the time precisely federal express uses computerized vans and after each stop the driver entered the delivery information terrell had checked he might have theories but he was also thorough and the login had been at giving fred a minute to finish up with larry and get back to his van fred rivera did not see jennifer in her house at but given his preoccupation with the solid gold oldie hardy thought it was unlikely he would have paid much attention even if she had been parading around naked behind larry well maybe then hardy wondered where matt had been so fred rivera hadnt seen anybody neither had he witnessed any suspicious persons walking up or down the street again not that he was looking mrs florence barbieto called the police at a couple of minutes after she heard the shots the houses on olympia though large were set almost on top of one another no more than fifteen feet between structures she had heard shots then looked out her window to the house next door thought about it for a while walked over and rang the witts doorbell when there was no answer she went back home and called the police hardy thought that sounded more like five minutes than a couple which meant that either the shots were fired at or three or so minutes before then could such a small detail make any kind of difference maybe maybe not the facts were beginning their slow accretion so were the possible interpretations jennifer soon realized that she and the people here werent so different she had not expected that they werent so tough or scary as theyd seemed when shed first been brought in and they were beaten down caged for the most part docile just like her not that it was a knitting bee there was constant vulgarity but she found that almost comforting an acknowledgment of shared feeling of being in this together this was their language in their world and to hell with anybody who didnt like it nobody seemed to care at all whether or not she was guilty of killing her husband but when they heard about her son well it got real to them she could tell and she couldnt blame them everything though still seemed unreal to her the night before after her older moneyhungry lawyer had gone away with the nicer young one she had cried on the top bunk of her cell for hours at pm they locked everybody back in the cells and had what they called count to make sure no one was missing that took the better part of the hour and then they brought the food by then jennifer thought she was all cried out without really thinking about it she took her tray and her plastic utensils and followed some of the other women out to the large common room the tank she set herself down at one of the tables under the television set she couldnt eat any of it meatloaf gravy fake mashed potatoes peas three slices of bread larry would have thrown the plate across the room especially with the gravy slopping over into the peas and the bread she found herself crying again you best eat up honey theys worse shit than this it was a tall almost stately black woman this your first time jennifer hadnt even been sure what she was talking about first time shed had meatloaf first time shed cried she hung her head shaking it from side to side i dont know i just dont know the other woman clara didnt pursue it whatever jennifer didnt know it was all right with her she sat down next to her even asked permission and started to eat saying she was in again for thieving what you in for jennifer put a fork into the meat and brought it to her mouth there was no taste good or bad they think i killed my husband clara nodded unimpressed shit probly deserved it am i right how bad he beat you up i didnt say that he was a good man a doctor and i didnt kill him course you didnt clara went back to her plate dont worry say he beat you they let you go you see get out of here no problem things work out nothing to cry about jennifer didnt mean it but it came out i miss my son clara put down her fork i know i miss my baby too rodney just two but he be some beauty they dont give me more than a year so i do five months and twenty days and rodney stay with else my sister she good to rodney sometime he too much for me so this be maybe some kind of vacation for us both may be thats gods plan jennifer shook her head again my babys gone she said hes dead she felt clara stop eating next to her she put a hand on jennifers shoulders her black eyes liquid and soft oh child they think i killed him too its crazy they say he came in while larry and i were fighting over the gun or something like that its so stupid crazy and theres no bail clara took her hand away her voice was hoarse and low i never heard of no bail jennifer told her shed heard of it now you sure the done the hearing yeah course they have oh honey im so sorry how old your boy matt he was seven they tell me theyre going to ask for the death penalty for you well you lucky there the news seemed to pluck her up jennifer stared at her uncomprehending and clara explained you the wrong color for that girl the dont give no gas to no white woman look like you at breakfast there was clara and the other new white woman rhea grand theft and mercedes murder and rosie aggravated assault and jennifer all of the men and women on the seventh floor were either awaiting trial or convicted waiting for their trip to state prison or another facility mercedes was going to trial in a couple of weeks and had been in jail for four months she had finally stabbed her no good husband because hed been running around on her rosie who had beaten her boyfriend with a rolling pin didnt have two thousand dollars for bail her trial was in six days and she was sure no jury would convict her rhea was about jennifers age size hair color but all the beauty had been used out of her she was telling them how her husband had been pimping her out and theyd gotten lucky or unlucky with a john whod lost his wallet with nearly a thousand dollars in it thats why they went for the grand theft they always lookin clara said whats you bail jennifer asked she had been giving more thought to bail lately if she had threehundredthousand dollars and could get out of jail for a third of that she could take the other twohundredthousand and disappear for a long time forever why did she want to spend it on david freeman just give it to him it didnt seem right somehow five thousand rhea answered so its takin jimmy a day or two to get it together its cool we talked about it you mean you boyfriend hell bring in five thousand dollars and youll just go home tonight or tomorrow and thats it this girl got no bail jennifer was claras story and she wanted to tell it no bail at all rhea ignoring clara seemed to smell something something with jennifer you got no bail is that true dont you want out of here amen to that mercedes said everybody want out of here cept me rosie who had nearly killed her boyfriend was the youngest of them a diminutive sweetfaced hispanic i stay in here as long as they let me you want that rosies black eyes shone at jennifer i want to be where i dont get hit no more amen mercedes said amen amen i get out of here rosie continued next day somebodys going to be hitting me next time he hit me i think i keel that sonofabitch so here and her face brightened im safe nobody hit me i cant hit nobody back i stay a while here i think one of the guards with a tag on her chest that read jessup was moving their way the talking stopped she came over to them you ladies having a nice time sure sounds like it she tapped the table gently with her nightstick her mouth becoming a thin line nearly invisible finish it up now lets eat up jennifer heard her name called over the loudspeaker freeman was not sitting nor was hardy jennifer looked defiantly up at them both freeman who had obviously been through this sort of thing many times before spoke matteroffactly typically a fullscale murder trial will run to between halfamillion and a million in legal fees so yes id say your retainer will be spent then what then what what jennifer after its gone then we go to the court and get paid by the state couldnt they still just pick a public defender then freeman nodded they could but they wont they dont want some new defense team coming in and spending a year getting up to speed by that time well know the case inside out and the court will stay with us how about if we just dont mention my my secret account freeman was shaking his head pacing jennifer without your secret account there isnt any money to begin with so the court then appoints whoever it wants and youve already said you dont want that you know im afraid i dont really understand your problem here youre going on trial for your life jennifer and youre talking about money youll never be able to spend if you dont have the best representation and frankly maybe even with it thataway david hardy thought sugarcoat it he did understand that freeman felt he had to give jennifer a dose of reality but her response made hardy feel that he was going too far her head was going back down in that cowed way she had she was blinking back new tears freeman appeared unaffected by this display but he did stop in front of her and speak more quietly jennifer look at me okay look up all right now listen we are going to do our best to get you off here thats what i do its my specialty you might say and as soon as youre found innocent you collect some fivemillion dollars insurance money but if youre not found innocent well you dont get any of your money insurance or secret account plus you could face the extreme penalty so whats it going to be you decide she swallowed hard and for a moment studied the table in front of her the only thing is mr freeman she whispered isnt it true that if i retain you i wont have enough money for bail at first it didnt even register a minute earlier jennifer witt had been rocked or seemed to have been how her eyes were clear her head was up freeman noticed too this lady was nobodys fool now suddenly there was a sense of gamesmanship in the tiny room hardy was outside of it but freeman sat down and leaned toward her good he said good good what she leaned away from him in her folding chair an elbow going over the back of it freeman ignored the direct question if we can get bail which you remember has been denied already youre thinking a hundredthousand pays the bondsman and you can get out and jump isnt that it jennifer still sitting back silently met his gaze you think your house is worth a million dollars i remind you that you didnt think it was yesterday the threehundredthousand in your secret account wont do it and neither will the insurance youll need at least a million thats relatively liquid and no matter who represents you and what you pay them this is reality bail is a waste of time even if you get it you cant pay it which means im here until my trial is over freeman nodded im afraid thats what it means jennifer took that in pulled herself up to the table and crossed her hands in front of her after a minute surprisingly she began to smile it was the first smile hardy had seen from her and it was quite lovely im going to have to think more about this hardy started to interject but freeman put up a restraining hand fine jennifer fine shall we just withdraw as your attorneys now no i dont want that cant i just have a little more time to be sure jennifer a retainer is needed the court will need to know that youre represented at all times if its not me as ive told you theyll appoint somebody and until your personal moneys gone youll have to pay them too could i pay some say twentyfive thousand now and the rest by monday if i decided to go ahead as opposed to what not go ahead do you want to plead guilty if and its a big if the da will deal it will probably mean life without parole again hardy couldnt read her her eyes were bright alive scared a brave front or i dont know now hardy felt he had to say something jennifer pleading means you say you did it for a lesser penalty you realize that she nodded slowly but youve been telling us adamantly as a matter of fact that you didnt now which is it diz it doesnt matter freeman said not now but hardy had had enough of freemans professionalism he was starting to get involved in the facts in belief or doubt in his own motivations and in jennifers personal story he slammed the table top with a flat hand raising his voice damn it david it matters to me he went back to the client now which is it jennifer and whatever it is lets stick with it jennifer hung her head for a moment or two then raised her eyes maybe i dont think i can win wouldnt that be a good reason to plead freeman said yes at the same instant hardy replied not if you didnt do it well i didnt do it hardy straightened up all right then as though they had decided it long ago freeman opened his briefcase and removed a piece of paper okay jennifer were in business hardy was at lou the greeks finishing his coffee and calling it lunch having long since given up hope that what he had ordered would become edible lous wife was chinese and she did the cooking some of it delicious all of it unique but todays special of sweet amp sour dolmas just flat didnt sing in nearly two hours of discussion with freeman and himself jennifer had not budged she was innocent they were not going to plead guilty even if they could which in its own way was good at least it eliminated any ambiguity jennifer was sticking her attorneys with the classic passive negative defense at every turn demonstrate the weakness of the prosecutions case the burden of proof was on the prosecutor and freemans position was going to be that they had not met that burden period except of course nothing was really that simple as both hardy and freeman had tried to point out to jennifer the prosecutions case on the face of it was not so thin they had physical evidence putative motive even eyewitnesses this was not they had argued some highhanded political vendetta come home to roost nobody had been out to get jennifer witt the evidence had persuaded the grand jury to indict her and it well might persuade a jury to convict the charges involving her first husband ned made it much worse the evidence might be older but the coincidence factor if thats what it was to say nothing of the presence of significant insurance money in both instances would be daunting to overcome at the same time though jennifers position gave freeman a strategy and hardy a concrete direction given their clients demands there was only one course timehonored and true that they could take find the holes if not in the facts then in the arguments interpreting them the fog had burned off but lest sanfrancisco bask in sunny warmth the wind had come up off the ocean hardy stood in the outside stairway four stories up the hall of justice listening to it howl through the structure that one day would be the new jail just across the way abe glitsky opened the door and stepped outside papers swirled and dust eddied he took it all in ive got a nice office not a hundred feet away remember powells in there glitsky nodded all too true he works in this building which i might add you dont exactly what are we doing here diz were having a secret meeting abe i wondered if you felt like taking a ride with me glitskys hands were in the pockets of his parka he pursed his lips and the scar through his lips burned white middle of the week middle of the day sure ill just take off nobodyll miss me i dont do anything anyway abe i need you to prevent me from committing a felony which if i do and get caught hardy stopped him please abe this is a critical time for my life and career if i commit this felony and if i get caught ill lose my license get disbarred frannie will probably divorce me the kids will have to live knowing their fathers a criminal even talking about it my life flashes before my very eyes your very eyes glitsky shook his head and the wind gusted come on hardy said wont even take an hour why do i do these things glitsky asked i think youve got a deepseated need to prove yourself i worry about it sometimes i really do a guy your age my age is your age i know but im younger i look better too its funny but its true glitsky chewed his cheek sad they were in the lobby of the bank of america at the corner of haight and cole hardy had given jennifers power of attorney to the vicepresident a young black woman named isabel reed who did not appear to have any problem with glitskys age or looks she had been checking on the atm withdrawal on the morning of december and returned with the news that the account had been accessed at am and since they were talking about times anyway shed be getting off at if there was anything else they needed to talk about hardy said no he thought that was about it that shed been a big help he nudged glitsky and they started to turn to go im here every day ms reed offered if you need anything else you know hardy stopped just now remembering there is something if you wouldnt mind abraham you think we should calibrate this thing this as hardy had explained to glitsky on the way out here was why he had to come along glitskys badge got them access not just to jennifers account but to the whole automated system while an obliging bank employee ran receipts out of the atm hardy dialed popcorn the number provided by pacific bell that police used for the official time of emergency calls to and checked it against the banks computerized clock on the atm they found that there was a threeminute difference between the times at the bank and from pac bell is that important ms reed asked abe hardy had ceases to exist altogether it could be crucial glitsky admitted in this case but you should have it checked in any event records arent much good if theyre not accurate ms reed nodding and attentive receiving this wisdom thanked them both and gave glitsky one of her cards then clearly as an afterthought she pulled out one for hardy too outside the gale blew and both men leaned into it thats why you do this hardy said through his clenched teeth records arent much good if theyre not accurate glitsky happily married with three children couldnt stop smiling something he did perhaps twice a year driving back downtown glitsky finally spoke i give up he said what felony have i prevented by this astute police work hardy answered straightfaced plan b was for me to dress up like a ninja break into the bank in the middle of the night and do the crosscheck plan b wasnt very good i didnt think it would work glitsky shook his head withholding comment hardy did some figuring when mrs barbieto had called at it had been at haight and cole if jennifer had left two minutes before the call at which was mrs barbietos testimony she would have to have run miles to the bank and access her atm at eight minutes later she couldnt have done that if on the other hand as hardy surmised it was more like five minutes between the shots and mrs barbietos call to emergency jennifer would have had eleven minutes three plus eight which was fast but hardy thought doable glitsky not knowing why had been right ms reeds atm information could prove to be important maybe even crucial he had to go upstairs to the jail again because although jennifer had given him permission to enter her house he had neglected to pick up the key which the sheriff was keeping with the rest of her effects hardy needed jennifers signature so the sheriff would release the key to him mr hardy is it the hand was out and hardy took it it was a surprisingly weak grip for such a big man ken lightner mr clairol with his brown hair and red beard jennifers psychiatrist was standing inside the bars by the elevator as the door opened i was just visiting jennifer weve got to get her out of here she doesnt belong in that you are here to see her arent you hardy explained about the key he didnt warm to this man but he could be polite actually lightner said as the elevator closed perhaps its fortunate that youre here i was going to call you if its about jennifer you should try david freeman hes her lawyer in this matter well freeman lightner paused began again jennifer seems to have a higher opinion of you hardy shrugged what was he supposed to say to that hed let lightner figure out where he was going i mean youre representing her too arent you i have to tell you that if either you or jennifer thinks im anywhere near the trial lawyer that david freeman is youre both mistaken davids a little abrasive okay but thats mostly just his style he doesnt get beat too often and thats where jennifers interests lie what if she just likes feels more comfortable with you there wasnt much room in the area between the elevator door and the bars but hardy backed away a step this is not a comfortable situation doctor im working with david for david im not that involved in jennifers defense on the guilt stage and im a little confused about your role in all this did jennifer ask you to talk to me not directly no im not interested in offending you mr hardy but my main concern is jennifer shes lost upset griefstricken shes very very unhappy shes in jail doctor lightner turned his head abruptly impatient no no i dont mean her situation now here he got a grip on himself spoke more quietly look mr hardy she cant stay here i dont think shed survive a year whatever it might be for the trial in there have you seen of course you have you know what its like and mr freeman tells her to forget about bail why is that in her best interest hardy was losing some of his own patience its about reality doctor id advise the same thing if i were the primary cousel representing jennifer im afraid shes not going to get bail shes not getting out lightner shook his head if she stays in jail i believe its not unlikely that she will kill herself youre talking to the wrong person you should be talking to the judge or the legislature besides i think thats a little extreme jails rough no question but i certainly didnt see any sign of suicidal depression this morning and i was with her for two hours would you know it if you saw it mr hardy hardy knew he had a point there but the man was getting to him i think so now if youll excuse me no listen listen please hardy waited im sorry maybe weve gotten off on the wrong foot but somebodys got to understand whats really happening here lightner said and you know i know ive been treating this woman for four years ive had to prescribe antidepressant drugs during crises jennifer is clinically depressed an obvious if ingenious thought occurred to hardy well doctor if shed been depressed for four years it isnt jail thats doing it to her hardy glanced at his watch now ive really got to go sorry lightner touched his arm and took a deep breath as though making up his mind about a major decision suppose i told you he said his voice low now that she may have actually done it dont you want to know why its what this is all about you said you noticed it yourself one minute shes so smart almost playful the next shes like a beaten victim head down uninvolved at sea she has no appetite shes subject to extreme mood changes lethargic to hyperactive nightmares ruin her sleep all of these are classic signs of clinical depression hardy had gone with lightner to pick up the release the reason hed come up here in the first place and they had ridden together down to the third floor the das floor hardy who used to be employed in the building knew a few of the private spaces and he brought lightner now into the reporters room just off the hall by the elevators here on a thursday afternoon there was no peace no reporters no other people a comfortable clutter amid recycled school desks and old pitted library tables but hardys main interest wasnt in lightners diagnosis of jennifer it still doesnt mean she killed anybody lightner was sitting forward on one of the tables next to the slatted window no it doesnt of itself but im telling you now im afraid she did kill her husband youre sure of that she tell you no but i know and her boy i dont know how that happened it could have been a mistake she might have thought he was larry a sevenyearold boy her own son i said i dont know how it happened the boy might have gotten between them the gun went off i dont know some terrible accident hardy didnt like to admit it had in fact avoided this conclusion each time it had surfaced before now but lightner had a point every day people got killed by mistake with firearms you put a gun in the picture you got the possibility of an accident hardy could invent half a dozen scenarios himself that might have resulted accidentally in matts death except she denies it hardy said but for the sake of argument how do you know why finally an open question lightner pushed his welltailored bulk back onto the table sunlight cut steeply through the motes by the one window fell across the psychiatrists face highlighting reds in the handsome beard he sighed his fists clenched the simple answer he said is to stop larry from beating her hardy was cramped into the seat of a onepiece oldfashioned school desk complete with builtin inkwell around which he was running his finger leaning back legs stretched out straight in front of him crossed at the ankles she says he didnt beat her she says they fought like everybody else but of course she says that but its not true its not true hardy repeated how do i know its not true he held up his roundtheinkwell hand no im not starting in again im asking if youve got any proof any corroboration jennifers admission anything i presume youre telling me this to give her an out an excuse that might clear her if she did it lightner nodded yes but im on very tenuous ground here mr hardy i know that well ive persuaded myself that i can tell you some of what i know things you might find out from other sources given enough time but im afraid i cant tell you how i know it it took a moment before hardy said privilege there it was that familiar doubleedged sword lightners head inclined a bit without my input there still should be records that point to it she never said but i believe she must have switched physicians theyre mandated to report he was right about that hardy knew when the same person a woman say or a child visited a doctor with burns contusions abrasions bruises saying they fell of their bicycle down the stairs walked into a door whatever if it looked suspicious the physician by law had to notify somebody in law enforcement there was compelling reason to suspect abuse hardy asked the obvious question but you knew jennifer was being beaten why didnt you report it lightner was still on his hands an unhappy look on his face were exempt from the mandate she refused to let me she was my patient i was her psychiatrist it was her right so she changed her doctors so they wouldnt suspect or report it anything else neighbors might know how many times have they moved sometimes thats a clue hardy pointed out that all this might be fine but jennifer herself was the most likely source of corroboration about whether or not she was a battered wife and she was denying it youll agree he said this poses something of a problem for us i see that yes of course well i just thought you had to know as you said its got to be her defense its why she did it hardy tried to straighten up in the tiny chair he put his elbows on the desk dr lightner ive got to remind you she denies both battery and that she killed anybody we went over this again and again this morning and she isnt going to go with any battered wife defense not with freeman not with me not with anybody and this leads me to the question why in the world wouldnt she just admit to being battered as you said people are increasingly getting off on this defense these days the precedents are in place we told her that so why since its got a good chance maybe the best chance to save her life wont she agree to it shes embarrassed for a second hardy thought hed heard wrong say what shes embarrassed she doesnt want anybody to know that shes the kind of person who could live with being beaten why wouldnt she just leave exactly now lightner leaned forward into it but dont you see thats the problem they cant leave i know this might come across as socialized slaptrap to you but in some cultures its more socially acceptable than in others to take this kind of domestic abuse but its not among upperclass whites in our culture well now she herself is upper class shes made it and shes not going back what if shes convicted whats she got shes still got her selfimage and youre telling me thats more important than her life i dont think shes ever faced that hardy realized that lightner could be right stuffed into the tiny desk his posture was getting to him he wedged himself out standing so jennifer wont admit she was beaten battered essentially because shes embarrassed thats right embarrassed may be too weak a word mortified is better that she was battered almost ritually beaten and unbelievably maybe even to herself stayed around to take it lightner slid off the table hardy was rubbing his shoulder i dont mean to offend here doctor but is any of this psychobabble i mean how many of your conclusions assuming i independently discover some facts can i depend on lightner didnt appear offended he nodded maybe he thought it was a good question all of them id say in the morning daylight the witt home was impressive the previous night when hardy and frannie had driven by there had been a sense of solidity to olympia way high up on twin peaks most of the street bordered the midtown terrace playground it had been quiet almost ghostly working street lights cast their beams through the early spring foliage of the trees that overhung the street hedges seemed trimmed and fullgrown in sunlight the feeling of sheltered enclave was even stronger hardy got out of his car and stood looking at jennifers home two lots from the park from the south side of the street to the west the pacific glittered and just north sutro tower stretched its rusted arms to the sky hardy thought some of the two and threestory houses could sit comfortably on embassy row landscaped and majestic these were the homes of people who might not miss three hundred thousand dollars if it disappeared slowly enough the witts hedge at perhaps three feet wasnt as tall as some of the others though it was as well kept as any a white picket fence fronted it the gate to the fence was shut but the hedge turned ninety degrees up both sides of the straight brick path to the front door hardy had to remind himself that until two days ago jennifer had lived here coming and going apparently unaware that the grand jury was deciding that there was sufficient evidence to indict her for murder it was an unsettling thought but no more unsettling than when he turned the key a dog from somewhere nearby barked and kept barking hardy stood waiting for its owner to come and quiet it down check to see what had set it off that didnt happen in fact nothing happened and the barking continued hardy could have been a burglar with a sledge hammer instead of a lawyer with a key and no one apparently would have questioned him and this was the block that had produced two eyewitnesses for the time of the murder and more of the fedex delivery truck hardy thought terrell must be one persuasive interrogator inside after another minute the barking stopped the house was white the foyer was of white italian marble with pink striations soft furnishings were modern and white tables and racks were black castiron everything sat on light champagne walltowall carpeting on the walls hardy recognized one of the mapplethorpes that had caused the stir along with a print of goyas mother eating her child up close he studied a couple of other prints or originals that he wouldnt have hung in a locked darkroom much less in the living room of a home with a child on his yellow pad he made a note to make sure david freeman kept the media out of here he had to assume the stuff reflected larrys tastes not hers downstairs everything was spotless antiseptic the kitchen a blackandwhite checkerboard tile and blackandwhite fixtures looked as though it had never been used copper pots gleamed from their hanging castiron rack over the island stove the silence hung heavily hardy found himself walking on the balls of his feet as he moved through the other downstairs rooms the dining room with its black lacquer table and six chairs a library with mostly medical books no novels a lot of history and biography there was a tiny sitting room with a fireplace and a loveseat with a magazine stand endtable but there were no magazines a guest bedroom hardy pulled down the quilt on the bed there was no sheet under it he stopped at the bottom of the stairs jennifer had been living here there was no sign of life he jotted another note to ask her if she had stayed somewhere else during the past months and if so where a month after he and frannie had moved in together he had bought her one of those little tiles at the ghirardelli art fair that read a clean house is a sign of a wasted life that tile hung proudly in their kitchen he didnt need to think he needed to search for where jennifer kept hers upstairs was more of the same to the left was what must have been matts bedroom the bed now made toys neatly arranged the evening sun was going down bathing the room in an orange glow off this was a full bath seahorse stencils on the wall minimal as it was so far it was the only sign of any comfort in the house hardy passed the stairway again stopping to look down at the living and dining rooms below him white black mirrors and metal and a growing dusk whatever else he had to do he wanted to be done and out of here in a hurry the master bedroom was a surprise the yellow police tape was still there no longer in place across the door but lying on the rug he stepped over it and walked to the middle of the room after the police departments technicians had finished with their forensics and the cleaners had repaired the damage hardy was suddenly certain that jennifer had not set foot in this room there were folded sheets and blankets on the beds bare mattress towels on the cabinet by the bathroom door balls of dust in the corners he didnt know if he imagined the remains of the bloodstains it was getting darker so he flipped on the overhead light it went out with a pop there were other lights on night tables on either side of the recessed headboard to the bed and quickly jumpy he got to one of them and hit the button that was better he walked around the bed and turned on the second one leaning down he checked the white rug running his hand over what might have been a stain as part of him had known nothing came up yet it strangely relieved him hardy stood more steady than hed been turning on the adjoining bathrooms light he looked in again no sign that anyone had been in there since it had been cleaned turning off the lights by the bed he stopped at the hallway door for at last glance into the shadowy room where the murders had occurred at the end of the hallway there was another door the last room on the left the overhead light which stayed on this time revealed an impersonal study with credenza files a short bookshelf filled with medical and business periodicals the centerpiece of the room was a neatly organized black tabletop desk with a new leatherbound green blotter hardy sat at it evidently no one had been in here either the dust was thick on the tabletop hardy wondered if the police had inventoried this room realizing there may have been no need to jennifer he remembered had provided the damning inventory forgetting that the gun was missing and of course if she hadnt ever gone back into that bedroom she might have been able to assume it hadnt been missing this could be vital he had to ask her and he scribbled some more sitting the sun all but gone now through the louvered window over the desk hardy tried to imagine what living here must have been like the degree of control and discipline everywhere palpable was he thought the kind of environment that could have produced internal and external paroxysms convulsions there just wasnt any place for release even a gradual release when emotions got too tightly wound here they wouldnt unwind theyd explode he had jotted his last notes on his yellow pad on the desk blotter and as he stared at the rim of the ocean he realized hed been picking at the blotter with his left hand in the upper left corner under the triangle of leather a scrap of paper protruded he pulled it out it was a piece of lined paper from a pocketsized spiral notebook the side was frayed where it had been torn off which seemed a little out of character for larry witt those irregularities in the edge hardy was beginning to suppose should have been intolerable to him he would have cut them off with the precise little scissors on his swiss army knife he smiled scornfully at his imagination there was something more immediate at hand on the paper was the date december and the single word no which in addition to the three exclamation points was underlined twice and circled and under that was a telephone number with a area code downtown los angeles hardy dialed the number law offices naturally he thought he identified himself and asked to speak to the office manager his watch read fivefifty on a thursday night but law firms never slept there was no hesitation the receptionist said that ms klein would be right with him it wasnt immediate but soon enough either ms klein had had an extremely bad day or she was someone hardy wouldnt want to party with im sorry she was saying the message wasnt very clear you are hardy explained again that he was representing a client in the bay area and among the papers in her house had been a document on which hed found the phone number hed called he wondered what the connection might be the firm was he figured that he could play her game as well as anyone crane amp crane and your client is jennifer witt ms klein paused well the name isnt familiar to me a tired laugh but that doesnt mean anything how about the name larry witt he was her husband maybe one of your attorneys would know your managing partner could i abruptly her voice seemed to break no no you cant another pause so long that hardy thought she might have hung up ms klein oh oh im sorry youll have to excuse me please im just to myself this past week i shouldnt even be saying this is everything all right no mr hardy is it no everything is not all right im sorry hardy said the tension in these big corporate law firms must be as bad as the rumors he thought ill try back later no later wont do either i mean now a sob broke im so sorry i mean mr simpson wont be back later hes he was the managing partner hes dead he was killed mesmerized hardy listened as the facts trickled out mr simpson was simpson crane lately managing partner of crane amp crane about a week ago he and his wife were gunned down at their home in pacific palisades simpson crane had been an antilabor attorney and he had been negotiating some contracts the suspicion was she said that organized labor had hired someone to kill crane but the police didnt have many leads and said it was mostly a theory simpsons son todd was now running the firm for the time being but as hardy could imagine it was a very difficult time by the time hardy hung up it was full dark outside he folded the sheet of paper and put it in his wallet leaving the light on in the study he made his way into the hall and down the stairway across the marble of the foyer and blessedly at last outside jesus he whispered driving home partly to escape the feeling of unease that had clung to him at the witts hardy allowed himself to be disgusted that he had used the word document to describe the piece of spiral notebook paper than now resided in his wallet he distinctly remembered the first time hed come on the word document in his law studies the verbiage the pretension the selfconscious importance in short everything about the definition struck him as so ludicrous so plain stupid that he had memorized it the alphabetical order made it easier vowing never to become a lawyer who would use it

vouchers and working drawings papers and files and a partridge in a pear tree and now this piece of paper with a date a phone number and the word no written on it had come out of his mouth like water through a sieve without an editing thought as a document it didnt thrill him rhea the woman who resembled jennifer witt had been yelling and swearing into the telephone at her jimmy for so long that finally when the guard had come in and taken the phone from her hanging it up she just shook her head and walked silently back to her cell jennifer in the next cell propped herself on an elbow on her cot that didnt sound too good that shit after the thirtysecond break rhea was getting her vocabulary back that cocksucker jimmer says ive got to wait another few days maybe a week in here maybe a week shit if hes fucking somebody else ill kill the son of a bitch what did he say jennifer hoped her calm would be contagious that language was all right when everybody was laughing teasing being together but when you mixed anger in it reminded her of too many other times with larry with others with what came next even hearing rhea like this she was getting cramps in her stomach she curled her legs up trying to get comfortable on the stained mattress trying to keep the cramp from seizing about bail that shit rhea picked up the plastic cup that held her plastic utensils and her disposable razor blade and her toothbrush and threw it against the bars rhea stop please stop she did stop raving stopped swearing but when she did it left her standing at the edge of her cell where she crumbled to the floor crying quietly after a minute or two jennifer uncurled herself from her cot and went to the side of her cell he couldnt get bail rhea shook her head quietly back and forth he said it would be a couple of days at the most now he says without me his income is down and its taking longer how do you like that without me his income is down she lapsed again into quiet tears how much would it take jennifer asked the crying slowed went to sniffles stopped what how much did you say your bail was five thousand she nodded why jennifer sat on the floor knees up arms wrapped around them she had already learned a lot about the working of the jail clara knew a lot so did mercedes if you had the stomach and the money for it if you were desperate enough guards could be bribed things could be done it had happened before many times i dont know for sure jennifer said but maybe i can help him get it she spoke as quietly as she could venturing a glance over to rhea if anyone else heard her she wanted to be able to deny having said anything but rhea was listening her mouth half open disbelieving of course youd have to help me if you could halfway out from van ness to the beach miz carters mudhouse had been a landmark on california street for half a century the mud was coffee sometimes thick as turkish and before espresso caught on with the yuppies in the late seventies the mudhouse was the best place for java in the western half of the city miz carters daughter louanne still made her mud the old way loose ground beans stirred into boiling water then strained as it was poured the stuff could jolt you right up which hardy needed he and frannie had been awakened no fewer than six times by their two young darlings doing their tagteam number rebecca with an ear infection and lowgrade fever vincent wanting to be fed it was fun but all and all the hardys agreed theyd had better times glitskys description of walter terrell white guy brown hair mustache wasnt exactly on the money he was swarthier mediterranean somehow not like the guy hardy had been thinking about from school hardy had put his briefcase on the table to identify himself and terrell came and slid in across from him he was younger than hardy had expected maybe thirytwo or thereabouts at fortyone hardy didnt feel old but it was disconcerting that so many people he worked with were starting to be so much younger and that he noticed it terrell wore new reeboks a worn pair of levis and an ironed dress shirt with thin maroon stripes under his members only jacket that fit him neatly in spite of glitskys feelings about terrell and his theories the guy must have put together some kind of record if hed already made homicide after hed had his coffee poured terrell took a sip and shuddered adding sugar like there was no tomorrow what kind of name is dismas he tried the mud again he kept stirring hardy explained for the thousandth time that dismas had been the name of the good thief on calvary he did not mention that he was also the patron saint of murderers only thing i can figure my folks wanted to punish me for some reason when i think they could have named me bill or jack terrells face cracked yeah i know anything but sue trying his coffee again he finally put his spoon down this stuffs awesome he said people drink this every day every day awesome he motioned to hardys briefcase sod you check out ned hardy nodded hed gone over the coroners exhumation report on edward ned hollis last night after theyd put the kids down further endearing him to his wife who after a day with no adult company had more or less expected him to share the evening with her the smile and the awshucks manner werent entirely convincing this was one smart cop he could be as friendly as you please but he wasnt going to be sandbagged by any smartypants defense attorney even if he happened to be a friend of abe glitsky but hardy merely nodded again there was no battle to be won here im trying to get a handle on ned i suppose jennifer doesnt seem to have much to say about him they found the atropine terrell pointed a finger at the briefcase that what it says yeah but so what it was the first time hardy had surprised him what do you mean so what they find a concentration of atropine on the front of the right thigh which indicates it might have been injected right all right well grant that but whats to say jennifer injected him terrell tried the coffee again ignoring its awesomeness he didnt shoot himself up atropine doesnt make you high okay but again so what maybe he was trying to kill himself maybe he succeeded what im asking is if theres anything im missing here because i dont see why this got charged as a murder terrell was visibly holding himself back his face was becoming flushed this got charged as a murder cause it was a murder your jennifer aced him for the seventyfive grand hardy tried to keep it loose im not saying she didnt im just wondering what proof if youve got any proof that she was the one who gave ned the shot i mean how do you even know she was in the room she was in the room she got him tanked up on booze and coke til he passed out then she bonked him with the needle now hes dead the coroner finds lethal cocaethylene and forgets about scanning for whatever else might have killed him like the atropine he stabbed a finger on the table thats what happened mr hardy you can bet on it getting back to mr hardy wasnt a good sign and it wasnt hardys intention to alienate the inspector im not saying it didnt the da bought it they charged it but it seems to me they had to have more on the defense now but softening slightly terrell the new homicide cop was anxious to show hed done it right there was more they did get more i got em harlan poole didnt i her lover the dentist howd you get to him i saw his name in a couple of statements jennifer made in neds file so i went and talked to him eager to explain his technique terrell leaned forward across the table the thing about this police work is sometimes you know you got to have some intuition i mean sometimes you just know what went down right so you go on that tweak things a little and you get somewhere and you tweaked poole terrell obviously enjoyed the memory wasnt much of a tweak the guys successful maybe fortysomething wife and three kids i told him if he cooperated told us what he knew wed try to keep a low profile on him guy cracked like a nut and said what said he missed the atropine one day after jennifer had been in the office for a little late night nookie evidently they did it in or on that guy and his wife dont do it much that way anymore anyway he didnt put it together until hubby ned turned up dead and then he figured jennifer had done it and it scared the piss out of him so gradually he says he dumped her because he thought shed killed ned yeah because she killed ned hardy sat back to grab some time he lifted his cup and knocked back the dregs making a face there was a crucial something missing here let me get this straight he said when ned turned up dead poole concluded that jennifer had killed him is that right terrell nodded well isnt that a bit of a leap i mean he must have had some kind of hit this was on her mind something right sure shed talked about it talked about killing ned hardy shook his head if poole got scared off afterward why didnt he see it coming and dump her before terrell was engaged now thinking it through elbows on the table i guess he didnt see it coming she didnt talk about it as a plan or anything i think afterward he just put it together but why why would it even enter his mind because shed talked about leaving him about wouldnt it be wonderful if he died the insurance all that leaving him and wishing hed die arent the same as actually killing him okay but shed tried to leave him before a couple of times and hed come after her and beat the shit out of her bingo ned beat her too is there any proof of that you mean did she report it anything like that get serious this was good stuff and possibly true but hardy was more than halfcertain that all of it was inadmissible because it was hearsay and twice removed hearsay at that dr poole saying that jennifer had told him that ned had beaten her nevertheless it was a psychological bombshell if it was true that jennifer had killed ned because he was beating her to stop him and to get the insurance she could figure she was entitled to who wouldnt believe she had done the same with larry because the argument was compelling the temptation to compare the circumstances surrounding the deaths of larry and ned would be overwhelming and hardy found himself hoping that powell and the prosecution would get caught up in the symmetry and pursue it because it gave her a sympathetic motive in both cases but he didnt mention this to terrell instead he told him he thought what he had was pretty good friends now or at least amicable adversaries they stood by the counter waiting for their change making small talk hardy asking if terrell had ever noticed the funny coincidences that seemed to happen all the time when you got deep into a case yeah i know terrell said its weird couple of months ago im still in burglary i get a call out in the mission and i go down there and im checking out a broken window when another window across the alley opens up and some guy yells hey wally i look up and its some guy i played ball with in high school amazing but youre right it happens all the time hardy told him about the death of simpson crane in los angeles is that strange or what here im at a murder victims house i find a phone number and call it and i get another murder victim that stopped terrell by the door maybe he just wasnt primed yet to go out into the swirling fog but hardy didnt think that was it howd you say this guy crane howd he get it they think it was some union job a professional hit just like jennifer says with larry hell of a coincidence huh terrell shook his head almost as though he were trying to clear it shake this rogue thought out completely no larry wasnt no hit there wasnt any hit man jennifer did larry hardy didnt want to smile when he set the hook give this man a theory glitsky had said still youve got to admit its interesting terrell tried to shrug it off sure but like i said this shit happens all the time youre right hardy pushed the door open steeling himself against the cold youre right it does a sevenyearold matthew witt smiled up in full color and perfect focus whoever had taken the school photos had done a good job capturing the personality behind the impish face whatever constrictions had worked on matt in his sterile home they apparently hadnt defeated him there was a real smile in the eyes some kidlike sense of jauntiness maybe hed just said something smart to the photographer and was proud of himself but it wasnt a wiseass look it was friendly open a nice little boy aiming to please david freeman was in the shower in his apartment and hardy slumped deep in an ancient red leather chair near one of the living room windows trying and failing to tear himself away from matt there were lots of other pictures in the folder that he held on his lap and he had already gone through quite a few when he go to the boy he had black hair neatly combed and parted except for a cowlick he was wearing a greenandwhitestriped tshirt with a soft collar up on one side and down on the other like puppies ears there was a gap between his two front teeth freckles across the bridge of his nose long eyelashes the beginning of a dimple the laughing eyes were a deep green hardy sat back pulling at the skin on his face staring without seeing anything out the window into the fog he didnt know how much time had gone by when he felt a hand on his shoulder theres nothing we can do about that freeman in a frayed terrycloth bathrobe gave hardys shoulder another gentle shake he was at times surprisingly perhaps sympathetic the tone said so but ultimately pragmatic if you couldnt affect anything if you couldnt act then by freemans definition there was nothing to be done hardy didnt agree it might not produce any tangible result but he thought you could at least grieve barefoot unshaven his wet hair in a grayandbrown mess freeman walked across his living room to the breakfast nook where on a shining mahogany table he had spread his own working papers legal pads binders boxes of cassette tapes currently working a trial planning for a new one cleaning up the loose ends and appeals of trials gone by was this what hardys life was going to become he got a glimpse of it from frannies perspective and wondered if by getting involved with david and jennifer he was making a mistake then he looked down at matt god if jennifer had killed him even by accident even if hed just gotten in the way but what if it wasnt that what if jennifer were telling the truth then someone else was out there someone who needed to die and was walking around letting jennifer go through this hell leaving matt unavenged hardy did believe in vengeance in severe purposeful vengeance it was what had drawn him into police work then into the prosecution business in the first place but and this way he knew he was becoming a lawyer he now believed that before the vengeance he personally had to eliminate any reasonable doubt and this was what drove him now not to sell his soul as a mouthpiece for some prosecution or defense posture for some legal opinion not to argue because he could prevail but to uncover the truth of the matter however it came out he put matts picture face down and went to the next one freeman lived on the corner of taylor and pine one steep block down from the peak of nob hill a floor above one of the oldest and best french restaurants in the city freeman kept his own personal wine cellar in the restaurant and averaged perhaps ten meals there every month his own apartment was modest in size and conveniences two bedrooms living room kitchen with eating nook in spite of his income the place resisted any not to modern technology freeman still used a rotary wallmounted telephone in the kitchen and whenever he played his classical music which was the only kind he listened to it was on longplaying a rpm records that hed bought with his then brand new stereo system in the early sixties the couches and chairs in the living room were comfortable cracked old red leather the coffee and end tables were of some dark wood with lions claw feet the lamps all had shades and most of them were threeway his current trial had been continued put on hold until the following monday because the prosecuting attorney had a toothache and needed to see the dentist so hed left a message at sutter street that hardy should come up it was only a sixblock walk to discuss some jennifer witt matters before the weekend the crimescene shots had been in the file of course and hardy knew there were people who turned to look at them first before they did any reading he wasnt one of them there were twentyseven pictures of the room where the murders had been committed as the photo team had found it although many were shots of essentially the same thing from a slightly different perspective these photographs were as usual competently done by design they didnt strive for artful composition but the focus was perfect the color sharp the angles inclusive there were also eight shots each of larry and matt of the bodies and their wounds on the autopsy table hardy and freeman separately had gone through them all one by one it was quiet work when they finished they spread out an even dozen of the crimescene photos for a closer inspection together both father and son had been shot one time each with a caliber automatic the bullets in common with the five that had been discovered in the clip later had hollow points common enough among people who had bought their weapons for home defense sometimes the argument went you only got one shot off and that shot needed to do as much damage as possible by this criteria the bullets had done their job larry had been shot through the heart the slug at that close range had exited through his back and the core of the original bullet had imbedded itself in the drywall there was a closeup of that section of the wall and hardy was surprised he had missed it completely while hed been there but then he had not by that time been in his most objective state of mind the force of the shot had apparently knocked larry backward onto the end of the bed where he had rolled off onto the floor he had come to rest on his right side his life gone before he had hit the carpet judging from the fact that there was no smearing of the bloodstains beneath him neither hardy nor freeman wanted to view the pictures of matt who had been hit in the head he evidently had been standing by the bathroom door last night the bathroom had seemed antiseptic but in these pictures the bathroom mirror was a shattered spider web the walls dotted with red putting the pictures aside they moved on to the atm the discussion hardy had had with lightner his tour of the witt home the crane coincidence and terrells view of the ned hollis murder freeman pacing the kitchen in his bathrobe took it all in he did not seem displeased when hardy had finished he acknowledged that he had been busy this isnt as bad as it looked yesterday of course it may look worse tomorrow im glad you said that last part you wouldnt want it to look better two days in a row freeman ignored him still our work is cut out for us i had phyllis wire the money over to our account by the way the initial retainer it went through did you think it wouldnt tell you the truth like many other things about jennifer i just wasnt sure hardy decided he wouldnt push it i thought id go talk to jennifer again this morning get some kind of line on larrys work and her family that they never visited i also want to find out about the last couple of months that house showed no sign of anybody living there id like to know if she ever went into the murder room after they cleaned it out none of thats going to be her defense hardy was packing the reports away into his thick briefcase he was going to do what he was going to do and didnt want to argue about it no i know but it might give you something to point at in your histrionic way keep the jury juggling the possibilities the possibilities of who else might have killed larry freeman nodded yes but we dont have to prove or even show that somebody else killed larry mr powells got to prove that jennifer did if she never went into the bedroom to take inventory it eliminates one of their major contentions only if we can prove it we can assert it but you cant prove a negative and the assertion gets us nothing it might get us some doubt you get enough doubts freeman was wearing his dour face well he said were a long way from trial whatever we find out might be useful at this stage certainly this terrell thing that was helpful if powell falls for it hardy snapped his briefcase shut hes already charged the murder he wont back out now hes committed freeman wasnt so confident about that not yet he must have something else thats what id like to find out he must know he cant win on what hes shown us so far he stared for a moment out his kitchen window in any event well know soon enough meanwhile ill take a look at what theyve actually given us and dont misunderstand your idea isnt bad ive used it before myself the old soddit defense some other dude did it freeman nodded thats the one find some other dudes to point at hardy stood up grateful to be moving again you know it is possible shes telling a lot of the truth oh im sure she is freeman scratched his stubble its really very difficult not to let at least some truth out even if youre trying to dissemble freeman paused added straightfaced i said if so larry worked at an abortion clinic so what glitsky was barely listening leaning back in the car seat next to hardy they were going home hey guess what he said its friday night the weeks over but hardy wasnt letting it go so how many deaths and threats do we have so far this year against abortionclinic workers glitsky kept his eyes closed i dont know you tell me okay i will i happened to check this afternoon four in the city since december glitsky opened his eyes homicides were his territory and this fact surprised him deaths deaths and threats combined how many deaths hardy one glitsky grunted closed his eyes again and larry witt would make two it would if hed been killed by a disgruntled antiabortion activist instead of his wife hardy kept driving west the fog had lifted and the wind had stilled and it was a lovely friday night a postcard sunset coloring the sky before them you dont see it huh not if im on a jury course im a cop so i dont think like a juror but what are you going to point at you need something besides ladies and gentlemen did you know that dr witt performed abortions on wednesdays and saturdays you know how mad that makes some people what are they supposed to do with that you dont have anybody okay how about tom the brother hardy had interviewed tom after he saw jennifer in the morning tom had obviously hated larry he wasnt particularly fond of jennifer either he had no idea where hed been the morning of december he hadnt been working so he was probably hanging at his apartment he had never tried to borrow any money from either jennifer or larry or matt either hed volunteered with a sneer the only information tom had provided and hardy had no immediate use for it was that his father would hit his mother regularly hardy had of course already seen phil slap tom finding confirmation that hed also struck nancy wasnt exactly a revelation except that it did verify what lightner had said about the culture of battery getting passed down from generation to generation hardy was still looking for other dudes that freeman might be able to use people who had an opportunity also a motive to have killed larry witt trying them out on glitsky and tom was next up after the hit man that had killed simpson crane in los angeles then the anonymous disgruntled antiabortion activist so what about tom hardy was pushing even he didnt give tom more than about two points out of ten glitsky roused himself okay let me get this out of the way and then we can talk about something else first as he ticked his fingers he didnt ask jennifer and larry for a loan right right so wheres your motive the guys got no record and theres no immediate catalyst everybody agrees these people havent set eyes on each other in a year or so you expect me to believe he wakes up one morning and says hey i think ill go kill my brotherinlaw second no prints anywhere in the house on the gun youll kill your case introducing any of this hardy squinted into the sun the problem is this leaves my client glitsky was matteroffact which could of course be why she got herself indicted the previous monday hardy and his brotherinlaw moses had gone salmon fishing off the marin coast theyd caught two each that night at moses apartment theyd roasted one for dinner a second the sixteen pounder they were going to have that night theyd put in some of moses nearly patented homemade teriyaki sauce to marinate the other two they filleted rubbed with rock salt sugar and cognac packed with some peppercorns and brown sugar wrapped in foil and weighted down with bricks in hardys refrigerator the intended to eat gravlax until they didnt want to anymore or died whichever came first frannie was leaning against the kitchen counter drinking club soda in a wine glass pico morales the curator of the steinhart aquarium and one of hardys longtime friends stood with his arm around his wife angela eating horsdoeuvres the as yet unmarried couple moses and his girlfriend susan weiss were nuzzling each other by the back doorway hardy came in with abe and introductions went around he crossed the room and kissed his wife who turned her face just far enough away from him to deliver the message she was still unhappy hardy knew why and even to some extent understood it this week had featured himself in an abrupt careerpath detour and it would be a while before the kinks got resolved so he didnt really blame frannie on the other hand he was fairly exhausted himself from last nights lack of sleep then a full day of jennifer witt and to top it off theyd planned this party to eat the salmon before they had to freeze it pico and angela moses and susan glitsky and his wife flo so he pretended not to notice frannies slight lifted the foil covering from the glass container on the counter and made a face not salmon again he sighed i guess ill just have a hot dog hardy loved salmon beyond reason he took a knife and cut himself a thin slice all of you youngsters watching this at home dont try this yourself he put the raw slice into his mouth chewing contentedly you know one of the first labor laws ever enacted prevented employers in scotland from feeding salmon to their workers seven days a week susan weiss couldnt believe that is that true that was a real law laws are the mans life frannie said perhaps she meant it playfully and none of the other women seemed to take it wrong but glitsky have hardy a look that was interrupted by the doorbell it would be flo hardy went with abe to answer it moses was regaling everyone for susans benefit about the time hardy had saved his life in vietnam embarrassed hardy was trying to put a face on it come on this guy is shot in the legs and im fifteen feet away and things hopping pretty good all around us am i right moses was exploding mortars and tracer rounds all around him in the air what am i supposed to do let you lie there so i pop up grab him drag his sorry ass back in the hole whole thing took ten seconds he left out getting hit himself believe me that wasnt planned and ps twenty years later the shoulders still a pain moses grinned my legs though are fine when the telephone rang hardy was going to let the answering machine get it but he recognized david freemans voice and got up excusing himself sorry to interrupt your dinner freeman began but this is not good news hardy waited there was a woman named rhea thompson brought in the same day jennifer got arrested freemans voice was hoarse guttural he cleared his throat her bail was five grand and she made it today and walked out of here with her pimp okay okay yourself rheas about fivefour onetwentyfive blond hair blue eyes sound familiar the answers yes hardy waited so what happened so somehow jennifers picture got on rheas housing card the housing the field arrest card was the bailiffs id of choice on the seventh floor you looked at the picture you eyeballed the person they either matched or they didnt both rhea and jennifer had only been two days in jail they werent yet known on sight to many of the guards especially the swingshift guards what are you saying david im saying our client only paid us through monday because she wasnt planning on sticking around after that our little darling has flown the coop jennifer escaped from the seventh floor youve got to be kidding freeman sighed would that i were wrong my son would that i were john lescroart hardy th juror the part two larry granted her fortyfive minutes for the run which was a reasonable length of time he was a reasonable man she tried to tell herself he just didnt want her getting hurt if she fell while she was running and there wasnt any time limit she could be lying somewhere suffering at the mercy of strangers and larry wouldnt know hed have no reason to suspect that something could be wrong this way if she was late hed know he could be there to help her he loved her yes that was the reason for all the limits taking matt to his private school laguna honda twelve blocks away was a halfhour and that allowed for traffic on some days though not any talking to the other mothers that way and it made sense she couldnt get into trouble saying too much the way some women did the witts were who they were in the community because no one had anything bad on them and larry wasnt going to let anything threaten that he was protecting all of them that way not just her for shopping just so long as she called him before she left and then again as soon as she got back before shed even unpacked the bags he could be flexible and she was good at shopping she could get down to the big petrinis on ocean avenue they carried everything and load up a cart and get back home in under an hour sometimes she cheated but that was because she was at her very heart a bad person a rebellious person larry knew she would cheat and he gave her rules so that she wouldnt have time and would be tempted but she still got around the rules even though she knew they were good for her that was just who she was larry loved her in spite of that in spite of knowing who she really was she didnt blame him really if once in a while he lashed out at her if it were her shed probably have killed someone like herself long ago sometimes she wanted to kill herself but that wouldnt be fair to matt or to larry either it was like the time she tried to get away to take matt with her what was that if it wasnt just a cry for help and larry heard her shed never even told ken lightner about that who else would have cared enough to follow her all the way to los angeles she didnt blame larry when he said that if she tried that again hed kill her she couldnt leave him he needed her he loved her he didnt mean to that hed actually kill her in fact after theyd come home that time he didnt even hit her for a couple of months ned had almost killed her when shed done the same thing with him but larry seemed to happy to have her back and he was right about her family too they proved on that first visit or two that they didnt like larry or her either anymore they were just jealous larry said he felt bad about that but it was one of those things you really couldnt do anything about you didnt change people she should know that and she knew she wasnt going to change her mother and father and especially not tom nothing was going to change tom he was just plain nasty and mean well there wasnt any reason to put up with that she and larry hadnt asked for that not from any of them theyd given her family every chance in the world and they just stayed who they were they thought larry hated them and had poisoned her toward them but that wasnt true maybe shed seen things a little more clearly after larry had helped her with the connections helped her hear the betweenthelines insults about her airs or their culture no they were sad to say just jealous people like theyd always been and there wasnt any reason to see them and get everyone upset the things with the banking and with ken dr lightner she was just scared shed always been scared life was scary people changed or the life you were in suddenly went sour and sometimes you couldnt see it coming or do anything about it but she wanted to understand it a little more so shed gone okay sneaked off to ken and he knew more about her than larry knew about ned in fact and he still cared about her she believed that that ken really cared she wasnt just a patient with him of course now well she didnt have to think too much about that that was just another thing and the bank it wasnt that larry wouldnt give her the money if shed asked but it was hard getting surprises for him if she had to tell him what she was spending the money on well at least that was how it had started the account it was easy asking the checker at petrinis to just ring up an extra twenty dollars in cash then fifty then two hundred shopping was just her job and larry didnt check the receipts she opened accounts as mrs ned hollis using her dead husbands social security number and was careful to see that all the taxes were paid that had been a close one the first year and then after that she got the post office box and the form got sent there and it hadnt ever been a problem besides you never did know what if larry somehow lost all his money or really got sued for malpractice like he was always talking about the she could imagine his surprise and happiness when she told him she had all this extra money that had saved them shed been doing it to save them all the family she thought about it sometimes why shed gone away that time besides the call for help shed wanted to protect her face and larry had started to hit her face for a while ken had made her see it differently she thought that might have been it for a while hed had her believing that larry hadnt been good for her that she was her own power and all she had to do was as he put it assert it walk away from larry and take matt with her california law he said would give her custody but ken didnt know how could he know she just felt worthless without larry and the beatings it wasnt larry it was her couldnt she bring the beatings on by behaving badly oh the beatings hurt but they also were what made her feel she was in control of something larry gave her that didnt he well didnt he it was like the time she was planning the party for matts fifth birthday larry was even letting them have kids come over from matts class which he normally didnt like because it wasnt their fault but kids just had no respect for property larry said the way to avoid things getting ruined was you didnt let kids get the opportunity if something got ruined because of a kid it was the parents fault you could bet on that like supposing you let a bull loose in a china shop well whos going to blame the bull is it the bulls fault of course not larry said anyway back to the party telling ken about it when he asked if she was worried larry would ruin the party by getting mad when the kids were there she had said look this isnt an outofcontrol situation ken youre always talking about control well im in control here and shed been right because she knew that larry had been getting the really tense way he got before he exploded so three days before it was a wednesday and the party was saturday she had dinner late and matt wasnt ready for bed when larry got home so he had to help with that after a long tiring day with patients and then shed worn this cheap kmart robe that she knew he hated and when he complained she said something back at him so shed brought it on and he hit her pretty bad a few times but then the good part he was all fine for the party and there wasnt any scene and shed controlled another ken word when it would all happen so to say that as long as she stayed with larry she didnt have any power well ken just didnt see it or maybe he just couldnt understand it but okay the hitting was getting worse more frequent that was a problem it wasnt as easy to cover shed have the bruises on her face now instead of just her stomach and her legs like before lately more and more it had been on the face and that really did bother her her face was who she was when shed been a girl she stared at her face in the mirror for hours getting the expressions right the way she looked when she said certain things now they were all second nature the sort of pout and the frown and the quick smile so larry hitting her face that had to stop it really had to last time it had gotten to that that was when shed gone away run away if she were being honest and larry had come and gotten her hed do that again no doubt about it hed even said hed kill her if she tried like he said if she were with another man same thing hed kill her would he really maybe he would he was strong he did get out of control an accident could happen a bad accident so she had to do something talk to him maybe right afterward thats when he listened the best shed just tell him he had to stop hitting her face ken was right about this one here she wasnt in control she even hated larry now sometimes really hated him and knew it admitted it to herself that part was scary or if it ever spilled over onto matt if matt was there while larry got crazy she wouldnt let larry hit matt even if he just got in the way between them or something if he did that if that happened whatever happened to her come right down to it she deserved it why else would it happen but matt was different he didnt bring things on he was a trusting and honest little boy she wouldnt ever let larry hurt him except how could she stop him that was the question if it ever started how could she stop him on saturday july hardy was bouncing sixmonthold vincent on his knee singing to him at near the top of his lungs he was forty feet above the ground perched on the threefoot parapet that surrounded the roof of moses mcguires apartment house moses was taking it easy lately when he finally gave up on the idea that hardy was going to get tired of the law and come back to bartending at the shamrock he hired a new guy alan blanchard to take over hardys old shifts and this gave him lots of time to pursue his other interests which for several months now could be summarized by two words susan weiss it was early afternoon the sun shone in a blue sky there was a slight warm breeze from the east and susan was sitting next to hardy on the parapet she was an intense darkhaired cellist with the san francisco symphony she wore her hair pulled back in a ponytail and looked about frannies age although she was eight years older she wore a tank top shorts and sandals moses was with his sister at the weber turning ribs hardy passed his boy to susan who started cooing into his face frannie took it all in her glance finally came to rest on susan dont let her hold too many babies thats how it starts moses tugged at his bottle of sam adams how she looks is how it starts he said then the other things happen well the other things can produce babies i have it on good authority uncharacteristically moses took a moment to answer i tell you fran she makes me think about it this didnt make frannie unhappy she liked susan and had to admit she was lovely although moses was in his midforties but she had to know are you serious moses trotted out his usual bartender answer no im alpha centauri sirius is the dog star frannie basted his arm with some barbecue sauce then looked gravely at her big brother this isnt an engagement party is it its not even a party moses was licking the sauce off its just a lunch hardy and susan stood susan was holding vincent to her rocking him as she walked frannie heard her humming tonelessly i warned you she said quietly to moses of what hardy had his arm around his wife you werent even supposed to hear that i wasnt even talking to you hardy kissed her ear well which was it moses butted in she thinks susans going to want a baby of her own just because shes holding one susan nodded she may be right she held vincent away from her making a face at him that he rewarded with a beaming grin oh god someone like this little guy she put her shoulder against moses leaning into him isnt he cute baleful mcguire put his arm around her he appeared to be studying the baby he shook his head no he looks like hardy now rebecca my niece shes cute she resembles my sister who in turn looks like me during this witty exchange hardy stood up to take the opportunity to kiss his wife but moses stopped him uh uh no tongues what do you mean no tongues daddy and mommy have tongues it was rebecca over to join the party she looked up at the adults worried about where their tongues had gone uncle moses is being silly hardy said bad bad bad uncle moses mcguire squatted down in most societies beck the uncle is revered above all other relatives the psychic damage your father is trying to do to you by this display is incalculable should you take any of his nonsense to heart he smiled sweetly at her gave her a kiss i still think this guys cute susan said do you mind if i hold him a little longer frannie gave her brother a knowing look said it was okay with her as long as she wanted there was a little beeping sound whats that moses asked dont tell me an actual relative of mine has a beeper hardy already had it out another family secret bites the dust besides stop calling me a relative frannies your relative he was squinting at the number just let it go frannie said call them monday were having a party this isnt a party moses repeated its a lunch dismas just let it go take me a minute he was moving to the door on the roof i just have to see what its about goodbye frannie said ill be right back promise hardy got there first as he had the time before unlike the time before though freeman was on his way over it was still light out hot and now strangely still on the womens side of the jail saturday late afternoon he was struggling to hold his temper they had frisked him at the door normally to get in the jail he showed his bar card and the guard whom hed seen many times would buzz him in this afternoon though to see jennifer hed gotten patted down and now they were making him wait in the hot and airless room two female guards walked with her this time and she wore a red not a yellow jumpsuit she also had leg chains and handcuffs attached to a metal band around her waist her hair had been cut hacked off unevenly so that an inch or two remained all around her face was blotched her lips cracked both eyes with purplish bruises hardy jeans and a tshirt stood up and she nearly fell against him reaching up until her hands were stopped by the chains she was sobbing what the hell hardy began one of the guards peeled her off him and got her seated in the chair cut the act sweetie you get your hands off my client the guard glared the second one had her nightstick out both of you can back off now these women werent going to be intimidated by a lawyer in blue jeans but it also availed them nothing to harass jennifer in his presence so grudgingly they withdrew when the door had closed hardy leaned forward they didnt do this did they she shook her head no then who down there she mumbled her head down this wasnt the cowed look shed shown earlier hardy thought but real fear something had obviously happened to her glitskys call had filled him in on some of it terrell flying down to costa rica and handling the details of her extradition they were coming in to sfo hardy and freeman might want to be at the jail pretty soon after that what happened slowly she raised her head unlike many of the inmates here her eyes were not empty they were full of pain again she shook her head from side to side tears streaming over her cheeks everything she said they did everything he got back to their dark house in the avenues at pm he stopped in the kitchen and opened the refrigerator the tropical fish tank gurgled from his bedroom he sat at the kitchen table sipping his beer it was an engagement party still dressed in her sundress hair tousled from sleep frannie leaned against the doorpost it wasnt just a lunch of course you missed it so it doesnt matter frannie dont no of course not dont bother dismas his work is more important than any old family stuff i didnt say that i dont think that sure you dont he drank some more beer you want me to sit down and talk about it or you just want to bitch at me i think just bitch at you he steadied the beer on the table looked across at her life wasnt as simple as frannie sometimes wanted to think she tended to lose sight that there were some things going on in the world beyond tow little kids and moses love life youre losing perspective he told her im losing perspective thats good thats really good thank you he said but you know this isnt really a good time for me i dont feel like getting bitched at im out trying to make a living so you can stay here and have the life of reilly and im sorry as hell that sometimes ive got to do things that arent on anybodys schedule things happen shit happens frannie and im supposed to deal with it oh poor thing he stared at her this had just escalated into a stupid fight retreat he picked up his beer took a slow sip then stood and walked back down the long hallway to the living room she didnt follow him fine he grabbed one of the throw pillows and tucked it under his head on the couch where he would spend the night on july the luckiest day of the year hardy woke up in the living room with a sore back he looked at his watch and saw that it wasnt yet six the house was quiet the light subdued he opened the front door and picked up the sunday paper then walking in his socks to the kitchen he took out the castiron pan hed had since college put it over one of the burners and laid in a pound of bacon he moved economically the kinks in his back easing as he crossed the kitchen quietly opening cupboards getting the coffee going mixing up some waffle batter the beck loved waffles the bacon started sizzling the smell coming up he sat at the kitchen table with a cup of coffee for the last four months while jennifer was an escapee hed been working out of the office in david freemans building and truth be told he wasnt having the best time of his life hed gotten several handoff cases from david or his associates perhaps half a dozen hed gone down and pleaded out the other two a disputed dui and a shoplifting were in the snails pace way of these things moving toward a trial sometime during the century worse though was the feeling that he was simply spinning his wheels going through the motions it was similar to being with the das office where you dealt with petty malfeasances and moved them along through the bureaucracy except here he was often from his point of view on the wrong side the other problem and it loomed large was that he had gotten himself qualified by the court for the list of approved lawyers available for appointment and a month ago leo chomorro who had been the presiding judge in his exfatherinlaw andy fowlers case had tabbed hardy as one of three defense attorneys for a penal code section murder where things went south was that hardy studied the file and decided hed be good and damned if he was going to spend six months trying to convince a jury that leon richman had not in fact sat in his ford escort with the other two defendants and fired approximately ten shotgun loads each into damon lapierre who just happened to be cohabiting with leons exgirlfriend aside from the fact that leon had already been convicted of manslaughter once and been acquitted of murder once two sawedoffs and one regulation shotgun had been found in the trunk of the escort shell casings were under the seat leon had bragged to lots of his friends that they wouldnt be seeing damon anymore and four patrons of the woodshack saw leon and the other two defendants leave the drinking hole with the lessthancooperative victim on the night of the murder in short leon did it and hardy wasnt going to help him get off period this hadnt sat well with chomorro did hardy want to be on the appointment list or didnt he if he didnt why was he wasting everybodys time hardy had almost said that he had no interest in defending guilty people but stopped himself before saying it those words would have given him immediate status in the hall as a legendary horses ass instead hed mumbled something to chomorro about a conflict of schedules and the moment had passed but hardy knew it would come again and he knew hed feel the same way do the same thing it wasnt a comforting thing to think rebecca appearing silently at his elbow interrupted his thoughts hi daddy why are you up so early he put his arm around his adopted girl the natural child of frannie and her first husband eddie cochran eddie had been killed on the day frannie had found out she was carrying rebecca hardy pulled her closer to him he couldnt imagine that a blood tie would make any difference rebecca was his daughter he lifted her onto his lap and she snuggled into him for six seconds before she started squirming which was close to a worlds record why are you up so early he asked this was a serious question carefully pondered daddy you know i always get up early and thats why you did today the beck nodded mommys still sleeping she whispered this apparently was confidential information lets let her okay well have a little special time just you and me together how about some waffles maple syrup hardy tugged gently at her hair kissed the top of her head okay maple syrup head maple syrup frannie and hardy sat on a crumbstrewn blanket in the shade of the overhanging addition to their house that they had built when theyd discovered vincent was on the way the lawn was deep and narrow flanked by fourstory apartments but to the east over their redwood fence on this clear day they had a view all the way downtown the transamerica pyramid coit tower the bay bridge the east bay hills it was a fine backyard for the six times a year it was warm enough to use rebecca preoccupied was building something in her turtle sandbox vincent slept in the portacrib they had brought down for the occasion they had kept from acknowledging the fight all morning then through the lunch with the kids now in the long slow slide of the warm afternoon it lay heavily between them hardy stared across the distance frannie picked at the crumbs finally she reached over and put her hand on his leg i just didnt think it was fair to moses hardy covered his wifes hand relief flooding through him i love you you know i know i didnt know about moses and susan as he kept saying it was just a lunch frannie was silent then he wanted to surprise us i think it kind of hurt him ill call him tell him it worked im pretty surprised theyre really getting married frannie nodded september and having kids all that thats what they said she moved over against him i was just upset hardy let out a long breath what do you want me to do in that situation of course i care about your family but sometimes no dont start that again please thats what you said last night every time the job calls you dont have to drop everything and run i havent been doing that at least not for the last four months not really since andy fowler but now heres another murder trial and it starts again hardy took a beat he wasnt going to let this escalate again fights with frannie made him physically sick murder trials are serious frannie murder trials are not like too many other things this is not just a job this is after all somebodys life and you get to know them and then they call and need your help what do you want me to do what do you think i should do with her free hand frannie picked at some more crumbs brushed the blanket do you really think ive got the life of reilly here raising the kids not working is that an answer to what do you think i should do she was still looking down smoothing the blanket no i think thats an entirely different question okay ill do yours first ill give you the short answer the short answer is no he felt her shoulders give the long answer is we think the kids should have a parent at home as long as we can afford it and we can so youre doing it as long as you want to be i do want to be he squeezed her hand no problem if you get tired of it well do something different okay maybe ill stay at home frannie gave him a look hey it could happen the point is sometimes ive got to do things when ive got to do them not when its convenient yesterday was one of those times you think id rather go down to jail on a saturday afternoon than hang out and eat ribs with you and the mose no correct i wouldnt but youre going to stick with this one arent you jennifer witt even though she ran away escaped even if she did it shes facing the death penalty fran i dont blame her for running away although i dont think it was very smart juries do make mistakes if they make one here its pretty terminal she might be mixed up hell she is mixed up but shes a real person not just a case maybe thats what im worried about dismas that shes a real mixedup person who might have killed two men shes involved with plus her baby maybe im even worried about her finding some reason to kill you he put his arm around his wife clients dont kill their lawyers fran this was not a brilliant riposte just a week before a madman whod been dissatisfied with his lawyers had walked into the offices of one of the citys big firms in the middle of the afternoon and started blowing people away frannie gave him the eye for a minute i thought i heard you say that clients dont kill their lawyers not often enough to worry about in the sandbox out in the sun rebecca had started destroying the castle shed built kicking zooming in like a kamikaze on of the apartments in the building on the right had opened a window and turned up the stereo bonnie raitt was telling the neighborhood that shed found love right in the nick of time hardy told frannie he felt the same way why would you take a plea now freeman brought in hardy with the questioning look after jennifers jailbreak they had both expected the da to take an even harder line on jennifer and now dean powell had contacted freeman and hinted at a willingness to take a plea to murder one no death penalty powell spread his arms expansive and at ease hell you know david were always ready to talk he pointed a finger underscoring the point you guys remember that my doors open my client says she didnt do it freeman was flipping through a sports illustrated barely paying attention powells office was the usual fifteenfootsquare cubicle two metal desks file cabinets a window welded shut with a charming view of the new jail going up thirty feet away powells officemate paul bargen had stepped out for coffee so there would be privacy to say nothing of room for three people if she offers to plead guilty to life without of course ill have to take it to the boss but i think its fair to say wed take such an offer seriously i heard powell went on that your client recovered from her amnesia down there in costa rica and now wants to throw herself on the mercy of the court i dont think thats it hardy had originally taken the second chair in front of bargens desk but one of the legs was shorter than the others and it listed uncomfortably so now he was standing i just dont think thats it powell shrugged id ask her again just to be sure freeman had stopped at an ad for a womans swimsuit he lifted the page toward hardy spoke to powell i thought you wanted a trial by the way im voting for you substantiating the rumors powell had recently declared his candidacy for state attorney general and he now broke out his toothy grin for a moment hardy thought he was going to jump up and try to shake both of their hands well that just delights the hell out of me david i cant tell you he glanced over at hardy who kept his arms folded his face impassive leaning against one of the filing cabinets freeman flipped another page seemed to be studying an editorial that had barry bonds in the headline he didnt look up and you dont want a capital trial seems to me it would be pretty good copy thats always true david but frankly i dont think i need it to be perfectly honest id rather use the time to campaign hardy couldnt help noticing that powell said frankly and to be perfectly honest in two consecutive sentences powell was lying about something he obviously didnt think the verdict for jennifer was all that foreordained but freeman wasnt showing any cards for free he scratched a stubbly cheek turned a page of the magazine sighed its up to my client finally freeman put down his reading and made eye contact what the hell did they do to her anyway dean she claims she was raped in jail down there i truly hope she wasnt david but she shouldnt have broken out of here that was her choice her risk id think you might out of a little human sympathy for what shes been through maybe without a plea at least drop the death penalty powell showed no surprise strategically this wasnt a bad move for freeman his client had been abused perhaps raped freeman knew he had seen her and jennifer witt was at this moment an object of some pity but all this got processed in the time it took powell to blink twice i have no sympathy for what shes been through he said shes brought it all on herself she asked for it huh getting raped if powell said anything like that under any circumstances he could forget his election chances thats not what i said david and you know it freeman of course did know it hardy not for the first time was glad he was in the same corner as freeman the threat that he might repeat powells words in some public forum that jennifer had asked for getting raped might break the deadlock hardy halfexpected powell to cave drop the death penalty request and offer a plea for murder one maybe even with the possibility of parole if jennifer took that there would be no penalty phase and hardy would be out of a job he waited but powell didnt get to where he was the senior homicide assistant district attorney by wimping out he smiled in the face of this veiled threat my heart just doesnt go out to multiple murderers and anything that happened to her outside of this jail or this country well he spread his hands thats completely out of our control ill be investigating what happened in costa rica i would too id expect you to let me know if i can help you that kind of conduct is unconscionable back to posturing and politics hardy picked the sports illustrated from freemans lap opened it at random whatever else was going to be said here he didnt need to hear it the yerba buena medical group owned a square block of buildings that housed their professional offices half a mile from san francisco general hospital hardy got there a little after eleven it shocked him there was actually a free parking lot provided for guests doctors and patients downtown in north beach in golden gate park throughout san francisco lot parking was running four dollars an hour with a twohour minimum street parking could not be found people had been shot over twelve feet of curb space following the signs through a landscaped maze of shrubbery and vine hardy stopped at a redwood kiosk inside of which was a glasscovered granite pedestal the directory of offices including a youarehere arrow more than forty doctors practiced here larry witts name was gone probably long gone it had been over six months since he had been killed hardy reflected that the wheels of justice had not yet turned one degree which was about normal for half a year and it didnt look like things were going to speed up jennifers flight hadnt predisposed anyone in the hall to do her any favors she was in lockdown with visiting and phone privileges drastically reduced she said even her food was worse if that were possible it wasnt necessarily on the books but in practice freeman and hardy were finding out that breaking jail constituted a pretty solid waiver of a lot of your rights freeman had been told that due to bureaucratic complexities over the extradition jennifer couldnt even get a preliminary trialsetting date for another week the good weather was continuing and the air conditioning in the business office felt good hardy found himself impressed with this whole operation his vision of the world hmo health care especially here in the city was bleak anonymous doctors and nurses dispensing care to people they didnt know in perhaps antiseptic but nonpersonal surroundings ybmgs reception office had light green tinted windows all around the couches were covered with soft cushions and cheerful fabric swirls of yellows and oranges and reds and blues a berber rug not the ubiquitous yellowing tile hardy always expected kept it quiet as hardy walked to the desk he had no appointment so he would have to wait but mr singh would try to be with him shortly more sports illustrated the same issue powell had had in his office forget july today july was his lucky day he considered buying himself an extra lottery ticket ali singh had answered hardys first questions competently enough but had his tiny hands crossed on his empty desk as though this would prevent him from tapping his fingers or twirling a pencil or otherwise betraying his nerves dressed in a white buttondown shirt thin brown tie new electric sportscoat he was nodding acquiescent of course you see the police have already been here they have asked these things hardy leaned forward ive reviewed everything theyve subpoenaed mr singh his office files the interviews i was wondering more about the personal things how he got along with the other doctors nurses that kind of thing well that is i dont know i didnt really know dr witt personally as you say you see we have a lot of doctors here they dont work together too often its not like a kaiser operation as you can see so you didnt know him at all well of course you see we talked about administrative things his help and so on but he had his work i have my work singh raised his eyebrows unclasped his hands for a split second put them back together but no problems singh smiled there are at times problems with everyone doctors have egos you know they want things one way their way and i have to try to standardize so of course sometimes there is conflict but nothing so serious with dr witt i liked dr witt occasionally we would spar over cost issues how we did things and how would you do things how would it affect him more than anyone else it didnt that was always my point but the group he gestured around taking in the whole complex the group had plans has plans you see we have nice buildings here pleasant wouldnt you say hardy nodded and this is a nice environment just so you see but this of course the landscaping the furnishings even the rent here this takes money from the fund and and dr witt thought that that money should go to the doctors now singh beamed at hardys understanding ah you do see just so it is just so unclasping his hands singh finally sat back in his chair dr witt liked to feel he had a say in these things in many matters he waved a hand this is not a criticism he was not alone in this he had a need to know to feel that he was somehow in charge with his business of where the group was going this certainly comported closely with jennifers analysis with lightners opinion with the fedex mans report larry witt had been a control freak so where was the group going is singh amended the group is converting to a forprofit organization we have notforprofit long enough the board feels to compete in this health market we need to attract capital to do that we must be attractive and sad to say part of that is the physical setting you would think the quality of the care is the thing but that is not business singh sighed its reality and the members the doctors were asked to take a shortterm loss no raises that kind of thing you see hardy saw times were tight everywhere but especially in health care and especially in california the move on the face of it made sense in the long term but he also understood why there might be resistance in the short term no raises less money bite the bullet wait wait wait from all hed heard waiting and deferring werent larry witts strong suits did dr witt fight with anyone about this get mad lose his temper dr witt oh good god no he never lost his temper you can ask anyone here he was always courteous always reasonable even if he wasnt backing down nothing here was to get mad about minor differences among professionals dr witt had no enemies here he was liked looked up to but somebody killed him could he have been having an affair with a nurse with one of the doctors wives singh was shaking his head an amused look on his face thoroughly at ease now he leaned forward it was no one here believe me mr hardy i think it must be his wife you see this freeman said is called a coveryourass affidavit and this he lifted his other hand is a check for two hundred thousand dollars hardy was in his office feet up on his desk thinking about where he was going to mount his dart board he had been here in freemans building for nearly five months and during that time what with feeling he should put in some regular hours and his growing family responsibilities he realized his dart game had gone to hell he had pegged a round of darts into the drywall and freemans mouth hung slightly when he saw them there ill patch the holes and cover it with my board then switching topics if i were her i think i would have spent more in costa rica freeman crossed to hardys open window a view of buildings across the way and four flights down the afterlunch show on sutter street i think she was in a hurry when she left he said that could have been it also she told me the bank wouldnt give her more than ten grand in cash on no notice so she took that and ran figured shed wire for the rest or something which was a bad idea that how they found her hardy asked freeman nodded looks like but the good news is shes with us all the way no more waittilmondayandilldecidethen bullshit hardy sat up feet to the floor rolled his shoulders i dont know i feel pretty bad for her david freeman turned from the window and fixed hardy with a look he seemed short on sympathy for jennifer witt why dont you go interview her again like i did for two hours this morning hardy leaned back in his chair hands crossed behind his head tell me she wont plead she wont admit her husband was beating her she wont talk about her escape who helped her out maybe get a little slack on that at least something to deal with but no not our girl she just didnt do it the end hardy pointed so whats the affidavit this freeman went around to hardys couch and sat down this is jennifers signed statement that i have advised her that her best defense is bws battered yeah yeah batteredwoman syndrome and that she but you dont believe yeah i do now shes gonna go down for the murders so im thinking about how to get into mitigation as early as i can i tried to drive that home and what do i get not much freeman shook his head hed never understand lay people exactly squat she didnt do it shes not pleading he reached inside his wrinkled jacket and pulled out a cigar jamming it into his mouth i tried to tell her it doesnt matter if she did it i can get her off on bws he shook his head again stood and walked back to the window maybe it matters to her well of course freeman was patting his pockets found a pack of matches stepped back from the window and lit up putting the cigar into the flare you know hardy said you ought to wave the cigar gently back and forth an inch above the top of the flame and dont inhale while youre lighting up freeman glared at him through the thick blue smoke but ill be goddamned if im going to let her get an appeal on my misrepresentation if i know shes been beaten and i dont bring it up its reversible and im not letting her or anyone else pull that on me hence my son this affidavit do you know shed been abused does she admit it no but it doesnt matter its a defense it can get her off damn it or at least give her the best chance of getting off its also admitting she did it mrs nancy distephano could not see hardy while she was working but he could meet her afterward if he wanted if he thought it might help jennifer since he was passing by with time to kill anyway hardy had dropped in at the office of curator pico morales in the basement of the steinhart aquarium and told him he was getting fat he ought to get out more take a walk exercise pico contended he wasnt getting fat he was actually in good shape except for his hyperextended stomach nevertheless he got up they were strolling along the paths in golden gate parks japanese tea garden across the concert grounds from the aquarium less than two hundred yards as the crow flew from the little shamrock there was serenity here when it wasnt crowded and it wasnt now huge koi swam lazily in the artificial streams the water trickling and gurgling over mosscovered rocks and small waterfalls the stillwarm sunlight came dappled through the cypresses pico had been listening to hardy talking about the atm and didnt think it was very clear so larry witt was alive at right you know that what time were the shots lets say between and and who told you about this difference between times and the bank times nobody i went down with abe and so this da whats his name youre telling me he doesnt know what about the cops pico walked on a few steps before he noticed that hardy had stopped he turned back to him what i am really stupid pico nodded now were getting somewhere hardy ran it down out loud to hear how it sounded no listen youre right forget time jennifers at the bank at right larrys definitely alive at take away two or three minutes for larry to walk back upstairs call it or even later when he gets shot jennifer is at the atm at not eight not eleven minutes later pico was shaking his head see all this worrying about the truth if the da doesnt know about the three minutes im not sure the da even knows about the stop at the atm pico spread his hands well there you go you win no way could she have made it miles in a maximum of eight minutes even if its all downhill i believe you pico said being faster than a speeding bullet myself i could have done it but your average bipedal human nancy distephano stood him up he was meeting her at fivefifteen outside the real estate office where she worked as a secretary the office was on kirkham near th avenue and it was closed up when hardy arrived he doublechecked the address the time the crossstreets no nancy after fifteen minutes he called it a day debated with himself whether he should go by the shamrock and apologize in person to moses decided not got in his car and headed home i want to meet her who you know who i would just like to meet her frannies red hair hung long and shiny shimmering in the evening sun they were walking along clement street hardy with vincent on his back in a pack rebecca running ahead stopping at driveways alleys and corners the way she had been taught frannie caught hardy with a sideways look you said she was a person not a case remember it would just make me more comfortable rebecca out of the street rebecca had dropped a toe over the curb she pulled it back turned around smiling just teasing that is nothing to tease about hardy said the street is dangerous we hold hands crossing the street rebecca knew this she gave her mother a conspiratorial glance and slipped her hand inside hardys i dont think its a good idea he said what mommy and daddy are talking honey we can talk about it later dismas no nows fine we ought to be able to have a small discussion without being interrupted dont you think and i dont think its a good idea i dont even know if youd be allowed to or if jennifer would want to see you whos jennifer hardy let go of the becks hand you can run ahead now but whos jennifer do i know her jennifers one of daddys clients sweetie doesnt she like you she doesnt know me i want to meet her hey hardy the referee making hand signals time out all right this is our discussion beck enough i mean it you dont have to yell at her hardy was trying to keep his voice under control im not yelling at her im trying to teach her not to interrupt this is a useful social skill vincent suddenly startled let out an anguished cry great hardy said this is just great rebecca arms outreached mouth open broke down she clung to frannies legs wailing heres an idea lets give them to moses and susan for two weeks hardy drank gin about twice a year and figured this was the night for it bombay sapphire on the rocks with two olives they had gotten the children down to bed it was still light outside not yet eight oclock and still warm they were sitting together on the front steps waiting for the pizza to arrive holding hands the door open behind them so they could hear if anyone called or more likely cried i dont think two weeks is enough frannie was having a glass of white wine the childrens crying jag had lasted nearly an hour if they rally want to get the flavor moses lives close hardy was running with it we could visit them all the time he sipped at the cold gin so smooth it almost wasnt there speaking of visits hardy shook his head jennifer again i dont know fran i dont see what good it would do what the point of it is it would just set my mind at ease thats doing some good you dont really think shed try to get at me do you i mean we went through the same thing with andy fowler i knew andy dismas or at least who he was a judge your exfatherinlaw plus you got him off this woman she shivered brought her glass to her lips all i know about her is what ive read which is shes a moneyhungry coldblooded dropdead beautiful shes not that pretty shes nowhere near as pretty as you frannie leaned into him mocking the flattery well then shes the most photogenic not pretty woman on earth but what she isnt to me is a real person somebody i shouldnt be afraid of worried about what if she wont see you then she wont see me she was right if jennifer wouldnt agree to see frannie that would be the end of it the gin that almost wasnt there was telling hardys body that oh yes it was too the evening had taken on a soft edge a benign glow he told her hed ask see what he could do it was a small enough request if it made frannie feel better how could it hurt when he had tried to contact nancy distephano earlier in the day asking her to call him back for an appointment hardy had not known what his schedule would be like sohe had given her his home phone number as well as the one in his office she called at a little after nine her voice a whisper hoarse nearly inaudible mr hardy she told him where she was would he please come and see her now there might not be another chance when he told frannie he was going she did not do cartwheels ulloa street was dark hardy had had his one martini switched to cranberry juice and the earlier glow had dissipated with the warmth the distephanos house was in the block two blocks from the cold pacific he pulled up in front of the number she was wrapped in a jacket wearing jeans but barefoot sitting in the dim porch light on her stoop when hardy got out of his car she walked unsteadily down the cement walk that bisected the lawn meeting him halfway she touched hardys sleeve then immediately pulled her hand away as if it were burned he wont hear us here not that he would anyway thank god hes passed out she was shaking hardy wondered if she were drunk whos passed out phil of course she laughed low nervously who do you think listen im sorry about tonight our appointment she wasnt slurring i thought we might but phil hardy waved it off his eyes were adjusting a sliver of moon gave a little light there was a lot of jennifer in her face haunted but still attractive it was unnerving she stepped in place foot to foot seemingly unaware of it but i thought it might somehow help my girl it might i dont know are you all right she leaned again in an unnatural way gripping her side maybe we should sit down without waiting for him she went back to the entryway it wasnt a full porch more a jutting covered portico enclosed by a low stucco wall she leaned up against one of the posts mrs distephano she held out her hand for him to be still breathing her way through whatever pain she was enduring when she could handle it she tried to straighten herself and halfturned back to him her eyes were wet but seemed way beyond tears summoning something the effort was palpable she pulled herself straight then turned all the way to face him headon raising her head she inhaled deeply making her decision and pulled open the jacket shed been wrapped in under it she was naked her body her breasts her ribs her stomach was bruised and welted in half a dozen places he stood transfixed two feet away from her feeling his body begin to pulse in anger fistsized blotches splashes of broken capillaries the rake of handprints over torn skin he stepped toward her grabbed the sides of the jacket and gently pulled it closed around her lightner had been right about jennifers abusive father she leaned back against the porticos post and let herself slump to the tiles hugging her arms to herself i told phil i told him it was for jennifer it might help jennifer i wasnt sneaking out he said how come you didnt try to talk to him hardy held his head in his hands this was twisted beyond his imagining jennifer suggested i talk to you if she would have said him i would have agreed i know that i told him that or tried to i didnt mean to put you in this she touched his arm again no no its not you this is just what happens hardy raised his eyes you should get out of this youve got to report this nancy distephano shook her head she was still hugging herself still moving her body to ease the shifting pains her look said hardy didnt know what he was talking about where would i go what would i do go anywhere he said do anything but dont live with this she kept shaking her head but phil would never let me never he wouldnt even let me see you you could move away ive tried that but you know i always come back its a tough world out there mr hardy here at least i know somebody cares about me someone who cares about you wouldnt do this to you its not so very often i understand hes mostly afraid hell lose me i tell him no but hes so jealous i wouldnt have called you maybe shouldnt have but if it could help jennifer did phil ever do this to her jennifer no he wouldnt ever lay a hand on her i think if he did i would have left him and he knew it he couldnt stand me to leave him no all this she gestured downward this is all between me and him it has nothing to do with jennifer hardy stared at the ground at the sliver of moon this woman defending the man who had just beaten her hes so jealous he tried to clear his head so what now nancy she shrugged i didnt even mean for you to know about this its nothing okay its nothing you wanted to talk about jennifer if this hadnt happened i suppose i shouldnt have told phil and just snuck out to see you its really my fault the reprise the repetition the denial its really your fault thats it huh was it the same for jennifer nancy nodded apparently grateful that he seemed to understand so we can forget this and just talk about what you wanted before cant we just do that hardy tried he sucked a lungful of the nowchilled night and tried to organize himself enough to talk to her about tom he couldnt as he sometimes did abe glitsky arrived unannounced at the front door when frannie opened it for him he stepped back and whistled my my my frannie was wearing a blue skirt and a plain white blouse low pumps nylons she had touched her cheekbones with subtle highlights they scarcely needed her eyes were malachite set into the alabaster of her skin the red hair softly styled fell to just below her shoulders whatever it is he said youll do frannie curtsied smiling you dont think its too much you panning for gold playing soccer mudwrestling frannie looked serious no im meeting somebody i think for meeting somebody youre on safe ground they were walking to the kitchen it was a smallish railroadstyle victorian house one long hallway with openings to the living and dining rooms off it to the right a bathroom to the left in the back the house opened up into a pod of rooms airy skylit kitchen hardy and frannies bedroom with another bath rebeccas room hardys old office off that to one side vincents nursery to the rear hardy was coming out of the bedroom a mug of steaming coffee in his hand he was wearing the slacks to one of his better suits a white shirt a silk italian tie glitsky stopped in the kitchen doorway i must have the wrong house where are the kids were taking a day off frannie said their grandmother came and got them ill be back in a minute you want some tea frannie disappeared into the back room glitsky was getting the hot water who are you meeting hardy was still shaken by nancy distephano hed told frannie about it when hed gotten home then sat up alone in the living room not able to sleep for a long time and now here was abe dropping in wanting to know who frannie was meeting abe wouldnt approve of frannie going to get acquainted with jennifer witt if you were smart and in any aspect of law enforcement you didnt mix your job and your family life the problem was that hardy didnt feel like getting into a defense of why he was going along with frannies idea when he knew it wasnt a smart one i thought id drop frannie off downtown and later wed go someplace nice for lunch what brings you around it slid right by glitsky wasnt in his investigator mode when very little got past him ive got to go see this couple about a gun they left laying around for their kid to find and play with he tightened his lips the scar shone white he didnt need to say more abe was in homicide and homicide meant that somebody wasnt alive anymore its out this way so i thought id stop by here and liven up your morning you back with jennifer witt frannie and the three of them talked for twenty minutes while glitsky finished his tea hardy and frannie another cup of coffee hardy never mentioned the threeminute difference in times between the atm machine and by this time he was convinced that it was evidence in a murder investigation and if he revealed that it could be part of the defenses case abe the policeman would be bound to report it to the prosecution but who are you jennifer in her red jumpsuit looked through the plexiglas window in the publicvisiting area at the womens jail frannie was no longer sure about this the woman across from her was certainly no threat to anyone at this moment nearly anorexic with bruises on her face her hair chopped at different lengths her eyes skittish here was a woman frannie thought who doesnt trust a living soul im frannie her mouth dry tried to swallow im with mr hardy i know youve already said that thats why i came out here but then how come were not in the visiting room frannie didnt know she thought they were in the visitors room she didnt know that this long counter with folding chairs plexiglas windows the telephones to talk through wasnt where hardy and jennifer had their interviews im i guess its just im not an attorney so this isnt official or anything suddenly she understood why hardy hadnt come with her to introduce the two of them what could he have said hi my wife just wanted to come down and check you out to make herself feel better she was a little worried youd get out of jail someday and try to kill me she felt like a fool and she felt angry dismas has humored her to teach her a lesson a cruel one that he might have argued her out of but then she realized that she wouldnt have let him do that she could be as strong and bullheaded as anyone she had decided she was going to meet with jennifer and by god she wasnt going to back down that had been her position and now she was stuck with it jennifer waited her eyes now fixed on frannie pained eyes frannie suddenly thought of the son matt what if this woman hadnt killed anybody she had lost her son and then got raped and beat up in a costa rican jail i know this is unusual she said im mr hardys wife frannie hes told me whats happened to you and i just wondered if i could do anything to make things easier the cityrun mission hills clinic was about midway between the hall of justice and the yerba buena medical group cluster on mission street but not particularly close to any hills hardy stood across the busy thoroughfare and watched for nearly ten minutes judging from the signs people carried there were he decided two separate picket lines one protesting the abortions that took place here the other comprised of publichealth workers who were being laid off due to cutbacks in the city budget the groups orbited in their own spheres which warily circled each other moving from one front door of the building to the next one and then back again the dance almost appeared choreographed in the months jennifer had been at large hardy had remained subliminally aware of the ongoing escalation of the antiabortion activists since hed had his discussion with glitsky a city worker in the sunset clinic had died when shed had the bad fortune to be working after hours probably the people whod left the bomb hadnt intended anyone to be there when it exploded just trying to make a point theyd say the unlucky worker wasnt any less dead for the good intentions a doctor and a nurse had had their homes vandalized windows broken threats tied to rocks or tagged graffitid on stucco there had been at least six reports of muggings of publichealth workers after they had finished their shifts although no one was saying whether these were typical latenight random acts of violence or related to the clinics larry witt had done volunteer work here performing jennifer guessed between two and five abortions per week it was something jennifer said he believed in people shouldnt have unwanted babies the biggest problem the earth faced was overcrowding a child born to poverty and neglect would most likely stay there it was tragic and hardy believed all of it but the moral dilemma of when life started and beyond that the value of human life itself wasnt going to go away soon for an irish excatholic he strongly believed that people ought to be able to choose but he also didnt particularly approve of abortion on demand as a form of birth control at the very least he thought people ought to make a decent effort to remember what they forgot last night but people should also make a decent effort to remember not to shoot each other and that didnt seem to be happening with any great frequency either he crossed the street feeling overdressed in his suit there wasnt another coat and tie on the block the people in the picket lines male and female wore jeans and tshirts er and giants jackets running shoes boots and birkenstocks timing his approach he crossed both lines and entered the building without incident inside the clinic was along the lines of what hed expected and not seen at ybmg yellowing tile glaring fluorescence that old hospital smell in the main office lobby he waited in a line for twentyfive minutes and got sent to talk to the secretary to the clinic administrator when she returned from her break and discovered that hardy wanted to talk about abortion records she told him he could have called and found out hat they released no records whatsoever and no information on what might be within them as hardy surely could understand these files were completely confidential frustrated and with another hour until he was supposed to pick up frannie he paused outside in the cavernous main lobby then followed the signs down a long echoing hallway to obgyn there were eight young women in the room all seemed to be under twentyyearsold a couple closer to fifteen two sat next to maybe their boyfriends holding hands one crying was flanked by her parents five sat alone empty chairs between them popping gum flipping through magazines listening to walkman bored and unconcerned scared and withdrawn it was hard to tell which the receptionist at the window was a cheerful and cooperative young black man with a neatly trimmed beard and afro he wore a white smock with a gay pride tag that said sam hardy handed him a card introducing himself asking if sam might direct him to someone who could tell him a little about dr witt you can ask me i remember him pretty well too bad what happened hardy agreed saying thats what he was trying to get clear on i thought his wife did it thats what theyre saying you think she didnt she says she didnt so im just turning over rocks maybe find a snake here at the clinic seems like a lot of angry people out there on the sidewalk sam waved that off the prolifers no forget them those people live there on the street people have been killed sam beat up leaving work at these clinics sam kept up a confident smile what about grocery checkers or bus drivers they get beat up too welcome to life in the big city hardy tried another tack all right maybe it was personal someone on the staff i dont know maybe dr witt had a runin with somebody no way no way this isnt a social club here these volunteer docs come in and put in their time and leave and witt more than most nobodys billing anybody here no reason to hang out he gestured at the waiting area behind hardy lowering his voice this is not fun city west hardy recognized the gospel when he heard it he pointed at his card lying on the window ledge between them if you do think of something personal anything at all would you mind giving me a call hardy watched his wife walk from the back of the restaurant noticed the heads at the bar turning one of the problems he had had when he was starting to fall in love with her had been her looks they were too good he knew it was easy to get fooled by a pretty face it had happened to him before and even though he had known frannie since she was a young girl moses kid sister once he started connecting with her letting himself really see her he made himself put on the brakes not for too long but enough to persuade himself that at least most of what he loved about her wasnt on the outside he had to admit though that even after three years a lot of it still was the waiter was there holding her chair out for her the little amenities what are you smiling at im shallow i have no depth i wonder if our relationship is purely physical frannie daintily popped a bite of calamari into her mouth they were by the window at mooses looking out through the sunshine onto washington square well some of it anyway they hadnt discussed it but they had both felt they needed to go someplace nice light upscale carefree to wash away the tastes of their mornings she reached across the table and touched a finger to hardys cheek trailing it along his jawline picking up her glass she swirled the chardonnay staring into it wine two days in a row you think vincent will be all right their son was living on breastmilk and a few squashed bananas hardy told her he didnt think vincent would notice it wasnt as if she was out pounding herself into the ground with alcohol i know sometimes i just worry she put the glass down scratched at the tablecloth but she wasnt really worried about vincent it was something else and hardy was fairly certain he knew what it was pretty bad she nodded you look around here and you see all these people being so happy and then back there in the jail it kind of makes you wonder whats the real world hardy covered her hand with his own i mean how isolated are we she asked the waiter lifted the empty plate from the middle of the table he removed some nonexistent crumbs from the starched linen tablecloth with a small rolling handbrush someone began playing classical music expertly at the piano by the bar by friday hardy felt that hed covered a lot of territory and uncovered very little freeman had been his usual unenthusiastic self about the atm although he did admit grudgingly that it might be helpful at some point freemans attitude made hardy decide that there was a real disadvantage in believing your client was guilty he was trying to keep his own mind open he had verified lightners opinion about the battery passing through generations with several other published and unpublished authorities their explanations were all consistent jennifer had seen her mother beaten at home her mother took it and took it possibly without complaint to the children so that behavior became jennifers expectation of married life if it wasnt there things just wouldnt feel right intimacy couldnt begin so hardy thought larry had been beating jennifer without a doubt so had her first husband ned according to lightners theory she would have had a difficult time marrying either of them if they hadnt gotten at least a little tough with her during courtship they wouldnt have felt like husband material whether or not it could be proved in a court of law terrells scenario of jennifer injecting ned with atropine was plausible and hardy had to believe if she killed ned it was a possibility that she killed larry too next was if jennifer did kill both men at least she had a good reason though hardy had a hard time with any kind of premeditated murder jennifer on her part still hadnt budged an inch on her denial of abuse which continued to infuriate david freeman signed affidavit or no freeman was afraid he would lose and that the decision would be upheld on appeal but he was hamstrung he couldnt bring up bws at all if he did he was all but admitting that jennifer did it and even process of saying why in spite of all her denials hardy had finally located brother tom at a construction site near the panhandle of golden gate park struck out during the day hardy returned to the site after work hours wearing dirty jeans and carrying two sixpacks of mickeys big mouth and got him to talk for twenty minutes hardy verified what the mother nancy had said jennifer and larry did not visit the family since a few months after the wedding tom had been seventeen at the time hardy could see that it had hurt the boy back then although now the man covered it with bluster the last time tom himself had seen the witts had been christmas eve no one had mentioned that before and hardy asked why not tom had shrugged it off why would anybody care hed gone by his parents home during the afternoon had a few beers and his mother had started moaning about jennifer and the grandchild she never saw shed bought matt this great present and he wasnt even going to come over to see it tom had gotten pissed off he drove his motorcycle over to olympia intending he said to kick a little ass but by the time he got there he figured there wouldnt be any point he wasnt going to change them hed dropped off his own christmas present a whiffle ball and bat with his nephew said merry christmas to his sister told her she really ought to go by their parents so matt could get his present from his grandmother then left and he added no surprise they didnt come but here hardy thought might have been the catalyst glitsky had been talking about out of the blue tom might not wake up one morning and say i think ill go kill my brotherinlaw but he sure as hell might do it three days after being snubbed during the holidays touching off years of resentment walter terrell sat in with them while they went through the physical evidence and stood over them in the evidence lockup while hardy and freeman checked off the computer list with the items that came out of the bags there was larrys bloodstained shirt all the other clothes the stuff that had been in pockets larry had a comb a small swiss army knife keys some coins including a quarter painted with red nail polish larry hung out in bars this didnt fit hardys profile so far terrell shook his head no sign of it thats a bar quarter freeman and terrell both looked at him blankly for the juke box he explained you paint your quarters red you feed the box you dont get charged when they come collect freeman was unimpressed so he went out for a drink on christmas eve maybe ive had quarters like that turn up in my pocket means nothing but pickings had been so slim that hardy wanted to keep grabbing two days before he gets killed anything he did means something freeman didnt respond he had already moved the pile of coins to the side going on to what looked like a bag full of trash whats this stuff forensics had picked the room clean and bagged whatever might have interest in this case the contents of the bedroom wastebasket used kleenexes used christmas ribbon and wrapping paper the kind of plastic bag they wrapped shirts in at the drycleaners this is evidence terrell pushed another bag toward freeman answered wearily you know the drill sir its here if you want to use it its your decision whats important freeman pulled the bag nearer and slid the gun out onto the table he picked it up checked its serial number against the prosecutions proposed exhibit list smelled the barrel he checked the fingerprint report and his eyebrows went up they didnt find her prints on the gun the clip this wasnt any surprise to terrell he pulled another bag and pushed it to them she wiped the gun somebody wiped the gun freeman gave him the bad eye and terrell shrugged if you say so it was getting late on a friday afternoon and the room in the basement of the hall of justice didnt have the best ventilation freeman tipped up the bag expecting the clip to fall out instead they were all looking at another gun what the hell is this wheres this on the list terrell read from the list bag dumpster contents want to see the egg cartons we found with it yeah but what the hell is it freeman repeated why is it here terrell was holding up his hands it was there now its here how should i know but its a gun terrell reached over and picked it up he put on his official voice sir please calm down im calm enough freeman sat back in his chair all right son im calm terrell explained its a toy gun its a good toy gun but its plastic see thats all as far as i know its got nothing to do with the evidence in this case then why is it here hardy could play the straight man if it came to it the questions were obvious enough its here because they found it in the same dumpster as the other gun the murder weapon i thought at the time it might be worth holding onto the same dumpster terrell nodded they both clunked out onto the street guy who found em when he saw the real gun gave us a call the garbage man hardy asked right how does this connect freeman was still sitting back trying to get a take on it it doesnt thats what im trying to tell you i just had a theory and thought id run with it you never know hardy knew this was terrells mo what was your theory i dont know the perp comes in with this gun looks real doesnt it maybe hes doing a burglary keeps it to threaten people he gets to the bedroom sees the real gun gets surprised by larry and the boy panics boom boom this was before i fingered jennifer did they print that gun the toy sure nothing though anyway i figured they had to be connected right but i was wrong besides the guy tells me guns are the numberone toy you find in the garbage sector garbage sector his words parents dont want their kids to grow up violent so some relative sends them a gun for christmas or something they toss it second is barbie dolls you believe that whod throw away a barbie doll brand new can we stick to the gun freeman was leaning forward now interested terrell shrugged hey you want it you can have it here check it out he handed it to freeman who gave it the once over then passed it to hardy what do you think its a toy gun in a dumpster freeman mulled it a few more seconds anything else in this dumpster you bagged that isnt connected to anything wally you want to waste more of our time freeman was picking at the bags lifting them dropping them we got trash we got toy guns he shook his head christ how bout we get to see the clip afterward hardy went up to homicide and finagled glitsky into a stop at lou the greeks freeman had gone to wherever it was he went on friday nights jennifer was calendared for monday morning and hardy thought he was probably up to some behindthescenes shenanigans with somebody now hardy was trying to convince abe that hawaii was where the glitskys ought to go for vacation glitsky saying that hardy must be out of touch with what policemen made nowadays if he thought abe flo and their three children could spend fourteen days at a kampgrounds of america site much less soaking up rays on maui he concluded by saying he thought theyd probably go to santa cruz for the weekend maybe the russian river spend the rest of the vacation painting the apartment if we can afford the paint things a little tight glitsky chewed the ice from his tea things were a little tight before my voluntary five percent pay cut you got that everybody who makes over fifty grand and now after a mere nineteen years on the force when i have finally graduated to that lofty height they whack me for getting there abe swirled his glass in its condensation on the table stared at the window just the other day i was saying to flo hey hon why dont i volunteer to work two hours free every week next year she thought it was a great idea since we dont need any money to live anyway he drank some tea you know what i did i went in to frank this was frank batiste glitskys lieutenant and asked him for a pay cut save the city some money and whatd frank say he said he wouldnt it wouldnt look cooperative i tell him im making take away the five percent im down to my two grand and a buck idea puts me at all things considered id rather have the extra i would have done it glitsky shook his head no you wouldnt you know why because the difference is fifty bucks a month which after taxes is maybe thirtyfive call it two burgers a week and for that you get a rep for being difficult after nineteen years and guess what happens to difficult guys heres a hint eightyfive didnt get to take their voluntary cut they got pinked eightyfive the number was higher than hardy would have thought how could the city lay off cops this was almost five percent of the force eightyfive sure what do we need cops for or health workers hardy mentioned the picket lines at the mission hills clinic but guess what the mayors still got his driver you wouldnt want the mayor driving his own car around would you what would people say how would it look hardy drank some beer well at least hes got his priorities straight if it were me id definitely do the same thing lay off the police and keep my driver im going to look into setting up my own security business glitsky said his eye caught something behind hardy and here comes my first recruit terrell slid in beside him across from hardy first recruit for what glitsky home security armed response in minutes terrell took a pull from one of the bottles of bud hed brought over we get to shoot people no miranda catch em and put em down yep and get paid for it terrell was bobbing his head i like it im in he had another swig focused on hardy your partner might be famous but whew thats why hes famous hes that way he looked at glitsky freeman what way glitsky asked what way hardy repeated mildly to terrell you can speak freely to inspector glitsky i got an idea bagged that might or might not be evidence and the guy goes ballistic on me i tell him he can use it or not hey i had a theory that might have worked so it didnt big deal lous was getting crowded louder hardy elbowed his way to the bar and bought another round when he returned terrell was in the middle of something that sounded familiar the crane thing was at least worth looking into but it turned out to be nothing too what did hardy slid in passed the round two more bottles for terrell another iced tea for glitsky i was just telling glitsky about that other thing the guy in la you called from the witt house crane the guy who was murdered yeah crane just talking about how theories sometimes pay off sometimes not most times not no argument just stating a fact abe was already chewing the ice in his fresh drink it drove hardy crazy but he preferred not to change the subject if terrell had discovered a link with simpson crane and was going to talk about it but he couldnt resist the urge to get in a dig whyd you follow that up youve already got yourself a suspect terrell didnt take any offense instead he smiled disarmingly hey i love my work you called it it was one of those coincidences you check it out what do you lose you cant tie up a murder too tight am i right or not on this everyone was in accord hardy sipped his beer taking his time not wanting to betray any particular interest so whatd you find pretty much what you told me no connection to witt well there must have been some the number was stuck on his desk i mean sure yeah that but im talking the actual hit they know who did it or think they do so who some local muscle down in la terrell was into his story a bottle of beer in each hand from which he drank alternately and steadily this guy crane was the premier union buster of the nineties cleared like a half a mil a year making sure all the little people kept getting fucked they try to organize he gets em fired figures out a way to make it stick time to renegotiate hes got everybody scared theyre going to lose their jobs so they cave they say the president wanted him for secretary of labor but couldnt pay him enough he work for san francisco glitsky asked joking i think they must be using somebody like him terrell shook his head well nobodys using him thats for sure what happened well he already killed a couple of unions meat packers janitors like that small time stuff and then he thought hed take on the machinists and somebody important didnt like it thats the theory terrell held up his empty beer bottles are these things twelve ounces he started to get up anyway they did it right hired some pro no paper trail no indictment my round this time he was on his way to the bar no more for me glitsky called after him he was still chewing his ice youre a sly dog hes following your leads and doesnt even know it hardy kept a straight face you heard him he loves his work he brought his beer up it is interesting though dont you think two murders and two hit men glitsky was shaking his head i count three murders and one hit man larry witt their kid this guy crane actually you want to get technical there were four murders cranes wife this didnt slow abe down very much you have anything connecting any hit man to larry witt no answer glitsky got out of his booth slapped hardy lightly on the cheek told him to have a good weekend the master calendar for superior court was called on monday mornings at it was july and jennifers name appeared first on the computer printout tacked up beside the double doors in the hallway outside department since her extradition from costa rica and subsequent return to san francisco had been reported in the chronicle and on television the media was on hand when freeman and hardy entered the courtroom a little after nine hardy knew that david freeman had no love for most reporters but was careful not to let them see it they could be helpful in a trial with political overtones candidate dean powell wasnt going to let a photo opportunity pass without getting whatever possible mileage out of it so the two attorneys one on either side of the courtroom were now chatting amiably with reporters powell was coming across as considerably more sincere than he had four months ago perhaps hed gotten some coaching the hand gestures didnt seem as rehearsed he moved a step closer to his own personal knot of reporters look he lowered his voice speaking from the heart im in favor of the death penalty and weve got special circumstances here that if proven warrant the death penalty hell that cry out for it show me a little remorse an admission of guilt even a cry for mercy the district attorney can be responsive to that defendants arent numbers to me theyre people living and breathing human beings this trial isnt part of my campaign to get tough california he leaned a leg casually over the corner of the table on the prosecution side of the courtroom this is a gamble by the defendant she thought she could commit murder for money and get away with it she was wrong terribly wrong i am not bloodthirsty but if she is found guilty were going to ask for the extreme penalty thats justice and shell have brought it on herself freeman had his own group this is unfortunately all too typical of the ways things get done the very fact that all you folks are here shows how out of line it is already nobodys talking about the weight of evidence which is light fatally light it never would have gotten this far except its likely to keep some names in the newspaper more than they would be otherwise i doubt it will even get to trial after i file my motion to dismiss you dont think itll get to trial this was from a woman with a microphone freeman shook his head i doubt it another hand another microphone but the grand jury indicted her freeman smiled the grand jury tends to indict whomever the district attorney asks it to but she escaped from jail didnt she she ran away shes resourceful and shes innocent and she doesnt trust a system thats already gotten it this wrong i think in her place i wouldve broken out too if i could have figured out how to do it powell was standing now a hand in a pocket smiling his smile freeman serious and indignant at the systems injustice was warming up for when the judge came in everybody had an agenda hardy walked back up the middle aisle and out into the hallway they still had twenty minutes looking through some papers his briefcase beside him ken lightner was sitting on the wooden bench in the hall across from department hardy sat next to him i want to apologize to you it seems you were right lightner put the papers down about what not that i wouldnt take just about anything right now about jennifers mother her father beating her the psychiatrist nodded shuffling his papers this obviously was old news to him youre disappointed i thought you might have found something a little closer to home something with jennifer herself hardy shook his head jennifer isnt giving anything away especially after this escape fiasco freemans pulling out his hair what hes got left im pulling out mine too shes made me stop talking about it which given where she is tends to limit our conversations how are we not supposed to talk about it what exactly the truth larry beating her abusing her her defense what shes going through to say nothing of all this madness over the last months how is she supposed to deal with all that lightner pushed his hair back with his fingers youve seen her then ive seen her i try to visit her almost every day that must cut some hell into your practice hardy hadnt meant to be accusatory but lightners back went right up i take care of my patients mr hardy i care about them i try to be there for them when they need me as i assume you do with your clients hardy took the rebuke lightner had a point sometimes you didnt punch the clock you want to accept a second apology in five mintes that didnt come out the way it was supposed to lightner shrugged it off its all right im under a good deal of stress myself i dont mean to snap back at everybody but i dont know what to do about this about jennifer her irrational guilts her selfdestructiveness its making me question my own judgment whether i can do her any good what do you think would help her i dont know right now i dont know the problem is i cant get her to talk about even acknowledge her real problem so what have you been talking about every day lightners expression said he knew how it must sound under the circumstances we talk about her selfesteem mr hardy how shes finally growing up taking responsibility for herself about her future her future i know i know we dont have to go into it lightner had put his papers down was rubbing his hands together he raised his eyes to hardy but thats what she wants to talk about how shes finally getting things straight she says she knows she can probably get out of this altogether by blaming larry but shes just not going to do it it wasnt his fault beating on her wasnt his fault what about her saying she didnt do it and a defense of battered woman syndrome would be an admission lightner nodded yes im afraid so things like that are deeply ingrained he stood up taking his briefcase asking where the mens room was if he had time before calendar came on he had disappeared around the corner before hardy realized that he had left a couple of his papers on the bench glancing down at jennifer witts name highlighted in yellow hardy picked them up this first page was an initial patients signin form from lightners practice filled in four years before giving an overview of medical history previous physicians allergies surgical background and so on hardy thought a minute folded the paper and put it in his inside coat pocket jennifer in her red jumpsuit handcuffs and leg irons was the first computer number or line called something was up judge oscar thomasino wasnt interested in the computer printout on his desk before him his eyes followed jennifer as she limped from the bailiffs entrance on the judges left until she got to the podium in the center of the courtroom where she stood flanked by her two personal bailiffs freeman was waiting for her though there was a neartangible air of friction between them jennifer glanced behind freemans back to where hardy sat at the defense table she nodded to him her eyes grateful or at least welcoming though he couldnt say why that should be so he hadnt seen her in a week he also wasnt exactly sure why hed come today this was the second arraignment for jennifer and she certainly wasnt going to change her plea maybe he told frannie lightly he missed being in a courtroom now he wondered if there hadnt been a germ of truth there this was supposed to be a more or less pro forma administrative procedure that would determine the date that jennifers trial would start or more precisely when it would relocate to its eventual department once the presiding trial judge and the courtroom were assigned which would be at another calendaring monday like this one the trial itself might not start for another six months to a year but thomasino started things off with a curve ball from the bench judges had different techniques to combat the routine hardy was beginning to understand that thomasino like to start the day with a little drama before wading into the sea of paperwork mr freeman is your client all right he was taking her in pale thin hair hacked off unevenly dean powell who had hardly been paying attention stood up your honor we will stipulate that mrs witt may have been badly treated during her incarceration in costa rica she thomasino used his gavel everyone in the courtroom jumped the court addressed its remarks to mr freeman he said mildly if i remember he could speak for himself last time we did this his face was stern but there was something nearplayful behind it mr freeman with the door open it was freemans nature to stick his foot in your honor my client has been badly beaten she needs medical attention she is so intimidated by what shes gone through that shes afraid to say anything certainly her civil rights have been violated the people have given up this case by their handling of the entire extradition process didnt this alleged beating take place in costa rica they were our proceedings it would not have happened if we hadnt thomasinos spark of humor vanished it wouldnt have happened if your client had not broken out of our jail here and fled the country nevertheless your honor nevertheless mr freeman ive got a full docket and i think the air conditioners starting to act up you mind if we get on with it evidently freeman did mind his retort was on the way when thomasino leaned out of his chair give it a rest david freeman confidently patted jennifers arm she had no reaction thomasino was back at his printout writing himself a note i assume given the interruptions to this point that everybodys ready to proceed is that the case mr powell it is your honor mr freeman freeman had another problem here normally in a potential deathpenalty case the defense would delay and delay and then try to delay some more but he had discussed this with jennifer and as usual she hadnt agreed with his decision or strategy powell wanted the trial to begin quickly and to conclude before the election in november as a matter of principle freeman hated to agree to anything the prosecution wanted but jennifer had tied his hands she was in jail and she wasnt getting out until she was found not guilty not unreasonably from her viewpoint she wanted the trial to begin as soon as possible freeman had told her it wasnt at all certain that she would be cleared she was up for three counts of capital murder and he knew that the da would not frivolously charge anything that serious he also knew that her case as presented by the prosecution would feature the kind of motive and presumed callousness that persuaded juries to convict murder for insurance money he wanted hardy to have time to find some other dudes he wanted time to think to plot to devise he wanted time for something else to happen for powell to be elected and a new prosecutor without powells agenda to be appointed mr freeman thomasino reported are you ready to proceed freeman had no choice we are your honor thomasino looked surprised and he was he had never seen a capital case actually ready to be set for trial at the first setting date all right then and the trial was calendared for monday august in department its you im trusting on this you know not him before leaving the building after the hearing hardy had decided to go on up and share a few impressions with jennifer he also had a list of questions written on a legal pad in his briefcase now they sat knee to knee in the tiny interview room by the guards station jennifer was expressing her displeasure with david freeman hes a slob and he doesnt believe anything about me not even that they raped me down there hardy pulled his chair back he wasnt sure how their knees had gotten so close and he didnt want to be misinterpreted thats the thing about the pros in this law business jennifer and its why davids so good its not personal if you getting raped would help your case in any way hed jump on it with both feet but unfortunately it doesnt i mean it happened because you escaped if i can get off im going to go back down there find that guard and kill him i swear to god instinctively hardy looked up at the bare yellow walls fairly secure in the knowledge that this room wasnt tapped he hoped leaning forward he unconsciously lowered his voice it would be a good idea to keep the death threats to a minimum for the next few months okay she smiled its what you call a figure of speech i know but sometimes the sense of humor thing around here gets a little fuzzy ill watch it jennifer stared a minute through the glass to the empty guard station i like your wife hardy nodded somehow wishing this hadnt come up knowing that it had to maybe in fact it was another reason why hed felt the needed another visit to reassure himself that the connection between jennifer and frannie was unimportant she said you had a nice talk jennifer shrugged we did it was just mostly girl stuff but i havent talked to anybody like i was a normal person in so long i thought dr lightner talked to you every day here he saw her processing his knowledge of that information it wasnt clear what she made of it well sure ken i mean doesnt he talk to you like a normal person out of any context she smiled hardy thought hed like to videotape an interview with her and analyze when these random smiles appeared but he was almost afraid of what hed find ken doesnt count she said besides i dont think anybodys normal for him normal doesnt have any meaning its one of those psychological buzzwords hardy had already heard enough jargon to know what she was saying but she had left open an avenue for questions what about down in costa rica didnt you meet anybody down there her eyes shifted to him then away no i didnt think it would be a good idea so what did you do again the empty guard station seemed to grab her attention she spoke into the window the first few days i just stayed in the hotel then i went to the beach i read a few books hardy could probe this by asking her which ones but it wasnt his intention to interrogate her like her rape anything that had happened to her in costa rica wasnt going to have much effect on what shed done or didnt do last december did i tell you id seen your mother he said youd said you were going to how was she she wasnt good jennifer your father had beat her up he didnt think she needed to hear any details the vision of her mothers battered body was still coming back to him jennifer looked down at the table a thumbnail to her mouth i understand this thing this beating it passes down through generations in families he said her eyes came up pained weve been through all this and she was saying were not going into it again she became brisk businesslike and bizarrely almost cheerful anything else you said you had some questions hardy took his pad from his briefcase last night he had reviewed the notes from his visit to jennifers house his questions yes she had stayed in the house in the months between the murders and her arrest except she hadnt been able to make herself go upstairs she had gone into their bedroom once to get her clothes and some personal items and the experience had been so upsetting she hadnt been able to make herself go back in so how did you do the inventory for terrell well thats why i messed it up she said nothing was gone from downstairs they hadnt taken my jewelry i didnt even think about the gun she held up a hand i know a big mistake she might at other times not be telling the truth hardy thought but this he decided wasnt one of them might there have been another gun hardy asked what other gun where i dont know anywhere maybe matt had a gun a toy she shook her head no we wouldnt let him own one it was something larry and i agreed on when he was an intern he said he saw too many accidents so no gun no gun why do you ask that trick question the dog that barked in the nighttime this time she sighed this can make a girl tired mr hardy just one more a straight one okay she nodded crane amp crane her face skewed up i dont know chess and checkers is this a quiz or something its a law firm have you ever heard of it why you tell me first she shook her head again its not familiar no now why hardy was putting his notes away larry might have called them about something jennifer gave it another minute the female guards came back to their station they passed a bag of fritos back and forth i dont know what it could be jennifer said just some more nothing hardy was feeling better about his office the dart board was in place moved in and nailed up over the weekend it was early afternoon and he was getting back into the groove throwing some down trying to hit all the numbers on the board in descending order ending with a bullseye in his glory days hardy had often done it in under ten rounds thirty darts and his alltime record was twentyfour now hed already thrown eight rounds and was hung up on which was normally his easiest shot his in and out number in a wide range of money games freeman entered without knocking hardy missed again this is not billable freeman said im thinking hardy replied thinking counts the older man closed the door then walked over and sat on a corner of hardys desk im thinking too im thinking that we get a trial in two months so dean powell can get free ink in time to get elected and i cant object because my client wont let me hardy pegged another dart finally hitting the he held a last dart and threw it randomly or thought it was random until it smacked into the middle of the he was getting it back and then freeman was continuing i come in to check on the progress made by my handchosen ace investigator and he is throwing darts am i the only one that feels some pressure here i think thats a fair question two months for a capital case its unheard of its been five months since the original arraignment so what who knew she was going to get found in costa rica does thomasino think we were preparing for trial all that time whose side are you on anyway as always im on the side of justice and truth but its not going to trial in two months its just beginning jury selection freeman of course knew this but jennifers trial was going to begin more quickly than he wanted it to and there wasnt anything he could do about it hands jammed into his pockets he stood near the window and studied buildings across the street i need a lever christ diz i need something just this morning didnt i hear you tell some reporters that this thing was such a turkey it wouldnt even make it to trial you could write a book on what ive told reporters youd be surprised i doubt it ive had it work some rookie assistant da reads in the papers that ive got this blockbuster secret evidence thatll blow the trial wide open and next day im down at the hall pleading a manslaughter on what should have been a righteous murder two but in this case he trailed off shaking his head in this case weve got jennifer and jennifers weapon and jennifers presumed motives were very much going to need somebody else to point at the famous other dude hardy came around his desk and flipped through some pages of his yellow pad thats all ive been doing david the problem is there hasnt been what youd call a run on them in the meantime maybe itll ease your mind to know im not just shooting darts to pass the time i have an appointment on another matter actually the appointment was for about fifteen minutes ago but mr frankl is late at the window freeman halfturned whos frankl my dui wants to go to trial the guy with the in california a blood alcohol level of got you convicted for drunk driving if that fact was undisputed you were guilty hardy nodded he says hes thought up a defense to a dui id like to hear it it could make us rich the telephone buzzed on hardys desk thats him now ill keep you informed freeman was at the door going out when hardy picked it up but it wasnt mr frankl it was sam bronkman from the mission hills clinic and he had just remembered something personal regarding larry witt that hardy might be interested in late in the day hardy parked in the long shadow of the mission hills clinic the evening breeze whipped at his jacket as he got out of his car and prepared to cross the picket lines again same people same building same wind there was no one in the darkened waiting room at obgyn and the blinds behind the window at the reception area had been pulled hardy felt all his muscles go tight almost turned to walk out then made himself knock on the glass he was here might as well make sure there was a slit in the blinds and they blinked open sam smiled waved pointed at the door to the inner offices and closed the blinds down again hardy crossed the room the door cracked and sams head appeared a turtle poking out of its shell grabbing hardys arm he pulled him through all clear he said you wouldnt believe we close at fourthirty people come here at five expect to waltz right in keep the desk open and youre here all night sam chattering led the way to an employees lounge plastic yellow chairs white metal tables vending machines a microwave it was an inside room with no windows and it was empty they sat at one of the tables i should have remembered when you were here last time especially when you mentioned the personal stuff but sam snapped his fingers in the air the brain sometimes it goes on hold one minute youre there the next the hands described a mushroom cloud woosh nobody home thats all right sam i really appreciate you calling whenever you remembered and you did remember something sam nodded elaborately over the weekend did you read that article about that senator who wouldnt let his daughter have the abortion well anyway i was at jasons hes my friend jason and i was reading it and suddenly it was like i dont know a vision or something just again the hands fluttered whammo there it was hardy smiled there what was sam dr witt the same thing dr witt had a daughter no no way sam reached over and slapped hardys arm no listen the personal thing the connection is this there was this girl melissa roman whose parents told her she couldnt have an abortion forbade it you know he rolled his eyes smart right these people ill never understand a deep sigh anyway she tried one on herself an abortion and it didnt turn out so good what happened what else the hands again including the universe she winds up here dr witts the pro with female plumbing and hes a volunteer he calls for an ambulance right away but before it even gets here shes dead the parents blamed witt sam nodded you got to theyre not going to blame themselves right so they need somebody and melissas already dead kind of unfair to take it out on her wouldnt you say so they pick witt they decide hes somehow responsible for the abortion that killed their daughter the logic of that couldnt stand much scrutiny but hardy supposed it rang true for the bereaved romans hardy was leaning forward now howd they pick on him when did all this happen sam nodded pleased with himself i looked that up today it was right before thanksgiving of last year which was a month before witt was killed right what did they do threaten to sue him what sams palms were up again laying out the whole truth i dont know everything i know roman came down twice we had to get security on the scene the second time then right after that dr witt said he might just quit volunteering it was too much somebody broke his car windows and he was sure it was roman did he report that i dont know this was something hardy could legitimately bring up to terrell or even glitsky here was a crime that happened to a murder victim within a month of his death if larry had reported it the other stuff sam was saying if roman was suing him or the clinic i dont know i havent heard about that but ill tell you something hardy waited how about this if youre planning to kill somebody you dont also sue him do you maybe thats why i never heard of anything otherwise why wouldnt he just sue the clinic interesting question his house was empty when he got home and he felt the emptiness trying to settle on him heavy and cold as the citys familiar fog he had lived the better part of ten years alone in this house before he had gotten together with frannie and the associations werent all good he missed almost nothing from that lost decade the house back then had been smaller without the nursery darker without the skylights colder just plain colder somehow he would get hoem from bartending or a ball game and go to his office in the back which was now rebeccas pastel bedroom hed take a bottled guinness from the refrigerator and sit at his desk in the light from his green bankers lamp and read or shoot darts or clean his now unused pipes or whittle something hed light a coal fire in the grate everything he did he had done all by himself even when he was with other people he hadnt thought he was lonely he wasnt lonely he was just alone and he now knew there was a difference frannie hadnt mentioned going out and hed talked to her after hed seen jennifer in the morning it was possible shed gone to the market although theyd just spent a domestic weekend including a trip to the grocery store on saturday he didnt know where they were and against any kind of sense it worried him on the drive home hed been thinking about jennifer and larry and the romans and the medical background sheet lightner had intentionally left for him to pick up all those thoughts were now gone he looked down and out the window in vincents room wondering if even with the july evening chill they might be in the backyard they werent he fed the tropical fish in his bedroom looked at his watch started to call the shamrock and decided not checked the time again he didnt know there was no note he wasnt going to sit around waiting letting the old emptiness fill him up it was something hed put behind him and its sudden reappearance spooked him were the kids all right had frannie run out quickly to the emergency room not even having time to jot something on a pad he walked from the kitchen to the front door down the hallway and back through the inside rooms telling himself he wasnt looking for drops of blood on the floor in his bedroom he shucked his suit and put on shorts a sweatshirt tennis shoes he had a fourmile circle he ran from his house out to the beach across golden gate park along lincoln back to the shamrock at th avenue then home it took him about fortyfive minutes he looked at his watch hed be home by seven he wrote a note and left it on the kitchen table under a salt shaker at least frannie would know where hed gone in the kitchen frannie greeted him with a kiss she was stirring her white clam spaghetti sauce and humming rebecca was pouring water from a watering can getting almost half of it into the differentsized pans shed arranged on the floor vincent was in his baby seat next to her the windows were steamed with the boiling water the sun was still up in his house there was nothing empty or spooky or sinister hardy went in to shower berating himself for his paranoia wondering how he got to be so old on wednesday at a little after noon there was the sound of something being thrown clattering against bars onto the floor in the jail behind where jennifer sat on the bench in the visitors area startled frannie nearly left her chair sitting back down she forced a smile i hate that kind of noise i always jump a mile it doesnt really bother me anymore i guess im used to it jennifer looked down at her hands larry used to throw things sometimes so by the time i heard the noise it meant most of it was over what do you mean you know the tension waiting for him to blow up it was almost a relief when it came frannie put her hand on the plexiglas jennifer put hers up against it it had developed between them some kind of signal a touch by proxy this was their third meeting the hands remained in place frannie stared at the hands at her wedding ring her face paled are you all right jennifer asked im fine sometimes just what im sorry moment of weakness its nothing then smiled again weakly i dont know what it is you look sad frannie nodded thats what it feels like like all at once things have sort of stopped she searched for the right word resonating id say maybe its just the postpartums they can go on six months you know sometimes longer after matt she paused surprised by the name from out of nowhere a deep breath pushing on after matt first there was euphoria then this black hole that didnt want to go away frannie shrugged maybe i dont know i dont feel like its that she brought her hand back down to her lap i wanted to tell you you know my first husband was killed too frannie then told jennifer about it about twentyfiveyearold eddie cochran frannies husband and hardys friend hardy had helped expose the murderer and five months later they hardy and frannie had gotten involved married frannie told her about some bad moments since theyd gotten together guilt perhaps timing questions but this frannies sadness seemed to strike a deeper chord somehow everythings been so kind of rushed you know jennifer listened rapt her eyes glistening another woman had problems had sadnesses it was some comfort to know she wasnt so alone its just first there was eddie then dismas and me then all of a sudden im married again and rebecca is being born next before ive really given any thought to those changes im pregnant again and having vincent and now now ive stopped for a minute and i look back and its like ive been running like a crazy person as though im maybe running from something does this make any sense jennifer nodded yes sometimes i think the trick is to just keep running so you dont have to stop and think about it once you stop then taking a long moment frannie leaned forward her elbows on the table today i was sitting rocking feeding vincent and all at once im crying really sobbing now why would that come over me when i look at my life and im fine im happy day to day dismas and i are good i love the kids i dont get it you miss your first husband eddie a little but im used to him being gone i know hes not coming back its not that its more that i havent sorted things havent even thought about it and here i am in a marriage with two kids and this is my life and sometimes i dont even know how i got here jennifer scratched at the pitted counter on her side of the glass talk about not knowing how you got somewhere frannie forced a smile look at me talking to you here ive got no business doing any complaining seeing where you are its okay jennifer said its okay i wont be here forever either way at least im out of this place i dont know how youre handling it jennifer took a minute swallowed then forced her own smile it isnt like ive got much choice he treats you right does he he doesnt hurt you the segue here was unclear who your husband dismas frannie shifted her weight on the hard wooden chair no i mean yes he treats me very right hed never hurt me he loves me jennifer gave her a look that seemed to ask what that had to do with it but she said did eddie hurt me no never jennifer leaned back in the chair ran both hands through her cropped hair it must be me she said ive always believed it was me what was you what jennifer sat forward now hunched slowly she lifted her hand and placed it against the glass frannie brought up hers almost imagining she could feel the heat from jennifers skin why they always hit me on the third floor dean powell was listening to another assistant da analyze the merits of an aggravated assault the people who worked at the hall of justice spoke in a kind of code san francisco had a welldeserved reputation as the most politically correct of cities and you could get yourself fired or worse if you labored for the city and inadvertently happened to use a word that had not been officially sanctioned or had been officially proscribed by some group or other the members of the police department and the district attorneys office were among the most sensitive to irregularities in this area and so had developed the most sophisticated code for use among themselves visitors could spend half a day in the hall people chatting all around and be a hundredandeighty degrees off on what they thought they had heard dean powell running for state attorney general still had to function as a prosecutor and especially between now and november he was careful not to use too much of the code himself nevertheless he didnt need a translator if you ask me tony feeney was telling him we got a stone bdi here professional women some dispute over funding both of them canadians in my opinion shell go sideways like she has the three other times feeney was another assistant district attorney in powells office getting the more experienced mans take on whether he should even bother charging mr duncan j dunlap for aggravated assault on his livein girlfriend byna lewes a professional woman bdi was the code for a case in which the defendant believed and usually loudly proclaimed to police that the woman he had just savagely beaten or killed had brought the attack on herself bdi stood for bitch deserved it in this case dunlap thought lewes was holding out on him and might be about to choose another pimp feeney thought lewes would go sideways which meant shed refuse to testify or even better change her testimony on the stand and by the way both parties were africanamericans called canadians by members of law enforcement to avoid offending anyone in earshot byna lewes had promised to testify against mr dunlap on the three previous occasions when hed beaten her and each time she had relented saying he was truly sorry this time and he really loved her he just needed some help maybe the city could help pay for his counseling powell crossed his hands behind his head you ever wonder why we keep doing this feeney had no response he sat across from powell hoping hed be remembered if powell got lucky and took up residence in sacramento how badly was she hurt feeney opened the folder starting to take out the pictures but powell held out a hand palm up just describe it tony how bad the polaroids had been taken by the arresting officer in bynas hospital room shortly after the attack before shed been bandaged her left eye was swollen shut her nose looked broken there was blood in her hair and over her ear feeney went to the police report and saw shed also had her arm dislocated not bad he said about average we charging it powell was getting to the meat of the issue if byna the victim would cooperate in the case against mr dunlap then he would be charged and the matter would proceed if on the other hand the victim chose not to assist the prosecution would not appear and testify which in these cases was very common then the case would fall apart well its a little iffy is the problem on picture night here feeney gestured to the file ms lewes had had enough she was coming down as soon as she got out of the hospital and filing charges and put that bad man away so what happened he come see her he would have but he was in jail at the time but naturally the minute hes out on bail he buys her roses candy says hes sorry only this time shes not sure she believes him but shes so afraid of him she doesnt want to testify logical good reasoning feeney held up one finger but he said she says if we give her a subpoena shell testify what a citizen this is a beautiful story and youre asking me what id do i know what youd do dean im just wondering how youd explain it we got a third offense weve got a witness who says shell testify how do you just drop it you dont drop it tony you file it hold her hand every day and try not to feel too bad when she doesnt show up for the trial david freemans office was up one flight or ornate scrollbannistered stairs in the front corner of the old building on sutter street below him the ground floor was comprised of the comfortable reception area a conference room that faced a brick and ivy inner courtyard and a small law library four years before freeman had redecorated and put in a lot of glass down below giving the place an open feel at the head of the stairs outside freemans lair phyllis wells kept the howlers at bay the howlers being their own code name for associate attorneys phyllis had been with david for thirtytwo years and in that time had seen associates come and go enter the practice as eager law school graduates hoping to ride the coattails of the brilliant david freeman to fame and glory carve a reputation in the city and perhaps beyond become a partner in a reasonable six or seven years most didnt last two not one had hung on to become a partner they worked their twelvehour days and nights and weekends and wrote briefs and even got trial experience and then moved on either to their own practices to one of the big downtown firms or out of the law altogether the reason david freeman did not want partners not for nothing had he named his firm david freeman amp associates it wasnt about to change he didnt like to delegate no phyllis knew it was more than that he was incapable of delegating which was why she thought this situation with dismas hardy was a little unusual hardy was doing work that freeman had always done himself freeman even seemed relatively pleased with hardys results this was so out of character that it worried phyllis she wondered if david were sick if he would tell her if he was not that she had anything against hardy there was a good feeling around him he was nicelooking in a craggy way not too lean sometimes maybe a bit too quick with the humorous phrase for her taste but god knew shed seen enough humorless attorneys pass through these halls it was refreshing to have one who seemed not to take himself so seriously freeman had instructed her to let hardy come in when he needed to talk confer even visit of course technically he wasnt an associate not one of the howlers he wasnt even of counsel he just rented a room he came and went rather haphazardly and was beginning to show some sign of trusting her which of course he could do although shed been somewhat resentful at the beginning when david had suggested he share her as his own secretary but that had been working out too he was up on the fourth floor connected to her by intercom that he rarely used still it was a change giving him information before shed cleared it with david now her boss freeman would always be her boss was at trial and her was dismas hardy casually asking how jennifer got referred to the firm she had thought he already knew well it wasnt a big issue he had just come up the stairs from somewhere snapped his finger and came back stopping at her desk jennifer witt was davids client there was no mistake about that even though she remembered it was near hardys first month or so in the office when shed buzzed him after shed beeped david in court and hed told her to get hardy down there to meet jennifer in jail but if phyllis had learned anything in thirtytwo years in this business it was that information was the coin of the realm and its dissemination almost always was strictly needtoknow it just occurred to me hardy was saying that here ive been learning all i can about this woman and i dont even know how we got involved with her i mean she thought i was david when i first met her so she didnt know him either am i right phyllis smiled adjusting her glasses didnt you ask her he leaned comfortably against the partition separating her desk from the open hallway if i recall she said something about her husbands lawyers but i didnt know who they were she couldnt tell you she could if i went over to the hall paid four dollars for a parking space rode the slowest elevator in america up seven flights got patted down and admitted by the guard into the womens jail waited fifteen minutes for them to get jennifer and then asked her he knew he was charming her and more strangely she knew it and didnt mind now he grinned openly youre stonewalling me phyylis i cant tell the referral had come from donna bellows a member of the firm of goldberg mullen amp roake hardy called her from his office two flights up from phyllis it was the middle of the week the middle of the afternoon and he got right through introducing himself he was struck by the immediate chill that came over the deeply pitched voice perhaps it wasnt clear at the time mr hardy but not only doesnt this firm take many criminal cases i personally dont want anything to do with mrs witt so im not inclined to be of much help im sorry did you know her personally he had to keep her talking or she was gone and he did have something he wanted to get to i never met the woman i never want to now im sorry but if youll excuse please if i might one quick question can you tell me anything about crane amp crane any connection to dr witt silence the decision being made hardy knew that he and ms bellows werent adversaries in any real sense she might have felt a loyalty or more than that to her client larry witt but good lawyers at least tried to observe the professional courtesies with one another hardy was counting on that he heard her sigh going ahead with this distasteful discussion all right im sorry mr hardy i liked larry witt i read the papers and im afraid i believe that his wife killed him and their boy from what youve read in the papers that yes and some other things what other things another pause considering rejecting lets get back to the one question shall we though there might be a wide vein of information here hardy knew hed have to let it go if he wanted to find out about crane amp crane hed spent the better part of a frustrating yesterday and all of this morning chasing down the chimeras of other dudes melissa romans parents witts first wife molly a dr heffler from dr lightners form he had not so much as spoken to any of them now he had donna bellows on the telephone and hed take whatever she was willing to give crane amp crane some connection to larry that name is familiar in the sense that i believe ive heard it thats all its a los angeles firm that may be it you say larry and i dont know he called them a few days before he died before he was killed you mean he didnt just die he was killed he listened to her breathe for a moment i was larrys financial advisor with respect to crane he may have mentioned them in some context this would have been about six months ago whatever it was if anything it couldnt have been too important i really dont remember but i can check would you mind frankly i do mind mr hardy i dont like my clients being shot to death it really bothers me and i dont want to help their killers get free but ill look into it i said i would and i will hardy thanked her ill call you she said and hung up date night was a freeform event the traditional and sacred wednesday ritual had taken them before the children had been born as far afield as los angeles or reno or santa fe on the spur of the moment date nights had been known to continue for several days hardy calling in to the shamrock to have his shifts covered while he and frannie gambled or perused art galleries or decided to take the ferry out of long beach over to santa catalina the island of romance tonight they were on another ferry chugging across the bay to sausalito out near alcatraz the water was choppy the wind high the sun lost in a bank of fog that was rolling over and around the golden gate bridge the temperature was in the fifties ah summertime frannie watched dismas suck the bracing air they stood at the front rail on the upper deck blown and sprayed nothing like the middle of july to get rid of the winter blahs frannie leaned into the rail holding onto it with both hands maybe thats it she said the winter blahs she looked up at her husband her smile as lost as the sunlight he put an arm around her bringing her inside his heavy coat and she leaned into him you all right she considered whether she should tell him how much she should tell him she felt like she was sneaking out cheating on him but she didnt want to get into it not just now it would become a discussion the theme for the night and she didnt need that she didnt need to clear everything with dismas she loved him but she had her own life her own feelings for frannie seeing jennifer witt was somehow bringing things to the surface and that she felt was good once she recognized what she was dealing with shed be better equipped to handle things questioning how you felt wasnt necessarily threatening to her and dismas or to the kids she loved them all her husband and her children it wasnt that it was what she started to say to jennifer that there was just so much that she hadnt been able to take time for she was losing sight of who she was of who frannie rose mcguire cochran and now hardy had turned into and how it had all happened and how she felt about it was she just some adjunct to whatever man she was with the bearer of their babies she didnt really feel that with dismas she hadnt felt that way with eddie she and eddie had been living an adventure eddie had been about to start graduate school when hed been killed theyd been saving money for everything discovering new places each other then suddenly no warning and eddie was gone and there was dismas not in eddies old space but close to it and now two years five minutes later she was a stayathome mother with no money worries where dismas already knew all the good restaurants and the great places where dismas had already made the discoveries and so many of the decisions like living in this old house which of course theyd decided to do together it made so much more sense and she did love the house but that wasnt it the point was that even though shed changed it to her tastes brightened it up painted rearranged added a room it was still his house dismas house not really their house all of their friends too were his friends and their wives abe flo pico angela even moses her own brother even moses had been hardys friend long before shed been in the picture not that she didnt like these people she did but she hadnt found them on her own what about her old friends the people she and eddie had known didnt they count why werent they part of her new life anymore was it the kids or dismas or herself she knew dismas wouldnt approve of the extra visits to jennifer the original idea had been simply to set her mind at ease about the kind of person jennifer was but now something else was happening and it was important tapping into a vein of her own that hadnt been mined in a couple of years maybe by talking about things with jennifer why she continued to let both of her husbands beat her for example frannie could help her change see the way things were supposed to work it seemed worthwhile even if dismas didnt know about it she was sure he had some secrets from her you didnt have to tell your spouse every thought and word and deed in your life and seeing jennifer was doing her some good she was frannies own friend confidant and dismas didnt need to know about it she could choose her own friends make decisions for herself in her own life later shed tell him maybe after he and freeman got jennifer off after the trial she was her own person but somehow shed let the predictable in her daily life devalue her she even found herself wondering whether dismas would keep loving her why he loved her in the first place all the while telling herself she deserved to be loved youre a great girl wonderful sensitive cool if you dont love yourself how can you love anybody else how can anybody love you the ferry had entered the lee of sausalito and the chop had flattened dismas tightened his arm around her hello it really didnt have anything to do with loving him she loved him his face and his body and the easy way he did things it was just that she needed a little more of herself in her life im here she kissed his cheek molly freemans living room on friday morning and hardy was sitting back in one of the leather chairs freeman in his maroon bathrobe checking off answers making notes in pencil at the kitchen table molly wasnt here in december she hadnt even heard hed died or shed even a better actress than our client howd she take it i think it would depress me if the news of my death was greeted so warmly freeman raised his bushy eyebrows a question hardy continued she hated his guts even after lo these many years he used to beat her too again the eyebrows went up but he didnt beat jennifer hardy kept a straight face thats our defense right he didnt beat her so she says never laid a hand on her hardy had finally spoken to larry witts first wife molly she was now a guidance counselor living and working in fargo north dakota she had not remarried and had not seen or heard from dr witt in five years i guess we could have somebody doublecheck see if she was in north dakota over christmas but id bet she was the news of larrys death absolutely made her day freeman put down his pencil staring out the window lets stop a minute diz what kind of sonofabitch was this guy crossing his legs sitting back hardy took a minute by all accounts he was a model citizen total professional concerned father great provider he just happened to beat his wives you really believe that you dont i dont know why jennifer couldnt cop to it even if the legislature doesnt go for it theres a good chance a jury would walk her and no chance shed get the death penalty powell wouldnt even ask freeman was referring hardy knew to the fact that the california assembly had recently failed to pass an amendment that would have codified batteredwoman syndrome as a legitimate mitigation for murder since the courts were often accepting it anyway the precedent was established and it was a moot question but the legislatures action or lack of it was a definite setback for proponents of the defense i simply cant understand her resistance to it hardy could go through all of lighters explanations but it all came back to jennifers contention that if she admitted larry beat her then she had a reason to kill him that a jury might well convict on but thats just it freeman continued theyd be just as likely hell more likely to let her go he stood up stretched sat back down but you believe he did beat her yes absolutely he was a control freak she got out of line he whacked her around and she really felt she couldnt leave she had to stay there and take it thats the profile david its sad but its true hed track her down if she left hed take the kid hed kill her if she tried all of the above so she killed him first it worked with ned it ought to fly with larry right hardy shrugged she says not well the pencil beat a tattoo on the table i must say in all my years doing this i havent seen too many cases this pure id like to watch her play poker see if she bluffs maybe shes a vulcan whats that mean it amazed hardy was it possible that david freeman had never seen star trek didnt know that vulcans never bluff looking around the apartment he realized it was probably so there was no sign of a television never mind david its a long story you want to keep going here the tattooing stopped wed better from freemans apartment hardy walked up the street a block and treated himself to lunch alone at the stanford court he wanted an hour to think there had been no police report on the alleged break in of larry witts car by melissa romans parents or anybody else dr witt hadnt reported it a fact which hadnt surprised abe glitsky who had explained that the populace was beginning to understand that there was no such thing as a nonviolent crime in san francisco anymore there were bad things that happened sure like larrys car but if those things didnt physically hurt people the police tended not to get involved they werent about to break out the troops tracking down a culprit who had lifted a fivehundreddollar cd player from a car they didnt have the manpower any more than they would investigate a pine cone falling from a tree and breaking your windshield practically speaking it just couldnt be a police matter hardy loved it vandalism as a force majeur he was having salmon again grilled with a light wasabe glaze a glass of hafner chardonnay he was worried about frannie something was going on with her and she wasnt telling him about it maybe it was his continued involvement with jennifer she shouldnt have expected that one visit was going to change anything and obviously going to the jail had been a trauma he hated to see her unhappy maybe he was spending too much time running around for david looking for a plausible other dude the inherent cynicism in it all was getting to him david seemed to care almost nothing for the guilt or innocence of jennifer just whether he could get his client off that was what he did for a living he said was he really that cold was there a deeper concern behind the socalled professionalism hardy couldnt tell couldnt really read david that well and he suspected that that was just the way david wanted it no black or white for hardy in this case not with jennifer not with his colleague david not with anything which could wear a person down the waiter appeared now and asked if the food was satisfactory monsieur had not touched the plate if he would like to order something else of course well for today at least hardy decided he would not be looking for other dudes the crux of the matter in court was whether proof existed that jennifer was a battered woman once that was established the question of her culpability could be debated providing jennifer cooperated anyway hardy couldnt let freeman shake his belief in some objective truth in the facts something specific did happen in a certain way and at a certain time if he had any pretensions of seeing justice done the first step was to uncover those facts he had ken lightners assertions he had seen the bruises on jennifers mother he had the first wifes mollys admission that larry witt had beaten her he even had jennifers acknowledgment that she and larry had been in a few fights this was ammunition but it wasnt a smoking gun dr saul heffler was one of the doctors from ken lightners list that lightner had accidentally left on the bench for hardy to find and pick up heffler had a practice in a onestory office building on arguello halfway from downtown to hardys house the doctor and the lawyer had played a serious game of phone tag during the week and it was time to put an end to that even if it meant sitting a while in a waiting room the gods smiled and a parking spot opened directly in front of the address as hardy pulled up he took this as a good omen inside the receptionist was blessedly free of bureaucratic baggage and informed hardy that the doctor could probably block out some time in about an hour would that be all right hardy walked up to clement street drank a cup of iced espresso at an outside table to ward off the post wineforlunch slump then bought some earrings for frannie from a sidewalk vendor he loved lower clement street had loved it through its incarnations first as a russian enclave with piroshki and antique shops then as an upscale though not too upscale haight street with its hippies haze of incense and coffeeshops to now a bustling oriental bazaar with teasmoked ducks hanging in windows and the slightly off yet somehow appealing commingled smells of cooked meat raw seafood and garbage strolling in the bright sunlight enjoying the smells and the breeze he bought a newly steamed pork bao and chewed it happily there was a bright turquoise childrens kimono in a window and he went inside the tiny store buying it for rebecca along with a tiny silk shirt for his boy hed make this up to frannie things were going to change he wasnt sure how but he wasnt going to let anything not david jennifer frustration fear or silence get between them and keep them apart three minutes after he was back inside hefflers office and the receptionist told him he could go right in hefflers small but welllit office had three diplomas and about six hundred mounted fishing flies on the walls the man was in his midfifties with a full head of pepperandsalt hair a flat unlined face a hint of navajo over a lanky gangling frame he smiled easily hardy explained the situation he was after all working for jennifers defense he wondered if the doctor would help him verify some background he showed heffler jennifers signed release allowing her doctor to discuss her medical history hardy had told jennifer he needed her medical records in connection with what had happened to her in costa rica hed be glad to help the doctor said what did hardy want to know hardy told him this was four years ago five i cant say i remember her offhand ill have joanie pull the file we keep the archives in the storeroom take two minutes they waited talking fishing heffler was leaving the next morning for a sixday wilderness trip to alaska going after the huge salmon that ran up there maybe some arctic char hardy held a hand over his stomach dont say salmon to me i think im hitting my limit joanie came in handed over the file and left heffler opened it and flipped some pages his face closing down you want to believe people you wonder how much of this you really see you got something i dont know what you call something maybe i should have seen this suspected something i dont know hardy waited heffler read some more then closed the file she was my patient for seven months came in without a referral said shed just moved here from florida first time i saw her she had fallen down the steps in her new house the first time heffler nodded he opened the file again three months later she broke her arm skiing she thought it was just a sprain until she got home otherwise she would have gotten it set up at squaw valley he turned up a page scanning this one he said maybe i really should have seen this one whats that three months after the arm pretty regular isnt it she comes in with this fluke accident she was cleaning out a closet and the shelf came off loaded with stuff slammed down against her back her urine had blood in it he wasnt looking up contusions and bruises over he kidneys all the way across her back he closed the file again i must have asked her i cant imagine i didnt and she just said no simple as that and got herself another doctor he took in a deep breath let it out as a sigh im ready for a vacation he said you see a lot of this a lot some i guess i see some accidents people hurt themselves i cant go to the police every time someone breaks their arm comes in with a black eye i wouldnt have a practice left he picked up the file opened it flicked impatiently at the pages heres something stuck to the back of the folder was a yellow postit pad and on it was a name and address i dont know why this is here he buzzed joanie again and she came back oh thats just my note to myself when i get a request for records heffler leaned forward still frowning so this might have been the next physician this patient went to joanie was as bright and cheerful as heffler had been before this had begun it might be id assume so wouldnt you i told her i wouldnt treat her unless she let me inform the police she ought to get some counseling i saw her the one time and i knew right away hardy was sitting in the waiting room of dr helena zamoras office now it was closing time a tightly strung woman about hardys age zamora let him in but politely told him she had a dinner appointment in fortyfive minutes and could spare him no more than ten he outlined what he had learned at dr hefflers and what he was trying to find she came in dr zamora said with a large round bruise under one of her breasts an some cockandbull about tripping against a knob at the top of her bannister i got suspicious checked her signin form sent for her records then i called her and never heard from her again she pulled her glasses up and balanced them on top of her forehead common story too common does that help you hardy said it did and thanked her dr zamora took her glasses all the way off she finally killed the animal that was doing this did she shes charged with it good for her from a phone booth in a gas station at th and kirkham hardy called jennifer at the jail in san francisco it is a myth that prisoners get one phone call the common areas in the jail have pay telephones on the walls and whenever the inmates want to they can use them there had even been significant callingcard fraud that had been traced to both floors of the jail a thriving black market in phone numbers and the pins that go with them jennifer hardy ive got a quick question have you ever lived in florida there was a longish wait this is not a trick question jennifer have you ever lived in florida thats all no why no reason just checking something talk to you later so this friday afternoon he had caught jennifer in five lies the fall down the stairs the arm broken while she skied the shelf accident the know on top of the bannister the state with epcot and the everglades lies yes except four of them were apparently to protect her husband sick yes but mitigation at least frannie was on top of him laying long against him moving like a calm ocean his arms surrounded her the covers had been kicked onto the floor at the foot of the bed she was wearing her new earrings and hardy took one of them into his mouth careful she said careful yourself im being careful youre going a little too fast this will slow you down some she bit into his shoulder im going to go a lot faster before im through promises promises let go then youll see i knew this girl in high school moses said rachelle manning we were in math together and i thought she was okay so i asked her out to some dance or something and she said sure they were queued up in a long line at candlestick park having already missed half an inning when the last place padres had scored four runs off the firstplace giants waiting to buy two beers each for a mere four bucks a cup before they closed the stand for the day after the seventh inning it was the conceit of giants management that people who had a beer after the seventh inning would more likely drive under the influence than those other puritan souls who had had two beers early in the game and then stopped frannie had already designated herself the driver and moses had had seven so far and now was feeling every one of them so listen he continued loudly word gets around and guys are coming up putting rubbers in my pockets patting me on the back one of the big guys telling me theyve done it with rachelle in their cars and in her parents bed and behind the student union and under the goddamn principals desk on the weekend the guy behind them in line tapped mcguire on the shoulder i did it under the stands during a basketball game once best sex i ever had hardy and moses told him they thought that must have been great they moved up a step hardy signaled maybe mcguire should tone it down anyway i figured it had to be some kind of joke i mean rachelle manning is not a slut shes not putting out for the football team this is a sweet young thing nice clothes nice family clean hair hairs important hardy moved closer to the beer vendor the stands erupted with more noise action on the field they were missing i was always a hair guy myself so i take her out im a little nervous thinking you know what im thinking were not out of her driveway and her hand is on me i swear to god i loved high school i could do high school again turned out to be a hell of a night i dont think we hit the dance if we did i dont remember it they finally got their beers and starting moving back to the stands its a truly moving story mose but was there a moral here i missed i thought we were talking about jennifer witt of course we were talking about jennifer witt youre a lawyer and shes your case so thats what we talk about and talk about and talk about but moses drank a third of his beer and i reiterate but theres some people and i hate to say this but women seem better at it than men you just cant tell anything this is how rachelle relates to the fascinating and mysterious mrs witt looking at her back then you would never have had a clue talking to her youd never know i mean i would have bet the horse that this girl was a stone virgin maybe she was moses couldnt help grinning she definitely wasnt the next morning i have it on the highest authority what susan said they were back in their seats ten rows back on the first base side great seats moses got himself seated and didnt miss a beat just talking about jennifer witt about how some women lie frannie had her beer and poured some into moses lap oh sorry dear brother she made a show of brushing it off if im not mistaken men lie too okay everybody lies at one time or another but my point to diz was that there are some women and i just say women because in my own private experience i havent run across this in that many men who seem to embody conflicting personality traits i mean they seem to be two completely different people and still they walk around and act normal and youd never know frannie leaned over and spoke to susan theres still time youre not married yet you can get out of this moses had a ph d in philosophy that he liked to say hed outgrown he had not outgrown his love of talk however the words flowed and sometimes hardy thought he even thought about them before they came out although this didnt appear to be one of those times frannie im not saying you or susan look at all the literature on it the two faces of eve sybil all of them all two of them its welldocumented you dont have to get so riled up about it women just hide things better theyre taught to as kids lets face it if theyre liars theyre better liars its a compliment i think ill cut him off here susan said she lifted what was left of his last beer and held it on her lap i still love you but youre getting close jesus women lie better its a compliment whos winning hardy asked trying to end it here but frannie wasnt having it what about men who beat their wives moses you think you can tell just by looking at them you think thats not living some monstrous lie moses thought a minute i think you could tell somehow if you got to know them hardy entered yeah like if you got married to one and he beat you then youd know this isnt funny frannie turned on her husband dont make a joke of it dismas im not making a joke out of it frannie im on your side here okay whats your problem my problem its not my problem my brother says all women are liars and i dont accept that and thats my problem i didnt say all women i said i know what you said what im saying is this isnt my god damn problem suddenly frannie was on her feet halffalling over her brother and susan getting to the aisle running up out of the stands hardy looked helplessly after her susan got up and followed moses was shaking his head what did i say it was after six when exhausted they finally found a parking space around the corner unloaded the sleeping kids from the car seats and carried them one each a halfblock to the picket fence that bordered their lawn phil and tom distephano were sitting on their front steps they stood up together both in denim and tshirts hardy swore under his breath he opened the gate and stepped in front of frannie this isnt a good time guys he said rebecca shifted loose and gangling in his arms and he bolstered her up you hiding behind some babies and a girl phil had been drinking a lot his eyes were out of focus he was having trouble keeping his balance hardy kept his voice low im not hiding behind anything howd you find out where i live thats for you to know asshole tom the son had talked to his dad got his attitude adjusted when hardy had gone down with the sixpack and interviewed him last time hed been surly but gradually somewhat cooperative now never mind the profanity his body language said it all he was ready for a fight blocking the path hardy gave them both a weary practiced smile lets move on guys all the way off the property were going in neither man moved you come over to my home and molest my wife you think youre getting away with that phil said put down your kid asshole toms little mantra of asshole was getting under hardys skin he halfturned back to where frannie stood as though rooted to the ground holding vincent he was about to herd them all back to the car drive down to the safeway on clement and call the police was about to takes a brave man to hide behind his kid phil said you men get out of here frannies momentary shock had worn off she started to step around hardy but he held out a hand stopping her were going inside he said follow me he tried to get rebecca to stir to put her down have her somehow be protected behind him but she was dead weight in his arms he turned back im real impressed with a guy who beats his wife takes guts a real man you put down your kid ill show you a real man you and your son tom here two on one thats about your speed isnt it phil whats your speed asshole hardy squared away on tom thats for you to figure out he paused considered decided against anything moving forward get out of my way right now anybody here gets touched youre going to wish you werent born oooh tough guy hardy the vulcan nodded if thats what it takes and started walking frannie a step behind him first phil then tom stepped aside and let frannie go by covering her back with macho desperadoes like these he knew a rock wasnt out of the question her hands were shaking and she had some trouble with the door so he stepped in turned the key and pushed it open before he entered himself he turned around the next time i look out here you guys had better be gone go sleep it off before you get into real trouble phil pointed a finger at him you go near my wife again hardy frannie got sick all day out in the sun the outburst at the ballpark the tension out front hardy tended to her ran her a cool bath and did all the kid stuff getting them down before he tucked frannie in it was still light outside he went to his chair in the living room put on some classical music was freeman getting to him and started reading the paperback of a brief history of time recommended by both moses and abe separately black holes the big bang string theory maybe even god but he couldnt concentrate or rather he couldnt get the confrontation out of his mind he was racing the adrenalin pumped and nowhere to go how had they found where he lived hed given nancy his home telephone number a mistake he knew that a reverse listing even of an unlisted number was as close as the nearest phonecompany employee and pacbell was probably the biggest employer in the state stupid he considered options several illegal going back out to phils house with a handgun make the point a little more strongly that he didnt want them coming around anymore go back without the gun call the police report phils battery of his wife report tonights disturbance and threat but he remembered glitskys words random mischief just wasnt a crime wasnt a police matter in san francisco anymore he wondered what phil had done might be doing to nancy when he got home with his own unspent load of adrenalin after tom left then what he picked up the telephone and got the number for park station it might be a dead night some redhot young patrol person wanting to make some bones do a little more than the minimum nothing ventured it might do a little good im not giving a name hardy said and this is not an emergency but you might want to send a car at the shamrock it wasnt dead but it was slow sunday night the new man hardys replacement was behind the bar the juke was going steadily not too loud the shamrocks usual mix of mostly old rock and roll and irish folksongs since the day two years before when moses had finally removed and ceremoniously smashed the of the unicorn green alligators and longnecked geese some humpback camels and chimpanzees hardy didnt think there was a loser in the box on his second guinness hardy was in a game of with one of the locals named ronnie ronnie was one side or the other of thirty a piano player in a band that had the night off he also illustrated childrens books ronnie was a class act evidently talented certainly a match for hardy at darts he also possessed a deal of gray matter my problem with it he was saying pegging his own customs at the board is that i have a hard time imagining some brother or father letting their own sister or daughter especially daughter get executed for a murder they committed shes a long way from executed if she gets off the worst of it is they put her through a bad time a murder trial is some serious bad time try living with these guys ronnie retrieved his round two twenties and a five drew a line through the on the chalkboard and without a pause without even seeming to look at the board scribbled in even dumb dart throwers got good at subtraction and ronnie was a computer hardy stepped to the line could be just bad luck they didnt know she was even going to be charged so now theyre just waiting to see what happens tripletwenty a good start he took a sip of the stout you know ronnie said i just thought of something what if one of them was trying to kill her too i mean kill all three of them and she just didnt happen to be home hardy stopped his dart poised ronnie was into it do you know whos the beneficiary if the whole familys wiped out at once hardys dart sailed a second tripletwenty three in a row a round was worth a free drink in any bar in the city give me a break ronnie said then did he have any other family the husband who might have inherited anything i dont know hardy said its a good question he threw the third dart which kissed the flights of the other two but landed a millimeter above them in the but outside the triple ring not a bad round ronnie said not bad that man was the devil penny roman mother of melissa who had died from the botched abortion attempt believed it she was not old but somehow conveyed age her hair was frosted to a flat glaze her makeup heavy she wore a calico print grannie dress with a frilly collar that had probably been designed for a teenager and the effect as she walked in her flipflops carrying a tray with coffee and mugs was nearlygrotesque now pen her husband cecil sported a clipped graying mustache a pencil in his ear overthecounter reading glasses green slacks he might have been in the hands of the devil doing the work of the devil he was the devil cecil shrugged at hardy its been very hard you cant imagine im sorry he was almost sorrier that hed come out here by mission dolores to the thousandsquarefoot house with the feeling of doors and windows that never opened jesus and mary peered down from three framed prints in the small room where they all sat cramped and airless hardy and cecil on the chintzcovered sofa and penny on the from half of a wingback chair an oversized ornately framed picture of their daughter melissa smiled at hardy from the end table cecil wheeled up a little metal portable stand for the coffee tray and their cups the romans were an unturned stone that he had discussed with freeman who had upbraided him for his scruples about whether or not the romans had actually ever dreamed of hurting larry witt the question was could he point at them could they however tangentially deflect the prosecutions case he also didnt love the idea that he was here on this tuesday morning under false pretenses keeping the appointment he had made with them yesterday after telling them he was a policeman if terrell or glitsky couldnt or wouldnt do it when he had been an assistant district attorney hardy had gone shopping one day in south san francisco at the badge store badges were neither sanctioned nor forbidden by the office everyone realized that sometimes they came in handy especially with people whose english might not be perfect and who were used to looking at badges who knew essentially what they meant even if some of the nuances were missing so he had been officer hardy on the phone and now he had a badge they had let him right in this is just routine especially after this much time we keep trying to catch up someday maybe hardy smiled ingratiatingly sipped his coffee and opened the manila folder he had brought with him the folder did not contain a police report on the reported vandalism to dr witts car instead hardy had borrowed for the morning his own copy of the police report on his client mr frankl the man who had thought erroneously as it had turned out that he had a defense for dui the romans did not notice the deception what does he say about us cecil was trying to see something he recognized in the folder hardy moved it away frankly he accuses you of breaking into his car stealing his radio thats ridiculous penny spilled coffee over into her saucer hes a liar too hes not anything anymore maam hes dead yes i know that of course her lips tightened trying to hold it in and failing and im glad he is now pen cecil reached his left hand across the table and laid it on his wifes knee we have to be christians here hate the sin but love the sinner i cant i cant do it cecil patted the knee absently his attention back at hardy his hand stayed where it was and it made him sit crookedly dr witt was a sinner officer but that doesnt mean we broke into his car he gestured around the room do we look like the like we steal radios out of cars why would we what would it prove would it bring our daughter back hardy was beginning to think it was pretty likely that in fact they hadnt broken into dr witts car if anyone had he jotted a reminder to ask jennifer you say dr witt was a sinner though did you know him personally hardy saw the tendons of cecils left hand rise up he was squeezing his wifes knee hard there was no reaction from her cecils calm was chilling dr witt was an abortionist officer he killed our daughter they went through it as hardy knew they would have to penny began to cry silently unmoving to them both it was a seamless tale of evils cause and effect their daughters unfortunate lust her sin not accepting gods will and bringing to fruit the life she had created allowing witt to turn the blade on her baby finally casting her lot with the abortionists the killers and as cecil and penny had known would happen they wound up killing her hardy closed the folder he deserved what he got penny couldnt hold herself in any longer cecils hand tightened again we read about it in the papers naturally the lord takes care of his own i think someone else took care of dr witt hardy said he wasnt the lords officer he was the devil he was the last instrument of melissas torture we never even saw his car i dont know what kind of car he had penny began crying we didnt know anything about him now hes coming back from the dead to punish us some more hardy was standing up wanting out of there no maam hes not hes not going to punish you im closing this file and were going to forget all about it i believe you gradually the fire went out penny sat back deflated managing a weak thank you cecil walked with him to the door took a couple of steps outside it was another clear morning with a light breeze the sutro tower sparkled in the sun a mile away cecil stared at it for a long moment it does get meted out you know punishment we hope so hardy the cop playing the role im talking about him about dr witt hardy waited you know after he killed melissa before he was killed himself i knew he was living in his fine house making all kinds of money profiting form his sins hardy wondered if cecil knew that witt had volunteered for his work at the mission hills clinic but this wasnt the time to tell him and i know thats the way in this world sinners prosper but once in a while we see proof we see some justice here in this world it gets meted out yes sir they shook hands it wasnt until he was back downtown parking at sutter street that he realized what cecil had said penny may have believed she knew they knew nothing about dr witt but cecil obviously knew he lived in a fine house up by sutro tower and he had known that before hed read about it in the papers hardy talked to jennifer and learned that larrys car had been vandalized but he hadnt reported it to the police what were the police going to do about it hed simply gotten it fixed bought a new radio thats what you did insurance had covered it larry had been an only child and his parents had died long ago the witt family had been alone in the world and they felt like it that was why she said larry was so protective wouldnt let her go out on her own wanted to know where she was all the time so he could be sure she was all right that the family was safe she and larry had agreed that they didnt want phil and nancy to be matts guardians so larry had asked one of his cousins laurie something who lived down in orange county if shed take the responsibility if it ever came down to that but all that notwithstanding jennifers family as closest next of kin in fact would have inherited if jennifer had been killed along with larry and matt still after all that and though hed be happy if it turned out that tom or phil or even the romans had had a hand in larry witts murder hardy didnt really believe any of them had he was reaching after his day with her physicians his gut told him that jennifer was probably guilty of what shed been charged with hed just about come around to believing as freeman did that she had killed firsthusband ned and secondhusband larry to stop them from beating her and somehow tragically by mistake matt had gotten in the way frannie put her hand up against the plexiglas and jennifer did the same they stared at one another for a long moment frannie hadnt really planned to visit jennifer again shed left the kids with erin intended to go shopping maybe it had been the scene with jennifers father and brother maybe she just wanted reassurance that they werent really so dangerous maybe she felt a little guilty starting something with jennifer she wasnt prepared to follow through on she wasnt sure it was complicated but the fact was that she was here now jennifer broke the silence you dont look so good are you all right slowly at first then gradually building into a torrent of words surprising herself frannie told about her fight with her brother moses the trouble with dismas that seemed to be getting a life of its own her guilt over leaving her children again with erin cochran rebeccas grandmother only at the end did she get to phil and tom distephano and their threat last night my father and brother came to your house why did they do that i think to beat up dismas maybe just threaten him they were pretty drunk i think but it scared me to death jennifers eyes went to the hands pressed together on either side of the glass those idiots it never ends she let out a long breath what were they threatening him about something about molesting your mother dismas told me hed gone and seen her i know and my father had beaten her up he told me that too silence frannie was scared shed been frightened all morning jumping at little noises when the telephone rang imagining the rooms and their house violated the door broken down the windows shattered angry or embarrassed or both shed had no heart to discuss it with dismas before hed gone out i just talked to him again you know your husband he wanted to know if he wanted to know some things about my parents he didnt mention anything about last night was he here jennifer shook her head he called me on the phone its a hassle getting up here anyway and he just had a couple of questions no you and he are separate she paused men are separate thats just the way it is i tell them what they need to know they ask me questions and i answer them so what about your father what do you think hes going to do i dont know against another man i dont know or my brother either do you think theyd hurt our kids if they touched frannie stopped unable to say it youd kill them frannie nodded startled by the sudden realization that she would kill to protect her children is that what happened she asked larry started hitting matt for a moment she thought jennifer was just going to nod and say yes but there was a withdrawal something in her posture her eyes her hand came away from the plexiglas i wouldnt worry she said finally i think its okay my father wont do anything besides men only hit when they think you wont hit back jennifer sat forward legs crossed id kill for a cigarette she said and added one time ned my first husband decided this dentist was coming on to me and he went over pounded his chest a couple of times or at least he said he did then came back and beat me up her face broke into a sad almost wistful smile same as always what did you do frannie was leaning forward her hand alone pressed to the glass how could you let that go on jennifer sighed again crossing her arms and staring into the middle distance above them im listening frannie said jennifers hand moved to the plexiglas her face seemed to harden with the memory whatever it was she was whispering intent eyes on frannies you dont want to know hardy had mentioned it more or less casually an annoyance more than anything else but abe glitsky did not like the fact that phil and tom distephano had gone proactive on his best friend it wasnt so much the threat itself after all nothing had really happened no serious crime had taken place glitskys view that all but the most heinous acts went uninvestigated and unpunished in san francisco did not mean however that uncivilized behavior was okay by him his days as a beat cop were not so far behind him that he didnt remember the force a policeman could bring to bear on an individual who needed a lesson in etiquette or control phil distephano was a plumber who worked out of a mediumsized shop near the kezar pavilion the dispatcher told glitsky that phil and two of the other guys were out to lunch and ought to be back within fifteen minutes so he decided to wait it wasnt that long glitsky stood up the scar through his lips stretching into a white line as he found himself enduring the halfhostile stares of the three rednecks halfcaucasian sometimes he found himself hating white people more than he ever hated all but the most repugnant of blacks he thought it was probably a flaw in his character hed work on it someday he really would the dispatcher said something and the biggest of the three men turned around he spoke in mannered polite tones ostensibly cooperative im phil distephano is there a problem glitsky had flashed his badge earlier and no doubt the dispatcher had passed along the information that this casually dressed strapping black man was the law the other two plumbers flanked phil but seemed to be waiting for an excuse now to go to the back room or their truck or wherever it was they went while they waited to fix drains and unplug sewer lines he took out his badge again if you could spare a couple of minutes he motioned outside a jog of his head opening the door he didnt look back but went halfway across the sidewalk and turned arranging it so that the sun was behind him when he turned phil had followed him and stood off a few steps squinting beginning to sweat glitsky let him he took it for about ten seconds which seemed like a very long time we got a problem here officer ive go some calls ive got to dismas hardy glitsky wanted it so quiet that phil would have to listen carefully whats that glitsky repeated it your daughters attorney guy you visited last night phil put up a hand hey now you wait a minute hardy came by my house i dont know what hes telling you but hes the one phil went on a while longer the sweat now shining across his forehead when he wound down glitsky asked him if he was all finished i dont know if i am phil seemed heartened by glitskys tolerance his quiet patience arms folded hearing him out im thinking maybe i should call in some report on him you know hes gonna keep up this kind of harassment im harassing you no no i didnt mean that i meant him coming to my place bothering my wife it had gone on long enough glitsky thought that another of his flaws was that he hadnt sufficiently enjoyed burning up ants under a magnifying glass when he was a kid he nodded his head as though hed taken in all of phils information considered it carefully hardy didnt bother your wife sure he did he was there and andi if i hear that youve threatened him again youre going to find life in this town very hard youre going to get speeding tickets youre going to get towed whenever you park phil was moving into righteous indignation act i are you threatening me its entirely possible you could even lose your job bosses dont like employees who have the cops down on them its bad for business i dont have to listen to this whats your name again you cant do this glitskys scar shone bright through a cold smile ill bet i can he lowered his voice the name is inspector sergeant abraham glitsky you need me to spell it ill give you my badge number if you want phil stood there the sweat running down his face glitsky moved a step closer hardys a friend of mine id make him a friend of yours too in fact id say its in your best interest to see that nothing bad happens to him because if it does i might be tempted to think you were part of it and that would be unfortunate for you he turned and left phil sweating in the sun getting into his car he heard and ignored the explosion of obscenity he had expected it and it rolled off he had delivered his message put out the word it was what hed come down for by friday in spite of her assurances to the contrary donna bellows had not called back with news of any connection between crane amp crane and larry witt freeman was chomping for any crumbs he might use at trial so hardy covering the bases thought that hed call down to la again though he entertained little hope that there was even a tangential link between simpson cranes murder in los angeles and larry witts in san francisco on reflection the whole thing was so tenuous that he didnt want to pursue it at all which was why he had hoped that donna bellows would have called him back so he wouldnt have to chase this phantom himself nevertheless he was doing his job following leads that so far led nowhere freeman wanted them all to juggle see how much he could keep in the air as hed often done in the past sufficiently dazzle the jury with his legerdemain so they wouldnt notice it was being done with mirrors look this way now look at this what about this whoa theres a neat trick anything to distract to draw attention away from the evidence they both thought had a good chance of damning their client hardys feet were on his desk the door out to his hallway was open and so was the window over sutter street behind him faintly he smelled the bay the crossventilation felt good in the room the phone down in los angeles was ringing and he picked up a quick dart and tossed it across at his board it landed in the a quarterinch from he spoke to a monotonic receptionist who put him on hold waiting he threw another dart this time hit the and was talking to an extremely formal secretary mr crane is in a meeting right now may i help you hardy tended to respect secretaries even formal ones like phyllis but he had a hard time with the secretaryaskeeperofthegate school he thought that in the long run for important issues it wasted far more time than it saved principals ought to talk to principals he was polite if mr crane is in ill be glad to hold its a matter of some urgency regarding a murder trial there was a sigh another long hold then a weary mans voice todd crane hardy raised his victory fist in the air introducing himself expressing his condolences but crane kept it to the point maxine said this was about a murder trial how can i help you hardy explained about the postit hed found under larry witts blotter with crane amp cranes number written on it the word no underlined and circled several times im afraid i dont what was this victims name again larry witt dr larry witt sorry im drawing a blank on that hardy took a shot how about the yerba buena medical group ybmg okay was witt with them we handle their business development thats jody bachman he spelled it for hardy you want me to connect you the telephone presumably in jody bachmans office rang ten times before bachmans voice mail picked it up thinking here we go again hardy left his name and number and a brief description of what he wanted he got up threw the last dart on his desk and hit the on the other side of then turned around and looked down out the window onto sutter street in spite of bachman not being in he found himself somewhat encouraged there was finally a link between larry witt and crane amp crane sure he knew that there would have had to be since the postit had had cranes number on it but the relationship had proved elusive to establish and now hed done that like the crossventilation it felt good finding out facts felt good of course what those facts supported what they even meant was another issue altogether and since it was friday afternoon hardy didnt feel much in the mood to pursue that line facts related to the other dudes line of defense seemed to lead to a fork in the road to the truth that led to a dead end he had uncovered a fact but did it lead anywhere the police in los angeles thought although they couldnt prove it that a hit man had murdered simpson crane and his wife simpsons firm one of the partners anyway handled the business development of the medical group that larry witt belonged to even a genius like david was going to have a difficult time establishing any provable causality between those two bits of data at least hardy felt like hed done his job bachman would call him back about details before they really got into the trial which probably wouldnt be for another month or so glitsky had consented reluctantly to see what he could find out about the romans on the day of larrys murder over the next weeks he might see nancy distephano again and try to get a line on where phil and tom had been on the monday after christmas so hardy had other dudes by the carload for the time being his job would be to assist david freeman research legal issues that might come up prepare for his own phase of the trial the penalty phase if jennifer got convicted he was going to see what david freeman could do with his brains his showmanship his fabled much ballyhooed je ne sais quoi part three on monday july oscar thomasino had slammed down his gavel and sent the case of the people of the state of california v jennifer lee witt to department the courtroom of judge joan villars that formality was quickly followed by a flurry of motions made and denied jury selection would begin as scheduled on august david freeman had immediately filed his pro forma penal code motion for dismissal arguing that there was insufficient evidence to proceed and as expected judge villars had thrown that out if a grand jury had found sufficient evidence to indict on three counts of murder it was an unusually brave or foolish judge who would cast aside their decision jennifers hair had grown out her bruises had disappeared when she appeared in the courtroom for the first time flanked by two bailiffs a buzz went up in the gallery the defendant looked like a movie star gone was the red jail escapee jumpsuit gone were the leg irons and handcuffs judge villars prodded by freeman had agreed that they would be prejudicial to his client also there would be no need to shackle her to her chair at the defense table although jennifer had broken out of jail even powell admitted that there was little risk that she would bolt and escape the courtroom jennifer wore low heels nude hosiery a stylish muted coral dress with a hem an inch above her very attractive knees freeman had arranged to have someone come into the jail and do her hair and now it shone clean blonde just long enough to be feminine and proper diamond stud earrings a tasteful touch of makeup they led her in before the judge entered while the members of the media as well as the eighty potential jurors were finding their seats behind the rail hardy who had been talking with frannie at the defense table on the left side of the courtroom heard the noise in the gallery and looked up stopping in midsentence my goodness he said freeman halfturned a few flash bulbs went off villars would put a stop to that as soon as she came in but for now jennifer was fair game she smiled in her ambiguous way either shy or posing and more bulbs went off the bailiffs delivered her to freeman who put an avuncular arm around her waist guiding her to a chair between himself and hardy you look good freeman told her just right im scared jennifer said freeman rubbed a hand over her back its all right thats natural you just sit here and relax hardy noticed that her hands were shaking she clasped them together on the table in front of her her fingers tightly intertwined freeman came around on her right and covered them with one of his gnarled paws over the past weeks hardy had seen the earlier animosity between lawyer and client dissipate as they worked together fashioning a defense now though freeman still apparently believed that jennifer was lying about her innocence he had somehow convinced her that he was her best and most trusted friend that he personally was her only salvation accordingly she had come to cling to him her life raft in a stormy sea that was all right with hardy who might yet have his own role to play and it would not be as liaison between jennifer and david freeman it was villars would enter in seven minutes dean powell and his associate a young assistant da named justin morehouse were conferring shuffling papers on their table a dozen feet to hardys right jennifer dr ken lightner had come up to the rail and jennifer turned in her chair then stood and put her arms around him one of the bailiffs came moving up fast but freeman held out a hand and somehow restrained him from breaking them up it was over in seconds anyway jennifer pulling away kissing lightners cheek hardy made a mental note probably freeman did too to caution jennifer about these kinds of public embraces they could too easily be misinterpreted both hardy and freeman knew about the bond between jennifer and lightner but it would be difficult to explain to a jury woman accused of killing two of her husbands hugs another man as her trial begins no it wouldnt look good jennifer freeman and lighner were huddled whispering together at the railing that separated the gallery from the courtroom proper walter terrell had appeared and was having a few words with powell and morehouse even though he would play no active role in this part of the trial hardys mouth was dry his stomach jumpy and sour he turned in his chair to pour himself a glass of water in time to see the door open behind the judges bench the clerk intoning that all should rise department of the superior court for the city and county of san francisco was in session judge joan villars presiding the concept of voir dire the questioning and selection of jurors had undergone a sea change in california since the passage in june of proposition before that time attorneys on both sides of a case were given a wide latitude in questions they could ask prospective jurors what did they do for a living how many brothers and sisters did they have what were their hobbies favorite books andor movies feelings about puppies cats goldfish almost anything went if it might serve to bring out a prospective jurors character often the questions were thinly disguised speeches designed to sway prospective jurors and because of this jury selection in a capital case such as this one could easily take as long as two months and in some cases longer since proposition however voir dire was conducted by the judge and as the proposition had contemplated tended to go much more quickly attorneys could supply the judge with a list of questions they wanted to see asked but often these were ignored likewise in the case of jennifer witt freeman had asked villars if he might ask direct questions of some of the jurors the answer had been no lawyers for the prosecution and the defense still had their twenty peremptory challenges the right to dismiss a prospective juror for any reason whatsoever or no reason at all but the empaneling of the jury was now much more outside the perceived control of either counsel it was the judges show jurors were asked if they had read about the case in the newspapers if they could sit through a threemonth trial and perhaps most importantly if in the appropriate case they could vote for the death penalty out of the first eighty jurors after perhaps three days of questioning maybe four would be available for service and they would be told to come back at the end of september they would be part of the pool from which the twelve jurors and six alternates would be chosen then villars would send for eighty more except for the halfmoon reading glasses judge villars was hardys notion of an elderly joan of arc with her helmet of gray hair over a benign and handsome face villars might strike a casual passerby on the street as a gradeschool principal fair but firm perhaps even with a rogue streak of humor but as freeman had told hardy when they had drawn her for this trial looks could be deceiving villars was close to humorless an authoritarian on the bench freeman did not think it was purely the luck of the draw although it was supposed to be that had brought this capital case to her courtroom he fancied that he smelled the sulfurous machinations of dean powell behind the scenes villars was also the least likely judge in superior court to be reversed on appeal if powell got a conviction in her courtroom there was a likelihood that it would stick hardy did not like something else judge villars wasnt likely to overturn a jurys recommendation for the death penalty if it came all the way to that when they had drawn her hardy had tried to convince freeman to challenge out of her department similar to their rights with jurors attorneys for either side in california had one peremptory challenge of the judge assigned to any given case the result in theory was to keep judges from getting too uppity inserting too much of their personalities or beliefs into trials designed to be objective if a judge made things too tough for the prosecution for example the das office could decide to challenge that person out of the building and a few judges over the years had found their careers ended when they had been too free with mandating from the bench some uniquely san francisco notions of fair play legally in theory judges had tremendous responsibility and leeway even in a capital case months of a prosecutors hard work and a jurys longcontemplated decision could be overridden by any judge who decided for almost any defensible reason that justice was not being done but it was also true that any judge who exercised that privilege too often might be off the bench hardy had wanted to challenge villars in spite of her gender she had acquired the reputation of being especially hard on women throughout her career she had it seemed leaned over backward to avoid giving the slightest appearance of favoritism to female attorneys staff defendants a few years earlier she had been in the vanguard of a successful effort to dump the chief justice of the california supreme court a woman because of her soft stand on the death penalty villars was nobodys pussycat all right but freeman had been adamant he wanted her hed been delighted with the choice he could win with her why because freeman believed that villars was in fact absolutely impartial and very few other judges were it wasnt that villars was so tough on women it was that she treated them exactly like she treated men and in san francisco filled with vocal minority groups of every stripe judge villars played it by the book she thought men and women were equal before the law in every way that was how she treated people and it was how she judged them men women whites blacks hispanics gays everybody so freeman was confident that with villars on the bench he stood the best chance of winning the guiltyorinnocent phase and wasnt inclined to challenge the down side of course was that if freeman lost villars would be a very unsympathetic choice for judge in the penalty phase for the eighth time in five weeks eighty people filed into the courtroom the clerk read off twelve names and those people came out of the gallery and filed into the jury box all eighty swore to answer truthfully any question pertaining to their qualifications to serve as jurors judge villars began jennifer lee witt has been charged with three counts of murder in the first degree and special circumstances in an indictment returned by the grand jury for the state of california she continued asking the standard battery of initial questions did anyone on the panel know the defendant the victim how about the attorneys representing them had anyone been a victim of a violent crime did anyone have a policeman as a relative a lawyer a judge did anyone consider themselves familiar with the case from reports theyd seen on television or read in the newspapers had any of them been arrested hands went up in answer to each question and the lawyers took notes and so it went jennifer leaning close to freeman occasionally turning to hardy with a question or comment they were making notes on their peremptory challenges deciding who they would dismiss although there wasnt much to go on jury selection even in the old days of voir dire was of course no exact science now under the new rules it was close to a crap shoot did juror number look like she was sympathetic to jennifer would the young stud number want to give jennifer a break because she was so attractive or would he identify with larry witt a hardworking guy who got stuck with the wrong woman how about the plain jane who was number would she be jealous of jennifers looks or would she perhaps see her as a misguided sister who had been maligned and unfairly accused none of the first twelve survived the initial questioning twelve more were called by september there were ninetytwo people eligible to serve as jurors all the others had been excused for good cause hardship or bias disclosed during the initial questioning only now did the lawyers use their peremptory challenges powell challenged eleven times freeman used all twenty of his they picked six alternates the six weeks of jury selection had passed for hardy in a kind of haze san francisco had its allotted two weeks of warmth in early september and every workday hardy freeman and jennifer had sat at their table powell and his young assistant morehouse over to their right going over the same critical routine again and again it was grueling detailed work that was emotionally and physically draining hardy was needed in court everything he might otherwise actively pursue the other dudes for instance had to get put on hold every night after leaving the hall of justice hardy and freeman would discuss prospective jurors and strategies until they began to babble then theyd do it again the next day at home frannie held on her husband came home late left early was distracted when he was there they went away on two of the weekends once without the kids to a cabin in the pines around lake tahoe they decided they would get through this and have a real life again someday now it was monday october the players were assembled the gallery was full and dean powell stood at last ready to begin hardy thought that the contrast between him and david freeman couldnt be greater powell radiated authority and personality he wore a welltailored dark suit with a blue tie no need to emphasize the power with red or with pinstripes his face chiseled strong and bronzed wore an expression of amiable concern occasionally he would run his hand through the mane of white hair the only combing it needed in the middle of the courtroom he turned to face the jury that had been empaneled over the past weeks your honor mr freeman mr hardy ladies and gentlemen of the jury i want to thank you all for giving up your valuable time for this most important of civic duties all of us here powell included the defense table with a sweeping gesture are grateful freeman and hardy exchanged glances they both knew the defense would be within their rights to object to this little massaging of the jury by the prosecuting attorney such a welcome was really the judges prerogative but many attorneys on both sides often tried to show what nice people they really were underneath the lawyer costume freeman wasnt about to object the jury would find it meanspirited most judges let the welcome party go on a bit villars did not her gavel came down with a crack mr powell ive already welcomed the jury and thanked them for their time this is your opening statement lets hear it hardy kept a straight face freeman brought a hand up perhaps to cover a smile powell bowed slightly toward the bench of course sorry your honor he turned back to the jury there were four men and eight women five blacks four whites three female hispanics one retired doctor three housewives two unemployed four secretaries and an office manager a parimutuel clerk perhaps two gay men you could break it down any number of ways and it still came down to a guessing game no one doubted that villars had done a competent and quick job of it and no one had much of a clue what any of these people were like except that they all professed to believe in the death penalty if warranted powell smiled the lowwattage version judge villars has asked me to proceed with my opening statement and thats what im going to do he nodded making a little eye contact here and there what is an opening statement well its really quite simple im going to talk a little about the defendant in this case jennifer lee witt and the three people she killed two husbands and here powell stopped for effect and her young son another pause the roots of this case go back a long way all the way to the people of the state of california believe and will prove to you beyond any reasonable doubt that jennifer witt on or about the th of september of that year injected her husband at the time edward teller hollis with a lethal dose of atropine which is a derivative of jimson weed more commonly known as deadly nightshade powell wasnt using theatrics wasnt playing the personality game he did so well perhaps he had taken the early cue from villars but his version of events was beginning to come out free of gimmickry straightforward and plausible at the time of the death of mr hollis and while she was married to him we will prove to you that jennifer witt was romantically involved with another man a dentist dr harlan poole atropine is a common medication available in most dentists offices and specifically available nine years ago in dr pooles office it is used to inhibit the flow of saliva as though stricken with dry mouth himself powell went to the prosecution table and drank from a glass of water hardy found himself getting thirsty freeman drank even villars took a discreet sip on the bench powell came back to the center of the room why did jennifer witt kill her first husband the prosecution will introduce to you exhibits that prove the existence of a lifeinsurance policy in the amount of seventyfive thousand dollars payable to jennifer witt in the event of her husbands death within four months of the death of mr hollis jennifer received that payment in full seventyfive thousand dollars was a lot of money in objection your honor freeman halfstood he had to say something to break up powells rhythm even though this was the most innocuous of his statements but while it could be debated whether was a lot of money in it couldnt be that the opinion was evidence it wasnt villars sustained freeman but gave him a look opening statements could not argue the law and they could not editorialize but a wide latitude was often given and villars was telling freeman that if he was going to object to powells peccadilloes in these areas she would sustain powell if he tried to do the same to him the interplay of the trial was beginning if freemans intent was to bump powells rhythm he failed the prosecutor was sailing and this objection was nothing to him as soon as villars said sustained he plunged ahead as all of you ladies and gentlemen of the jury are aware this is a capital case alleging special circumstances and one of the special circumstances is that this killing of edward teller hollis was a coldblooded murder of a human being for monetary gain it does not matter that this act occurred some years ago there is no statute of limitations on murder jennifer sitting between hardy and freeman sat ramrod stiff on the front half of her seat everything about her seemed in tight control except her nostrils tended to flare with her breathing powell looked directly at her and paused in his statement was it a challenge to him her cold gaze of dismissal he allowed himself a nod almost friendly and next to hardy jennifer shifted a year after her first husbands death that is in jennifer married larry witt who had left the woman who had put him through medical school freeman stood again objecting again he was sustained this time more forcefully this was the beginning of what would possibly be many attempts at simple character assassination and villars was giving powell warning that she wasnt having it it wasnt evidence dont try to introduce it it was a small good sign and hardy made a note on his pad had the silent exchange between jennifer and powell lured him away from his game plan or had it been an unintentional gaffe but the prosecutor had a lot more to get out and he had everybody listening in jennifer married larry witt who was just setting up a medical practice they had a son matthew the following year as dr witts practice grew they bought increasingly larger amounts of life insurance until at the time of his death on december of last year larry witt was insured for twoandahalfmillion dollars this was the time for a pregnant pause and powell took it a susurrous breath went through the courtroom twoandahalfmillion dollars ladies and gentlemen we will show you this policy as one of the peoples exhibits and you will see that it contains a clause providing for double indemnity should larry witt die a violent death as he did that brings the amount of the payment on his death to fivemillion dollars and i neednt tell you that thats a lot of money in any year powell glanced with a smile at freeman making niceguy points with the jury freeman who didnt do suave as a rule gave his impression of a smile back villars picked up her gavel but reconsidered and put it back down of course the presence of an insurance policy is no proof of murder lets be clear on this we will show you and prove to you beyond a reasonable doubt that the actions of jennifer witt on the morning of monday december will allow for no other explanation than that she shot her husband and son with her own handgun then left her house in an effort to provide herself with an alibi for the time in question fortunately for the people of the state of california we have two witnesses who will testify regarding this alibi between them they will remove any doubt about jennifer being in her home when the shots were fired she was there she had the gun and she used it to kill her husband for his insurance and finally most tragically we have young matthew witt next to hardy jennifer slumped slightly the anger either had passed or given way to something more powerful for the first time she hung her head freeman looked over and put his hand over her lower arm she looked back up frankly we cannot tell you why matthew witt had to die on that monday morning but die he did shot with the same gun as the one that had killed his father we will even concede that it might have been a mistake the boy could have accidentally come into the line of fire he could have startled jennifer your honor please these conjectures have no place in an opening statement powell preempted the judge apologizing freeman was right he was sorry and the facts will show that jennifer witt killed her husband for fivemillion dollars motive the murder weapon was her own gun which she and her husband kept in the bedroom of her house means she was alone in the house with her husband and son when she turned the gun on them opportunity we will prove these beyond a reasonable doubt and in so doing will recommend that a person capable of these crimes has forfeited her right to live in our society such a person male or female should be given the ultimate penalty such a person should be condemned to death thank you in california the defense has the option of delivering its own opening statement immediately after the prosecutions somewhat as a rebuttal or of waiting until the prosecution rests its case freeman had done it both ways in various trials in his career and this time he was choosing the latter he wasnt sure how things were going to break as the evidence accumulated and he thought he would make more of an impression introducing things if indicated later on he did not want to tip his hand the drawback to this way of proceeding was that it did seem at the outset to give the prosecution a lot of time in possession powell had barely sat down when freeman announced he would be waiting giving his opening statement at the beginning of the defenses case the prosecutor was quickly back up calling inspector sergeant walter terrell as his first witness freeman and hardy had speculated on the order of witnesses and neither of them had picked terrell as leadoff looking younger than usual in slacks and an aviator jacket terrell aggressively pushed his way through the railing separating the gallery from the courtroom taking the oath his eyes were everywhere why is he so nervous jennifer asked first murder trial freeman did not take his eyes off the inspector mistake he whispered half to himself for us jennifer turned to hardy who shook his head no at least he didnt think so freeman didnt answer and powell was moving forward talking to the judge your honor for the record we are going to be conducting this trial by first concentrating on the murder of edward teller hollis we will be calling witnesses again to testify when we get to the larry and matthew witt phase of the trial and officer terrell will be one such witness i just wanted to make that clear since this had been covered in pretrial conferences with villars there was no objection from freeman powell turned to terrell officer terrell could you please tell the jury how you came to be involved in the investigation of the murder of edward hollis terrell nodded swallowing trying to smile thats ned is that right the first husband there was a brief chorus of nervous laughter some even from the jury box terrell reacted to it offended he didnt mean to make anyone laugh powell remained calm if it please the court well refer to edward teller hollis as ned hollis back to terrell he repeated his question i am an inspector with the homicide department last december i was the investigating officer in the homicide of larry and matthew witt in the course of doing background on the suspect the defendant mrs witt i asked about her first husband she told me he had died of a drug overdose and that shed collected on an insurance policy i thought that was a coincidence worth looking into all this was true and hardy realized that calling terrell maybe wasnt such a mistake at all terrells testimony would establish the similarities between the alleged motives behind the two homicides and would do it before introducing any of the evidence that linked the murders to jennifer actually it seemed a pretty slick opening and hardy wondered what freeman was going to do about it come right at it and try to knock it down was the only answer your honor in the courtroom freemans voice took on a more sonorous tone which couldnt be anything but purposeful everything freeman did on this stage was if possible rehearsed although nothing appeared to be freemans voice in other situations tended to the gruff with a coarse edge low and guttural here rising the personification of gentle reason there was authority but the tone was that of a kindly grandfather villars waited while freeman got all the way up it took longer than it had to but the trial had just begun and the judge could be expected to incline toward patience your honor he repeated its a little early for coincidences no evidentiary link has been established as hardy knew motives were terrells weakness the young inspector redfaced now veins visible on his neck halfstood leaning forward in the witness box the man was killed and she collected the insurance what do you want bam bam bam villars eyes were on fire although she controlled her voice inspector terrell thats enough mr freeman is addressing the court not you is that clear terrell got himself back down he straightened his jacket still angry i asked you a question inspector is that clear yes your honor sorry villars nodded once apparently holding no grudge satisfied even the glaring eye was gone nothing personal but make no mistake there was going to be order in her court for two seconds villars looked at the ceiling then back down to freeman the objection is sustained mr powell youll have to be a little more specific she turned to the jury box from firebrand to functionary in a few seconds ladies and gentlemen please disregard the inspectors comments about coincidence its up to you to make the connections between facts remember that back to the prosecutor mr powell powell who had had the control of the courtroom taken from him in less than the time it took to tie his shoes was suddenly hyperaware his first witness was now a demonstrable hothead with a fraction of his original credibility and they had a long way to go he smiled his unruffled smile officer terrell lets take a new line shall we he walked terrell carefully a step at a time through the interview with jennifer leaving out reference to the reasons they had finally gone back and exhumed the jury as villars had said would have to make that leap the fact was that they had exhumed and that they had found a concentration of atropine in the left thigh powell did not go near any question of how it might have gotten there ned did have an insurance policy for seventyfivethousand dollars jennifer had provided a copy of the policy and the check from her tax records here it is ladies and gentlemen of the jury peoples exhibit jennifer was the beneficiary heres her canceled check peoples thats all for the prosecution inspector terrell thanks very much here comes your crossexamination hardy was sure he wasnt alone in the impression that terrell had gone up there intending to say a lot more stay a while longer make more of a splash he was still obviously pumped up both from nerves and adrenalin freeman was playing that against him shuffling some papers fumbling up out of his chair straightening his wrinkled tie it wasnt quite slow enough to prompt villars into moving him along but it clearly was playing all hell with terrell finally finally freeman got to the center of the courtroom good morning he said genially and waited some more the gambit threw terrell further offstride until at last he nodded and mumbled something like a greeting back now inspector terrell you have testified that ned hollis had a seventyfivethousand dollar insurance policy and that jennifer witt was the beneficiary thats correct isnt it the witness looked up at the judge for an instant then to powell finally back to freeman thats right what did mrs witt tell you would happen if she died instead of ned then what another pause thinking about it then ned would have gotten the money in other words it was a joint policy a husband and wife ifoneofusdiesthehouseispaidfor kind of policy yes thats right and in fact did jennifer tell you that she and ned owned a house together at this time yes they did and you checked it out and that was the truth wasnt it yes it was in your investigation did you come upon any records on the value of that house terrell cast a whatsallthisabout look at powell freeman knew that if powell objected to hearsay what someone had told terrell out of court that the objection would be sustained but freeman could prove the value of the house anyway with other records and witnesses if he had to and the jury would remember that the prosecutor had tried to keep it from them powell said nothing terrell answered that yes jennifer and ned had bought a shoebox down near daly city putting down twentythousand dollars so their loan was eighty thousand dollars i dont know id assume so you know they put down twenty thousand dollars but you dont know what their loan was powell stood up trying to save terrell at least for later your honor relevance villars was curt i think so go on mr freeman inspector their loan was around eighty thousand dollars yes freeman did a little awkward halfturn almost a pirouette toward the jury and again in your investigations did you discover whatever became of that loan terrell pulled at his suddenly tight collar i believe mrs witt paid it off with the insurance money yes i believe so you believe so or you know so inspector i know so she paid off the loan indeed she did freeman went back to his table and took out a fat photocopied document he had it marked as defense exhibit and passed up to terrell youve seen this before as terrell was looking at it freeman turned to the jury in other words inspector terrell from this document you knew that jennifer witt did not take a yearlong vacation to las vegas for example powell was on his feet objection ill withdraw the comment your honor freeman had made his point if jennifer had killed ned to take some money and live the high life she might have been expected to have kept at least some of it to party with theres just one other thing id like to ask you about inspector you said jennifer mrs witt told you that ned hollis used drugs yes she said he experimented with drugs isnt that right thats right you interviewed people who corroborated that powell got up again your honor hearsay mr freeman is badgering the witness not quite but i take your point freeman waited silent mr freeman i was waiting for your ruling your honor villars was not amused she had the reporter read back the previous dialogue then said that for the record the objection is sustained freeman nodded then continued with terrell how many of mr hollis friends did you interview all that i could find and every single one of them confirmed hat ned experimented with drugs isnt that true objection hearsay sustained freeman did any of them deny that ned experimented with drugs objection hearsay sustained the old defense attorney stood for a beat then during your exhaustive investigation into the death of ned hollis did anyone ever describe mr hollis drug use as other than experimental like a weary jackinthebox powell again rose objection hearsay villars had had enough mr freeman no matter how many different ways you ask the question im going to sustain this objection every time please move on freeman was contrite i apologize your honor back to terrell with a kindly smile i have no further questions theyre shooting themselves in the foot on ned you notice powell said little about it in his opening especially didnt even put jennifer in the county when he died much less the room freeman chewed on his sandwich a thick fistful of dry italian salami on a sourdough roll villars should have bought my this was the motion he had filed before the trial asserting that there was not sufficient evidence in the ned situation to convict which villars had denied unless theyve got some big surprise this one cant fly it was the lunch recess they had cabbed up to the office on sutter and were sitting on benches in the small brickandglass enclosed garden just outside the conference room above them in the aperture formed by the surrounding buildings the sky burned a deep blue indian summer san franciscos finest season hardy picked at the bread of his sandwich threw it in the direction of some sparrows foraging in the low shrubbery you with us freeman asked sure hardy flicked another crumb just thinking about the case hardy shrugged you dont have to tell me but are things all right with you you doing okay getting enough sleep the first days of these trials can be tough leaning forward hardy let out a long breath i dont know whats going on at home david it feels like im losing my wife literally i dont know maybe not but maybe so hardy stood up crossed the small opening stared at blank brick without turning around he said somethings happened the last couple of months i dont think its the trial all this preparation i dont know what it is but it scares me to death you ask her couple of hundred times one way or the other and nothing hardy shrugged finally turned not much not enough weve got this tradition where we go out on wednesday nights date night or we had it til a month ago the birds were chirping over the crumbs and freeman broke off a bit of his bread and tossed it across the patio something happen a month ago i wish it had i came home one night thinking we were going out and shes in a nightgown reading she tells me i ought to go out by myself shoot some darts shes just tired maybe she was tired time was shed be tired on a wednesday night wed grab a blanket go out to the beach take a nap this date night idea was something wed decided to do tired or not kids or not the marriage needed it we need it for ourselves freeman contemplated his sandwich how old are your kids two and almost one but its not that at the skeptical look hardy said i dont think its that you think it is i barely know frannie diz but she wouldnt be the first woman to decide her kids needed her more than her husband priorities change well they havent changed with me freeman allowed himself a smile lifes unfair like jfk said if only we could find somebody to sue he shifted on the bench popped the last of his sandwich does she think you need her come on david need who knows need i love her and i think she knows that i dont mean to sound presumptuous but your kids know need frannie knows need well hell i need her too i mean were adults though weve both got things weve got to do ive got this trial shes got the kids what are we supposed to do thats what date night was supposed to be for to keep us connected it doesnt sound like youre too connected you just said it youve got this trial shes got the kids hands in his pockets hardy found himself pacing arguing with david freeman proving his point that frannie perhaps shouldnt feel what she was feeling whatever it was didnt alter the fact that something pretty fundamental seemed to have changed between them some balance had shifted maybe what freeman had implied was true that she didnt feel as though he needed her so much anymore he had to admit he wasnt giving her much sign of it leaving for work early getting home late drafting motions doing research following up his investigations reviewing files on weekends as far as that went he didnt feel like she was needing him much either she was doing her jobs caring for the children taking care of the home they were he believed committed to each other and that had to be one of the main ingredients of what they both called adult love id surprise her freeman had come up next to him and put a hand on his shoulder break up the routine maybe shes just burned out maybe she sees youre not there for her and shes afraid you wont be and shes pulling away but i am there this trials just starting what does she expect maybe the question is what does she need freeman patted his shoulder opening the glass door back into the conference room lets get back to court her honor frowns on tardiness john strout the coroner for the city and county of san francisco was already a familiar figure to hardy and every other professional in the courtroom an authority with a national reputation the drawling wellrespected medical examiner had appeared at almost every trial grand jury and preliminary hearing that involved a murder in san francisco perhaps once a week for the past thirteen years and now he sat his lanky frame down in the witness box comfortable and relaxed powell showing no sign of postlunch slump combed his white mane with his fingers and greeted strout genially old friends for the jurys benefit then he got right to it preempting what hardy thought would be freemans tack on cross dr strout did you do the initial autopsy on ned hollis back in yes i did and what were your findings at that time strout backed his chair up in the witness box and crossed his legs his broad and open face creased in a smile we ran an a scan and returned with a finding of accidental death due to an overdose of cocaine mixed with alcohol an a scan would you explain to the jury what that is strout leaned forward and gave a twominute explanation most poisons andor volatile compounds were found in the a scan and it was cheapest and quickest if a causeofdeath could be found at the a level without a police report indicating a suspicion of foul play the scanning tended to stop there and the a scan did find traces of cocaine and alcohol in mr hollis system is that it strout frowned making it simple for the jury wasnt his job he was already on the record as having missed the true cause of death in this case and he wanted to keep it precise there was a potentially lethal level of cocaethylene which gets a little technical but basically it is the byproduct when cocaine and alcohol mix in the blood and when you determined the presence of this cocaethylene you stopped the autopsy well no but we stopped looking so hard for a causeofdeath a mans got a knife sticking out of his head we dont necessarily go looking for a coincidental heart attack a brush of low laughter but we didnt complete the autopsy with that finding in fact the lab tests and the physical examination are related but separate procedures strout explained about blood samples being sent off to the lab while the autopsy proper concerned itself with the body and its organs when we get back the lab results we check to see if anything weve discovered in the physical examination might throw some new light on the labs finding or viceversa and in this case well we found the cocaethylene there werent any appreciable amounts or physical indications of the presence of barbiturates or alkaloids so we had a probable cause of death at the a level and stopped there powell nodded to strout then turned first to the jury then back to the defense table making eye contact with jennifer again hardy glanced at her out of the side of his eye was she smiling at her prosecutor he touched her arm and she stiffened her face now a mask the direct examination continued without any surprises both prosecution and defense counsel might have stipulated to all of this forensic detail the facts were largely undisputed but neither powell or freeman had shown any inclination to do so they had their reasons powell wanted to make the longago death of jennifers first husband real to the jury he might have been dead a long time now but when he died hed been a healthy twentysixyearold man powell wanted the jury to know that to get a sense of a young life snuffed out to watch his accused killer react to it all when hed finished outlining the c scan and discovery of the concentration of atropine in neds left thigh powell led strout into an area that did not strictly concern his findings in the lab or at autopsy now dr strout atropine is a prescription drug is it not its not available over the counter strout agreed and what is its principle use its used in anesthesia and to inhibit the flow of saliva strout was good at including everybody he smiled all around smooth and comfortable were you surprised when you found it in the scan youve described objection freeman was up like a shot and almost as quickly without discussion villars sustained him powell remained impassive dr strout to your knowledge does atropine get much use as a recreational drug hardy could see freeman getting poised to object again but he sat back seemingly content to let powell continue with this line of questioning if it is its not a common one it doesnt produce a socalled high or anything like that again hardy glanced over at freeman powell was leading the witness all over the place and freeman was sitting back in his chair lips pursed listening no so if a person were an habitual drug user and looking to get high he or she would not here finally freeman raised a hand keeping his voice low your honor speculation again he was sustained powell smiled palms out apologized in his gentlemanly way and nodded to both the judge and the doctor thats all then thank you dr strout your witness mr freeman the rumpled defense attorney no less genial than powell had been although hardy thought more believable in this guise walked to where powell had been standing then moved three steps closer to the witness box lifting one hand in a casual unspoken greeting to strout telling the jury by gesture that he and strout too were professional colleagues just because he was with the defense it didnt mean he was with the bad guys or was one of them this exhumation business i dont suppose its much fun is it doctor strout was still relaxed there had been trials where he had testified for the better part of a week he looked on his witness time as a break from his work in the morgue he spread his hands its part of the job sometimes it gets pretty interesting was this the ned hollis exhumation one of the particularly interesting ones strout thought for a moment then added id have to say it was and can you tell the jury why that was strout liked this the opportunity to sit back and chat well in any autopsy the search for a cause of death is a bit of a puzzle as ive explained earlier we run laboratory scans for various substances and examine the body hoping we can point at something when were finished in a case where someone has died a long time ago the puzzle can get complicated i guess thats what i mean by interesting freeman apparently fascinated had now wandered closer to the jury box what kind of complications doctor well the body decays for one certain substances break down chemically i mean or turn into something else or disappear entirely evaporate over time of course eventually you can lose almost everything and had that happened with mr hollis well to some degree yes and yet this was a particularly interesting puzzle i believe you called it the medical examiner nodded thats because we believed we had another poison and we had to find it not just the substance itself but how had gotten into the body strout the ideal witness was forward in his chair again addressing the jury directly during the first autopsy he explained we had of course examined stomach contents and so on but now we were looking to see if we missed anything the first time so we tried again but there wasnt much there although the scan found the initial trace of atropine we couldnt get any concentration approaching a lethal dose and your next step hardy glanced at the jury this was gruesome stuff no one was sleeping strout continued showing enthusiasm for his work now heres where the puzzle gets interesting if theres been a recent death you might find some needle marks bruises and so on but here we took samples from various locations hoping to find a concentration and we got lucky how was that strout got technical on some muscle names and so on but freeman brought him back making it clear that the injection had gone in twothirds up the front of the left thigh youre sure it was the front of the thigh it could not have seeped through so to speak from the back strout was certain theres no chance of that the muscles arent connected more medical detail but gradually the picture came out the lethal injection had been administered to the upper thigh to hardy it seemed like a long journey to get to something they already knew until freeman asked this location on the thigh could someone selfadminister an injection there unflappable and friendly strout said of course was there anything about your examination that indicated that the injection had not been selfadministered such as i dont know maybe a scratch where he might have tried to fight off the injection anything at all strout thought after all this time no nothing freeman went back to the exhibit table and lifted peoples exhibit the original autopsy report did you notice anything nine years ago doctor that would have argued against mr hollis giving himself the shot perusing the page strout handed it back no but of course there were tracks needle marks there were needle marks and where were these doctor on his inner arms consistent with where a drug user might inject himself yes did you notice any needle marks on his thighs again strout glanced down at peoples exhibit his early autopsy diagram no not that i noted here across the room hardy saw powell sitting his hands folded in front of him his head down he was getting killed and he knew it freeman with half a losing point the needle marks on the thigh wasnt even ready to concede that hed come back nearly to the edge of the witness box during the rapidfire questions and now he moved back to the center of the room but its possible is it not doctor that you might have missed even a recent needle mark nodding amiably the doctor relentlessly honest went him one better not only could i mr freeman it seems likely i did the injection went in his thigh its the only way the atropine could have concentrated itself there needle marks are notoriously difficult to locate and catalogue autopsies miss them strout spread his hands one last time it happens he said dropped off on the seventh floor by the bailiff then escorted by her two female guards jennifer witt undressed in the open room hanging her good clothes carefully on the wooden hangers watching as the guards made space for them in the changing locker she turned and faced the wall as she removed the feminine underthings that freeman had bought for her she slipped a runners bra over her head turned back around took the proferred plastic bag from milner a sweetfaced overweight redhead with a gappy smile and freckles and dropped the articles one at a time into the bag the other guard montanez sullenly held out the red jumpsuit from out in the pods through the building they heard the sound of bars clanging strident voices rising and fading it was near to dinnertime getting darker a little earlier a few weeks before the end of daylight savings time hows it going down there milner asked jennifer shrugged bunch of men talking a lot aint it though montanez started moving them together toward the door to the changing room the judge is a woman though her name is villars there are a few on the jury too but these considerations didnt much concern either milner or montanez the two guards flanked her in the dim and ringing hallway their belts and hardware creaking as they walked from behind them the lockup guard called out is that witt shes got a visitor dr ken lightner had been in the courtroom for at least some period of time during each of the four days of the trial so far not being a lawyer he had not been allowed into the tiny room next to the guards station but like frannie had to content himself with the more public arrangement hard wooden chairs and telephone lines on either side of the plexiglas he was already sitting there waiting his head was cradled wearily against the heel of his hand when jennifer sat down he stared at her for a long minute finally he reached for the telephone how are you holding up nobodys hitting me anymore maybe they think im going to win she allowed her face to crack into a brittle smile im starting to have a little faith in mr freeman lightner nodded what does he say he wont every commit to anything he says its a long haul but i hear him talking to mr hardy i see the response hes getting from the jury he seems confident and how about you i miss you ken i miss talking to you everything the people here there was nothing to say about them they lived on a different plane she stopped herself swallowed its so different i dont know the phone nearly fell from her hand what jen she swallowed again giving the impression of pulling back even through the plexiglas about going on what about going on jen youve got to go on shaking her head she became silent lightner leaned forward his face an inch from the glass jennifer listen to me youve got to go on you cant give up now youre winning now the worst may well be over no the worst isnt over mr freeman says the worst hasnt started yet hes a big help hes trying he is ken im at least sure of that its not even the trial you know not mostly its everything else being so different all these people here she gestured around her this whole place i think sometimes ill never get back to anything i recognize anything i want a tear broke from her eye and rolled down her cheek this time she didnt wipe it away it didnt matter if she looked weak if she broke down in front of ken thats what he was for and she was weak theyd proved that she didnt care about the old things anymore im so confused ken im so confused lightner watched her waiting for something he couldnt say exactly what jennifer seemed inside herself suffering and he wanted to get her past this but he didnt want to push you let people find their own way out if they could im still here he said finally she allowed that brittle smile again i sometimes think youre the only reason im alive a halfsob halflaugh its funny you know remember when i thought if we could just get away from larry everything would work everything would be better itd be a whole new world i remember it could still be there jen weve talked about this over and over working through the changes she shook herself almost began rocking her head moved back and forth a heavy weight held by a thread but thats just it thats the problem i dont believe it anymore i dont know if i believe it anymore the thing with matt the flow of words stopped her eyes suddenly dead without any energy it would be better if it were just all over with thatd be the end of it maybe it was a test jennifer searched through the glass for something in his eyes some answer she scratched at the counter in front of her reached her hand toward the plexiglas then withdrew it its not going to get better no matter what happens im just the kind of person that everything beats up on men things situations im a loser thats all lightner was sitting forward now his hand pushing against the glass youre not a loser jen youve been victimized weve talked about this its natural to feel the way you do with what youve been through but youre not a loser i wouldnt stick with you if you were a loser if i thought there wasnt some end to this some time when things are going to be better tell me when come on jen no one knows that exactly but i think youd stick with me anyway ken even though i am a loser and you know why ive figured this out because im a challenge to you some classic case study jesus jennifer how can you say that after all because its true isnt it you dont really care do you i mean about me who could ever love somebody as messed up as i am as soon as i do get turned around the minute it happens if it ever does the challenge or puzzle or whatever i am would be over youd be gone too wouldnt you and then where would i be ill tell you where where i am now which is nowhere nowhere nothing never coming back oh goddamn it all she threw the phone down pushing the chair backward knocking it over standing looking around tears falling freely now the guard was moving up hand on her stick lightner stood his own hand on the plexiglas watching jennifer said something to the guard slumping she didnt turn back to look they moved toward the door back to the cells and lightner sat again in the hard chair trying to control his own feelings suddenly she was back at the glass hands splayed against it crying for real now her body halffalling halfleaning her weight against the partition shaking her head her face set reaching for her stick as if she might really need it the guard was coming up behind jennifer who was forcing words out between the sobs even if he couldnt hear clearly he knew what she was saying it was what she always said when she hit her own bedrock when she felt it was all on her and she had to accept it im sorry she was crying over and over trying to reach him through the glass as though he were in another dimension im sorry i didnt mean it dont be mad at me and then the guards hand was on her shoulder pulling her backward turning her around and back to the door lightner stood there breathing deeply and thinking that jennifer might be right she might be hopeless an incurable loser and after all hed done for her it hit him like an electric shock forcing him back down into the chair the realization that she might never ever get herself straight he realized he was shaking trying to get it under control but what he wanted was to wake her up knock some sense into that confused lovely head of hers frannie could not believe that hardy had made all these arrangemenets calling erin rebeccas grandmother to see if she would mind taking the kids overnight sending a cab to pick everybody up and drop them where they should be making reservations at this luxurious bed amp breakfast hardy was modest im a virtual treasure trove of surprises what made you think of this what about the trial hardy sat on a red crushed velvet settee drinking an old tawny port from a cutcrystal wine glass i figured we owed ourselves about four date nights call it twelve hours minimum the trial can live without me a day this is primarily freemans phase anyway remember frannie stood at the window arms crossed her hair up taking in the view of the golden gate bridge from the back window of the california house an old victorian on upper divisadero street that had been refurbished and reincarnated as a bed amp breakfast they were in the gold rush suite complete with stocked bookshelves jacuzzi fireplace port and sherry with crystal service and of course the view which added eighty dollars to the room charge he had made the reservation from the hall of justice as soon as they had recessed for the day erin had told him it would be no problem to come by get the kids feed them their dinner hardy had the feeling that if erin simply showed up with a plan thered be less chance that frannie would demur a cab came to their house and picked her up at and now here they were hardy still wasnt sure frannie was altogether thrilled with the surprise her arms stayed crossed her face was set he didnt think it was anger in spite of the distance she hadnt been acting as though she were mad at him her jaw was tight her eyes alert and thoughtful inward looking as though she were bearing up under some physical pain she didnt want to burden him with his fear was that the pain was the result of some change that shed realized that she didnt want him and their life together anymore her eyes came to him from across some chasm a halfsmile hi he realized hed been holding his breath watching her literally afraid to breathe if he didnt breathe maybe the moment would stop and he wouldnt have to find out what the next one held he put his port on the end table and let out his breath in a rush so hows life frannie how do you think i think not good ive had a stomache ache for a month since you stopped smiling i thought maybe youd like to talk about it she turned back to the view her face in profile to him he saw the muscle working in her jaw he wanted to get up go to her but something perhaps the knowledge that if she pushed him away now didnt let him gather her in and hold her then they might not get it back not ever something rooted him to the chair the words came out mumbled and he told her he hadnt heard what shed said they took a minute to come again she turned to face him directly and met his eyes secrets he digested the word and as the most obvious interpretation hit him his stomach churned he felt his head go light as though he were going to faint what secrets it was the only thing he could think of to say she stood in the same posture facing him straight on arms crossed secrets are what you dont tell hardy leaned forward in his chair he lifted the glass of port next to him and took a drink then put it back down okay he said its not just that she said i dont even know what that is thats right you dont hardy brought his hand up to his forehead squeezed at his temples okay fran but ive go to know his palms found their way together praying is it another man can you tell me that he saw her shoulders settle her eyes close all her body language said that some crisis had just passed her arms uncrossed untangled came to her sides she moved toward him kneeled in front of him what are you talking about another man theres no other man there couldnt be another man she had her hands on his face her eyes into his searching outlining his features with her fingertips her arms then around his neck pulling him to her against her he felt himself shaking under her it was all the emotion he so much tried to keep in check to control that was why hed married her because he trusted her enough to let her see him like this see who he really was she was part of him the catalyst that let him be whole again she rocked him his head in her hands holding him feeling the waves of emotion coming out of him surfacing she held him as tightly as she could this was her man and he needed her if he could do this trust her with what hed call his weakest self she didnt have to worry she could lay herself out for him her own doubts her own failings inadequacies he wasnt going to leave her for them he wasnt going to leave i was afraid you wouldnt understand i probably dont but i try you expect life to be perfect all the time and i dont she shushed him a finger to his lips it was full dark now later the bridge lit out the window a candle by the bed i didnt want to let you down she said and i was just so damn sad and it wasnt you it was me it was my sadness it was eddie my socalled youth everything i guess it just caught up to me hardy lay there quiet i didnt want you to know i didnt want it to hurt you i think i know lifes not perfect frannie god knows i know that but you want ours to be our home life dont you sometimes you even think it can be dont you dont you think thats something to shoot for i dont know i thought i did and then this this whole thing feeling trapped all of it she shifted in the bed moving her head from the pillow to the crook of hardys shoulder her leg over his middle i didnt try to trap you into this frannie into being married i thought you were happy it wasnt you dismas i can see now that it wasnt you it was my life all of a sudden i dont know what it was it all just came back at me and then i felt so much like id failed i mean i wasnt happy and i should have been and whose fault is that i generally blame a consortium of arab investors so do i usually but this time it didnt work and i couldnt tell you it wouldnt be fair with your trial coming up and all and then i began to resent that that i couldnt tell you and then i convinced myself that you wouldnt care anyway that this was just all stupid female stuff that isnt very linear anyway and cant be whoa whoa whoa what is that stupid female stuff we didnt invite any stupid females to this party you know what i mean i dont know what you mean and linear he turned up on his elbow looking down at her i dont know what you mean he repeated really frannie closed her eyes for a breath i saw jennifer i know you did no she shook her head more than once i snuck out i left the kids with erin and went and saw her how many times i dont know three or four at the jail he answered himself of course at the jail hardy sat all the way up pulling the sheet around him frannie put a hand on his leg the first time i guess we connected then i didnt think youd approve or i didnt want to ask for your okay frannie but then i talked myself into being mad that i felt like i had to clear it with you every time that didnt seem right that i had to ask permission shes my client frannie he was shaking his head trying to fit this in somewhere i know i know i should have talked with you but it it all seemed to fit in with the other stuff being so depressed feeling like i was trapped jennifer well she listened to me jennifer listened to you jesus hardy threw the sheet off and swung his legs off the bed he walked to the window not to see the view but because it was the only destination in the room he stood stock still then without turning whispered you talked to jennifer about you and me whats she got on us now he heard her voice small behind him it wasnt like that dont be mad at me now please he stood another minute trying to piece it together the images out the window the lights on union street far below the golden gate the presidio evergreens blurring the western horizon they were piling up falling over each other kaleidoscope fashion turning back he sat again on the settee this was the secret frannie was at the edge of the bed she paused framing an answer all of it was a secret it was all connected hunched over hardy had his hands crossed in front of him his head down dismas she was off the bed now on the floor on her knees in front of him again he felt her hands on his legs im not mad he said lets get that straight im not mad at you and im glad were talking about this but did it occur to you that she might be using you she wasnt i just told you it wasnt like that at least i didnt think it was like that he jumped at the difference you didnt think it was like that then but you do now you think it might have been frannie got up grabbed the blanket and drew it around her then sat on the edge of the bed no i didnt say that she took a deep breath and reached out again the space between the bed and the settee i wish you wouldnt interrogate me i want to talk about this dismas but when we get into it like this i feel intimidated it doesnt work it doesnt get us anywhere where do you want us to get to frannie i want us to be able to talk again im trying to tell you how it was in the candlelight her face was an amber cameo he found he couldnt take his eyes off her he nodded her arm was across the space between them touching his leg reaching out he put his hand over hers this was not the time to argue to tell frannie that jennifer might have had an agenda far removed from the one shed led frannie to believe he came over next to her pulling the blanket around both of them youre right he said kissing her holding her against him im sorry talk to me she told you larry beat her everybody has beaten her she couldnt believe you never hit me or eddie never hit me she didnt believe me i could tell like the idea is completely outside her experience it probably is they were still huddled together at the edge of the bed lets not ever hit our kids okay hardy said we dont i know lets not start frannie leaned into him muffled night sounds came up through the closed window a trucks brakes squealing as it inched down the north divisadero escarpment a girls carefree laugh from outside one of the clubs on union i still feel a little like ive abandoned her jennifer i mean i just it got feeling wrong somehow well i havent abandoned her so i guess its still in the family right i know but shh look maybe just hearing your story some woman who doesnt get hit maybe thatll give her hope that its possible if she believes it and if she doesnt you seeing her more isnt going to make her is it he held his wife against him breathing in her scent the candle sputtered briefly hardy looked over and saw a thin rope of wax snake its way down the crystal holder pooling on the dressers surface im not trying to talk you out of anything you know if you want to see her some more just tell me okay let me know i wont she sighed theres some things its just too wrong you said that but if youre not going behind me no thats not whats wrong its her really jennifer first i thought we you know we were two women we could talk but then she cut it off she was about to tell me something important and then closed up said i didnt want to know i began to wonder if maybe if maybe shes guilty maybe i couldnt handle that except i dont believe she killed matt even accidentally or larry maybe her first husband i dont know and if she did i dont know whether i could handle it if i said but she told me why did i think she was fighting this thing so hard the answer is she didnt kill them although larry beat and abused her please dont crossexamine me dismas she told me larry beat her but she also said she didnt kill him or matt not by accident or mistake or any other way or for any other reason hardy looked at her wondering if she was trying to convince herself he certainly knew how that felt no one seemed to know where the storm came from but rain slashed almost horizontally in gusts around bryant street the temperature was in the low fifties and the gray paint on the hall of justice seemed a bruised and burnished blue as hardy ran raincoat flapping from his parking space to the courthouse steps it was when he entered the building he knew they would be at recess which was how he had planned it he wasnt going directly to villars department anyway freeman and jennifer were having lunch in an abandoned office back behind the courtrooms hardy nodded at the bailiff standing watch outside the door then waited getting his breathing under control from the run through the rain he watched them through the wirelined glass window in the door talking chatting really at opposite sides of a pocked old green metal desk he pushed open the door freeman his mouth full raised a hand greetings were killing em diz their feet are up i swear to god jennifer was pushing some threebean salad around her white styrofoam tray with a white plastic fork he was struck again by the figure she cut demure yet sophisticated innocent and unattainable it was as if she were freemans creation now claymolded by an artist hardy had unbuttoned his dripping trenchcoat and now pulled a chair around backward and dropped himself over it a gust delivered a fresh torrent of rain slapping at the window in front of them hard enough to make everybody stop and look more good news the droughts over again freeman shoveled some tubular pasta in a glutinous red sauce he mopped his mouth with an already spotted napkin hey diz listen up im kicking some serious tail in there im thinking about what im going to say in there he pointed back behind him to the courtroom thats where i live you hear me you want some advice no i dont care ill give it to you anyway you want to give good trial thats where youll live too more milk another swipe of napkin it doesnt get in there diz it doesnt count and thats the truth the truth is also were winning right now a long moment went by while everyone looked at one another more rain got flung against the window over downtown lightning arced into a rod on a hotel rooftop and seconds later the crash of thunder rolled through the room jennifer kittycorner to him put her manicured hand over his one part of him registered that it was cool and dry so he thought it was odd that it seemed to burn where she touched him jennifer never admitted to harlan poole that ned was beating her in fact she always denied it his opinion that she was being battered is totally speculative freeman said he can say he and jennifer were having an affair he can say he had atropine in his office period i filed an early yestereday after we crucified strout and poole is turning into a bigger disaster than strout the is a motion for a directed verdict of acquittal by which the judge is asked to rule that no reasonable jury could convict the defendant that as a matter of law there isnt sufficient evidence to prove guilt if the motion was granted the charge would be dismissed and could never be retried id bet villars grants it after the recess freemans eyes seemed to glow he put a hand on hardys other sleeve he maybe can chew gum and walk but i dont think powell can run a campaign and a trial at the same time this things gong south for him the bailiff knocked and entered judge villars was coming out of her chambers trial was going back into session hardy sat listening as powell tried to find some wedge to introduce harlan pooles testimony the dentist was a wreck it was hard to imagine that this portly balding bespectacled sweating man had ever been jennifers lover also the low profile that terrell had promised him had turned out to be impossible to maintain like it or not and he obviously hated it poole was a central figure in a capital murder trial from his eyes the role was playing havoc with his life dr poole powell was recovering from another sustained objection freeman had jumped up as he liked to do and villars criticized powell for again referring to the fact that ned had beaten jennifer which they hadnt been able to establish because it was hearsay in his frustration powell was walking in circles facing the bench then the jury back to the defense table then his own table all the way back around to poole dr poole he said you have testified that you were intimate with the defendant poole studied the ceiling avoiding his wife in the gallery he wiped a handkerchief across his eyebrows yes during you intimate moments did you have occasion to see the defendant naked your honor objection but powell had given this some thought your honor at your insistence we have to take this testimony out of the realm of hearsay this is not a direction i would have chosen to go but it is relevant and it is not hearsay villars had her mask on eyes straight ahead unmoving she could have been a mannequin lets have counsel up here hardy rose along with freeman no one seemed to object or even notice they were before villars looking up villars spoke quietly im not sure im going along with the relevance mr powell what does mrs witts nakedness have to do with the alleged killing of her husband freeman still feeling he was on a roll incautiously spoke right up it doesnt a mistake villars glared when i want your answer or argument mr freeman ill address you is that clear without waiting for his response she went back to the prosecutor mr powell your honor it speaks to motivation we know that her husband was beating her and that wait a minute up to now all ive heard about is the insurance and an affair hardy suddenly noticed that the court reporter wasnt there he surprised himself by speaking up excuse me your honor is this conference to go on the record the court reporter was supposed to take everything nothing in a capital case was off the record the judge seemed to realize for the first time that hardy was even there the look of surprise gave way to her usual intimidating glare but hardy didnt back down perhaps we could go to chambers we just got out here extremely displeased she frowned down at the three men who were waiting on her whats your point mr hardy we dont have to go to chambers your honor powell was mr conciliatory im sure we can settle this right here villars straightened her back drew in a quick breath im getting pretty damn tired of asking one person a question and getting an answer from another one i ask mr powell a question mr freeman answers me i ask mr hardy a question mr powell answers me now everybody listen up im asking mr hardy you want this conference in chambers yes maam she leveled a finger at him yes your honor she corrected him not yes maam yes your honor im sorry villars was moving papers around in front of her on the bench she lowered her head shaking it back and forth this really pisses me off she whispered to no one she stood up the court reporter will accompany us to chambers were taking a short recess dr poole you can stand down til we get back it shouldnt take too long or you can stay where you are she led the parade out her chambers were not much more impressive than the cubicles used by the assistant das the room itself was bigger and had its private bathroom and a sitting area away from the oak flattopped desk but even with two nice throw rugs and some framed prints the place had that publicbuilding feel hardy was now facing the wrath of villars all right mr hardy were on the record in chambers what are we in chambers for if you dont mind mr powell was discussing the relevance of i know what he was doing hardy stepped back okay then your honor if hed like to continue his argument it might come up in the penalty phase if there is one villars reminded him of an angry bird head tilted to one side ready to peck his eyes out she shifted her gaze to the prosector who was sitting in one of the leather chairs all right mr powell lets hear why mrs witts nakedness is relevant your honor dr pooles testimony will give direct evidence that ned hollis used to beat jennifer regularly which of course would have given her another reason to have killed him surely thats relevant but also a point in mitigation hardy thought youre saying this is a burningbed case it may have those elements its a question of fact and we ought to let the jury decide villars shook her head you realize you are introducing bws here referring to the batteredwoman syndrome do you have any evidence that whatshisname the second husband larry that larry was beating her too is that your argument excuse me your honor freeman wanted to get onto the boards were not claiming bws she is not saying she had a reason were not saying she killed them because they beat her and they deserved it were saying she did not kill them at all villars pushed herself up until she was sitting on the edge of her desk hardy glanced at his partner freeman was leaning against one of the bookshelves seemingly at ease arguing the position that jennifer had not killed anybody for any reason villars her arms straight down on either side palms flat on the desk stared through the one window at the driving rain outside so i assume mr powell that were going to hear that mrs witt had bruises black and blue marks and so on all over her body thats right your honor and the fact that dr poole personally saw them takes this out of the realm of hearsay powell seeing where she was going with this began to squirm the leather chair squeaked as he shifted still he persisted the bruises themselves your honor are admissible dr poole saw them himself and you would then ask the jury to somehow connect these marks on mrs witts body to her husband your honor the truth is that her first husband ned beat her the implication can be drawn freeman stepped away from the bookcase thats not true dean he turned to the judge pardon me your honor but my client has consistently denied that she has been a battered wife or that this will be any part of her defense the jury cannot draw any implication at all from bruises that may have been caused by anything oh get serious david powell was halfway out of his chair you know as well as i do that gentlemen let me remind you that we are on the record here and that any remarks are to be made to the court she wasnt waiting for a response but moved off the edge of the desk facing both men mr powell from what ive seen here so far youve got an evidence problem of substantial proportions are you planning to call somebody whos going to give us any testimony about the day mr hollis died where mrs witt was on that day anyone who saw her take the alleged atropine out of dr pooles alleged drawer or the alleged syringe or who saw her dump it afterward powell was standing hands in his pockets trying to affect a casual posture hardy wasnt convinced and doubted anyone else was your honor with the insurance the pattern here villars held up her hand i asked you a simple yes or no question are you calling anybody to address any of the issues i just raised your honor i yes or no damn it she looked over to the court reporter adrienne strike that profanity then back to powell yes or no mr powell a faraway rumble of thunder rolled through the room not to those specific issues no your honor are there any specific issues youd like to preview for us that you can think of that would fall more or less into the category of evidence and not hearsay take your time powell sat back down leaning forward his forearms on his thighs lieutenant batiste who was the investigating officer for ned hollis death is scheduled to testify is this the same lieutenant batiste who did not see fit to arrest mrs witt for murder nine years ago presumably because there wasnt sufficient evidence to bring charges powell was combing his hair straight back with his hands we have several other witnesses your honor im sure you do but are any of them going to say anything that might be remotely admissible you know the law as well as i do you tell me in the middle of his worst nightmare powell came up for the third time your honor after much deliberation and at some expense the district attorneys office decided to exhume ned hollis and run scans for poisons we found the atropine which is not a recreational drug in a lethal dose your honor freeman broke in their own witness says hollis experimented with drugs he wanted to see if atropine could get him high thats all villars ignored freemans interruption her eyes on the prosecutor as you know mr powell the point is not whether you think it which i believe you do but whether you can prove it beyond a reasonable doubt that ned hollis was murdered now what i see is an insurance policy that was used for its original purpose to pay off the house i see a recreationaldrug user experimenting with a dangerous drug and here you are waffling on your motive if mrs witt didnt kill her husband for the money then she killed him because he was allegedly beating her do you have any reports from doctors documenting these beatings did she ever report them to the police there was finally nothing powell could say nodding villars crossed her arms and walked around behind her desk and stood there a moment everyone waited the rain beat against the window and the clicking of the court reporters keys stopped villars leaned over her chair and picked up then dropped four or five stapled pages of legal brief she shook her head taking in the assemblage im going to be taking a moment to consider this situation id like you all to return here to chambers in fifteen minutes back in her chambers villars told freeman and hardy that she was prepared to declare a mistrial on ned hollis if they wanted it of course in that case jennifer could and would be retried for the witt murders only obviously the jury had been prejudiced they had heard that the da at least thought that jennifer had killed her first husband also obviously the jury must have a poor impression of powell who was bringing charges that no reasonable juror could believe freeman and hardy wrestled about who got hurt more the prosecution or the defense in the end though it was jennifer who made the decision she did not want to sit in jail while they set a new trial date and started all over again they put it all on the record with villars your honor freeman said i believe the grounds for a mistrial wee caused by prosecutorial misconduct that has violated my clients dueprocess rights i believe the case must be dismissed in its entirety and that all further prosecution is barred because mrs witt has been placed once in jeopardy villars hated this nice try mr freeman are you asking for a mistrial or not if you ask for it the defendant can be retried if you dont request it i am not granting it on my own motion freeman not really expecting to have it both ways was satisfied nonetheless but he kept a straight face in that case your honor although i believe the trial has been fatally tainted we elect to proceed i have explained the situation to mrs witt and she elects to go forward isnt that true jennifer jennifer looked up yes they all trooped back into the courtroom where villars announced to the jury that she had decided to grant defense counsels motion regarding the murder of ned hollis there wasnt enough evidence as a matter of law to convict jennifer witt of killing her first husband they would be moving on to the next phase of the trial on monday but until then villars added why didnt the jury go home early and get a weekend of rest hardy shucked himself out of his wet raincoat tossed it to the other end of the seat and at the edge of the banquette at lous freeman slid in opposite him it was not yet four oclock a dark early afternoon at the bar lou was playing a quiet game of liars dice with one of the regulars his wife watched a soap opera on the television up in the corner they were the only other people in the place coffee arrived and hardy curled his fingers around the mug to warm them freeman took his time adding two spoonfuls of sugar pouring some cream he stirred sipped added more cream stirred again diz ive got something to tell you and youre not going to like it john lescroart hardy th juror the hardy was trying to keep his hands from shaking how long have you known this freeman studied his own nails longer than youd like to know diz hardy nodded what could he do freeman had just told him that jennifer had in fact killed her first husband ned shed shot him up with atropine just as the prosecution had contended and freeman had known all along you know you are a true son of a bitch he said the older man nodded i can understand why youd think so but i didnt really think fuck that david you didnt really think give me a break diz no no diz anything she told you freeman nodded and you could go on with this this incredible charade of course the blood was pumping of course even i really love that not just sure diz but of course shes a client of course shes guilty were supposed to get her off and i might add we just did we just did jesus give us a medal would you it bothers you does it hardy lifted his tired eyes bothers me i think thats fair david more than fair even just if the word has any meaning for you he took a long pull at his beer but as a matter of interest since im punting out of this case did she kill larry too and matt even what else have you known all along no no what no i dont think she killed larry or matt you dont think so diz i said no no david you said you didnt think so which i need hardly tell you is fairly open to interpretation as if you didnt know freeman was picking at the frayed wrist seams on his shirt you cant punt out what do you mean quit now hardy gave him a long look i know youre not much into popular culture david but yes punt means quit im out of here im off the case okay dropping it you think i could stick around and be part of this i get a woman off when she murdered her husband she admits it is that supposed to make me feel good why do you tell me now you think the irony appeals to me is that it no i dont think that hardy waited his breathing labored freeman picked some more at his shirt ends it was so complicated diz and he seemed uncharacteristically at a loss for words and i valued you i didnt want to lose you and i know i would have flattery bullshit hardys nose was getting refined he sucked the rest of his beer well david the hell with you and the hell with her rising he slammed the bottle down on the table and headed for the door freeman forgetting his own drink was up after him out into the rain i want you to just listen to her i want you to hear it for yourself freeman had followed hardy out to his car had gotten himself into the passenger seat and now they sat the rain pelting on the roof the windows steamed in the public lot across from the hall hardy shook his head in disbelief whats she going to say what can she possibly say i had not choice he would have killed me would have hunted me down and killed me how long do you have to take that before you can do something thats what they all say right thats what youre thinking well if thats what they all say maybe theres something to it the first year or so we both had jobs we bought a house we were going to be like our folks he wasnt doing much coke yet if he hit me one time in a fight hed be all sweet afterward and wed make up i went home to my mom after the first bad time you know what she told me she told me she hoped he stopped but shed better not tell dad because hed get all upset and what could he really do anyway except maybe go on over to neds and get himself in trouble either him or ned and either way it would be trouble so id be better off in the long run if i could just work it out with ned and not involve my dad thats what wives did mom said they worked it out and tried not to complain and maybe if i was just a little nicer maybe ned wouldnt get so mad if i wouldnt get so bitchy you know so i did try but the thing was i couldnt get any control over ned when he was drinking and doing coke and all that other he was just plain mean and even worse after he lost the job with bill graham he was like one of the chief roadies for a couple of years and then they let him go guess why and he had to go back to little clubs and just got meaner all the time and of course in those music scenes there was all that coke anyway i had this girlfriend tara down in la and i kind of ran away to stay with her i made the mistake of calling ned and telling him i was gone i wasnt coming back but he shouldnt worry about me isnt that great i didnt want him to worry about me i just wanted it to be over but he didnt want it over it was a mistake to have called i never dreamed hed come after me stupid i know now he came down and was so weirdly calm he wasnt stoned or drunk i think thats what scared me the most we let him in i never thought hed well he just walked up to tara and didnt say a word and punched her in the stomach as hard as he could ned was a big man you know six feet two hundred pounds then he stood over her and said hed kill her if she ever hid me again or helped me or called the police and me too hed kill me too if i called the police i believed he would too i had no doubt at all he grabbed me by the hair and the arm and we got to the car and drove back all night and he wouldnt let me go to the bathroom then we got home he hit me because the car was dirty and he made me wash it it sounds strange but during all this time we were trying to live normal lives i mean i was working with harlan i was his receptionist thinking someday to be a hygienist oh you didnt know that yes thats how that started i didnt plan it to be unfaithful that wasnt who i thought i was but everything with ned was falling apart and harlan was very nice to me gentle so it was easy to keep the relationship hidden it wasnt like i had to sneak out at night i mean wed just close the doors at lunch and then after we were together he saw the he saw what ned had done and said i should report it call the cops do something i kept telling him ned hadnt done it they were accidents thats all well you saw harlan he thinks you do everything youre supposed to do and things somehow will work out so finally i think im in love with him harlan i know hes fat now but in those days he was just big ive always had this weakness for big men now i decide to wait until ned isnt drunk or stoned and try to talk to him tell him im unhappy and cant take him beating me anymore and im going to leave i dont mention harlan of course thank god i tell him theres no other man nobody else its not that its just between him and me that were not working out i kept thinking that if i dont run away if im reasonable his reaction is going to be different which it was he sits there in his chair for about an hour and then real calm again which should have been a warning he says hes going to go out for a while and think about things by midnight hes not home and i finally fall asleep i wake up screaming but theres a sock or something in my mouth and i cant breathe or make any noise and theres this awful awful pain down down in me and neds on top of me holding me down the next day i cant move my insides feel broken ripped up i still cant breathe theres blood on the sheets and my hands are tied to the bed i see that my closet is open and half the clothes are pulled out cut into shreds thrown around the room on the floor i see the knife its a butter knife hes used the dull end poking it in me i wake up again and hes there untying me hes straight again helps me get in the bath im scared every second now hes being calm and says he can make things disappear without a trace ill find out its true he says so i take a sick day i couldnt have gone in anyway and then its the weekend and one of the nights ned has scored some coke and he wants me to get high with him well have fun he says itll be like old times what old times i never used drugs well i cant do it im so scared im still hurting bad ned starts to get upset with me again ive got to stop that i cant take it any more not right them so i try to be nice do what he wants and he wants to have sex can you believe this im pleading with him saying i hurt real bad but he says so what im his wife get on your back and i do and im not sure at the moment im going to die but i dont that was the worst not dying you know how many times i wished i had just died then how many other times i mean truly die not wake up just be gone from all this and believe me once you feel that like you really want to die its not too far to want someone else to be dead why does it have to be me i wake up sometime early and ned is lying next to me not moving for a long time i watch him thinking hoping he might be dead i pinch him in the leg and theres no reaction then he snores or snorts or something but the idea stays the germ of it a couple of days go by and im starting to heal and things look different the way they do no one really wants to believe theres no hope do they even though really there isnt im back at work im putting harlan off with some excuse and suddenly i realize i havent seen boots boots was my cat i havent seen her in days sitting at the front desk at harlans then all of a sudden i just know the only way out what i have to do dont kid yourself there wasnt any escape ned can make things disappear without a trace he was proving it i was next i arrange it so he thinks were going to get high im sorry ive been so difficult ill be a fun person the way i used to be this time its easy i give him the shot take a long hot shower drive out to the beach and bury the stuff go to my parents house for breakfast just visiting which i still did back then when i get back home i call the police tell them my husbands had an accident john lescroart hardy th juror the the tiny airless interview room smelled of sweat and wet wool freeman sat legs crossed in the chair that he had pushed back against the wall in the corner away from the door hardys mouth was dry his back stiff he had not moved a muscle in fifteen minutes he found that he believed every word that she had said and was struggling to keep his perspective you could probably have pled that as a murder two he said which would take it out of capital freeman said we got a dismissal that takes it out of capital too i dont care what the law says jennifer brushed her hair away from her face i knew him there was no other way you should have tried calling the police they could have done something hardy arguing against himself now realized how lame it sounded jennifer allowed a onenote laugh no they couldnt dont you understand this had been going on for two years and they couldnt have done a damn thing even if they wanted to even if they believed me why wouldnt they believe you because thats not how it really works you should know better you think the laws here to protect potential victims wrong what the law does is punish people whove already broken the law until somebodys already hurt or killed theyve got no business but you were hurt and ned did break the law he would have been punished jesus in your dreams jennifer looked to freeman is this guy for real does he live in the real world i live in the real world jennifer and you cant oh well listen heres the real world if im lucky ned gets no bail impossible right there and then gets a year if that for a first offense meanwhile ive got maybe a year to move change my name and my life then guess what ned gets out of jail and comes and gets me wherever i am and i disappear just like boots my cat do i have to explain this do i have to draw you a picture im the one whose life is ruined if i stay alive hardy leaned back in the chair and tried to stretch the crick from his neck in the guards room through the glass a woman had just come in for the night shift and was shaking out her raincoat hanging it on a peg by the door saying something to somebody outside of hardys vision i dont know from my perspective id say matts life is pretty ruined even if larry was beating you ive told you larry wasnt beating me she said glaring at him hardy slammed the table with the flat of his palm oh cut the shit jennifer he was standing now the chair tipped crashed to the floor behind him i know for certain that larry was beating you i know the doctors you went to see and i know the lies you told them he picked up his briefcase and grabbed for the chair to set it upright freeman still hadnt said a word i did not kill my son good for you i didnt kill larry either or if you did im sure you had a good reason i didnt goddamn it i didnt kill them i have no idea who did suddenly she was in his face coming at him arms flailing he tried to back away but in the constrained place there was nowhere to go the back of his knees hit the chair behind him and he lost his balance falling over somehow freeman had gotten between them and maneuvered jennifer back down into her seat giving the high sign that everything was all right to the guards through the window hardy was pulling himself up and freeman who was aware that he stood blocking the exit said that in his experience every trial worth its salt produced at least one good display of honest emotion i think we can all get through this he said its to all our advantage john lescroart hardy th juror the it had been a tense five minutes but they were all seated again clustered around the table hardy had agreed to talk to listen now he stared at his partner you dont care what in fact happened david youve made that point a hundred times no thats not strictly true what i said was that legally it doesnt matter what the facts are if they cant be proven personally though i care i care a great deal its why im a lawyer which is telling you more than you deserve to know i could ruin my reputation hardy turned to jennifer heres a quickquiz question did larry beat you or not yes finally a lot she nodded but if i admitted that especially with what happened with ned no jury would believe i didnt kill larry too this was the issue jennifer had killed ned because he beat her larry too had beaten her and she was contending insisting that she had not killed him i had to lie she said once it came out that they both hit me whats to make me think youre not lying now im not lying now im telling you all youre doing is telling me another version whatever flies this week diz freeman put a hand on his sleeve please look at it strategically shes free on ned were halfway there she certainly didnt kill her own boy accident or not she wasnt any part of that i think you and i both believe that i dont know what i believe anymore david jennifer put her hand on his other arm i did what i did with ned almost ten years ago she was talking quietly almost whispering not trying to look at him to persuade with her eyes which he took as a good sign if i had a choice as you say i did well then at least you should believe that i didnt think i had a choice i was scared for my own life and i didnt know what to do i thought there was no other way out with larry it hadnt gotten to that yet maybe it would have i dont know i wanted to think not its why i started seeing ken lightner trying to make the family work im screwed up i admit i bring things on myself even ken tells me im too much a victim i was trying to change and then somebody somebody kills larry and my son and out of the blue im arrested for it and suddenly im supposed to trust my whole life to two men who i didnt even know six months ago no way men havent been so good to me you might have noticed so i made my own plan and stuck with it hardy crossed his arms i did notice one other thing though you managed to tell david here the truth freeman cut in i sandbagged her diz thats how i work it came out and you didnt tell me that was my decision not hers okay it was a mistake on my part bad judgment i should have included you but i didnt think youd need to know until the penalty phase if then need to know huh it had become dark outside through the guardroom window friday night the weekend lay ahead with time to decide what he was going to do hardy let out a long breath he turned to jennifer if you have any other secrets jennifer now would be a good time to talk about them but the veil had come down again her passion spent just find out who killed my baby would you can you do that he didnt know what he was doing driving in the morning rain out california to miz carters then changing his mind turning down through golden gate park avoiding the tree limbs that littered kennedy drive knocked down by the force of the storm he didnt really know where he was going maybe his brain had shut down from lack of sleep it all had come down to whether he believed her this time even though he knew she had lied to him about damn near everything from the beginning could he still believe her he thought he did that was what had kept him awake tossing next to frannie until the clouds gray became visible out their bedroom window he had told frannie that jennifers story was flawed but the truth was that he found it credible hed been around and around on it and every time it came up more logically sound jennifer had to kill ned from her perspective it was pure selfdefense she truly believed he was going to kill her and why wouldnt she shed tried to run away and hed tracked her down then shed told him she was going to leave and hed beaten her almost to death violated her with the blunt end of a kitchen knife killed her cat as an obvious classic threat and threatened her with her own death if she did anything to stop the rampage he had read everything lightner had given him plus twenty or thirty other articles and briefs on the subject battered women did not feel like they could get away they were forever trapped in a situation from which they could literally neither run nor hide and which would someday in all probability kill them hardy believed freeman could prove that jennifer taking neds life had been justifiable a sometimes valid form of selfdefense that the courts had begun to recognize even with judge villars even with the legislature failing to pass a law codifying bws as a defense hardy was fairly confident they could get jennifer off certainly as he had pointed out no jury in the state of california would call for the death penalty jennifer was not stupid she knew that if she agreed to assert the batteredwoman syndrome then her life at least would be removed from the equation it would no longer be a capital case so the recurring question was why wouldnt she plead to it her reason was that it implied a defense against guilt and she said she had no reason for a defense against something she hadnt done and she could not very well plead to one murder and not the other no one would believe her powell would laugh at it a jury would be insulted no judge would be sympathetic yet hardy found himself believing it jennifer witt did not kill her son she had not been there when he had been killed she had known nothing about it matt rang true and if he bought that which was not at all the same as believing a jury would buy it then working backward all the other apparent duplicity made a perverse kind of sense she could not admit to any similarities especially in so far as battery between her lives with ned and with larry especially once theyd gotten as far as trial there was no evidence that she had been beaten and if they admitted at trial that she had been in the jurys mind that would only make it more likely that she had killed both of her husbands so her position had to be that no one had ever abused her it was the only story that worked and of course truthful or not david freeman the lawyer gobbled it up and made it his own there was a pause in the downpour hardy was wearing tennis shoes jeans and a green waterproof jacket he got out of the car and from where he stood near the top of olympia up the block from jennifers house he could see a band of blue widening at the horizon even this early in the morning and it was before seven the air was strangely humid and heavy laden with the smell of eucalyptus he didnt know why he had driven out here or what if anything he expected to find or accomplish lightheaded he walked from his car up past the witt house to the edge of the grove surrounding twin peaks leading up to sutro tower the source of the eucalyptus scent a mother deer and her two fawns were rooting through the foliage there fifty or sixty feet back into the trees the deer bolted startled disappearing into the woods in the deep shade hardy blinked his stinging eyes trying to clear his vision stunned to see jennifer witt in a bright blue jogging outfit break from the cover of the trees and run toward him on the trail then past him no close up it wasnt of course her out to the street where whoever it was turned down olympia as he stood there drizzle began to fall again and he ran following her footsteps around the corner and down the long block to his car the woman jogging faster than hardy could sprint had turned downhill on clarendon the car spun on the wet pavement then straightened hardy took the corner at olympia and hydroplaned again his wheels this time bouncing off the concrete cornerdivider before he got the car under control again he was alongside the woman slowing down and honking his horn motioning for her to pull over she flipped him off stole a glance at her watch and kept going hardy slowed rolled down his passenger window and gunned it up to her again honking i need help he called out to her driving ahead another hundred yards he pulled to the curb throwing open his door and getting out he held his hands wide spread out at shoulder height offering no threat the woman slowed abruptly stopping fifty feet up the street the rain started coming in sheets what she gasped cant you see im trying to run hardy tooka step toward her and she put her hand to her hip ive got mace here on my belt and ill use it i need to ask you a question a car passed going the other direction slowed to look then sped up the street a question she shook her head in disbelief who the hell are you leave me alone hardy wished he could try the old badge trick but he didnt carry it as a matter of course it was at home there if he decided he might need to use it im going by the woman said youd better leave me some room she was in fact holding what looked like a spray can in her hand and hardy had no doubt shed use it he had to talk fast find some lever she was coming toward him cautiously you ever hear of jennifer witt im her lawyer good for you im a runner she turned it on going by the other side of his car there wasnt so much as a glance back as she flew down the street around a curve and out of his sight back in his car hardy consoled himself that it was probably nothing anyway but then three blocks later he realized the truth of what hed just done he thought he might have stumbled on a nugget of truth in one of jennifers explanations so he hadnt given up on her jennifer had said she always started out walking for a couple of blocks when she left her house to go jogging she had insisted that was her routine and she followed it on the morning of december and somebody else with a resemblance to her came running by her house just as some shots were fired that person stopped saw nothing and continued running right from jennifers gate and was identified as jennifer by the states star eyewitness anthony alvarez it almost gave him real hope glitsky called after dinner and told them they should turn on the news because david freeman was on moses and his new wife susan were over and everyone was at the front of the house while hardy turned on the set moses plopped himself on the sofa that guy gets more air than a hotair balloon he said turning around hardy said that david freeman was a hotair balloon when it suited him the man himself appeared on the screen unshaven hangdog his tie askew over his wrinkled shirt with sleeves partially rolled up here was a man whod been working all night and all day on behalf of his client he was sitting on the edge of the desk in his office his lawbooks visible behind him and the sound came up victory but to be quite candid i expected it i have fought from the original arraignment to have this case dismissed for lack of evidence and of course the judges ruling here corroborates what ive maintained all along jennifer witt is innocent she did not do these things hardy and frannie now sharing their own secret about ned exchanged a glance he is some piece of work hardy whispered the young female reporter spoke earnestly into the camera and obviously buoyed by yesterdays victory mr freeman had some even stonger charges to make this was edited tape and again the sound bite picked up in midsentence freeman was answering another question theres the political motive i hate to bring this up but its true dean powell is running for attorney general on a prodeathpenalty ticket at the same time you cant have a death penalty just for black men he needs a case like this and he needs it right now if jennifer witt hadnt come along he would have had to invent her freeman hung his head genuinely saddened by the flawed nature of humankind unfortunately he said thats essentially what he did suddenly they were back in the newsroom and the anchorwoman was saying to his partner those are some pretty strong accusations shel and well be following that trial every day here on channel thats right jack shel beamed at the camera filling the screen want to know what happens when three sisters fight over the family dog slick segue shel frannie intoned moses leaning forward on the couch shushed his sister speaking to the tv yeah three sisters and the family dog i want to know what happens i do shel was continuing sounds like a case for solomon doesnt it and its developing right now down in daly city thats up next dont go away hardy was up also talking to the tube turning it off sorry shel got to go moses jumped up come on diz im dying to know about the sisters and their dog susan hit him on the leg pervert how can you do that turn of shel hardy was moving back to his chair years of training and therapy have helped me here why do i get the feeling that jennifers trial is going to be getting nasty its that amazing sixth sense you have frannie rubbed a hand over his arm it must have been an awful slow news day susan was smiling and relaxed leaning against moses on the couch hes your partner dismas cute isnt he moses cut adrift moaned that he wanted to know more about the girls and their dog they ate it frannie said susan nodded cut it up into little pieces fried the ears and served them with roquefort dressing hardy stood up id like to go on the record here by saying how nice it is to be among people who are so in tune with the big issues im going to get dessert because of the afternoon nap hed taken he wasnt tired moses and susan went home at a little after ten and frannie who would have vincents first feeding at one said she thought she would turn in hardy added a log to the fire in the front room and sat in his chair with a copy of john mcphees oranges hed barely begun when the telephone rang he grabbed it halfway through the first ring it was glitsky saying his man freeman was a star trial by television its what makes this country great that and concentrated orange juice hardy explained the mcphee connection knowing that glitsky like himself had a weakness for the obscure fact but i sense you didnt call to talk about citrus normally i would abe said except i thought youd want to be the first to know about something else hardy silently counted to five a log popped in the fire i love this game he said i called the detail on an unrelated matter about ten minutes ago they were interviewing a guy down there named marko something ring a bell no should it i dont know i thought you might have run across it in your travels hes saying he killed larry witt marko mellon had not begun watching the news report on jennifer witt during the freeman section as hardy and company had he had watched from the start when they showed her picture the one the stations and newspapers had used before she had been charged with the murders smiling vivacious marko a twentyfiveyearold syrian exchange student at san francisco state who had been following the trial in a fairly dedicated fashion up to this point was familiar with hardy thought a surprising amount of facts about the case so much so that it took police inspectors one of whom was walter terrell nearly five hours to determine he could not possibly have killed larry witt his motive for killing larry he said was that he loved jennifer as it turned out his motive for the confession was that he had decided he loved jennifer from her picture it was a spiritual connection he was sure they had and if he confessed she would of course want to meet him after which they would fall in love get married have more babies to make up for matt it was a nolose plan because eventually they would find out he marko hadnt really done it and then hed be free and they could live happily ever after together i dont think he thought the whole thing through hardy was talking to freeman the storm had passed and there were pink clouds in an early morning gray sky over the oakland hills across the bay they were by the door to hardys car standing in a deserted bryant street outside the hall of justice after the decision had been reached that they werent going to be charging marko with larry witts murder it staggers me that it took them five hours to come to it freeman said the boys got the iq of a turnip of course then again some of the inspectors he did know a lot of details david they had to let him cross himself up rats in mazes know details that doesnt make them smart they should have just asked him when his visa runs out why would they ask them that you check dollars to donuts his visa runs out in the next month or so he figured hed get arrested get to stay longer over here in jail on a murder charge freeman shrugged you ever been to syria diz hardy let it go freeman might be right i saw you tonight on the tube by the way i dont think deans going to be too pleased freeman waved it off its good press im doing him a favor there was a silence between them a residual tension that banter wasnt going to camouflage hardy pulled open the door to his car and in the predawn light asked if he could drop freeman at his apartment hed taken a cab down the old attorney said no hed walk this time of day through this neighborhood come on david get in freeman slammed his hand on the roof of the car take off diz ill see you tomorrow david freeman spread his hands theatrically weve been working together long enough you ought to know by now im bulletproof at sunrise hardy was still in his car waiting on olympia way as though he were at a stakeout if the jogger came by again he was going to get a few words with her if he had to sprint alongside her for six blocks breathing mace she did not appear freeman was wrong powell did not take it as a favor they were in judge villars chambers again it was on monday morning and the jury was in the courtroom waiting adrienne the court reporter was perched with her portable equipment next to one of the easy chairs but she was the only one sitting her presence was necessary as no meeting was ever off the record freeman hardy powell his young assistant justin morehouse and villars were taking up most of the rest of the space in the room or maybe it just felt that way everyone stood in a knot too close an invisible bubble surrounding them the pressure building within it ive never been more serious your honor freeman looked especially wan in a tenyearold brown suit ive given this a lot of thought over the weekend since your generous granting of my there was nothing generous about that dont put a personal spin on this the fact remains im convinced this would not be a capital trial if dean here werent running for ag your honor powell wore his substantial selfcontrol on his sleeve but it was wearing thin mr freeman knows full well that weve still got two sets of specials on both remaining counts this is a deathpenalty case its politically tainted and you know it dean theres nothing political about it freeman turned to villars let him prove that your honor if he can continue this trial until after the election see how hot our dedicated prosecutor is to fry jennifer witt then your honor i resent defense counsels implication im not implying anything your honor weve got grounds to appeal right now and i think were skating mighty close to another due process violation i might have to ask for a mistrial after all freeman though he said the magic word did not win a hundred dollars instead villars raised herself up and pointed a finger at him on friday you said you didnt want a mistrial mr freeman i am not going to let you take opposite sides of the same issue powell his temper beginning to show cracked his knuckles and ran his fingers through his hair if he wanted to calendar the case after the election he could have requested it anytime now we have a jury impaneled we have witnesses whove rearranged their schedules to be here to continue the trial at this point villars moved a step toward them both the color high on her normally gray cheeks she spoke quietly but her voice had the crack of authority all right now both of you listen up unless mr freeman requests it right now were not having a mistrial were not having a continuance im going to give some instructions to the jury this morning and then were going to proceed in an orderly fashion until we get to a verdict she reached to button her robe then stopped and one more thing i dont want to see this case on television or read about it in the newspapers over the next few weeks consider this a gag order my clerk will have a written order by the recess i trust were clear on this ladies and gentlemen the judge was still angry furious at powell for what she considered the sloppiness of the first half of the case and at freeman for at least a half dozen reasons blurring the mistrial issue threatening to appeal attacking powell personally going public with his accusations dressing like a bag man in her courtroom hardy wondered if her anger was as obvious to the jury and to the standingroom crowd in the gallery who had no doubt showed up in response to freemans appearance on television followed by the frontpage story in yesterdays chronicle jennifer witt had become big news again though villars had more reasons to want to flay freeman she appeared to be equally hostile to both sides and this freeman felt would ultimately help him of course freeman was of the opinion hardy reflected that a mass murder in the courtroom would ultimately help the defense his credo was that any disturbance in the steady accretion of incriminating evidence helped the defense it was why he acted so disruptively but in spite of the huge crowd villars might as well have been alone with the twelve jurors in a small room she did not so much as glance in the direction of the gallery of the attorneys tables in a conversational almost intimate tone she was giving instructions intended to keep her trial from becoming a reversal the nightmare of every judge and doubtless the root of her most immediate anger i wont try to deny that this trial has taken an irregular turn it is highly unusual to dismiss one charge in the middle of the peoples case and i wont insult you by pretending it is not some of you may feel a little strange that we are going on at all and i want to address that issue now mrs witt had been charged with three separate counts of murder on friday you will recall i ruled that there was to sufficient evidence that jennifer witt killed her first husband ned hollis however i want you to understand that this should not in any way prejudice your feelings about the peoples case on the remaining two charges on the one hand or mrs witts defense on the other she took a sip of water and cast another withering gaze at counsel on both sides of the courtroom that said let us now put ned hollis behind us he has no integral connection to the remaining charges filed against mrs witt if any of you feel that you cannot in good conscience accept this instruction please raise your hand now and i will excuse you form the jury no hands went up hardy would have preferred to see one or two because he knew in fact that this was an instruction that would be difficult if not impossible to internalize now all twelve jurors were sitting with the personal knowledge that jennifers first husband had died and afterward she had collected a lot of money no hands meant that it was not going to be acknowledged in deliberation over the verdict but it was going to be there a snake in the weeds villars nodded now the remaining two counts still include multiple murder and murder for profit and those are among the special circumstances defined in california for which the state can ask the death penalty the deaths of larry witt and matthew witt should be your only concerns during the remainder of this trial the court appreciates your patience in sitting through this exercise and assures you that we will not have a repetition of it during the coming days or weeks villars took a final drink from her glass then abruptly turned to face the courtroom i trust mr powell that you are ready with your next witness i am your honor all right then lets get this show on the road not only was dean powell unhappy and angry the confrontation with freeman in villars chambers seemed to have galvanized him now he didnt just want to win for another notch in his belt or a leg up on his campaign freeman always angling for an edge had raised the stakes and now for powell it had become personal he was not just going to win by getting the jury to convict jennifer witt he was also going to whip david freeman hardy flipped open his binder and found the tab for the federal express driver he pushed it over in front of jennifer so that freeman could review it too but freeman either did not need it could it be he had the whole file memorized or was he reluctant to show that he did mr fred rivera the lou christie fan hardy had had the gypsy cried going through the brainpan for weeks it was driving him crazy took the stand slightly illatease to be the first witness but clearly pleased to be part of all this excitement plus getting paid to take a day off he wore his federal express uniform and sat forward in the witness chair wanting to take it all in mr rivera powell stood on the balls of his feet rocking forward and back fifteen feet or so in front of the witness in the center of the courtroom on the morning of december of last year the monday after christmas did you deliver a federal express package to olympia way yes sir i did so it began powell walking rivera through the delivery at precisely am when larry witt and matt were still alive fred identified a picture of larry it was stamped as an exhibit as was the federal express invoice containing larrys signature for the package nailing the time down powell introduced the computer printout showing that fred had punched in his verified delivery at powell started his next line of questioning rivera had seen no one walking up or down olympia way that morning then without changing his rhythm the prosecutor departed from what freeman and hardy had predicted would be the script mr rivera you had a talk with inspector terrell about the events of that morning and you described mr witts behavior did you not you mean i said he was pretty uptight like that freeman raised his index finger and objected that this was speculation and called for a conclusion villars sustained him powell rephrased it mr rivera what did mr witt do when he opened the door well he only opened it a third maybe a half way i gave him the package and then tried to give him the clipboard so he could sign for it but he was holding the package no place to put it down it seemed to make him mad freeman wondering where all this was going raised a finger again your honor same objection villars leaned over to the witness mr rivera she said gently just say what you saw him do not how you think he felt about it riveras composure was slipping throughout all of his earlier conversations with lawyers and policemen nobody had made him respond in this way before welcome to jury trials hardy thought what did mr witt do then powell was suddenly his good buddy helping him drawing him out well he turned halfaround to give the package to the boy did you see the boy no i didn not see him not then he was behind the door then how do you know it was the boy i saw him go running off to show the package to his mother at the defense table freeman was flipping pages on riveras interviews you ever hear this before he whispered to hardy and then without waiting for an answer stood your honor i object the witness cant possibly know the boys intentions going off with the package freeman appeared agitated and he had reason to be if the prosecution could show that jennifer had been home at and until now nothing in the record had indicated that they could it would be a significant loss villars all but rolled her eyes im sure mr powell will rephrase powell still not skipping a beat smiled at rivera and said dr witt handed the package to the boy behind the door did the boy then say anything he said im going to show this to mom powell turned to freeman stopping to make sure the jury understood what rivera had said your witness it was a classic example hardy thought of why trials were both so addictive and so nervewracking freeman had interviewed rivera twice and the man had never wavered in his story he hadnt seen jennifer he had wanted to get back and hear the golden oldie win a trip to hawaii hed been at the door with dr witt for a minute at the most so the entire thrust of freemans interview had been to establish the time of delivery not whether matt had gone running upstairs calling for his mother the old bear got up slowly but by the time he had reached his spot in front of the bench there was no further sign that he had taken a blow he smiled at the witness nodded to the jury mr rivera weve had a few conversations over the past couple of months have we not yes sir and during those conversations did i ever ask you if you saw jennifer witt while you were delivering this package on december yes sir and how did you respond i said i didnt see her did you hear her was she for example singing in the shower or something like that moving furniture around freeman was taking advantage of the rules that allowed defense in crossexamination to lead witnesses and freeman was also using this bantering tone to get back into a more relaxed mode with fred showing him what a regular joe he could be he got his small reward rivera grinned loosening no i didnt hear nobody singing or moving things around when the boy ran off did he yell for his mother did he run up the stairs yelling mom or anything like that a risky question if the answer was yes it would hurt but given the repressed nature of what they knew to be the tone in the witt household hardy thought it would pay off it took a moment of reflection hardy glanced over at the jury they were following every nuance faces were on rivera no i dont remember that some of the damage perhaps repaired freeman allowed himself a breath lets go back if we may to what matt said to his father can you tell us again what it was seeing this new trap powell was on his feet its in the record your honor the reporter can read back what mr rivera said villars considered powells point a little too long for freemans comfort knowing that a trap could sometimes spring on the person who set it freeman withdrew the question he did not want the jury to hear again how matt had said im going to show this to mom he had been fishing hoping that fred would come up with another paraphrase of the same idea something like ill see if mom will like this when she gets home but no such luck smiling freeman turned back to the witness so to summarize you did not see jennifer witt in the house at thats right you did not hear her either no i didnt freeman paused and realized that this was about as good as he was going to get and it wasnt all that good giving the jury a confident grin he said to rivera thank you sir no further questions powell smelling blood stood quickly and said he had a short question or two on redirect mr rivera when matt went running off with this package what was dr witt doing what was he doing i guess he took the clipboard looked at his watch signed it and gave it to me did he speak to his son no i told you the boy went running behind him yes you did say that he didnt remind the boy though for example that his mother wasnt home objection freeman was up shot from a cannon villars pointed at powell sustained mr powell you know better strike the last and she directed the jury to disregard the question which they would try to do but powell had done more damage and he knew it as he graciously dismissed the witness freeman was fuming over jennifers objections he had insisted that he and hardy return to the sutter street offices he need to vent and didnt want to do it in front of his client he never never mentioned matt going to show anything to anybody hardy was drinking cranberry soda out of a bottle picking pretzels out of the bag on the center of the conference table well he did today david did you ask him shit does that mean you didnt nothing it seemed dimmed freemans appetite he was having liverwurst and onions on a rye roll drinking one of the popular nonalcoholic beers that were so politically correct in san francisco but which hardy thought were a blight on the earth i asked him ten times if hed seen jennifer was jennifer there youre sure you didnt see her you think she was there freeman swallowed what he was chewing the jury thinks she was there diz weve got to convince them she wasnt cause if she was guess what hardy knew too well the answer to that one he sat a moment part of him savoring the experience of freeman choking on his arrogance a victim of his own oversight after lunch they breezed through the coroner dr strout again and this time he delivered his testimony without incident it was no surprise that both larry and matt had been shot at close range with larrys gun and had died almost instantly from the wounds freeman could have stipulated to most of what strout had to say but he held onto a small hope that once again the doctor would put some spin on his testimony that might cast doubt on the essential and undisputed facts he did not there was no point in boring the jury freeman had been willing to stipulate to the validity of the forensics report identifying larrys gun as the murder weapon but on the matter of fingerprints he had a few thoughts the witness was the police departments expert aja farek an attractive pakistani woman of perhaps thirtyfive powell had elicited from her the testimony that jennifers fingerprints had been on both the brass bullet casings and clip that held them freeman shuffled to center stage ms farek did you find any fingerprints at all on the outside of the gun the barrel the grip anyplace like that no except the persons who found the gun of course the person who found the gun who was that ms farek consulted some notes his name is sid parmentier hes the man who found the gun in the dumpster i believe the dumpster what dumpster freeman knew all about the dumpster still he raised his eyebrows including the jury in his shock at this surprising new development powell stood up your honor the people will be calling mr parmentier about his discovery of the murder weapon ms farek is a fingerprint expert villars nodded her face a blank stick to the point mr freeman all right fingerprints freeman again included the jury this time in his disappointment he guessed that they too would have to wait to find out what they all wanted to know about the dumpster well it wasnt his fault he was trying to help them but the judge and prosecutor werent cooperating back at the witness he was gentleness itself how long do fingerprints last ms farek the witness frowned they can last a long time a long time a month a year yes easily and how old were the fingerprints of jennifer witt that you found on the casings and the clip i dont know theres no way to tell that you cant test them for residual dryness anything like that no fingerprints are oilbased they dont get dry in that sense so she could have handled those bullets and the clip at almost any time yes not necessarily on the day of the shooting or anywhere near it powell raised himself from his chair again shes already answered that your honor freeman piped right up so she has beaming all around as if hed made a point hed been laboring over for weeks no further questions despite the leadin sid parmentier the man who had found the gun had nothing either new or startling to say about the gun or the dumpster nevertheless it was not in freemans nature to pass on even neutral testimony he must have felt he had already used up his quota for the day by not crossexamining strout because he jumped up ready to go when powell had finished mr parmentier was heavyset with a neanderthallike hairline his black sports coat was shiny his overstarched white shirt was too tight and evidently so was the black tie he constantly tugged at freeman loving a man who shared his sartorial tastes stood close to the witness box hands in pockets relaxed at any time sir did you see the defendant jennifer witt he pointed for effect at or near this dumpster no did you see her throw anything into it powell raised a hand asked and answered your honor villars sustained him but freeman hadnt had his say yet or he had another card to play hardy suspected the latter your honor it bears repeating im sure the jury heard it the first time mr freeman if mr parmentier didnt see mrs witt at or near this dumpster then it follows doesnt it that he didnt see her throw anything into it silently apparently deep in thought freeman nodded he halfturned around to the defense table thought some more then gave the jury a look villars wasnt having it mr freeman do you want to excuse the witness lets stop these histrionics contrite sincere freeman apologized lost in thought as though hed forgotten where he was for the moment it just occurred to me your honor that this testimony here falls into the same category as that you ruled on during the earlier part of this trial no one in the courtroom not hardy not powell not the jury or villars knew where he was going and he took the opportunity he had created to push forward uninterrupted weve got a gun in a dumpster just like we had a hypodermic needle in a leg years earlier freeman turned directly to the jury suddenly raising his voice suddenly furious you see what hes doing dont you mr powell keeps leaving out any agent who delivers these objects to their destinations he wants you to assume that its jennifer witt and he cant do that bam bam bam villars sounded angry mr freeman get hold of yourself you dont address the jury like that the reporter will strike those last remarks but freeman kept his voice up indignant outraged your honor my clients life is at stake here and theres no evidence whatsoever that jennifer witt even held this gun that somehow got into the dumpster your honor powell had come around his table into the forum of the courtroom her fingerprints were on the weapon villars used her gavel again sit down mr powell were not arguing this right now she pointed a finger you mr freeman are out of order are you finished with this witness or not i am outraged now villars slammed the gavel the sound echoing in the wide high room next to hardy jennifer jumped anything but a yes or no and youll go to jail mr freeman suddenly freeman got himself back under control he nodded swallowed hard yes your honor yes what yes im through with this witness the judge was still holding her gavel ready to crack it down again but the moment had passed powell was back in his seat freeman was returning to his villars perused the room from her bench with no one else to talk to she looked down on mr parmentier the witness may be excused she said were going to take a short recess theyre hating you jennifer said freeman was walking around by the window looking out then back pleased with himself he hardy and jennifer had retired for the recess to their semiprivate conference room behind the bailiffs area i dont think the jury is hating him hardy said they love me freeman declared but mr powell was right jennifer was sitting on the desk hands and feet crossed there was something connecting me and that gun it was mine and larrys even if i didnt put it in that dumpster it wasnt the same as the needle it doesnt matter freeman said after what the judge did with ned every person on that jury is going to have it in their minds theyre going to think its another powell railroad because thats what theyre going to be looking for i think we just put em away hardy was standing by the door hands in his pockets taking it in its a different set of facts david i think the jurys going to go with the facts freeman stalked back to the window looking out and down bunch of spoilsports there was a knock and the door opened one of the courtroom bailiffs stuck his head in gave hardy a look and told freeman that the judge would like a word with him in her chambers hardy decided that he should probably swing by olympia way and spend an early morning hour going over notes and hoping his phantom jogger would reappear if she ran by that way even semiregularly there was some chance that she might be useful the defense would open its case in the next week and he wanted as many other dudes as he could for david to pull out of his hat not that strictly speaking hardys jogger was another dude or even a dudette he had different plans for her freeman wouldnt attempt to implicate her in the killings as a possible suspect but he might be able to use her to discredit the damaging testimony of anthony alvarez the neighbor from across the street what if he had seen this phantom jogger that morning and not jennifer at the gate and therefore not in the house if a question about alvarezs identification of jennifer could get planted in the jurys mind the jogger would be worth putting on the stand sipping some coffee out of a traveling mug cramped behind the wheel of his honda just after sunrise he realized that during the past week while the focus of the trial had been on the ned hollis murder he should have been preparing overviews on tom distephano and the romans if freeman was going to use them as defense witnesses but in fact he hadnt spoken to tom distephano since hed gotten threatened by him and his father a couple of months ago and glitsky hadnt seemed particularly inclined to move on finding an alibi for the romans on december glitsky might be his friend but he was first a cop and a busy cop with other priorities when the directed verdict of acquittal came in so early on ned he realized that time was getting short and he had to have significantly more if freeman was going to be able to use any of the information hed gathered on these people hed have to put the needle in abe see if he could get him to move on the romans and he knew the answer might well be that he couldnt he also came across the name jody bachman and realized that the los angeles attorney had never gotten back to him on crane amp crane and ybmg these were all areas that would have to be shored up before the defense began its case in earnest yesterday monday they had never gone back in to trial villars had evidently gotten herself good and fed up with david freemans grandstanding and after repeated warnings on the record had fined him five hundred dollars privately for contempt of court he knew the rules as well as anyone and if he wasnt going to play by them it was going to get expensive for him in a hurry by then it had been late in the afternoon and villars had sent word out via the bailiff to excuse the jury for the day on his way to do that he had stopped by the room where hardy and jennifer had been talking told them what had happened and hardy had taken the cue and cut out he was parked at the corner so that he could see where the jogger had appeared out of the woods the last time looking down going over one of florence barbietos interviews with walter terrell he almost missed her when she emerged again throwing his notes onto the passenger seat he started the engine in time sure enough she ran down the same route turning the corner onto jennifers street just flying hardy pulled across the street into the driveway just as she arrived at cutting her off he opened the door and got out facing her across the roof smiling hi again today she was wearing maroon shorts and a boston marathon tshirt a maroon headband and the can of mace panting seeing hardy she closed her eyes briefly then opened them whats your problem she asked sucking air why dont you leave me alone he really wasnt into ruining this womans day but he also didnt want to let her get away again he had a card out ready and held it up over the hood of the car just grab this as you run by would you and call me it might be important it might even save a womans life she stood there a minute staring as though she hadnt heard him youre a lawyer really thats right last time you didnt look much like a lawyer he grinned clothes make the man now he was in one of his suits on his way to court a reallife lawyer i was in disguise she was still breathing hard but more controlled than when she first stopped hardy figured that even if he could run as fast as she was going which he couldnt if he had come from the sutro woods down to here it would take him ten minutes to get his breath back she was already back to being able to talk without gasping it was impressive she reached over and took the card glanced at it then at her watch i dont want to keep you but if youve got time for one question we might clear up something right now she looked again at her watch took a deep breath what is it do you run down this street often almost every day ive got a regular route when im working out not the same time though she shook her head depends when i wake up how the mornings going why you been waiting around here a couple of days early so sometimes its later sometimes she was getting leary again this is more than one question yes it is sorry how about this one do you ever remember running by this house here hardy pointed and hearing something like shots something that might have made you stop for a minute thats the special one question she gave it her attention breathing normally now she ran the wristband over her forehead frowning in concentration when would this have been last winter right after christmas she gave it another second then slowly nodded yes i do remember that it was like bang then bang right together they were shots i think i convinced myself that they were just backfires but you did stop just for a minute im on a schedule i like to keep running i didnt see anything else or hear anything i decided it must have been a backfire so i just kept on hardy stayed where he was just outside his door on the drivers side he wasnt about to spook her now you mind telling me your name there was a last bit of hesitancy but it gave way she even halfsmiled at him lisa jennings this is for real isnt it as real as it gets ms jennings hardy came up the gallery aisle out of the corner of his eye he saw terrell in the front row on one side and lightner on the other and let himself through the swinging gate at the rail it was almost eleven and dean powell had a diminutive filipino woman on the stand florence barbieto jennifers nextdoor neighbor hardy sat down next to jennifer touched her arm and whispered jackpot the woman who started running away in front of your house i found her where hardy didnt get a chance to answer villars interrupted powells questioning with a tap of her gavel a glare at hardy the message got across he sat back with a gesture of apology he didnt feel like incurring a fivehundred dollar fine and his information though useful could wait powell turned back to his witness apparently she hadnt been on the stand very long they were going over the events of last december and hadnt gotten very far to repeat mrs barbieto you heard them fighting oh yes the houses arent far apart they were yelling at each other and the boy was crying could you make out any words mrs barbieto brought her finger to her lips no she said at last not that morning leaving the implication that on other mornings she had but powell knew better than to prod there freeman would be up if he did and hed be right this was the morning they cared about all right now could you tell us about the events leading up to the shots themselves well i was in my kitchen cutting up chicken for adobo the kitchen is against the wall by the witts house by the window you were standing by the window i was cutting at the counter the window is over the sink theres another window back a ways which i had open a crack because of the vinegar the vinegar for the adobo powell nodded as if he knew what she was talking about i see and so you could hear what was happening next door but not anymore they had stopped they had stopped yelling you mean yes and for how long was it relatively quiet over there next door at the witts not too long a minute maybe i put away my coffee i cleaned the cup and put it in the washing machine hardy had a vision of a washing machine full of porcelain chips no wonder the damn thing wouldnt work then took out the chicken and i was cutting it and suddenly i heard somebody yell out no and then this awful noise it had to be a shot still i was thinking about all the fighting this morning and all the weekend and then there is this noise so i go to the window the one that was open a crack yes that one more in the back when i get to it i hear another shot it is so loud i almost feel it hits me freeman nodded some more then turned around his eyes taking in the defense table jennifer sat forward hands clenched on the table in front of her she met his gaze and then what did you do well theres a chair there by the window i sat down trying to think i didnt know what to think what could you see from this chair some of the hedge then the side of their house to the back im sorry do you mean the side of the house or the back the side but you know in the back except nothing happens i dont see anything for a minute or two i just sit there trying to think what to do then i think maybe id better go out but maybe i should call my husband i dont know mrs barbieto was reliving the moment twisting the fabric of her dress in her hands squirming in the witness chair then i decided i have to go see if something is wrong maybe i can help it is so quiet now more quiet than before even when they werent fighting powell was up close to her soothing but persistent and what did you do then mrs barbieto took a breath i went next door and rang the bell then i wait and then again i ring but no one is answering and i now the noise came from inside the house just a minute before so somebody must have been in there but no one answered she was shaking her head stealing glances at jennifer clearly afraid to look at her perhaps to the jurys eyes afraid of her powell brought her back repeating the safest question there is in a courtroom and what did you do then i waited another minute and then nobody came so i tried the door to unlock it but it wouldnt move and then i became afraid and ran back to my house and call the and what did you do then i sat down by the front window until the police car came maybe a couple of minutes i was afraid to stay outside powell continued to walk her through the next hour or two after the police car had pulled up jennifers return from her run the arrival of the homicide team mrs barbietos actions and impressions it was a straightforward narrative that hardy didnt think was very damaging to jennifer after all someone had been in the house and done the killing but none of mrs barbietos testimony necessarily convicted jennifer it could still be argued that she hadnt been there when powell turned the witness over to the defense freeman didnt get up from his chair instead he looked up at the judge and then the witness i need one minute your honor if it please the court he sat there unmoving he didnt look at his notes his arms were crossed on the table in front of him after about ten seconds of silence a ripple began in the courtroom people moving in their seats throats being cleared freeman seemed oblivious hardy looked over to him so did jennifer the seconds went by powell got up after about half a minute your honor villars agreed she pointed her gavel mr freeman are you going to crossexamine mrs barbieto or not if you are please get to it that exchange took about ten seconds and freeman at last began grabbing up his yellow pad as a prop he still hadnt spoken sighing he moved forward glancing at his watch now he exclaimed half the jury jumped as did the witness freeman circled quickly in front of the bench taking in the whole room that was one minute he walked directly up to the witness box and smiled now mrs barbieto im sorry for that little display and if it startled you i apologize but weve got some substantial problems with time in your testimony and i thought it would be helpful to think about what a minute is he was out of line he wasnt questioning the witness villars was about to reprimand him but he went right to work youve testified that the yelling stopped at the witt house quote about a minute unquote before you heard the voice shout no and then the shot is that correct mrs barbieto was looking at freeman as if he were possessed and she could have been at least halfright she nodded yes the judge looked over and down at her please use words in your responses a nod doesnt work im sorry mrs barbieto said what was the question again freeman repeated it and this time she said that yes it had been about a minute just to be very clear on this during that time you were sitting there drinking your coffee you heard them yelling across the way at their house yes right up until you finished your coffee and got up maybe not maybe not but during while i was there yes about a minute before yes about okay and during that minute you got up from drinking your coffee where were you drinking it by the way just by the window there by the back all right by the back window you took your cup up front to the sink is that right yes and then what and then i washed it with soap powell stood up with an objection villars overruled him she might think freeman was an ass but he was following a visible trail here and it might even lead somewhere no i just rinse and put it in the washing machine freeman smiled but clearly with her not at her i dont mean this as a criticism mrs barbieto but do you mean you put the cup in the automatic dishwasher there see he wasnt so bad mrs barbieto smiled embarrassed yes i meant the dishwasher all right freeman went on to recap what shed done so far walking around pantomiming her actions in the area in front of the witness box and what did you do next powell tried again saying shed already answered these questions villars overruled him you mean cutting the chicken if thats what you did next yes she stalled now her face clouded the things i did in the kitchen thats what i did did you leave the kitchen during this time she was silent mrs barbieto did you leave the kitchen during this time the witness looked up at the judge i have to go to the bathroom mr freeman villars said are you close to wrapping this up the witness has to go to the bathroom no no no mrs barbietos embarrassment was acute thats what i say said ive got to i had to go to the bathroom then freeman stood stock still for a bit you went to the bathroom before you cut up the chicken do you recall how long you were in there the witness was squirming clearly uncomfortable with such talk not long maybe a minute i dont know in the courtroom there was a low rumble freeman his point made ignored and tried to bring mrs barbieto back to his side all right lets move along now youve testified that you began to cut up a chicken where was the chicken before this freeman maddeningly led her through each step the chicken had been wrapped in the refrigerator shed come over across the kitchen from the refrigerator to the sink unwrapped it threw away the wet wrapper washed the chicken in cold water dried it with a towel first shed cut off the wings then both leg and thigh quarters next shed separated one leg and thigh portion and just before she was about to cut the other one she heard the yell and then the shot now mrs barbieto freeman concluded still friendly and helpful this is why we bagan with my little demonstration of what a minute is its not as you know just a short amount of time its an exact amount of time sixty seconds and youve testified that you heard jennifer fighting with her husband a minute sixty seconds before you heard the first shot no it was more than that it could have been a lot more couldnt it perhaps as much as say ten minutes i dont know i didnt look it just seemed like you know not too long but easily hardy thought long enough for jennifer to have left the house and another dude to come in and commit the murders freeman let the jury take it in consulting the notes he held in his hand reaching his decision he looked to the bench your honor its almost twelvethirty i have a lot more questions for this witness but this is a good breaking point if the people have no objection the people did not timeout hardy had a black castiron frying pan that this parents had given him before he went away to college it was his only artifact from those longago days a relic from his own lost youth it weighed about five pounds and its cooking surface was as smooth and black as hematite after using it he cleaned it with salt and a wipe with a towel although every couple of years he spent an hour rubbing it down with oil and extrafinegrade steel wool so far as he knew soap had never touched it frannie was reading to rebecca before putting her down for the night hardy had discovered shallots and had cut up four of them and tossed them in the pan with butter and olive oil and some parsley he took a drink of his chardonnay and dribbled a few drops of wine into the pan a small pot of rice was on another burner and he lifted the lid checking it timing was all he turned the heat off under the castiron pan the prawns would only take two minutes and he wanted to wait until frannie was finished with the beck leaving his wine he walked through the bedroom and into what had been his office for ten years now the walls painted light blue and surrounded with a menagerie of stenciled animals it was a childs room rebecca was wearing her new turquoise silk pajamas they were daddys favorites and so she wore them every night soon hed have to get her another pair she sat surrounded by half a dozen of her buddies a teddy bear and a rabbit and a cabbagepatch doll and some others all with names half on frannies lap on the rainbow childrens loveseat draped enthralled by good dog carl hardy stood in the doorway taking it in he came over and sat with them and the beck rearranged herself so as to be lying over both of her parents hardy put his arm over frannies shoulders and she leaned into him smelling good he didnt particularly like it that frannie continued talking to jennifer but frannie just didnt feel right about abandoning her and she didnt want to go down to the jail so shed talk to her on the phone from time to time she seems confident davids going to pull it out after all i hope so hardy picked up a prawn by the tail and took a bite im getting good he said these are good frannie disagreed they arent good theyre perfect anytime you feel like throwing a little something together for dinner like this you go right ahead frannie had finished breastfeeding vincent she was having some of the wine now you dont sound too sure well david does put on a good show he was something else today you leave that courtroom feeling like youve got your moneys worth but but i dont know frannie put her fork down and looked across the table at him in the candlelight are you really worried im really worried he moved some rice around he had florence barbieto up there today for maybe six hours and proved that every time shed said the words a minute and she said them a lot it really didnt mean a literal minute but if this guy alvarez the neighbor across the street comes on and say he saw jennifer leaving the house within pardon the phrase a minute after the shots then she was there but this other woman you found the jogger well sure david will trot her out and i am glad that i found her and shell say she heard the shots or noise like shots and stopped and started running right from the gate but all powell will have to do is ask her how she even knows it was the same day she doesnt if alvarez sticks to his identification that still puts jennifer in the house and very probably we lose he pointed at her plate his face softening eat your shrimp woman itll make you strong frannie dutifully took a bite but her heart wasnt in it i cant believe somebody this man powell whos talked to her and seen her is so determined to put her to death god i mean shes a nice person maybe a little confused but hardy shook his head i dont mean to argue with you but i dont think shes such a nice person shes lied and she did kill at least one person he held up a hand okay maybe she had reasons but i dont want to go overboard on what a sweetheart jennifer witt is well she sure didnt kill larry and matt i dont think she did dismas you know she didnt i dont know that i hope it and its true i cant imagine that she killed matt but i dont know for sure nothing ive found and ive been looking proves she didnt do any of it but nothing proves she did and thats what it comes down to doesnt it thats what powells got to prove hardy nodded in theory well well in fact quite a bit seems to indicate that she did do it thats the problem shes got fivemillion dollars if shes cleared and shes out of her abusive marriage and and matt sure except that except hardy knew that there were a host of socalled human beings on the planet who were capable of killing their offspring without remorse he really didnt believe jennifer was one of them but i dont think thats her i dont either fran but its not impossible thats all im saying well i hate it and i hate to hear you even suggest it im not all that fond of it myself they sat across the table from one another the food forgotten hardy reached out a hand and frannie took it ive got a really startling idea he said how about if we dont talk about jennifer witt or the law at all for oh i dont know lets try five minutes and if we make it lets go for the whole night it wasnt easy but later on it was sweetly worth it as hardy had feared anthony alvarez was trouble it didnt help that he looked like ricardo montalban the cosmopolitan spokesman for whatever quality car it was little clipped white mustache ruddy yet handsome chiseled face except that his snowwhite hair didnt flow it was marinecut his business suit was neat neither showy nor rundown his posture was relaxed yet commanding and his vocabulary impressive he had worked for the city for thirty years as a fireman before retiring seven years ago rising to the rank of assistant chief he was at home most of the time now tending to his wife who was bedridden with a lung condition in short had he been a defense witness he would have been a godsend but he was the prosecutions witness in fact he was their star at powells careful prodding he was telling the story again from his own perspective talking about the shots it was very unusual its a quiet street most of the time and one noise like that it was surprising but i didnt think too much of it but then the second one right away like it was i thought i ought to go and look see if there might be some serious disturbance and what did you do then well marys room mary is my wife is up the stairs the second room back i had been in with her reading to her and after the second shot i walked up the hall to the window at the head of the stairs which looks down over the street olympia way and did you see anything then on the street yes i saw a woman dressed in some kind of a running outfit standing by the gate to dr witts house across the street powell had clearly coached mr alvarez on how to answer his questions and now he had him at the crux is that woman in this courtroom mr alvarez the witness did not hesitate yes she is sir shes right there he pointed at the defense table powell nodded the nail driven let the record show that the witness has identified the defendant jennifer witt there was the expected buzz in the courtroom and next to hardy jennifer hung her head shaking it villars tapped her gavel a couple of times calling for order and hardy took the moment to whisper to jennifer look at him look right at him her head came up but she apparently couldnt sustain her defiance alvarez was staring directly back at her conveying that he was committed to his accusation it was you and theres no mistaking my certainty on it jennifer slowly crumbled crossing her arms on the table in front of her lowering her face until it rested on them powell took it all in there was a moment when he looked at freeman declaring himself the victor then it was gone he turned back to the witness what did she do then hardy was constantly surprised by the many guises of david freeman he never rose to crossexamine the same way twice sometimes as he had demonstrated with mrs barbieto he didnt rise at all waiting for an invitation more an ultimatum from the bench with anthony alvarez when powell had finished with him freeman figuratively leapt at his throat mr alvarez you have just stated that you saw mrs witt standing by the gate looking back to the front door within a minute or so after the shots is that correct yes did you see her leave the house no she was by the gate when i saw her and your inference was that she had come from the house yes that she was in the house when the shots were fired yes and came out directly afterward within a minute or so which is when you saw her yes thats right i did infer that she could though have been anywhere when the shots were fired isnt that correct up the street down the street halfway across the city for that matter alvarez frowned and powell objected are you going somewhere with this mr freeman villars said freeman nodded i am clarifying your honor that the witness could not possibly have known where jennifer witt was when the shots were fired he assumed that she was inside at the time but if it was not jennifer at the gate villars nodded all right ill overrule the objection you may continue mr freeman it was a good exchange hardy thought of course it didnt preclude that jennifer had been inside at the time of the shooting but for the first time the jury was listening to a prosecution witness testify that he could not say for certain that she was and after freeman brought up lisa jennings the doubt that she had been there at all would be even greater the question was read back to alvarez and he reluctantly conceded that yes in theory jennifer could have been anywhere when the shots were fired except that she couldnt have gotten to her front gate in one minute from across the city he added freeman smiled warmly indeed she could not he said this is why i want you to be absolutely certain of your testimony mr alvarez that you saw jennifer witt standing at her front gate you are certain of that alvarez was not flustered but he surely was getting impatient yes im certain but youve testified that she was looking back at the front door yes and after that she began running down the street thats right and her house is where in relation to yours its just across the street and olympia way is a flat street is it no its fairly steep maybe a threepercent grade and from the witt home is it exactly across olympia way from you or a little uphill or downhill alvarez with no clue what freeman wanted remained relaxed he took a beat though to make sure that there wasnt a trap here not seeing it he answered i consider it just across the street but youre right it is slightly down the hill freeman remained crisp i didnt say anything i could be right about mr alvarez youre saying it so you were standing in your upstairs window looking across and down the hill at mrs witt who was standing by her gate and then immediately she began running down the street that is away from you is this your testimony yes alvarez sat back crossing his legs his patrician face had gradually tightened and now he was frowning freeman pounced all right then when did you see her face alvarez leaned forward when did i see her face thats right mr alvarez if she was facing away from you the whole time looking at her house and then she started running downhill when did you get a chance to see her face alvarez went with the only story he could salvage well i must have seen it from the side you must have you must have did you or didnt you yes i did i did i saw her profile i knew it was jennifer witt it never occurred to me it wasnt you mean it could have been so it must have been your honor powell was on his feet counsel is badgering the witness freeman raised his hands theatrically your honor this is a crucial eyewitness for the prosecution and the jury needs to know that his positive identification of jennifer witt is in fact highly questionable villars pursed her lips disliking freemans histrionics but knowing he had a point nevertheless she said firmly mr powell is right youre badgering the witness well strike the last question you may proceed freeman walked back to the defense table took a sip of water then turned back to the witness mr alvarez lets talk about the gun shall we did you see the gun the gun yes the murder weapon which somehow made its way to a dumpster down the street by the park that gun did you notice if the person you identified as jennifer witt was holding that gun as she stood by the gate there was something bulging at her side freeman shook his head mr alvarez please just answer the question did you see a gun alvarez didnt like it and neither did powell but there was nothing he could do about it no but she was holding freeman held up a palm please mr alvarez thats all lets move along shall we freeman turned again to glance at jennifer and hardy this of course conveyed his expression to the jury as well they would know that at least from his perspective he was eating alvarezs lunch he turned back to the witness box the final point id like to ask about is along the same line i pursued with mrs barbieto how long is a minute villars pursed her lips ready to squelch any histrionics before they got out of hand but for all his penchant for showboating freeman was playing this crossexamination very straight and hardy doubted that hed let his flamboyance sideswipe him when he was on such a roll youve told us that you were at your wifes bedside reading to her when you heard the shots thats right and then after the second shot you got up to look across the street is that right alvarez nodded wearily and villars instructed him to answer questions with words nodding again he said yes i got up after the second shot immediately within a minute say or less perhaps slightly less somewhere between immediately and a minute and then you walked to your front window thats correct and how far is that from your wifes bedroom i dont know exactly maybe twenty feet id guess something like that and you walked directly to the window you didnt stop for example to go to the bathroom on the way there was a nervous titter in the courtroom freeman was pushing the limits of villars endurance and knew it but it played beautifully for the jury alvarez didnt see the humor and answered soberly yes i walked directly to the window and the person you saw at the gate was already there when you arrived looking back at the house yes the picture was clear to hardy but he wondered how many of the jury saw it all of them would he believed after freeman got through with his opening statement for the defense could jennifer have killed larry and matt upstairs in her house then run down the stairs through the house out the front door and up the walkway and then shut the gate in the time it took anthony alvarez to walk twenty feet give or take less than a minute he doubted it he thought the jury would doubt it too especially once freeman tied in his jogger lisa jennings for the misidentification by alvarez mistaking lisa for jennifer but powell was not about to let alvarez stand down on this for him low note trial rules permitted direct examination by the side giving its caseinchief then crossexamination by the opposition then another round of questions should they be required by the side that had called the witness in the first place this last round was the redirect and powell was up and rolling before freeman got back at the defense table mr alvarez just a couple more questions how long have you known mrs witt weve been acquainted for about four years we went over and introduced ourselves when they moved in four years and during that time i take it youve seen her walking away from you yes and obviously in profile havent you alvarez finally started to loosen up with the friendly tone he broke a smile of course many times and you have no doubt personally that the woman you saw at the gate across the street after the shots was jennifer witt to his credit realizing what it meant alvarez took some time staring at jennifer i have nothing against the woman but it was her your honor all right mr freeman the jury will disregard that last answer mr alvarez please just answer the question the court recorder adrienne read back powells question and this time alvarez answered simply no no doubt at all to which freeman could not object officer gary gage took the stand in his uniform he was about forty a veteran patrolman the officer who had responded to and who had discovered the bodies and the front door was locked when you arrived powell said yes the neighbor he consulted his notes mrs barbieto came out when i got there we talked for a few minutes and then i went over and knocked on the door and then i tried to open it but it was locked and what time was this gage reluctantly replied i got there at so this must have been maybe powell frowned but you received a dispatch from much earlier than that didnt you officer gage nodded yes sir we received a dd call thats domestic disturbance at exactly gage again looked down at his notes thats what ive got here sir they radioed it through to me gage shrugged it was after christmas a lot of people were having family fights sometimes it takes a while powell nodded walked back to his table and took a yellow sheet from his assistant read it put it back down what did you do then well i was going to go check around the back but just then mrs witt came back from running she asked what i was doing there and i explained about mrs barbietos call hearing some yelling between her and her husband maybe some shots how did she respond to that gage fidgeted slightly raising his eyes to take in jennifer he wanted to get it out straight she uh she told me there wasnt a problem anymore she had just been out running obviously if there had been a fight it was over did you get the feeling she was dismissing you freeman objected to that and was sustained but powell didnt break stride what did you do then i told her id rung the doorbell and no one had answered she said her husband had probably gone out to cool off just like she had and taken her son next to hardy jennifer was whispering to freeman that she hadnt wanted the cop to have to confront larry because she knew he would beat her up for getting the police involved gage was going on i said id like to see the house make sure in view of the suspected shots that everything was okay she again told me she was sure that everything was in order but i insisted so finally she opened the door and then what happened gage swallowed well i smelled the gunpowder immediately so i told her to sit on the couch i drew my weapon and began to walk through the rooms of the house first downstairs then up until i found the bodies the courtroom was still gage was sweating apparently reliving the moment jennifer seated on the couch in the living room waiting while he looked and what did you do then gage took a breath i came out onto the railing and looked over and down at the defendant at mrs witt there i said stay here please there has been a shooting and what did she do she looked up at me and said i know after the lunch recess inspector sergeant walter terrell took the stand for the second time the walter terrell who was sworn in this afternoon was not the eager young man of only a few days before gone was the flight jacket and casual slacks the hair halfuncombed the designer shirt unbuttoned to the neck for his testimony this time he wore a threepiece charcoal pinstriped suit that had to have set him back plenty a lawyers suit complete with red tie and white shirt he had cut his hair and it lay where he had put it even the aggressive demeanor had been tempered hardy knew that if you wanted to succeed in this theater you sometimes had to grow up in a hurry and obviously two things had happened since terrells last appearance as a witness in the hardball of a capital murder trial someone had spent time coaching him and he had wanted to learn at first glance it looked as though powell had made terrell understand something that had been foreign to him before that a witness didnt need a macho personality out on his sleeve to be effective if placed in a careful arrangement of the facts powell for whatever his flaws in preparing this case continued to exude confidence that he was winning it was unsettling inspector terrell powell began since your credentials have already been established lets begin with your arrival at the murder scene the witt house on olympia way this was when this time up terrell didnt break out his winsome smile all business not trying to please anybody just here doing his job i arrived at the scene at there were already officers there and the room had been secured did you see the defendant jennifer witt yes when i came in she was sitting on a couch in a large room off to the right of the entrance one of the officers there pointed her out to me and i went over to speak with her what was her demeanor at that time she was sitting with her feet tucked under her her hands crossed in her lap she was quiet she was not crying no sir and she could speak coherently yes sir did you inspector terrell have any reason to suspect that mrs witt had committed the murders at that time terrell thought for a beat not really other than that statistically spouses often kill each other terrell sat back for the first time comfortable in the hard witness chair powell probably looked genuinely puzzled to the jury but didnt officer gage tell you about mrs witts saying i know when he told her about the bodies upstairs yes but i guess i chalked that up to shock plus she might have come to that conclusion while waiting for him to check the house this was good but not for jennifer terrell was repairing his hothead image of the other day he hadnt jumped all over jennifer like a rabid dog he had waited for the evidence to pile up and powell was leading him toward it toward his certainty that jennifer had done it during later interviews did you ask mrs witt who she thought might have done this now terrell sat forward well in law enforcement we always ask the question cui bono which means who benefits and of course when i learned that mrs witt would inherit something like fivemillion dollars well it got my attention i asked if anyone else would inherit she said no go on the next thing was that she had told me her husband had no enemies and if that were so the motive for the murders had to be impersonal robbery for example i asked her to search the house and list anything however small that was missing hardy had heard all this before but it was now coming out in a believable and damning fashion the gun never mentioned as missing by jennifer her belated memory of the strange swarthy man in a trenchcoat walking up the street as she walked down it when powell was finished and turned the questioning over to freeman the defense attorney started with the same line hardy would have taken the only pinhole in an otherwise seamless fabric mrs witt told you her husband had not enemies is that so yes sir and in the course of your investigations you looked into this assertion yes i did terrell was volunteering nothing playing freemans game pausing before he spoke never giving a word without thought he met freemans stare with his own hardy knew a little of what made terrell tick the inspector was daring freeman to try and come get him and somehow he was pulling it off without appearing belligerent powell had trained him well but something was up suddenly hardy put together powells confidence and terrells attitude the defense was walking into a trap he raised a hand excuse me your honor freeman interrupted as he was trying to find his rhythm turned around glaring id like to request a short recess villars frowned the afternoon had been long enough without these constant interruptions if there are no objections there were none she called a fifteen minute recess theres something going on hardy said were going to get sandbagged he and freeman were standing nosetonose just inside the door to what they had taken to calling their suite the windows were sealed shut and the heat either was working too hard or the air conditioner wasnt working hard enough in any case the temperature was at least ninety degrees on what ill bring up a couple of other dudes with terrell and sit my weary ass back down i know thats what you want to do what im saying is dont do it terrells got something hes dying to leak out you hurt powell on alvarez and he knows it and still hes a cheshire cat out there and i dont think its faked everything powell does is faked unlike your own sincere self right freeman let it go goddamn it s hot as hell in here what do you want me to do just dismiss terrell stop right here how could it hurt the look hardy got in response wasnt flattering but he didnt care he was convinced that they had closed to within a length of a good chance of acquittal after the testimony of barbieto and alvarez after all they were talking reasonable doubt here not certainty and hardy thought they had it further even though gage and terrell hadnt gotten them any points neither had they put too many on the boards for powell that though could change in an instant one false move now could turn the momentum of the entire trial it was a time to be conservative in the literal sense conserve what youve already got dont let the other side score this however had never been david freemans style you ask me how it could hurt it isnt presenting the best defense for our client thats how terrells on the record as implying nobody else in the world had a reason to kill larry witt hes built it on our clients saying witt had no enemies you want to let that to by you dont think thats important sure its important but we can get to it next week we can introduce it now get the jury primed to accept the details later hardy saw that he wasnt going to convince his partner which was no surprise well perhaps he was wrong it was after all just a feeling maybe terrells presence put hunches into his gut anyway hed tried to warn david satisfy his conscience put his two cents in and as in the rest of the world two cents were essentially worthless freeman pulled open the door and went out into the blessedly cool corridor inspector terrell we were talking about larry witts lack of enemies i believe you looked into mrs witts assertion that he had no enemies is that right thats part of any homicide investigation finding out who had a motive to kill the deceased freeman still flushed from the heat of the suite glanced down at the yellow pad he was holding and were your efforts to uncover enemies for dr witt successful terrells opinion about who might be larry witts enemies in fact this whole line of inquiry as speculative argumentative and irrelevant but powell didnt appear to want to object terrell was in no hurry he pushed his back against the chair stretching lifted his shoulders let them fall in what sense freeman looked to the jury surely a cooperative witness could understand this question but he bravely pressed on in the sense that you found people who might have had a motive to kill dr witt might have perhaps and in your thorough investigation did any of these people become suspects no no why not terrell explained patiently because at the time there wasnt any evidence linking anyone else to the crime a good answer but freeman had at least gotten the concession that perhaps there had been other people with motives hardy thought he should take that and sit down but again it wasnt to be his heart sinking hardy recalled malrauxs dictum that character is fate was freeman pressing on to his fate to jennifers at the time you say you mean that since the defendant has been in custody youve come upon such evidence freeman turned to the jury including them in his reaction linking another person to the crime yes terrell making freeman pull it out hardy was silently begging his partner to stop sit down call it off but it was already too late now it would have to play out and still youve kept mrs witt in jail even though there was another suspect again that inclusion of the jury i didnt say there was another suspect in fact this individual only strengthened mrs witts motive there was nothing that tied him to the crime scene jennifer gripped hardys arm terrell could hold it no longer without being asked he declared mrs witt was having an affair she was sleeping with her psychiatrist it was speculation it was obviously based on hearsay it was totally inadmissible but david had asked for it and he got it he didnt bother to object the damage was done it was the battle of the anchors each channel outdoing the other trying to bring out dirt on dr ken lightner alleged lover of jennifer witt they werent having a lot of luck even though it was date night hardy called and told frannie he was sorry but he wasnt coming home she could find out why by watching the television he had a lot of catching up to do after he left the hall of justice he went back to the office and watched some television himself a few of freemans associate redhots hung around in the conference room trying to figure out how to salvage something from this disaster nobody had any good ideas although all agreed it was a bitch when your client lied to you or seriously withheld information from you freeman himself after an hourlong argument with jennifer during which she had continued to deny any affair with lightner in spite of the fact that they had stayed in the same room in costa rica for a week had said he was going out to dinner alone at the french restaurant below his apartment he was going to drink a good bottle of wine and then he was going to drink another one once terrells testimony opened the dike the flood swept over freeman on redirect powell revealed the details of jennifers extradition how they had found her then he had called lightner and gotten it confirmed everything that is but the affair itself which lightner strongly denied the jury however would draw its own conclusions about that from the facts they would probably be the same as those drawn by hardy freeman and every other soul in the courtroom which was that your heterosexual male was not likely to go and stay in a hotel room on a beach in costa rica with a world class beauty like jennifer witt for a week and not have the physical creep in from time to time or to assume that this relationship might not be a preexisting condition from who knew how far back after she had broken out of jail terrell had played one of his famous hunches he had figured jennifer would have to contact someone and from his earlier investigations he tagged lightner as the most likely indeed the only possible person jennifer had no close friends and was estranged from her natural family there really had been no other choice and because it was a capital murder case because powell the candidate was so strongly in his camp because jennifers escape had infuriated the judiciary terrell had somehow squeezed enough juice to get a warrant on the phone companys list of lightners outgoing calls the outgoing calls to costa rica were good enough terrell was going to question lightner in person when lo and behold the doctor had gone off to costa rica for a week a muchneeded vacation terrell had followed him down laying low getting enough to come back and start the extradition proceedings hardy would have bet a lot that the money for all this had come from dean powells campaign fund there was no way that the san francisco police department would pay the freight to fly an officer down to costa rica to investigate some alleged hankypanky hardy realized that he had for too long let himself be diverted by freemans theatrics and boundless confidence this case was far from won in fact it might now be lost it was one thing that lightner had gone down to costa rica although that was bad enough but terrells testimony that she and lightner had shared a room the fact that there had been another man in the picture all along and who knew for how long would work against jennifer with the jury now in their eyes she also had a personal motive for killing larry it had not just been the money she was cheating too hardy understood what the jury would feel jennifer was a woman who did what she wanted took what she wanted and the world be damned she would seem exactly the kind of person one would expect to do what she had been accused of he knew now that whether or not freeman chose to address this costa rica business in the defenses caseinchief they were going to need to distract the jury by presenting their other dudes someone else who might have had a plausible motive and an opportunity to have killed larry witt and the means to have done it hardy had his briefcase open the files on his desk forcing himself he had to start somewhere he looked up the number of jody bachman the los angelesbased attorney for the yerba buena medical group since it was eightthirty after hours he wasnt surprised to get one of those automated answering devices that asked if you knew your quarrys last name or extension dutifully he punched in the first four letters b a c h the phone rang once jody bachman a youngish voice not exactly squeaky but enthusiastic peppy mr bachman my name is dismas hardy im an attorney in san francisco and left a message for you several weeks ago im following up tardily he added to himself there was a longish pause i didnt call you back hardy had to smile they ground down these guys so far in the corporate mills they had to look up to see down you might have hardy admitted i didnt get any message thats all im sorry its been crazy here maybe you know they schmoozed for a moment nonbillable lawyer talk about the rat race and working until all hours then hardy go to it saying that todd crane recommended talking to bachman about ybmg sure i represent them if i can help you but you said this was a murder trial hardy explained witt witt i cant say it rings any kind of bell but ive been awake for four days running now and sometimes i dont recognize my own name he laughed weakly the glamour of the lbo whats that said hardy the innocent what lbo leveraged buyout where have you been mr hardy the wave of the past or future depending on your politics or your money same thing arent they not exactly but thats often a good guess so listen about this dr witt im pretty sure he called your offices last december i dont know who he would have talked to probably me bachman admitted but i really dont remember ill have my secretary look it up and get back to you hows that thatd be good thanks sure no problem its the real you at last hardy said to his friend abe glitsky who stood in the doorway to his apartment wearing a clown costume big floppy feet white pancake makeup a cute little red nose let me guess glitsky cut him off its jacobs birthday party he turned back into the apartment hardy tagging behind flo came up bussed him on the cheek and asked if he wanted some cake or ice cream there were about fifteen tenyearolds in the cramped kitchen none of them meditating abe looks good flo gave him a look you wait youll do it too hardy thought that she was probably right he couldnt at this moment though imagine himself as a future reincarnation of bozo the clown but he had to admit it was possible is he going to be done soon ten minutes flo said maybe a little more he just does a little act id love to see it she moved closer to him a hand on his arm i think youd cramp his style you can wait in the boys room all three of the glitsky boys had the same bedroom and it wasnt a big one jacob and isaac shared the bunk bed and oj now almost five used a little daybed against the opposite wall hardy sat on it listening to the laughter from the kitchen a his friend the homicide inspector did his clown tricks he took the opportunity to rest his head for just a second on the pillow i hate to wake you but my kid needs to go to sleep hardy looked at his watch he had crashed for nearly an hour glitsky was back in normal clothes holding out a cup of hot coffee hardy took it sitting up rubbing a crick in his neck with his free hand i had a dream about you in a clown suit he said it was horrible glitsky shook his head and turned around hardy followed him into the kitchen sat down at the table with his coffee cup glitsky poured some boiling water into a cup and started fiddling with the chain at the end of his silver tea strainer in the back rooms they could hear flo finishing up with the boys supervising the washing up getting them into their pajamas ready for the sack but enough small talk hardy began what did you ever find out about the romans over by the stove glitsky dipped the strainer up and down in his cup and watched the steam rise i know they were after the greeks but beyond that it gets a little fuzzy he picked up his cup holding the tea chain in his other hand crossed to the table and sat latin wasnt my thing or id probably know more hardy drank coffee cecil roman father of melissa roman deceased patient of larry witt mr roman accused witt of performing an abortion and killing his daughter the tea was by now as dark as hardys coffee and still glitsky kept dipping the strainer oh those romans no i havent found out anything i probably would have told you if i had he finally took the strainer out and took a cautious sip you really going to need it id like to know if roman or his wife for that matter has an alibi glitsky nodded the case falling apart hardy told him about the events of the afternoon the allegation about lightner how it would be helpful if they had at least one other person who might have had some good motive and opportunity to kill dr witt it sounds like this guy lightner kind of sticks up he was sleeping with the lady and he could have they both deny they were lovers glitsky gave him the eye im sure hardy shrugged it doesnt really matter the jurys going to believe it so theres a motive for him except he was working that morning at his office with secretary in attendance terrell already checked it out glitsky slurped some tea his eyes out of focus somewhere behind hardy im not sure i understand why i want to help you point the finger away from a murder suspect who looks to me like shes guilty you want to explain that part to me again im a cop remember im on the other side i could say to serve the ends of justice but i sense youd gag or something or something okay i wont say that how about were such good friends and id do the same thing for you nope no good hardy got up for more coffee at the counter he turned back around ive got it you might get the collar on the real killer except we think shes already on trial well what about if it isnt her look abe the romans hated larry witt all im asking you to do is find out if they were in tahiti or some place on december so i can cross them off thats all huh find out what somebody was doing on a certain day ten months ago you saw them didnt you why didnt you ask them i think it was that the opportunity never came up so i go find out right piece of cake speaking of which cut me a little of that would you the remains of jacobs birthday cake pretty well destroyed were on the drain and hardy scooped some of it onto a paper plate and brought it back to the table see what a friend i am glitsky rubbed a finger through the frosting popped it into his mouth absurd he said hardy shrugged but so much of life is freeman did not have two bottles of wine at his french restaurant instead after the first one he decided he had to take another crack at jennifer get to the bottom of this affair issue but he didnt make it upstairs to the jail ken lightner was coming down the wide steps at the front of the hall of justice when freeman arrived not given to hesitation in any event freeman jumped out of the cab bumping his head on the door and calling dr lightner wait a minute would you fumbling for some money freeman threw a mixed handful of coins and bills through the cabs front window lightner had come down the steps mr freeman im sorry but its late and im very tired whatever this is its going to have to wait its not going to have to do anything of the kind sir i need the truth from you and i need it now lightner gestured back toward the building i told the truth in there this afternoon and tomorrow if i choose i get to crossexamine you about that about what you said would you rather we get to it then what have you been doing in there visiting my client visiting my patient mr freeman my patient and your lover this time lightners response was measured ive denied that under oath youre going to have to accept that i dont accept it freeman said i dont believe it and that makes you my best suspect me are you joking freeman jabbed a finger yeah you no im not joking if you were having an affair with jennifer youve got at least as good a motive as she does to have killed her husband of course he didnt really believe that but he had to try so ill look forward to talking to you tomorrow on the stand and if you think youre tired now freeman headed for the wide doorway now just a minute freeman turned its going to take a sight more than a minute doctor you got the time or not if not ive got better things to do they were ten feet apart freeman flat on his feet like a fighter lightner scratched at his beard all right he said but not here i know a place freeman said already moving leading the way across bryant through the doors and down the steps to the underground labyrinth leading to lou the greeks this time of night the place was nearly empty lou was wiping up the tv was dark two regulars quietly nursed beers and shots at the bar and a couple were wrapped around each other in a side booth freeman took lightner to the back to another booth when lou started toward them freeman waved him away my only concern mr freeman is jennifer it hadnt been warm outside and lous wasnt any better but lightner had a sheen of sweat on his brow that he seemed unaware of well good doctor that gets us off on the right foot freeman knocked on the table loud calling out on second thought lou bring us two cold ones would you back to dr lightner he crossed his hands in front of him im listening doctor again the beard got scratched its complicated she thinks shes in love with me its a common phenomenon transference reinforced by the situation she had at home transference where you sleep with her lightner shook his head look mr freeman i am not a therapist who sleeps with his patient i dont really care if you believe that or not that would really damage her she doesnt need that she didnt need that even if she thinks she did and she thought she did lou came back with the beers put them on the table disappeared freeman put his hand around one and drew it to him drinking listening lightner sat there reflecting ignoring his bottle it was not an easy week he said down there i mean in costa rica freeman took another swig of beer so you didnt sleep with her but why didnt you tell us about how she felt lightner was shaking his head side to side as though lecturing a child that would have been rather stupid why because it would announce to the jury that jennifer wasnt in love with her husband that she wanted out of the marriage you think that would help her help your case freeman shrugged its out now doctor how about that it came out nobody volunteered it theres a difference lightners voice was down to a nearwhisper listen please do you think if i thought it would help jennifer that i wouldnt have lied im human im even at least a little in love with her he shook his head it happens both ways in therapy a professional recognizes it and controls it he seemed to notice the beer for the first time and pulled it toward him dont you see she realizes that it gives her the freedom to feel as she does and not be afraid i will take advantage of it its in part why she trusts me but she stayed with you she was scared mr freeman she wanted to stay with me i decided to allow it it may have been bad judgment as i said im human too even though i am a shrink he halfsmiled now lightner took a drink thats all of it mr freeman and you can believe me or not i could not turn her out we draw our own lines i let her stay in the room with me platonically freeman crossed his hands in front of him again he sighed it was not impossible i still say you could have told me this earlier i didnt want it to come out at all dont you understand that nothing about it i was afraid it would hurt jennifer at this trial it would seem to say that she had a strong motive in addition to the money or whatever else theyre saying to get rid of her husband wouldnt it it would cast her in the role of a cheating wife and now it has finally lightner seemed to lose his patience he slapped at the table well that was not me i did not make that happen and if you want to bring it up again tomorrow and hammer at me if you think youll be doing jennifer any good then so be it ill repeat what ive told you here and you can watch while the jury takes in the fact that jennifer had a strong emotional reason to kill her husband maybe even her child maybe even on purpose so that she could run away and start a new life with her shrink he grimaced if you really think thats going to help her well you cant possibly the best thing you can do for jennifer mr freeman is forget about her and me sipping his beer freeman nodded it also lets you off lightner shook his head again as though regretting what he was about to say mr freeman he said i was in my office that morning and i can establish that im afraid the jury is going to focus on jennifer on her supposed motive or motives on the fact that she didnt love her husband anymore that she wanted out of a terrible marriage lightner drank off half his beer my god he said youre the lawyer do you think i wanted this to happen do i have to draw you a picture his eyes sad dispirited freeman spun his empty bottle between his hands you just did he said good morning im not going to take up too much of your time with my defense statement this morning you probably feel youve been here long enough i dont want to bore you on the one hand or insult your intelligence on the other but i do think it will be useful to recap whats happened here in this trial so far as the evidence is concerned because evidence is what trials are really all about does the evidence prove beyond a reasonable doubt that jennifer witt killed her husband and son well looking at the evidence which weve now seen every bit of the answer ladies and gentlemen is no let me repeat that the evidence weve seen so far does not prove that jennifer witt killed her husband and her son and thats what it has to do freeman voice low in his least aggressive tone spoke in place gesturing occasionally with his hands but seemingly content to let his words do their work he stood before the jury box directly in front of the table shared by hardy and jennifer he did not so much as glance at judge villars or turn to powell and morehouse at the prosecution table this was his statement to the jury and he was going to play to them the evidence has to prove that jennifer witt has done these terrible deeds it must allow for no other reasonable explanation it is not enough to say well maybe she could have been there and done this you must be absolutely convinced there must be no doubt your honor dean powell appeared saddened by the need to interrupt he conveyed how much he just hated to break mr freemans rhythm but alas he really had no choice he spoke with considerable control this is argument not an opening statement surprisingly villars overruled powell hardy thought it was the first time in the trial that hed seen villars blow a call on the law freeman was out of bounds this was clearly argument evidently it was an argument that appealed to the judge but freeman had no cause to gloat he knew it and picked right up and what do we the defense have to prove do we have to prove that jennifer witt was not at her house that she did not use the gun that she did not have a lover that perhaps she did not know about her husbands insurance policy and the doubleindemnity claim the answer is that we do not have to prove a thing the burden of proof is on the prosecution and it never goes away from the prosectution mr powell here and freeman turned slightly his job is to prove jennifer witt did those things and you know what he just has not done it hardy had to admire freeman the man was a fighter freeman held up a finger one no one ever has positively put jennifer inside the house when the shots were fired this is a fundamental flaw that by itself creates reasonable doubt two another finger and this is also crucial the prosecution has offered no motive no theory no reasonable hypothesis at all for the shooting of young matthew witt it is simply asking you to believe that jennifer witt for some unknown reason shot and killed her only child there has been no effort to prove that she did or why jennifer still took any mention of matt heavily her head went down for an instant and she sucked in a breath swallowing hard she reached for her water and drank three the first witness to even put mrs witt near the scene at the time of the shooting that was mrs barbieto youll remember was not even close to being clear on the amount of time that had elapsed between hearing jennifer next door and the shots it might have been fifteen minutes in fact it quite possibly was four mr alvarez says he saw mrs witt running down the street away from him within a minute of the shots one minute lets recall the testimony of mr alvarez on this famous one minute he said that he walked directly from his wifes bedside to the window at the front of the hallway overlooking olympia way a distance of perhaps twenty feet and there was jennifer witt already in that short minute or less outside the gate to her house looking back at it this hardy thought was clear by now and it was a crucial point even if she had run jennifer could not have made it from her bedroom where the killings had occurred down the stairs across the living room out the door down the walkway and out the gate closing it and turning around in the amount of time it took alvarez to walk twenty feet freeman paused briefly to let it sink in more quietly now confident in his facts lets go to mr alvarezs identification of jennifer witt now im not saying he didnt positively identify mrs witt he did that ill ask you though to consider how he could be so positive when he admits that he never saw her face thats a hell of a trick villars frowned at the mild profanity but again surprisingly let freeman continue uninterrupted next since it made such an impression on the prosecution when this came up lets take a minute to talk about mrs witts alleged intimate relationship with her psychiatrist dr lightner under oath has denied it now you may be skeptical but remember that inspector terrells opinion that they were having an affair was stricken as speculation which means that as a matter of law this alleged relationship has not at all been proved has anything proved that mrs witt and her psychiatrist were intimate at any time the answer again is no he paused lowering his voice no nothing and after the interview with lightner freeman could assert this with conviction freeman walked to the defense table and took a sip of water raising his eyes for a moment he briefly took in the gallery seeing if he still held them as well satisfied or nodding as if he was he turned back to the jury box raising a finger again nevertheless although we do not have to prove anything we will demonstrate to you how easily mr alvarez could have been within the meaning of reasonable doubt how he could have been and indeed was mistaken in his identification of mrs witt as the woman who went running off after the shots further and finally we will show you evidence powerful compelling incontrovertible evidence that jennifer witt could not have killed larry and matthew because in fact she was not in her house when the shots were fired she could not have been there just as this court found that there was insufficient evidence to prove that jennifer witt had killed her first husband ned hollis there is none to prove that she killed her second or for gods sake her child he pointed a finger for the last time at jennifer there sits a woman who truly has been wrongly accused a victim not a criminal mrs witt is more than legally just not guilty she is in truth and in fact an innocent woman in his bleaker moments hardy wondered if it was something in the san francisco air he had often heard that there was supposed to be something some mold or spoor or other magical substance in the local salttinged windy ether that was responsible for some of the wonderful gastronomic delights of the city sourdough bread and italian dry salami for example but he found himself wondering if there was a less benign side to it some as yet undefined parasite or chemical or meteorological phenomenon that produced hope at the outset of an endeavor only to dash it before it could be realized witness the giants had a team ever come so far only to crash and burn just enough to fall short by one game you could talk all you wanted about their sore pitching arms and lack of basic team character but it was damn tempting to blame the air here it was october and hardy wasnt watching san franciso in the playoffs and back when the giants had been ten games ahead at the allstar break hed also entertained the belief that jennifer would be acquitted now he worried that that was another dashed hope like the pennant for in spite of david freemans antics and experience in spite of his other dudes in spite of the victory in the ned hollis portion of the trial even in spite of freemans really brilliant crossexaminations of the prosecutions major eyewitnesses florence barbieto and anthony alvarez he believed now that they were probably losing with the lightner business being introduced despite davids best efforts to neutralize it the wind had seemed to go out of the defenses sails of course freeman would never admit defeat or the likelihood of it and he was doing his best to keep the ship sailing but the ballast the weight of all of jennifers apparent lies now seemed to be just too much there was a scrambling feel to the defense now a sense that all the arguments and pyrotechnics werent leading to the truth werent in the service of justice despite freemans arguments the jury wasnt going to vote your way if you didnt convince them there was an alternate truth that perhaps they just werent seeing for a while even he had believed in the possibility of an alternate truth that might be convincing he thought the jury would too and what was reasonable doubt if it wasnt that now maybe it was after all something in the air but like the giants and their sore arms freeman had started well but with the failure to come up with at least one convincing other dude and the bombshell about lightner and jennifer well he feared the season could be over on monday jennifer was escorted into the courtroom by david freeman on one side and the bailiff on the other as opposed to the fashionable clothes she had been wearing throughout she wore a maroon runners outfit and some hightech tennis shoes her hair was tied back in a ponytail and hardy thought she looked about seventeenyearsold when villars ascended to the bench she immediately noticed the change and frowned mr freeman would you approach hardy watched his partner chatting with the judge nodding gesturing voices didnt get raised and in a minute freeman was back at the defense table smiling what could she do he said freeman called lisa jennings the other jogger who was dressed identically to jennifer the gallery caught it and villars rapped her gavel a couple of times calling for order lisa did not look exactly like the defendant but in their matching outfits with their hair cut the same freeman had paid lisa to cut hers there was no denying the similarity lisa was a little thinner and an inch or two taller but they were both mediumboned attractive blonde women in their twenties hardy thought freeman shouldnt have lisa say a word he should just call alvarez and see what happened but freeman could no more do that than he could whistle with a mouth full of thumb tacks though hardy had warned freeman often and vigorously that lisas testimony could be chopped up and masticated by powell still the old dog wanted to introduce it to the jury itll ring true he had told hardy you wait and in fact he was right lisas testimony itself stopping at the house hearing the shots running off after a minute or so all of it did ring true the problem as hardy had argued again and again was that even if it had happened they had no way to prove it had happened on december and powell no surprise did not seem inclined to let that omission slide ms jennings how often do you run down olympia way in the course of say a month several days a week id say she may have been nasty to hardy when he had first tried to corral her but lisa came across as a cooperative even friendly person now that she was here committed she wanted to please maybe fifteen twenty times a month and youve been doing that for how long a couple of years id say almost three so you run by mrs witts house what about two hundred times something like that yes and do you keep a log of where youve gone on which days which route youve run lisa looked at freeman then back at powell no i just run so you dont know for a fact when you heard these noises on olympia way that youve just testified about do you well i only heard them once two noises like gunshots yes powell nodded taking his time he looked over at the jury his face showing a question mark i see and hearing these gunshots did you report them to the police no lisa rolled her shoulders moving in the seat why not i dont know i guess i didnt think they were gunshots wideeyed wonder broke out over powell oh why didnt you think they were im not sure i guess that at the time i thought they were backfires or something could they have been backfires freeman trying to save her stood up and objected but before he could even give grounds powell withdrew the question but came right back youve mentioned the phrase at the time this was on december last year is that right again lisa looked at freeman i didnt say that no you didnt thats why i ask powell smiled a gentleman only trying to get to the truth of the matter take your time i dont really know what day it was the wonder appeared again but surely it was last winter i think it was i know it was several months ago might it have been longer your honor counsel is badgering this witness freeman was standing but he was going to lose and he knew it he did i dont think so villars said overruled might it have been longer ago powell asked again mildly suddenly lisas voice rose to a nearshout i dont know when it was shocked by what shed done she stared at powell then at the jury finally she apologized to the judge and repeated in a nearwhisper i dont know when it was thank you ms jennings i have no further questions it was getting to the end freeman had been intending to call alvarez and get him to point at the two women lisa and jennifer in the back of the courtroom at least demonstrate to the jury that a mistake in identifying one or the other would have been possible in a sense having lisa simply appear accomplished the same result although in hardys opinion it was nowhere near the victory he had been hoping for when he waited those mornings out in his car on the offchance that lisa would go jogging by now with powells undoing of the mistaken identity argument alvarez would not be called they were down to the atm their last hope no one was exactly asleep but it was a monday afternoon and even hardy who had memorized the numbers and carefully honed the theory to its present form had to admit that this was the kind of testimony that reminded him of his afterlunch high school physics class the one he had largely slept through freeman was up with isabel reed the young black woman who had been so taken with abe glitsky when he and hardy had gone to visit her at the bank of america half a year or more ago in the course of a couple of interviews the matter of the threeminute difference in times had come up and freeman had brought it home strongly to ms reed so that on her own without a direct question from him she should not bring up the discrepancy he wasnt sure but it was possible it could get her in trouble this made hardy uncomfortable but again he got overridden freeman contended that if the prosecution knew about it and wanted to talk about it theyd deal with it then but they wouldnt feed them the extra three minutes they might need them when he had ms reed on the stand freeman had introduced jennifers own atm receipt and a copy of the bank of americas confirming report solid physical evidence that at bank of america time jennifer witt had been standing at the automated teller machine getting some spending money they were looking at a blownup poster that had been set up next to the witness chair it was a portion of a map of san francisco showing the route from olympia way down clarendon into the haightashbury district the route jennifer told hardy she had taken that morning on friday one of freemans witnesses had been officer gage again he had been induced to talk about the distance from the witt home to the bank the shortest route along the streets al long semicircle around the ucsf medical center now outlined in red for the jurys benefit it really had nothing to do with ms reeds direct testimony but freeman thought he saw a way to get in what he wanted and he wasnt going to let a little thing like that bother him his face assumed its most perplexed expression ms reed lets look at this map for a moment you may have heard officer gage the other day testify that you branch is miles form mrs witts home yes freeman kept frowning trying to figure this out he said miles does that seem right to you your honor powell rose well stipulate that the red line represents miles stick to it mr freeman villars said somewhat ambiguously whats your point now the door was open freeman smiled im glad to explain your honor he turned back to ms reed youve said that mrs witt accessed her account at precisely thats right well weve heard a witness mrs barbieto say that mrs witt was home that she heard her a couple of minutes before she called the police at im just wondering if you are sure about your time it was ms reed said she was welldressed selfassured confident a good believable witness with a document the computer printout showing the exact time that jennifer had accessed her account to back her up it was in other words ms reed just to touch all the bases and your honor freeman smiled up at the bench this is the point ive been laboring to make weve got a picture of jennifer witt at her house at which is in mrs barbietos words a couple of minutes before she called at and we are expected to believe that five minutes later she was at her atm machine having covered a distance of miles this played very well the jurors were struck by it as hardy had hoped they would be behind him he heard a satisfying low buzz in the courtroom even villars doing the math in her head seemed to be impressed all might not be lost after all the prosecution could not have it both ways either jennifer left before the shots in which case she obviously could not have done the killings or she had left later in which case she couldnt have made it to the bank but she had made it to the bank so she hadnt killed anybody in fact freeman continued even if it had taken mrs barbieto ten minutes to call after the shots that moves jennifers time back to but he shots werent at either because the federal express driver fred rivera was there at at least freeman was rolling in his enthusiasm making a closing argument and for some reason dean powell was letting him do it hardy looked over at the das table and his stomach tightened the man was smiling the judge wasnt stopping freeman either he just rolled on and on paying no attention now to the witness speaking directly to the jury lets even for the sake of argument say that jennifer was home upstairs when fred rivera was there lets say larry and matt were shot within a minute of that at if she left immediately or within a minute as anthony alvarez has said she did then jennifer would have had to cover miles in ten minutes this is a pace of better than a sixminute mile which is almost a dead sprint for a real athlete jennifer witt just could not have done it villars caught for a moment in the rhetoric came back to herself she sent a hard look at powell no doubt hardy thought wondering why powell was letting the defense get away with that without objecting but he prosecutor didnt react to her gaze freeman was walking to his seat and powell was actually rising straightening his jacket combing his hair with his fingers a man on his way to a party ms reed powell began do you know if the clock on your atm your automatic teller is accurate hardy leaned across jennifer he knows he whispered to freeman how could he know freeman shook his head tightening his mouth jennifer said what and he patted her hand ms reed gave it a valiant try im not sure i understand the question accurate you mean does it keep accurate time itd say yes thats not exactly what i meant powell smiled at her then turned to the jury weve just heard so much about time in this trial the federal express computer the dispatcher your own atm machine that i wonder if you know these are all connected by some big computer or someshuch ms reed no fool knew where this was going but there wasnt anything she could do about it if she was going to get in trouble then she was she definitely wasnt going to lie under oath it came out powell of course feigned shock do you mean to tell me that the defense knew about this threeminute gap and we listened to all this hoopla from mr freeman and he never saw fit to mention it villars hardy thought was almost smiling and that was chilling in her eyes it seemed powell had just vindicated himself yes why didnt you bring it up didnt it seem important well it did but mr freeman had said i might get in trouble mr freeman said you might get in trouble yes how could you get in trouble i dont know with the police maybe thats what mr freeman said anyway hardy covered his eyes with his hands for a minute it occurred to him that it didnt look good to do that but in lieu of a hole to crawl in it seemed a reasonable second choice powell pushed on so with the threeminute difference weve got a thirteenminute run dont we or a pace that makes a sevenandahalfminute mile which is fast but nowhere near requiring a trained athlete i dont know ms reed was near tears either from fear or from anger at being placed in this position objection but villars just pointed her gavel dont you dare mr freeman she said powell waited naturally pleased with the ruling then continued since the defense had brought this poster up here lets use it for a minute shall we youve testified about this famous miles is that right yes but look here this red line skirts the property of the ucsf medical center are you familiar with these grounds yes theyre just up the street i eat lunch there sometimes you mean theyre not closed off to the public anybody can walk through them i do all the time ms reed would you mind taking the red marker weve been using and draw a line through the grounds of the medical center so that the jury can see it everyone in the courtroom was watching it was almost a straight line form the midtown terrace playground at the end of of olympia down to parnassus street and is this a level area ms reed objection i dont think so villars said again no sir its all uphill or downhill from olympia way yes so powell concluded if you ran through the medical center you had only to cover a halfmile of ground as the crow flies and all of it downhill even if the defendant had left her house at she could almost have walked it by friday hardy was going crazy sitting in his office or strolling down to freemans or going by the jail to talk to jennifer or looking into store windows waiting for the verdict was its own special hell and if they lost the case would become his and his alone it had begun really to sink in that freeman wouldnt even be there in the courtroom with him anymore there was no reason for him to be freeman had been the guiltphase attorney and win or lose his job was now over he would write his appeal if necessary try for a new trial or a reversal but as far as the courtroom was concerned freeman would play no more active role when freeman had first asked him to be keenan counsel the attorney for the penalty phase of the trial hardy had not fully realized its implications he should have he told himself now he alone would have the responsibility of convincing the same jury that convicted her if it did that jennifer should not go to the gas chamber that there were factors in mitigation it would be his job to tell the jury what those factors might be but of course all this led back to his belief now that the jury might find her guilty it wasnt he felt that the prosecution had done such a bangup job proving that shed killed her husband and accidentally in some undocumented fashion her son nor he was convinced had freeman been inept in spite of what hardy considered to be his occasional lapses of judgment no if the jury convicted jennifer it would be because they had become convinced that she was selfish cold a liar who stole from and cheated on her husband a woman who mostly had shown anger rather than contrition exactly the sort of human being who would do what jennifer had been accused of and the source of much of hardys angst now if the jury believed jennifer was such a coldblooded person they could also not implausibly believe that she deserved the ultimate penalty hardy had asked frannie if she could leave the kids with erin for a couple of hours and have lunch with him and now they were standing at phyllis station outside freemans office making small talk waiting on freeman who had invited himself along when the telephone rang on phyllis desk david freeman she said formally her standard response to incoming calls then listened lips pursed nodding once or twice thank you hanging up apparently forgetting the presence of hardy and frannie she pushed the button on her intercom mr freeman the jurys coming in the gallery had filled up with media representatives in a remarkably short time hardy finagled a space for frannie next to a reporter he knew on the aisle in the second row jennifer was escorted in and brought to the defense table she was wearing a white blouse and tan wraparound skirt with low heels freeman patted her hand though she seemed not to notice sitting without expression showing no emotion when villars directed her to she stood at attention staring straight ahead flanked by freeman on her right and hardy on her left the judge took the paper from the clerk read it carefully handed it to the clerk as to the first count we the members of the jury find the defendant jennifer lee witt guilty of the murder of larry witt in the first degree with special circumstances hardy felt his stomach churn halfturning he noticed that jennifers reaction was the one he would have predicted none no not quite a muscle on the side of her jaw was moving but otherwise she might have been waiting for a streetlight to change he glanced at the jury box they were seeing it too a cold woman they must be thinking behind them in the gallery there was an insistent buzz but villars after a perfunctory tap with her gavel was bent on the job at hand as to the second count the clerk read we the members of the jury find the defendant guilty of the mrder of matthew witt in the first degree with special circumstances freeman was holding her elbow she did not appear to need the assistance im not going to break im not going to let them break me they beat on you every way every day and their satisfaction is watching you fall apart then you break down you beg them to give you another chance youll do better anything you want youll change and be different and you wont even be yourself anymore if they would only stop making you hurt which is all the time now especially since matt but im not going to let them anymore crying doesnt help it never helped with larry with ned with ken even with these lawyers they think its an act anyway if i show how i feel they dont know and even if they did they wouldnt care why do i want to convince everybody of what that im not a monster why should i bother of course they found me guilty they always have i am guilty in a way i am to blame for getting myself to here for becoming who i am empty used up you let them beat on you long enough eventually who you really are that person goes away hides well i wont give them that satisfaction anymore thats something maybe a start i honestly didnt think theyd convict freemans hair was all over the place in the lateafternoon wind the sky was a thick gray blanket over the steps in front of the hall hardy had his arm around his wife who was feeling sick her hand clutched to her stomach she had waited in the courtroom until it had cleared until hardy had come out after going into the private suite with freeman and jennifer where jennifer hadnt wanted to talk about anything at least not with freeman she told freeman a smile of fury on her face that he was lucky he had made her pay up front if she had known he was going to lose wasnt he supposed to be the best he told her it wasnt over yet of course that was her understandable reaction but hed be working on the appeal there were grounds hardy had listened to part of it then excused himself he would talk to jennifer later without freeman and came out to frannie she wanted to go home but freeman caught them on the steps wanting more post mortem he was still fighting the case he was going to appeal it came down to the three minutes hardy felt he had to say something that was my fault i thought it was a big deal freeman hit him on the arm thats bullshit he said the whole thing was my show dont kid yourself i mean i should have walked the route myself if there was any way in the world she could have got to that bank in five minutes instead of eleven it was my responsibility to have found out how too many eggs in that basket he pulled his jacket more tightly around him anyway i can probably get a new trial villars should have stopped this one after she granted my whistling in the dark hardy had a hard time imagining that freeman wanted to go through this exercise again he also doubted whether as a matter of law freeman was right but he really preferred not to get into that instead he said maybe you should have crossed lightner thats when it went south if they were having an affair we could have made the case that he had as good a motive as she did freeman shook his head if he said and if we could prove it and if he hadnt had an alibi which he did not to mention he pretty much convinced me he just wouldnt do that no im afraid lightner just gave jennifer a better motive diz the less the jury saw of him the better frannie finally spoke up guys please im really not feeling good dismas she looked at freeman sorry david i cant handle this very well jennifer did not do this how could they have found her guilty a gust whipped between them stopping what freeman was starting to say reconsidering forced to really see her expression at last he moved closer and put an arm out encircling them both go on home frannie get some rest diz go on you two go on home in the car frannie was crying quietly hardy had the windshield wipers going in the drizzle she held his hand in both of hers on her lap youre more upset than she was frannie shook her head no she was just holding up trying to hold herself together hardy glanced across well shes some kind of superhuman holderupper then nodding frannie said that she had to be she did not kill matt dismas she didnt kill larry either i still believe that hardy looked over at his wife he squeezed both her hands not knowing what to say john lescroart before she had known that the jury would be coming in that day frannie had made plans for the weekend she knew that her husband would probably want to stick around hang out with freeman discuss and analyze and worry she didnt think that would be wise so when they got home from picking up rebecca and vincent at grandmas although she still felt sick to her stomach she helped dismas pack the car and then got him in the passenger seat and drove north for ninety minutes up to the small town of occidental near the russian river she had rented adjoining rooms in the old union hotel where there was nothing to do except eat huge plates of homestyle italian food and drink in the bar and dance to country music and in the soggy daytime drive around some more looking at redwoods and water and playing with your children in spite of her own feelings she gave dismas until they got to san rafael about thirtyfive minutes to get out all of his frustrations and impressions about the trial and verdict and plans for the upcoming penalty phase right now they were having a family weekend the penalty phase would take over their lives soon enough this was an opportunity for some quality in their lives she had gone to some lengths to arrange it and she was going to demand it for herself for her children for her man the rest of the world could wait until monday hardy knew it was one of the reasons he loved her she did things like that his own inclination was to keep pushing and pushing until something gave but she had taught him on a couple of occasions that sometimes it didnt hurt to back up a step and look at the direction you were pushing a different angle of perspective might get more accomplished he had originally planned to go right up and talk with jennifer but on monday morning marginally refreshed from the food and simple beauty of the north coast although he hadnt slept much he found that sometime over the weekend he had decided to call on ken lightner lightner had been not exactly a thorn but a presence since the beginning in any event his involvement was greater than hardy had originally suspected and he wanted to get to the bottom of it if he could not only that he was considering the battered wife issue again he felt he had to the jury had decided that jennifer had killed larry and matt but he thought they might be persuaded that she wasnt a coldblooded killer deserving execution if they knew how often andor how badly she had been beaten it was worth a try he didnt have much else lightner had sounded pleased perhaps relieved to hear from him maybe he felt ostracized since the allegation of the affair had come out and they hadnt wanted to bring him to the fore because his relationship with jennifer could appear to give her one more reason to get rid of her husband the office was across from stern grove in a large mixeduse apartment complex called cleverly the grove it was a glass and brownshingle contemporary building surrounded by trees the parking lot on this morning halffilled with a disproportionate sprinkling of highend german automobiles rent here wouldnt be cheap in spite of a morning sun autumn was in the air after he had parked hardy stood a minute by his car arrested by the scents of eucalyptus and wood smoke although where the smoke came from was a mystery no one was supposed to burn anything outdoors anymore it was illegal lightners office seemed to take up most of one of the backcorner modules hardy rang waited was buzzed in he walked down a long hallway of muted color there were six or eight nonrepresentational framed things works of art on the walls lightners bulky frame appeared in the light at the end of the hall mr hardy he said welcome hardy shook hands and was introduced to helga lightners secretary the reception area was bigger than it had to be but still somehow cozy the two couches were overstuffed there was an easychair and ottoman in hot orange yellow blue and black the only brightness in the office helga herself she preferred she said helga to ms or miss brun was about forty and wore no rings she had a low black desk the surface of which was clean except for a green felt blotter a low shelf held a typewriter no computer here with what hardy took to be a sixline business phone and intercom set up next to it helga asked if they would like coffee and both said they would lightner led the way to his consulting office a room that was small but warmer than the reception area it wasnt pastel for one thing done in greens leathers carved woods and glass it was restful its windows looking out onto one of the older groves sunlight coming through the trees hardy avoided the couch and took one of the two leather armchairs lightner left the door to helgas area open and sat in a chair by the door ill come right to it hardy began you went to costa rica for a week and stayed with jennifer he figured he didnt have to say anything more lightner frowned are we going through this again i thought id covered this with mr freeman freeman somewhere in the back of his mind hardy figured he must have known this though hed never made the overt connection yes freeman must have talked to lightner he had said right after the trial that lightner had convinced him he hadnt done anything wrong with jennifer been intimate with her at the time right after the trial and the verdict it had gone right by him and just like freeman not telling him about jennifer being guilty of killing ned he hadnt reported to him about this interview with lightner either typical david the psychiatrist nodded so now what mr hardy now you too want some assurance i was not violating every code in the book and having sex with my patient the burden of saving jennifer had been buiding steadily on hardy or probably he wouldnt have resorted to the extreme ply he was now about to try dr lightner your patient and i gather friend jennifer told me otherwise of course she hadnt but if it would smoke out some mitigation for her some alternative lightner looked shocked then saddened mr hardy i find it hard to believe that i really do im sorry but if indeed jennifer did say this well there are psychological reasons but you would only say they were selfserving i tell you that i did not have intimate relations with my patient i testified to that i believe i thought mr freeman believed me hardy shrugged feeling increasingly uneasy about what he was doing so where does that leave us dr lightner youve wanted to help jennifer and believe me id love it if you could so lightner stood and crossed the room he opened a door that led out to a patio motioning to hardy who got up and followed outside lightner walked a few steps into the grove then turned ill take a polygraph if youd like you know how much i care about jennifer but i cant have it said ive been intimate with a patient taking advantage of the relationship im sorry but jennifer is just not telling the truth finally hardy relented sorry its me who isnt telling the truth it was a bad try okay heres what happened just as i told mr freeman he and jennifer had stayed in the same hotel room in costa rica because when lightner had arrived she had become scared all over again realizing that she hadnt run that far if he could be there on such short notice she had felt vulnerable alone checking out of her own room thinking she would be leaving no paper trail it stretched hardys belief to the breaking point but the explanation was plausible if foolish from lightners point of view still people did foolish things it could have happened the way lightner told it and now hardy felt he needed lightner if he was going to have any real chance to save his clients life and he had to think of it that way freemans appeal working out was not to be counted on between answering the phone helga had managed to bring the coffee they were back in their chairs more relaxed now though not totally allies lightner had not been impressed or pleased with hardy lying to him he said still they were on middle ground working for the same result they didnt after all have to be pals hardy sat with his coffee perched on his knee what do you personally think is the situation here doctor what do you mean i mean what in your gut do you believe i believe her mr hardy but as ive said if she did it she was driven to it its not a frivolous defense you know placing his cup and saucer on the low table next to him lightner turned toward hardy and leaned forward in the chair hands folded ive said this all along ive never understood mr freemans concept he was obeying his clients wishes about the abuse the same thing youd do hardy wasnt about to listen to lightner criticize anybody his own judgment after all was a long way from exemplary but the fact remains he lost and jennifer loses he held up a hand my point is that he could have called several witnesses myself included who might at least have planted the seed did you visit any of jennifers past physicians at hardys nod he continued okay then you know there was abuse and there were more people people ive talked to her own mother for example an abused person as well as you may know even helga has seen jennifer come in here staggering with the pain limping it was a classic situation larry witt was literally beating her to death but jennifer told freeman she ordered him not to get into that he should have overridden her he was her lawyer his job was to clear her not allow her to be convicted she is a victim mr hardy hardy raised his voice she would have fired him dont you understand that lightner sat back his face working and why is that if she admits she was beaten to her its the same as admitting she killed larry and if she killed larry thats admitting she killed matt she doesnt have to admit anything does she lighter said you can call all those people as witnesses cant you get them to talk about what theyve seen with jennifer maybe nothing overtly even about larry i could come on as an expert witness ive done it before this kind of denial is common i wouldnt have to talk specifically about things jennifer told me id just discuss the syndrome and then let the jury make the connection that she killed larry because he beat her theyve already convicted her it cant hurt her any worse and it might help show the jury what shes been through it might if nothing else move them to some sympathy this woman has done nothing but suffer her whole life maybe you can end the cycle lightner shook his head god this is a travesty yes it is hardy said lightner walked him out to his car as hardy opened the door lightner reached into his wallet and took out a card i expect to talk to her today as ive been doing but i want you to feel free to call me anytime if you feel i can help you if i can come in with you and perhaps try to convince her to agree with a defense anything at all im always here you dont go home lightners face lit in a brittle smile my exwife and children have the home ive a space behind the office he motioned back to the building bedroom kitchen and whatever i was able to keep but its all right im getting along shrinks have a notoriously high divorce rate were often better with other peoples lives than with our own mr hardy it was phyllis on the intercom theres an emmett kelly down here to see you hardy pushed his files away smiling send him up a minute later abe glitskys form filled the doorway i couldnt resist he said he walked across the room and looked down onto sutter street then turned back and plumped himself halfway over the couch laying his head against the armrest i think ill take the afternoon off get in a nap naps are rare among the ranks of homicide inspectors i should do a study you should hardy agreed but in the meanwhile glitsky sat up in the meanwhile i have made an ass of myself yet again in your behalf although i realized on friday the horse got out of the barn i thought id make sure it all got covered so i went out to see the romans told them we were finishing up some paperwork and you found out glitsky grinned his horrible grin the scar through his lips stretched white the eyes with no mirth in them i found out that they have no idea what either or both of them were doing on the monday after christmas last year which is the worst possible news for you why is that because glitsky held up a finger lecturing if they had spent any time being guilty and thinking up an alibi i believe they would have remembered it and trotted it out thats what guilty folks do as it was they just looked at each other glitsky stood they had no clue diz theres nothing there by this time it was getting to be no surprise well at least i feel like ive covered the bases then remembering the other thing hed been meaning to put to his friend you filed a report on that visit to the bank we made didnt you the threeminute thing glitsky had gone over to the dart board and was coming back to hardys desk having pulled out hardys nearperfect round sure i was on duty i thought terrell could use it why hardy shrugged just following up glitsky threw and the first dart hit the wall a foot below the board these are heavy he said my kids darts dont throw like these twenty grams hardy grimaced at the hollow sound at the hole in the wall another dart flew smacking the wallboard high and wide of the target theyre made out of tungsten theyre pretty good darts glitsky fired the last one it grazed the bottom of the board before sticking again in the wall the inspector headed for the door stopping when he got there i dont know he said i think they might be broke then he was gone he was almost through the first and had another four working days villars had given everyone a week off before the penalty phase was to begin hardy was grateful for the prep time but the probable reason for it galled him powell was in the stretch run for his election and it seemed villars was cutting him some slack he couldnt of course prove it but that didnt make him any less suspicious freeman hadnt been to the office either which was just as well he was sick to death of freeman and his histrionics he was also sick of himself of his waffling every chance hed got hed backed off in the face of the older mans resolve and personality half a dozen times he should have just stood his ground said this was what was what and take it or leave it but partly hed wanted to believe that freeman was right and would prevail partly because if freeman won he wouldnt have the burden of trying to save jennifers life he had wanted so badly to get out from under the responsibility that hed convinced himself that freemans strategies would likely work he had been whipping himself over his own deficiencies time and again he had driven from olympia way down to haight street trying to find a shortcut that would undermine his argument about jennifer getting to the bank but through it all ran a common thread he had believed he had never questioned that jennifer had run where she said she had at least she had run on paved streets he had dutifully consulted his map no hed convinced himself there was no flaw even if jennifer had taken a slightly shorter route as long as she stayed on the streets she could not have made it to the bank and also killed larry now he realized he had ignored ucsf medical center about ten square blocks of campus and buildings at the base of mount sutro between jennifers home and her bank he had seen it of course he knew it was there but he had never gotten out of his car and walked through it on the map it looked impenetrable a dense maze of impassable structures the huge medical buildings gave the impression of a fortress not a park anyone could simply stroll through it did have a wall why did he think it was solid without gates why didnt he get out and stroll through and look because he was too clever for his own good and freemans and most important jennifers all his careful calculations about time and distance and how jennifer couldnt possibly have made it to the bank and accessed her account when she did and still get back home in time to commit the crimes didnt really signify what he had been convinced they did he had set freeman up for powells devastating rebuttal and that in his opinion even more than freemans ego and tactical blunders had cost them the verdict hardy had always in theory at least considered himself more or less in the deathpenalty camp he didnt pretend it was a deterrent what it did do though was eliminate the possibility that the person who was executed was going to kill another innocent citizen either when they got out on parole or if they were doing life without parole during their life behind bars he had favored what he called the mosquito argument if you killed a mosquito that bit you you at least guaranteed that that particular mosquito wasnt going to bite you again other mosquitos didnt have to know about it and tell each other and get deterred if another one bit you you killed that one too that way at least you had less mosquitos in the population but he knew jennifer she was not a mosquito he understood why she had done what she had done if she had done it and he didnt think she should get the death penalty for that here he knew at least generally speaking he was getting on shaky ground every murderer had somebody who knew him or her somebody who understood that theyd had a lousy childhood or whatever it was that had made them believe it was somehow okay to kill as an expression of rage or frustration the flip side to that of course was that the victims also had people who had loved them whose lives were ruined and hearts broken what about them to say nothing of the victims themselves they didnt ask to be victims did they they had done nothing wrong and now they were dead and generally thats where hardy drew the line the people who made innocent people dead deserved to die hardy believed that at some point adults in society had to take responsibility for what they were for who theyd become if as grownups theyd turned into killers they didnt deserve any breaks adios you had your chance and you blew it it was a tragedy all around there was no denying that it was a tragedy that children got atrociously bad starts in life that people turned out bad but it was the world it was a worse wrong a worse tragedy to keep giving bad people the opportunity to do truly bad things again and again but what about someone like jennifer who had two husbands who beat her whose life had been a living hell where did she fit in the next morning as he was gathering his things getting ready to go to the jail to see jennifer the telephone rang mr hardy this is donna bellows with goldberg mullen amp roake as soon as she said the name hardy recognized the sultry voice ms bellows the lawyer who had referred jennifer to freeman was another lead he probably hadnt followed up enough another unreturned call that he hadnt pursued he said hello somewhat warily i found out about the verdict over the weekend and i was out of town yesterday but i realized i never called you back im sorry i suppose its too late now anyway its never too late if youve got something hardy said im sure david freemans working on the appeal right now well i dont think i have anything hardy waited finally he said whatever you do have ill take i did find out that crane amp crane was ybmgs law firm although what that means about larry witt bellows sighed over the telephone thats what i found too where i had heard the name again hardy waited ive had a busy few moths and ive had two secretaries quit on me and my files are a mess so i came in a couple of weeks ago and tried to get some of this cleaned up it should have been filed with larrys stuff but it wasnt in any event i cant imagine its of any importance what is it its an offering circular larry had sent it around to me with some questions but id been on vacation over christmas maybe thats why he called crane to answer the questions he did call them directly once from his home anyway well okay but by the time i saw it larry was dead im afraid that between my reaction to that and my other pressing business i just laid the circular aside larrys questions were moot by then anyway but it sounds like you got your answer remembering how foolish he had felt asking jody bachman what an lbo was hardy hesitated a moment but then went ahead the way to stay ignorant was not ask questions he admitted that he didnt really know what an offering circular was its pretty much what it says its a brochure outlining a stock offering in this case ybmg was reorganizing to change their notforprofit status i guess larry had some questions so he came to me then when i wasnt here he went to the horses mouth he wrote the word no under their phone number he probably decided he wasnt going to invest it doesnt look like it was much of a deal anyway so that was that hardy being thorough now asked if ms bellows would send him a copy of the circular so that he could look it over she said she would messenger it over that afternoon she was dressed in her reds her hair was all over the place the guards let her in and she stood arms crossed leaning back against the closed door she had asked hardy to bring her a pack of cigarettes and he shook out one and gave it to her san francisco county jail was officially a smokefree environment this created a cottage industry among the prisoners who smuggled in cigarettes and sold them the way they sold cocaine marijuana and heroin hardy just couldnt believe theyd bust jennifer convicted of murder and up for the death penalty for having a smoke in the attorneys conference room her eyes squinted against the smoke drilled into him now what she said now i think we talk about how larry beat you she squinted some more seemed to shrink into herself and thats why i killed him hardy nodded thats our best shot it always was he took a step toward her but she stared him back how are you holding up he asked gently she laughed briefly more like a bark then coughed choking on the smoke from her cigarette the small room was filling with smoke im real good she said real good i love being here tears filled her eyes overflowed onto her face she left them there hardy again tried to move forward but she held out her hand you stay away she turned a shoulder into the door and stood there shaking her body heaving trying to control the sobs the cigarette fell to the ground at her feet this isnt me after all the other scenes this was not an act she was talking to herself i cant have got to here hardy didnt know what to say or do he had some of the same reaction that this wasnt real they couldnt have gotten to here yet here they were one of the women guards looked in through the window leaning over slightly with no expression at all the two people in the room one crying and one standing might as well have been part of the furniture the guard ignored the cigarette smoke there was no point in pushing hardy took one of the chairs pulled it around backward and straddled it he crossed his arms over the back of the chair and waited eventually she had to sit down she turned her chair to the side resting an arm across the table i dont know why he needed to do that who larry she nodded i always tried to be a good wife a good mother but i know who i am i guess larry knew it too maybe better than i did he was trying to protect me from myself i think keep me from making mistakes and he wasnt mean like ned was even when he was mad he wasnt mean about it it was more like it was his job to do to keep you in line it wasnt every day you know most days sometimes for a couple of weeks nothing would happen but then it would just get to me this this feeling that if i didnt do something something for myself id go crazy a couple of times i think i did go crazy threw things tore up the house the anger just took over do you know what im talking about at all i realize it sounds pretty strange but you couldnt leave him she hit her fist on the table i didnt even want to leave him i loved larry and oh god i loved matt it wasnt the way it was with ned not at all i really hoped we would work it out someday this was hardy thought the straightest and saddest talk hed ever gotten out of her but if it was going to do them any good he had to get more im sorry to ask this jennifer but what about ken lightner it was as though she expected it nodding to herself i talked to him he told me about your lying to him about me saying wed slept together but im not going to pretend i dont feel something strong for ken i do she stared straight ahead for a long moment but no she said at last i wasnt going to leave larry and matt for him we talked about it it was okay i wanted to at first especially but that was just more of the same behavior ken said i should break the cycle dont do the wrong thing to begin with that way i wouldnt feel like i deserved to be punished what about him how do you think he feels about you she shrugged he thinks im attractive he told me that so i wouldnt think he was rejecting me her hands were crossed in her lap her head down her voice almost inaudible men find me attractive but once they get to know me they dont like me so much hes sticking with you all through this hardy said that counts i guess hardy took a breath this was the moment if we can talk about this talk about ken lay to rest the talk about your having an affair say exactly what youve just said to me how you just snapped and did some crazy things i think we might have a chance she just looked at him he spoke quietly we can get another shrink or even ken if you want to argue for leniency based on the stress you were under now shaking her head what no she said i told ken no hardy stopped what did she mean no thats again saying i killed them isnt it id be saying i just snapped one morning and killed them her body had straightened her head was up now eyes getting life back into them as soon as i say that then there really is no hope was this deja vu or deja deja vu hardy had been through this a million times if she didnt have something new to say the jury was going to vote the death sentence didnt she see that im not going to tell anybody ever that i killed larry hardy met her eyes defiant and hard he noticed she didnt include matt and before hadnt named him them she said she could say larry but not matt she might let people ned or larry control her up to a point but when she moved out from that control it was on her own it occurred to him too that she had changed over the past year maybe shed decided not only that she wasnt going to take it anymore with larry but with any other men as well shed just gotten assertive cured of the submissive streak that had allowed her to accept being beaten if she were getting better hardy was glad for her still he thought strategically it couldnt have come at a worse time what was he going to argue in front of the jury what could he say that might influence them at least to spare her life since he was in the building anyway he thought he would drop by dean powells office on the third floor see if he was putting in his time at his desk while he campaigned he was sitting alone reading what looked to be a police report powell started at hardys knock after the surprise the genial candidate appeared hardy come on in take a load off half out of his chair hand extended he could afford to be gracious after all he had won hows freeman not taking it too hard i trust i ought to give him a call congratulate him on a good fight hardy closed the door behind him he leaned back against it not moving toward the seat in front of the desk dean he began i want to be straight with you a minute off the record is that all right the smile remained but powells expression went a little sideways he sat back down sure mr hardy dismas is okay if dean is the smile flickered back hardy hadnt had much luck reading powell he couldnt really blame himself powell was in an unusual predicament on the one hand he wanted votes so badly that it was almost painful to watch on the other the two mens relationship was adversarial it must be awkward hardy thought to feel like your adversary might wind up voting for you to want your adversary to vote for you even to like you deans fine powell said i assume youre here about jennifer witt hardy nodded this is off the record he repeated i dont want this to be construed as a presentencing conference or anything formal and id prefer if what we say here doesnt leave this office you have my word hardy would rather have heard sure or okay or anything but you have my word which he thought clanged with insincerity if not downright duplicity still he was here and determined to press ahead i wanted to talk about the death penalty powell folded his hands in front of him on the desk all right he said mildly talk i dont think its just powell waited you and i both know that there are people out in the system with sheets a mile long that make jennifer look like a den mother and these guys are getting ten years for armed robbery with priors and serving six thats true its one of the reasons im running for ag thats got to stop we need more jail space we need tougher sentencing hardy didnt need the campaign speech dean my point is that going capital on jennifer witt is going overboard powell looked up at him a woman whos killed not one but two husbands he raised a palm to stop hardys argument we dont have to be legalistic dismas david freeman won that one in court sure but since were off the record we know the truth about that lets not kid ourselves this woman has twice plotted and killed in cold blood for money and in this second case also managed to kill her own son if that isnt a death penalty case i dont know what is hardy braced his foot back against the door have you talked to her one on one why would i want to do that maybe to get a handle on the fact that shes a human being powell sat back let me ask you one have you tried to visualize the crime can you imagine the kind of person who takes out a gun and shoots her husband at pointblank range and then turns and powell exploded in righteous anger and blows away her own child can you imagine that she didnt do that it wasnt like that powell slammed his desk coming halfway up onto his feet bullshit thats just what it was like the jury says thats what she did i proved it beyond a damned reasonable doubt gathering his control he sat himself down lowered his voice if you want to call such a person a human being youre welcome to but dont expect any tears from me or any mercy either there was a knock on the door and hardy stepped aside pulling it open it was art drysdale hardys old mentor the exofficio administrative boss of the office everything all right in here how you doin dismas were fine art powell said evenly everythings fine just a little disagreement among professionals drysdale looked from one man to the other raised a hand and closed the door again you really think she did it dont you you know her husband larry was beating her so what nobodys talking battered wife here freeman never did we should have i should have jennifer wouldnt allow it but she was wrong he almost said dead wrong she thought it would prejudice the jury make them think she was suing it as an excuse sitting down he gave powell as much as he could of the short version id just like you to consider if it was selfdefense bring it up in the penaltyphase ill consider it im not a monster hardy i cant bring it up ive just told you why you cant bring it up powell went all the way back in his chair looking up at the ceiling running his fingers through his mane the way he did he took a long moment running it around different ways finally he came down this is pretty goddamn sleazy im not dont try to lay this humanbeing guilt trip on me now hardy to tell the truth it was heavy enough deciding to go capital on this but ive played by the rules from the getgo i dont give a shit what spin you put on it were sitting here talking about circumventing the system and as far as im concerned this is an unethical conversation and its over right now powell was up out of his desk around it to the door he pulled it open ill see you in court he said not until hardys first reaction was that he needed a drink his stomach was in knots his breathing coming shallow he stayed thirsty until he got inside the door of lous then abruptly decided not it was still early in the afternoon and a drink or two now would end his day and he needed all the time he could get he was at his desk going over his options lightners motion to introduce de facto witnesses to jennifers pain and suffering at the hands of her husband wasnt bad might well garner some sympathy for her but as soon as jennifer saw the way the wind was blowing there and it wouldnt take long she would either go berserk in the courtroom or insist on testifying that no beatings took place so given that what was he going to do next monday if powells reaction was any indication jennifer hadnt won many hearts in the courtroom dressed in a way that separated her from the commoners for the most part sitting without expression at the defense table she hadnt testified on her own behalf another of freemans questionable decisions the package arrived messengered over from donna bellows grateful for the distraction hardy opened it little more than an envelope depressingly thin there was the letter from larry witt to donna bellows there was a covering letter to go with the offering circular finally there was the circular itself dear donna i wonder if you could take a look at the enclosed as you will see the ybmg is offering all doctors we are called providers in the brochure an option to buy into the new forprofit plan the shares are a nickel each and the tone of both the covering letter and the brochure is very negative theres slim to no chance that this is a worthwhile investment so why did they bother sending the thing out my concern is that the board has only given us three weeks to exercise the option and that they sent this circular now over christmas when so many providers are either on vacation or swamped with personal business at home i realize that most shares any individual can buy is so potentially the greatest personal exposure to any provider in the group is only but hardy abruptly stopped reading larry witt control freak extraordinaire was asking his twohundreddollaranhour lawyer to look into a maximum exposure issue of less than twenty dollars he must have read it wrong got the decimal misplaced he looked at the last line again the greatest personal exposure to any provider in the group is only shaking his head thinking what an absolute pain in the ass larry witt must have been hardy stood stretched and gave up for the day he went downstairs to watch the world series in the conference room maybe his side would win frannie had her feet up on the couch a book face down on her chest her eyes were on her husband and she was trying not to nod off no listen this is really interesting his wife shook her head anytime youve got to say that it isnt hardy put his paper down you used to be more fun she raised her eyebrows let me get this straight youre sitting in our living room on a balmy october night you didnt taste the fantastic dinner i made you didnt even want wine with it and for the last ten minutes you are reading to me along from some stock proposal that isnt worth anything anyway and im the one who used to be more fun he nodded a lot more i remember i know it cant be me frannie swung her feet to the ground patting her lap okay come here hardy crossed the room what am i going to do fran she still wont let me use the only thing that might save her i dont think youre right about it being the only thing that can save her its not just the beatings jennifers life with her husband was terrible but she didnt kill him dismas she never lied to me not even about ned she never denied to me about him she just didnt say she did it but she absolutely denied killing larry she had no reason to lie to me she avoided it in the case of ned hardy could think of at least one reason why jennifer might want to lie to frannie frannie was his wife he was jennifers lawyer it would be better if he believed she didnt kill larry and matt frannie went on this is not just an instinct you know or womans intuition although i wouldnt put that down if i were you youre forgetting what you proved never mind if she could have done it or not jennifer in fact did not run through the medical center it did take her probably fifteen minutes to get to her bank to five and that means she didnt kill anybody she had left her house she ran to the bank the way she told you she did talking about that morning telling me about it she volunteered the way shed come down clarendon through the victorians the old haight she talked about that how the neighborhood calmed her down you dont make that stuff up sometimes you do hardy thought but it wasnt a bad point so what you dismas hardy the person forget the lawyer what youve got to do if you really want to save her is to stop doubting her stop even considering that she might be guilty frannie they found her guilty that parts over her fingers felt good against his scalp now i say she did not kill larry and her boy i cant prove she didnt she did kill ned that was different not so different he said neds dead larrys dead frannie stood up and walked over to the fireplace she spent a minute rearranging the small herd of brass elephants that liked to graze there i still say youre thinking too much like a lawyer youre thinking what arguments you can make thats kind of my job fran she faced him im not attacking you dismas im telling you she did not do it thats reality not law not what the jury found its one reality fran yours damn it listen to me you want to argue and fight about words you go ahead but theres a major thing youre forgetting oh whats that sure go ahead get mad thats a real help hardy was mad he had gotten up found himself standing by the couch with his fists clenched he closed his eyes and took a breath okay im sorry what am i forgetting if jennifer didnt do it somebody else killed them and did it for a reason hardy was shaking his head ive been all through the possibilities there by myself with terrell and glitsky and freeman and the whole known universe then you missed something except if jennifer did do it how about that frannie didnt budge she didnt i think you know it and i know i know it powell got it wrong both ways i dont know that frannie was heading back through the dining room i feel like a glass of wine several you can join me or not i dont care the hit man the mood had mellowed some it was tenthirty and theyd finished most of a bottle of chardonnay hardy had run all the people with motives by frannie and finally they had arrived at frannies suggestion that one of these people although armed with an alibi for his or her personal time had hired someone to kill the family hardy shook his head dont you suspect a professional hit man would bring his own weapon you ever hear of a hit man shooting somebody with their own gun frannie had her legs over his on the couch she sipped her wine i dont know its not exactly my area of expertise plus how did he get in or out maybe he just walked is there a back door a window all im saying is it had to be someone someone besides jennifer the problem is fran even if i agree this takes us back to police work and they didnt find anybody else no hit man no nobody maybe abe hardy shook his head abe is a good guy but hes done on this one everybodys done its down to me frannie finished her wine and you dont have a lawyer argument thats going to save jennifer do you no she wont frannie shushed him she knew all that she reminded him okay then theres only one option left im listening youve got to find out who killed them hardy sensed that he and walter terrell werent friends anymore he had reached him by telephone at the homicide detail before nine the next morning and they had had a brief discussion after hardy had introduced himself saying he just had a couple of quick questions terrell had replied why dont you take your questions to somebody who gives a shit and then the inspector had hung up hardy held the receiver for a long minute until it started to beep at him okay he thought i can take a hint he had a problem nobody was going to talk to him terrell was the first indication but as he sat flipping though the interview folders and copies of police reports on his desk he realized that he had about run out of folks who might be willing to give him the time of day much less a substantive interview tom and phil distephano forget it nancy too scared and rightly so the romans he could go get in cecils face but there was no leverage even if he had a grounded suspicion which he didnt there was sam the gay receptionist at the mission hills clinic but that could get awkward and was still once removed from any even remotely potential suspect hardy went downstairs again watched more world series action drank a cup of coffee and schmoozed with phyllis david freeman was in his office this morning but had a client with him and phyllis wouldnt interrupt not that hardy wanted her to it looked like another murder case by the way hed been working while hed been at home she had typed the first papers on the witt appeal this morning the everspinning wheels of the law depressing him hardy went back upstairs he threw darts the numbers falling the clock ticking the only human being left was ali singh the office manager at ybmg hardy thought hed take him out to lunch see if there was any other avenue he hadnt explored regarding larry witts work maybe he had stolen another doctors patients singhs avowal that larry had been popular with his fellow workers on reflection just didnt seem to be possible the man had been difficult with everyone and all work environments created frictions at least it was worth a shot not to mention that it was the only shot hardy had except that singh no longer worked there do you have a forwarding number the efficient voice said they werent allowed to give out that information which hardy had somehow known was coming its very important the voice was sorry there was nothing it could do hardys karma on a negative course okay then how about this how about i give you my name and number and you call mr singh and ask him if hed like to call me back i may be able to do that the voice said ill check assistant district attorney and candidate for attorney general dean powell and his boss chris locke were having lunch together at a corner table fiftytwo floors above san francisco in the carnelian room at the top of the bank of america building powell had asked for the lunch the special was santa barbara rock shrimp risotto and both the attorney and his boss the da had ordered it powell had decided he wanted a half bottle of meursault to go with it locke wasnt having any until it was poured and then he allowed himself to be talked into a glass they did not click their glasses together the upcoming election was now less than two weeks away and powell was leading the pack of contenders in the latest poll by four percentage points after a few minutes of chatter about that powell came to the point filling locke in on hardys visit to his office the one he had promised not to talk about when he had finished locke said hes only been with freeman how long and hes pulling this course hes capable of doing it all on his own powell nodded its pretty transparent he stabbed a shrimp he tells me his client wont let him bring it up but nevertheless its the truth and im a cretin if i dont believe him still though dean this issue has been floating around since the beginning of course theres little doubt the woman was hit a few times but its nowhere in the record yes it is dean at least once not with larry not with the second husband a bit annoyed perhaps only impatient locke snapped i know who larry is then whats he doing with it hardy i mean well thats just it he says jennifer has forbidden him to bring it up in open court he say why powell shrugged she says it gives her a reason to have killed larry and she didnt do it shes feathering her bed for the appeal locke finished his short glass of wine and powell poured him a little more to which he did not object thats how i read it too shes just stonewalling and shes smart figuring if she admits to being beaten shes admitting to the murders i dont think she killed anybody because she was being beaten locke said right she did it for the money twice powell looked out over the sparkling city the view clear to napa he sipped at his own wine i just wanted to alert you i think you can expect a personal call from mr hardy calling on you to tap those reserves of sympathy for which you are so justly famous locke never able to stand hardy allowed himself a small smile he brushed his lips with his napkin if its not in the record it doesnt exist dean thats how i run my office always have powell was satisfied yes sir i know he nodded locke held out his glass for the last drops of the mersault and powell poured at least hardy had found a couple of questions he hadnt yet asked it gave him a glimmer of hope not that this particular question what was in the federal express package andor who sent it appeared to have much to do with the matter but it might at this point he was considering a might of resounding relevance the files were piled in a halfcircle around the periphery of his desk in places a foot high the other consideration that had occurred was phil distephanos coworkers glitsky had told him about the redneck feel of the plumbers workplace hardy thought it was at least possible that here from a pool of bluecollar workers might surface a moonlighter who augmented his hourly wage by a subspecialty in taking people out again this was the long shot to end them all who said bluecollar workers were disposed to professional killings and besides plumbers were not exactly economically depressed but what else did he have if he was going on the assumption that frannies feelings convictions were accurate which he now was then he had to have missed something when the telephone rang now it startled him he had been trying to figure out a way to contact one of phils friends hi i think one of your coworkers might be killing people on the side anybody talk about anything like that unlikely hello mr hardy is it the welcome voice of ali singh to that he was likely to know anything either its a little late hardy said but if you havent eaten yet id like to take you to lunch it was a different setting than the carnelian room the independent unicorn was one of those san francisco coffee houses in the avenues that always seemed to be empty and yet had been operating in the same location for thirtysome years a postere next to the front door announced poetry readings on wednesday nights openmike music on a few others randomly the place had picture windows but they were covered with paisley cotton sheets keeping the room suitably dim there was sitar music and faint smells of patchouli and curry a shirtless bearded man and a longhaired thin young woman dressed in black were playing chess at the counter singh waved tentatively from his table at the back hardys eyes not yet adjusted to the light made out the form and he moved toward it knocking into one of the tables on his way a cat meowed at hardys feet and jumped up to the window ledge hardy studied the table moving on singh shook his hand weakly the little efficiency expert seemed somehow diminished beaten down though he put on a brave smile when hardy thanked him for the meeting singh said it is my pleasure for you to come down there is not you see much his voice stopped he gestured around the room is this your place hardy asked you own it a polite laugh oh no no he leaned forward confiding it is not expensive they let me sit in here all day sometimes it is better than being home it is a place to come to like work the shirtless man had put on an apron for his waiters duties and was at their table offering the menu espresso teas whole grain bread products lentil soup brown rice tabouli hardy ordered hummous and a salad singh asked if hardy minded if he had the vegetable curry at the most expensive thing on the menu hardy said sure anything lunch was on him hardy the sport when the waiter had gone hardy asked singh what had happened to his job singh smiled sadly well the business climate you see he began then trailed off again he was still wearing his thin tie and his white shirt the sportscoat was draped over the chair behind him no it is not that i think it is just greed greed no that is not fair not right i suppose it is just business but i am i was with the group for seven years and i thought he shrugged what happened well the restructure yes the bottom line singh drank from his water glass no ice i did not see this coming it is my fault i should have known this is how profit is made you trim the fat he laughed i never saw myself as the fat though you see i thought i was valuable providing a service now of course i see hardy having read the offering circular three times was by now familiar with the facts the yerba buena medical group had been in the process of changing its status from nonprofit to forprofit for well over a year the hmo needed to attract capital if it expected to compete for patients and it couldnt attract capital if it didnt make a profit so they just let you go singh shrugged somebody else could do it more cheaply maybe not so well i dont know but i was staff not a doctor so another shrug the conclusion obvious in any case how do i help you you did not come to talk about me hardy sat back on his chair thats all right mr singh i dont mind hearing about you you might have heard that dr witts wife was gound guilty of killing hi no i did not i do not follow the news since his wife shes my client im trying to keep her from being getting sentenced to death i do not believe in that i think execution by the state is just another form of murder then you might want to help me if i can but as i told you dr witt was respected the food arrived slightly more appetizing than its description hardy broke off some pita and dipped it in his hummous singh ate hungrily beginning almost before the food was on the table you also said that you and dr witt had some problems over how money got spent but that was the board their decisions it never came to anything dr witt did what he did in his office what he wanted i think he wanted more say more control in how the plan worked in the decisionmaking singh stopped eating for a second a smile on his face what he would do now i dont know what do you mean now now there is no ali singh to discuss it with now with the takeover you mean the change to forprofit singh shook his head no mr hardy that was last march i had not bought in almost no one did but i think dr witt he would have arguments over this hardy stopped the pretense of eating he felt a tingling at the back of his neck im afraid youve lost me i thought we were talking about the company going for profit yes it did that hardy waited and then this is separate you see later this summer the group was bought who bought it singh had finished his curry he pushed his plate aside these are the people who let me go the insurance people pacrim they paid million in cash hardy pushed his own plate away million singh was going on when it filed with the state for the status change the fee is to pay the state for your worth it came to dollars that was the groups net worth the offer of million was a great surprise you see no one thought the group had that kind of value somebody did hardy thought no business suddenly discovered its value had increased from to million in less than six months yet the offering circular had described ybmgs financial future in the most conservative terms no sale was contemplated publicly last christmas there had been no potential buyers and the market had been scoured at the time the circular had been clear on that the members shouldnt expect any windfall profit it probably wasnt even worth the members time to buy the nickel shares theyd never be worth any more than that the tingling sensation was spreading if i had been a member i would have bought singh said not many members bought but i would have and everything now would be different the members did all right hardy asked the ones who bought in singh the accountant knew the figures he couldnt help smiling bleakly in admiration they offered fortynine percent to the members the doctors thats shares at five cents a share how much you could buy depended on how long you had been with the group the most for any one individual you see was shares which would be a total investment of hardy remembered that figure less than twenty bucks i have been over these numbers so many times singh said and it is still very difficult to believe do you know what a nickel share is now worth i could do the math singh smiled his sad gentle smile again no need i have done it one hundred fortytwo dollars and eightysix cents per share hardy whistled fiftytwo thousand five hundred seventytwo dollars and fortyeight cents singh said whats that thats what you have now if you bought your three hundred and sixtyeight shares for eighteen dollars and forty cents interesting if true but so what freeman was on his own turf unlike his austere apartment the surroundings in his office were sumptuous a twelvebyeighteenfoot persian rug covered the center of the dark hardwood floors fine leaded crystal was on display on the mirrored shelves behind the fully stocked bar two original bufanos and a bateman hung on the spongepainted walls the corner room was large three times the size of hardys with full bookshelves two fullsize couches several armchairs there were drapes not the ubiquitous louvered blinds on the three sets of windows freemans desk was a fivebysevenfoot expanse of spotless shining rosewood it was six oclock and hardy was sitting in one of the armchairs after his discussion with ali singh he had tried unsuccessfully to reach donna bellows again he had also left a message with jody bachman at crane amp crane then he had spent an hour or so going over the ybmg offering circular in some detail in light of what he had discovered with singh it didnt read the same way it had so what hardy replied so something at least freeman grunted handed hardy a cold beer and went back to the bar rummaging around down behind it its a lot of money hardy persisted its a hell of a lot of money freeman came up with a bottle of red wine i agree he was taking the foil off but again so what so a bunch of doctors made a lot of money happens every day not a bunch only a few this accountant singh said he didnt think more than fifteen twenty guys bought in freeman pulled the cork sniffed it and laid it on the bars surface he lifted one of the largebowled crystal wine glasses from behind him and poured himself a quarter of the bottle holding it up to the window to check its color its clarity its legs hardy crossed a leg let me know if im bothering you david he sipped at the wine not at all he said taking another mouthful flushing it around his mouth gargling finally swallowing he came around the bar the bordeaux are not overrated you really ought to try a glass choosing an armchair placing the glass on a marbletopped end table he sat down hardy defiantly pulled at his beer freeman sat forward i would love to put something together here dismas believe me im not seeing it hardy sat back trying to formulate his position it would be good practice if he had to present it to villars or a jury maybe it wasnt as clear as it seemed to him lets be generous say a maximum of fifty doctors bought the stock there are about four hundred doctors in the group freeman waited hearing him out sipping his wine okay okay so from my perspective and i admit its almost a year later the cover letter looks like an outright deception a year ago you hadnt started your first trial freeman reminded him you didnt work here you didnt have two children youd never met jennifer witt and larry and matt witt were alive he swirled more wine a lot can happen in a year perspectives change i think the reason larry got in touch with his lawyer and then this guy down in la was because he thought something was fishy back then and he was calling them on it calling who the board the attorneys i dont know whoever drew up this thing whoever concocted the scam the bushy eyebrows went up now its a scam now freeman sat all the way back into his chair dont hang your hopes on the way you want something to be dismas i dont think im doing that freeman shook his head you want it to be a scam because if it is a scam and you can prove it then maybe you can help jennifer with it although how you plan to do even that eludes me he leaned forward again all you can do this round is get the death penalty mitigated shes already guilty you cant get her retried if i can get villars youre talking about joan villars the superior court judge i presume get serious the womans about as flexible as concrete youre not going to convince villars to do anything so let me try to convince you freeman sat back again ive been listening i think you said fifty doctors bought stock continue the reason the other three hundred and fifty did not was because of the wording of this coverletter and the offering circular together they made this dumb nickel investment sound like a waste of time then they sent it out to their doctors during the holidays when only a few of the guys would be likely to take the time to read it and limited the option period to about three weeks im with you so far did larry buy or not buy larry smelled a rat and then and then he threatened to blow the whistle on this multimilliondollar scam that was the call to la fingers pressed to his eyes freeman sighed i was afraid thats where you were going hardy had been talked out of enough good ideas by david freeman over the past weeks he was not in his most receptive mode david the managing partner in the la firm handling this was shot to death within a month of larry witt freeman tipped his glass you said that i fail to see though how any of this is going to mitigate jennifers sentence even if you could get villars to listen to it which you cant youre saying now i take it that there was in fact some mysterious hit man the existence of whom by the way the defense thats us never hinted at during the trial and of whom there is no physical evidence that doesnt mean he doesnt exist do you think he does you think jennifer is telling the truth hardy said he still didnt entirely think that but the jury might ill let them decide villars wont let you introduce the theory and if shed be inclined to which she wont powell will object and win unless youve got some shred of evidence which doesnt exist no doubt because this didnt happen this way which leaves jennifer hanging hardy said freeman noisily sipped the rest of his wine it always has he muttered but he wasnt going to take any more of freemans advice even if it was right he still had four days and he thought if he did succeed in finding that shred of evidence freeman had talked about he could get villars at least to listen after all this was a capital case this was life and death not some mootcourt discussion not petty politics if he got something real he had to believe she would listen to it of course this did beg the question of whether or not anything real in fact existed but hardy had nothing else he had to assume it did somewhere the next day he interviewed three doctors at ybmg two of whom had not invested and one who had the first two felt understandably snakebit but neither one saw a grand conspiracy at work in his bad fortune the group had done well and they both wished they had been more a part of it but it was like the lottery who would have predicted the windfall it was a fluke and theyd been given their chance the lucky one dr seidl was a younger member of the group only entitled to ninetytwo shares paying his monthly bills in december he had sent in his and promptly forgot about it last month when he received his payout of he thought it was very nice but after taxes it was a little under ten grand and after all his credit cards he was back to square one it sure beat a swan dive into a dry swimming pool but it wasnt really going to change his life hardy was starting to think it was going to be hard to sustain his conspiracy theory even to himself if he didnt find somebody who had made a bundle and theoretically at least would have had reason to shut up a whistle blower if thats what larry witt had been in the afternoon he went to the library and looked up the members of the ybmg board in the business reference section but the names were all unfamiliar he did learn that the corporation as an entity was scheduled to hold fiftyone percent of the stock and the doctors fortynine percent if all of them bought in he wondered if there was a provision for outstanding unbought doctor stock some kind of secondary buyin but he saw no mention of it in the published prospectus he did some figuring realizing that if only ten percent of the doctors bought their stock then there appeared to be a little over shares out there somewhere unclaimed with a value of something like million on friday morning he was in his office talking on the phone to the los angeles police department he still had discovered no evidence connection between ybmgs business dealings and dr larry witt he had talked to jennifer again last night pressing her but she could recall nothing larry said or might have said regarding the proposed buyout hardy was tempted to tell her to make something up just so he could get it in front of somebody but he restrained himself then it struck him there had been an investigation he knew that policmen got sensitive about their unsolved backlogs their skull cases they called them but he might be able to drum up a little enthusiasm tie the old crime to another one restoffer homicide it was an older voice but not a tired one and hardy had gotten through the huge bureaucracy faster that hed have thought possible maybe it meant something hardy introduced himself trying to talk fast and still be as clear as he could be he was a defense attorney in san francisco and maybe had discovered a possible link between his client and the murder of simpson crane there was a longish pause whatd you say your name was hardy told him another pause just a minute hang on would you when restoffer came back on there was less background noise you said you were in san francisco thats right im listening hardy went through it more slowly this time filling in the blanks when hed finished restoffer said thats pretty tenuous mr hardy the inspector was right of course and hardy admitted it simpson crane ran the law firm that represented the medical group of which larry witt had been a member crane himself hadnt been ybmgs lawyer or witts for that matter even jody bachman hadnt been witts lawyer hardy knew better than to push it was the quickest way to turn a cop off a citizen especially a defense lawyer lobbying for an unsupported theory the facts were either going to intrigue restoffer or not well hardy said i just thought i should report it to somebody get it off my chest it was restoffers cue to hang up if he was going to but he stayed on were pretty sure it was union muscle but we couldnt find any kind of trail they did it right same up here except theyve convicted my client witts wife of killing him for the insurance theyve convicted her already last week my problem is shes got no defense other than saying she didnt do it she says she saw somebody walking up the street maybe it was some kind of hit man so ive been trying to find a reason for a hit man to want to kill witt this might be it there was a long silence ive got four months before i retire restoffer said id love to close out these two crane was a prominent guy so was his wife but ive got five live cases right now when am i supposed to fit this in that was his problem and hardy let him wrestle with it you got a paper trail anything at all all hardy had was the offering circular and the prospectus from the library which hed fax down if restoffer needed it how much money we talking about i figure about seventeen million dollars seventeen million you think that could motivate somebody to do something serious restoffer grunted seventeen dollars does it down here sometimes seventeen cents the line hummed empty and open okay he said why dont you send your stuff down ill take a look at it now it was hardys turn to hang up but much as he wanted restoffers help he didnt want to mislead him it was fulldisclosure time inspector he began floyd restoffer said okay floyd there is one other thing you ought to know that argues against this hit man theory it might make the whole exercise not worth your time l im listening i dont know what the practice is with professional killers if they do this but witt was shot with his own gun the silence hung hardy thought he heard restoffer let out a deep breath so was crane he said send down your stuff at least some things seemed to be falling together even the details that did not appear to have particular relevance for example the fedex package while hardy was filling out his subpoena form to call ali singh as a witness for the defense it had come back to him that the fedex invoice had been entered as an exhibit and all he had to do was look up who had sent the package he had done that and seeing that it had come from nancy distephano he had remembered putting things together that tom had gone over to jennifers house the week before the killings to deliver his own present but that nancy was going to wait to deliver hers in person when the witts came to visit on christmas so what had happened was that after the witts had blown off the family visit nancy had sent her present to her grandson matt by federal express what the gift had been didnt matter it had obviously vanished into the gaping and insatiable mouth of christmas presents into the mountain of matts new toys but like restoffers cooperation and though it was not what hed call hot evidence the information gave hardy some small consolation the unanswered questions had been distracting and there werent many left now there seemed something fishy in the ybmg takeover hardys theory was a long way from completely developed and even further from proven but what he was beginning to suspect drew him like a moth to a candle hell any possibility did suppose that both larry witt and simpson crane had for different reasons and by differing paths somehow threatened to expose and undermine an extremely lucrative and shady business transaction so whoever was behind it had these two obstacles to eliminate simpson and larry before the deal could proceed someone was hired to do the dirty work and the murder of simpson crane and his wife who just happened to be there looked like some kind of radical union hit while the murder of larry witt and his son who just happened to be there got laid off on his wife it was at least a tantalizing parallel sunday morning frying eggs and bacon in his metal pan frannie in her bathrobe reading the paper in the sunny kitchen rebecca and vincent enjoying the special treat of sitting next to each other rebecca the big girl helping her mommy feeding the baby getting fully twenty percent of the squashed banana into vincents mouth hardy taking it all in out of the corner of his eye one of the life moments that hed committed himself to recognizing savoring from the front of the house came the strains of the grand canyon suite more freeman influence he walked a couple of steps across the kitchen and planted a kiss on frannies forehead um she said kissing the air distractedly near his face and the telephone rang it always did dont get it hardy said he was standing right next to it and was fighting the temptation pretty well but frannie was already up i know its susan she said shed call me she might be pregnant she picked it up listened then frowned just a minute hes right here he gave her a look but what could he do it was floyd restoffer ive got good news and bad news he said getting right to it the bad news is im off the case youre off the case hardy had gone around the corner to the workroom off the kitchen what happened my guess would be politics after i got your stuff on friday i talked to the younger crane simpsons kid todd asked him if he didnt mind which he didnt if i interviewed some of his partners although he had no idea what i wanted from him anyway i didnt tell him much just following up a new lead on his parents deaths i asked if his dad did any work with yerba buena and no it was this guy bachman and a couple of associates okay so bachman and i have a chat he seems like a nice guy cooperative hardy remembered that had been his take on bachman too i ask him if he knows witt he says hes heard the name then he remembers youd called him bachman i mean he says he forgot to call you back the message got lost he writes himself a note this time id expect a call from him if i were you so we talk for a while about the deal if simpson had been involved somehow bachman cant think how and i dont have any more questions so thats that i get the impression he doesnt know witt from whinola did you mention the seventeen million yeah he said he thought that figure might be pretty exaggerated but hed look into it there might have been some slush as he called it given as bonuses an so on and he was pretty sure the members of the board had a buyback option but none of this was a secret so why are you off the case somebody took you off somebody asked thats all yesterday called me at home who my deputy chief but there wasnt any pressure more like a suggestion what am i doing messing with a tenmonthold murder when im counting four months to pension city clear my plate and get out thats what i ought to do hardy was staring out at the citys famous skyline across the rooftops in the avenues the thought occurred to him how did he know you were on it to begin with did you tell him i asked him the same thing evidently it came down from the chief himself who in turn got an earful from mr kelso whos mr kelso oh thats right youre not a local frank kelso is one of our illustrious supervisors called the chief and wanted to know why we were hassling that was the word why we were hassling the pillars of our legal community and griefstricken ones at that i took it he meant the son todd a los angeles supervisor my hardy thought but this is heating up whatever else he might be doing he had touched a nerve here it pumped him up so where do we go from here me im afraid i dont go anywhere im in dontrocktheboat mode hardy the brass wants me to leave it i leave it they just tell you to forget about a murder every few years yeah after a beat he said seriously i asked the same question you know what the answer was did i have anything solid to go on or was i just fishing so i told him a little about your client what youd told me just the high spots but enough and he said it sounded like i was fishing i told him sometimes it pays to fish and he said it wasnt one of those times restoffer sighed its all a numbers game here and i do have five live ones they want cleared up by the time im gone hardy took a moment then tried again youre okay going out with unfinished business like this it was a lame attempt at a guilt trip but hardy didnt want to let it go restoffer laughed you know how many open cases im leaving you dont want to know but one more isnt going to make any difference i can tell you that theres just no percentage in it for me you might have some luck with a private eye i could recommend a couple of guys down here floyd i need a pro someone inside maybe sugar would work restoffer had access and a history no private detective could approach cant do it hardy sorry okay floyd thanks for your help anyway he was about to hang up waiting for restoffer to say goodbye instead the inspector said arent you going to ask me about the good news okay hardy played along although even the bad news was good in a sense the involvement of supervisors and police chiefs was corroboration that it wasnt all a chimera something was getting covered up whats the good news the good news is that last night i think this whole thing stinks so i did some research of my own this morning downtown weve got lists some guys in white collars use for whatever they do you know its all public record although sometimes its a little hard to get access to contributors to various causes that type of thing i thought id check the list of supervisor kelsos contributors against the yerba buena board and see if i found anybody who might feel comfortable leaning on our good supervisor for a favor or two guess what you found one hardy could almost see him nod margaret morency san marino old money and lots of it she called kelso i cant prove it but its a safe bet can you go to your deputy chief and tell him about it seems like this takes it out of the fishing department not enough hardy restoffer was off the case and he was clear about that he wasnt going to jeopardize his retirement with his last months on the job hardy was grateful taking what he could get at least the man was helping this only looks like something if youre already disposed to see it restoffer was saying ive got nothing hard at all nothing to connect the dots do you know anything about this morency woman nothing shes probably on ten boards thats what these people do isnt it sit on boards keep the money in the family take a small stipend say my salary for their efforts and the rich stay rich hey listen to me im four months from life by a lake in montana in a cabin thats paid for get out of this zoo for good so what am i bitching about sounds great it will be believe me the first year i dont think ill do anything but paint i havent painted since i was a kid i used to love it then i ran out of time to do it i used to make things out of wood hardy said no nails there was a silence then life huh restoffer said anyway i thought id give you what i found see if you get lucky well i appreciate it floyd i really do listen if you get so youre closing in on this one im here got you later hardy climbed the hall of justice steps it had turned cold overnight and the morning sun shone bleakly as though through a gauze just enough to cast its long shadows he had never believed he would miss david freeman but the schlumpy gruff arrogant presence would have been welcome now he entered the building passed the metal detector and went downstairs to the cafeteria not yet mobbed as it would be later he ordered a cup of coffee went to a table and opened his briefcase taking out a fresh yellow legal pad and a black pen it was and the penalty phase was to begin at he had wrestled with his options for an hour before talking to floyd restoffer and in the end had decided that time had simply run out to pursue things on his own down in los angeles if it absolutely came to that he would but meanwhile he had a defense to conduct jennifer witt would be sentenced to death unless he had some reasonably effective argument that she should not be and of course he couldnt use his best one but the penalty phase of the trial gave him more leeway than freeman had had the guilt phase was interested in the weight of evidence in proof in determination of the facts by contrast the penalty phase explicitly contemplated indeed mandated the introduction of factors that might persuade a jury of the defendants mitigating human qualities so hardy could bring up those things about jennifer her life as a wife with her husband what a good mother she had been he could talk about her childhood her friends even her pets his problem was that over the past week at the rate of a couple of hours with jennifer every day he hadnt discovered much more about her life than hed already known and he suspected that not much of jennifers life story the part he could tell was going to move the jury to empathy larry witt had not allowed her to make or keep any friends and she had acquiesced she wasnt even allowed to be involved in matts school life she didnt visit her parents or her brother there were no pets those few times they went out to dinner or to one of larrys social engagements she played the role of an aloof beauty the wife as a trophy she insisted on denying the terrible reality that she had been found guilty hardy hammered over and over the fact that from the jurys perspective she was a multiple murderer this was a hard truth but it was the truth she avoided it as she had so many other hard truths in her life finally they did reach a compromise of sorts hardy could bring up what he saw as humanizing issues in effect pleading for her life as though she were in fact guilty so long as he left out any reference to larry beating her in return hardy must continue to bring up alternative theories for the killings she was not letting go of her idea that this possibility that someone else had done it would at least plant enough doubt to keep the jury from voting the death sentence and no matter her situation and hardys dose of reality she still seemed to cling to the hope that somehow the real killer would be found and she would be entirely cleared so based on the ybmg material and in the face of david freemans warnings hardy spent half the night arranging and he hoped buttressing the argument that a hit man had killed larry and the reasons he had for doing so to that end he had subpoenaed ali singh trying to portray jennifer as a model of sweetness and light proved to be somewhat more difficult she just wasnt the girl next door and had never pretended to be a difficult moody child she had grown up a difficult moody adult haughty cool secretive selfdestructive that was too often her persona showing rarely what was beneath it the jury could not properly consider many of the things she had done since the arrest but hardy believed that one way or another they knew as much as he did and would be unlikely to be able to forget it here was what the jury was working with hardy noted down after killing her husband and son jennifer had gone out for a jog setting up an alibi her stop at the atm that almost had sold them then by a clever ruse she had broken out of jail remained at large for three months during which she continued an affair with her psychiatrist so much for the loving wife though the judge had instructed the jury that there was insufficient evidence to convict jennifer of murdering her first husband hardy doubted any member of the jury didnt think she had theyd no doubt remember that too when the time came yes she was pretty to some of the men she might even be beautiful but even that hardy suspected played against her she seemed by her appearance of aloofness to think she was above it all including the law more tears would have helped but jennifer fought tears it had taken hardy almost a whole day to hammer out the jury instructions that villars would give after argument just before the jury got the case ladies and gentlemen good morning powell stood in the atease position about twelve feet in front of the judges bench eight feet from the jury box facing them his voice was low his tone relaxed though it carried well enough it looked as though he was going to be keeping out the theatrics reasoning that the jury might well have had enough of them another problem was that powells lead in the polls had jumped over the weekend he was now leading his nearest opponent by seven points and seemed to be heading for election on the first ballot hardy had a feeling some members of the jury were aware of this and if that were the case it was more bad luck for jennifer powells authority and stature would tend to increase if the jury saw him as the attorney general of the state of california rather than as just another working stiff prosecutor but this again was something hardy could do nothing about powell continued around these united states of ours a murder is committed about once every two hours every hour of the day every day of the week every week of the year until only a few years ago the death penalty was a relatively common punishment for a person convicted of murder as well as for socalled lesser crimes such as rape and even some types of armed robbery that has changed now in our socalled enlightened age and we live in a society and a state that sanctions the death penalty for only the most heinous of crimes murders involving special circumstances which include as judge villars has told you multiple murders lying in wait murder for financial gain murder of a police officer you have found jennifer witt guilty of murder and guilty of two of the special circumstances i have just referred to murder for financial gain and multiple murder that is no longer in dispute in this phase of the trial i am going to be showing you why the state of california is asking for the death penalty first in the strictly legal sense the laws of this state have decreed that the nature of these crimes compels the ultimate punishment but of course there is an even larger issue here and that is the nature of the murderer a nature so devoid of mercy and feeling that she could and did coldbloodedly plan and execute the murder not only of her husband but of her own flesh and blood her only son hardy as well as powell knew that this was the baldest of opening statement rhetoric but it was powerful and legally accurate while no one had ever before in these proceedings claimed that the murder of matthew witt had been anything but accidental his death by gunshot had occurred in direct consequence of and during the commission of another coldblooded crime any person planning the first crime would have to see inherent in it the possibility of the second that at least was the prosecutions point in that sense legally the two crimes were of the same magnitude or sufficiently close so that hardy decided he couldnt object and be sustained powell stopped and turned his whole body toward hardy and the defense table jennifer now on hardys left she had been on his right throughout the guilt phase seemed to jut out her chin and stare straight back at powell hardy had his hand over her wrist she was shaking he squeezed to signal her it wouldnt help her to get involved in this visual exchange of defiance a game of chicken but the references to her son matt earlier in the trial had been few and glancing this was an escalation and jennifer was taking it hard she pulled her hand from under hardys youre such an asshole she said out loud unable to restrain herself the courtroom exploded powell stood there openmouthed but no doubt pleased let her hang herself villars was calling for order pounding her gavel behind hardy the gallery was humming he put his arm around his client pulling her to him and telling her to shut up right now over the din villars was trying to be heard but to little avail jennifer was starting to stand up about to say something else hardy squeezed her arm again trying to keep her down to save her ow turning on him youre hurting me let me go she wriggled her arm free now facing the judge now the jury a fury cornered and suddenly mute the two bailiffs were closing in on the defense table hardy leaped up reaching for her and at the same time trying to motion to the bailiffs that they didnt need to interfere his voice quiet hands outstretched he kept repeating its okay its all right except of course it wasnt she was killing herself villars stood at the bench her gavel forgotten behind hardy someone said jennifers name and she turned ken lightner had gotten to the front of the gallery and jennifer went into his arms across the railing separating them protectively his big hands caressing the top of her head as a parent might do to comfort a child he held her the bailiffs rooted where they had stopped waited the crisis had lasted less than a few moments and appeared to be over villars sat down powell appeared bemused the judge tapped her gavel and called for a recess then ordered hardy to see her in her chambers villars usually gray visage was almost crimson powell did not say a word she wont do it again your honor damn right she wont do it again the judge spoke quietly standing behind her desk hands down on it leaning on them if i dont gag her and she does do it again mr hardy ill hold you responsible you wont sleep at home for a week hardy expecting a rebuke was brought up short by villars tone more personal than hed expected he decided it would be a good time to bring it out into the open if something was there do you have a problem with me personally your honor i have a problem with your client disrupting my courtroom thats my problem you got a problem with that i dont think thats it hardy said villars straightened up what she squinted at him what did you say i said i dont think thats it the judges eyes narrowed her voice came out raspy choked with anger my courtroom is a goddamn model of fairness mr hardy justice is hard enough to come by so i bend over backwards to go by the rules and try to be evenhanded and i resent the hell out of anybody suggesting that i dont i havent said it got into your courtroom your honor but i noticed you fined david freeman for contempt and now youre threatening me with the same thing or time in jail id do the same thing to mr powell dont flatter yourself she glanced at the prosecutor who was doing his wallpaper imitation nobody gets to yell obscenities in my courtroom nobody freeman go out of line as he does often its not a personal thing with me as you seem to think the main reason im not going to gag your client is that it would further prejudice the jury against her beyond what shes done all on her own nevertheless you have guaranteed her behavior and if she goes over the edge again ill take appropriate steps against her and against you clear perfectly she continued to glare at him your honor he added powells statement took another hour taking them to lunch as he went on jennifer kept a grip on hardys arm sometimes squeezing hard enough so it felt like she was cutting into his skin through his coat sleeve and shirt the thrust of powells new argument in aggravation was that implicit in jennifers planning to kill her husband for the insurance was the realization that it might be necessary to kill her son too that it wasnt a mistake the boy hadnt just gotten in the way she knew he would have to be there and she knew she might kill him might have to hardy thought jennifer might leap out of her chair and attack powell and he almost felt the same powell was really going all out who will speak for the victim powell had concluded if a person who has planned to kill a child has not forfeited her right to live then what as a society have we become what greater violation of trust can there be and what punishment other than the ultimate can begin to balance the scales miraculously jennifer had somehow borne it quietly tears quickly and angrily wiped away had begun on several occasions but by the time he had finished she seemed composed cut that bastards balls off she said to hardy as powell was walking back to his table he prayed that none of the jury had heard her youve heard mr powell characterize jennifer witt as a person who by the very nature of her crimes has forfeited her right to live and if in fact she has committed these crimes i might agree with him without standing powell raised a hand objection your honor the defendants guilt has been established ive acknowledged that your honor hardy hoped he had enough he thought his only chance and it was slim of getting any other theory of the murders admitted was to be crystal clear on what the jury had already determined he wasnt trying to undermine them merely give them alternatives to consider villars gave it a moments thought just so thats clear go on she said to hardy it was enigmatic enough powell took it as though hed been overruled and hardy would take anything he could get he inclined his head to the judge then went back to the jury the evidence in the first part of this trial persuaded you that jennifer was guilty beyond a reasonable doubt but now you are being asked to pass judgment on this womans life and there is a different standard a mistake here that leads to her execution cannot be rectified if new exonerating or at least mitigating evidence appears sometime in the future it would be too late the law recognizes a concept and the judge will give you instructions regarding it called lingering doubt lingering doubt does not undo what you have found beyond a reasonable doubt but it does contemplate a situation such as we have right here before us though you have found jennifer guilty hardy thought hed best keep repeating this to make a following distinction lets see what even the prosecution acknowledges that we dont have and why each of you if you should vote the death penalty might find yourself over the coming years with some very haunting and serious lingering doubt like powell hardy had begun in the center of the courtroom but as he began to loosen up he moved closer to the jury box he had all of their attention this was after all his first appearance in a speaking role before them and there was a curiosity factor but he thought it was more than that up to this point his statement seemed to be hitting a mark slowing himself down he went to the table pretended to consult some notes and took a drink of water he returned to where he had begun number one ladies and gentlemen we dont have anyone who saw jennifer witt shoot anybody nobody not one witness we have heard a witness mr alvarez say that he saw jennifer outside her house right after the shots mrs barbieto said that she heard jennifer yelling inside the house before the shots but neither of these are eyewitnesses to the shooting itself and let me remind you mrs barbieto was unclear as to how long exactly it was between jennifers yelling and the shots and there is the possibility even tough theyd apparently chosen to disregard it in their deliberations that mr alvarez saw someone else outside the house on that morning and thought it was jennifer objection your honor counsel is arguing evidence im reminding the jury of previous testimony thats all your honor this is not a roundtable discussion mr hardy but the objection is overruled so he won one and got slapped on the wrist at the same time villars might as she claimed be fair to a fault but that didnt make her any easier to deal with thank you your honor he turned back to the jury what else does the evidence leave unexplained true jennifer stood to collect five million dollars presumably the motive attributed to her for these murders but if that is the case if this were a meticulously planned murder for money where is the evidence of the planning what was the fight about the one overheard by mrs barbieto if jennifer killed her husband might it have been because they were fighting was it in the heat of argument without any premeditation at all did matt somehow tragically simply get in the way these are questions that are not answered by the evidence they cannot be answered he paused again letting his words sink in there are two final points id like to make to you the first is this that jennifer witt said and says she did not commit these crimes you may dismiss this as selfserving but her stance her position has never wavered throughout this trial she has pleaded not guilty and she has stuck with that throughout she is not claiming she was temporarily insane or pressured by issues beyond her control or hardy took a breath or trying to escape an abusive situation at home he hurried on she could have said any of these things and hoped you would find her guilty if at all only of some lesser offense than firstdegree murder deathpenalty murder but she did not do that she has never done it no bells or whistles no fancy defense moves to save her life and believe me my colleague david freeman has a few he can pull out if hes asked to hardy went back to the defense table and took another sip of water gathering his thoughts the last point ladies and gentlemen concerns a crucial factor that has thus far been missing in the record of this trial and that is the fact that because no one actually saw jennifer kill larry and matt witt the possibility must remain that someone else could have done these deeds powell stood quickly your honor the verdict is in but again he was overruled hardy was not arguing a logical inconsistency nor strictly was he arguing hypothetically he could continue but walk carefully mr hardy theres a thin line here acknowledging villars warning hardy turned to the jury i am not here to prove to you that your verdict was wrong you worked long and hard coming to your decision and i respect your work but the fact does remain someone other than jennifer conceivably could have had a reason to kill larry witt and someone other than jennifer conceivably could have done it so as this portion of the trial proceeds you are going to be hearing some about larry witt the kind of man he was his business dealings some of the other matters he was involved in i believe that a number of these considerations are persuasive and might bring you to that lingering doubt i mentioned earlier he paused took a breath ladies and gentlemen there is one last painful thing mr powell has gone to great lengths in his opening statement powell wasnt having it objection this is not the time for rebuttal villars didnt hesitate sustained she waited hardy almost felt she was daring him all right he said turning to the jury including them in his frustration out of villars lineofsight now i must i must say a word about the death of matthew witt again he paused and it was not just for dramatic effect he could not tolerate having the tragedy of the boys death however it had transpired misrepresented to the jury no evidence has been introduced nor will any be that jennifer witt was an abusive mother if there were doctors out there who could testify that matthew witt was the victim of any kind of abuse believe me they would be here as witnesses for the prosecution there are none and why is that hardy turned and pointed now at his client because jennifer witt was a remarkably good mother no one contends or even suggests that she was not she loved her son she has been devastated by his death she did not concoct any plan that however remotely might have put her son in danger and that ladies and gentlemen is the plain truth hardy glanced at villars waiting for powell to object again and this time be sustained bit it did not come he had kept it vague enough and after all this was just an introduction letting out a breath he decided this was about as good as he was going to get at this stage he thanked the jury and sat down it was sixthirty and hardy was sitting at the bar of the little shamrock working on a black amp tan a mixture of ale and stout moses and hardy back in his fulltime bartender days took pride in how they made the drink separating the two brews cleanly stout on top but the new kid alan had not gotten the knack so that the fresh drink tasted old flat maybe it was just the way the day had gone how hardy felt after the full day of the trial the emotional drain of finally getting up and beginning to work hardy didnt think going home with his edge on would be wise the shift in personal mode from nearadversary to ally was not a toggle switch and he had called frannie explaining he need some unwind time if she could handle it if she wasnt too burned on the kids that early on a monday there were only five other people at the bar two couples at tables near the dart board and a really lovely young woman up by the window talking to alan hardy spun his pint slowly on the smooth wood before him willie nelson was singing paul simon on the jukebox about the many times hed been mistaken the many times confused hardy understood that the young man behind the bar brought a new attitude to the shamrock moses called it the look of the nineties short hair shaved face dress shirt and slacks moses said they were getting a lot more single female customers than they had had with hardy behind the rail to which hardy had replied that maybe that was true but probably they were shallower people into the good looks thing he hardy was into substance character depth real stuff moses said the real stuff was all right but it didnt sell as much booze besides moses said since susan hed been into the goodlooks thing himself times changed the woman by the window said something and alan laughed swirling checking on hardys progress with his drink he was smiling as though no one had ever lied to him maybe that was it hardy thought im in a business where most everybody lies its expected he took a last sip for politeness sake pushed a few bills into the gutter raised a hand saying goodbye a stranger in his own bar it was just getting to dusk and there was one light on in the distephano house in the front left window no cars in the drive hardy parked down a halfblock he put the foldedup subpoena form in his shirt pocket going up the walkway heart pounding he wondered how frannie would feel about this segment of his unwind time he walked a few more steps onto the lawn through the lighted window he saw nancy moving about in the kitchen on the porch he stopped to listen there was no conversation if phil was home he would bull his way through or try he rang the doorbell the overhead light flicked on she stood inside the screen hello she said she looked around behind him up and down the street phil isnt home shaking her head no she opened the screen door hes on a call again hardy was struck by how young she looked jennifer had gotten her good bones from her mother he thought those bones had played a big role in getting their men perhaps it wasnt the blessing it was cracked up to be i wanted to come and ask you if youd like to talk about your daughter on the witness stand talk about jennifer what do you want me to say i want you to talk about how much you love her nancy swallowed her eyes wide i do love her she said i know you do i want you to tell that to the jury why because it might help save her life because its something they can see something human her eyes became hooded haunted jennifer got that way often enough too hardy thought it was whenever either of them thought they were about to do something that would get them hit he pressed the point i need you nancy jennifer needs you the da is pulling people out of the woodwork and theyre painting a very bad picture of jennifer i know i watch tv she scanned the street again then stood silent volunteering nothing what is it its him hardy had met women before who referred to the current man in their lives always without preamble as him and it always chilled him phil would want you to save his daughters life nancy dont tell me he wouldnt want that this whole thing she began then stopped again he hates it he hates that everybody knows its his daughter on trial hes worried about how that affects him hes not just worried hes furious he said he wishes we never had her he wont even let me talk about it about her nancy hows he going to feel if they execute her how are you going to feel the plea in her eyes was clear dont ask me such a question she loved her daughter and was scared to death of her husband if he had to bet on it she hoped more than anything at this moment that he would just go away but he didnt drive out there just to go away he took the paper from his breast pocket this is a subpoena for you to appear nancy i need you to be there i need somebody to say that jennifer loved her son that she herself has something to offer that she is at least worth saving she the jury that somebody cares nancy held the paper close to her nancy how old are you hardy asked suddenly she tried to smile but it came out broken fortyeight she said its not too late he said she clutched the subpoena form against her in a fist held tight against her stomach she sighed almost shuddering any trace of even a broken down smile was gone yes im afraid it is she said in the middle of the night the telephone rang it was freeman you heard yet anybody call you hardy blinked tying to focus the clock fourthirty no david nobodys called me well they called me jennifers mother just tried to kill her old man they were both at shriners hospital phil under the knife in emergency surgery nancy in a guarded private room hardy was down there before six before the sun was up before any other lawyers or the media shes going to be all right him i dont know the inspector sean manion had had a long night but he worked out of park station he had known hardy from the shamrock and they got along they were standing in the hallway outside nancys room now she had been sedated and was not going to be giving interviews to anybody for a while what happened manion was strung tight he was shorter than hardy by half a head with a pockmarked face a reconstructed cleft pallet a monks tonsured hairline perpetually hunched hands in his pockets chewing gum he talked in a rapid staccato guy beat her once too often i guess she grabbed a knife and stuck him four times i think no five how bad three on the arms standard slash but a couple of belly whacks could have knicked his heart they werent sure last i checked guy lost a ton of blood she called us you know after you gonna charge her manion chomped his gum i dont know ask the da i doubt it with what attempted murder manion snorted nah shit this was selfdefense you ought to see her son of a bitch ought to die if he lives anybody gets charged with anything ought to be him sean did you call david freeman on this who never mind maybe she did before you got there hardy motioned back toward the room shes out though huh manion nodded dreamland check her around noon cant hardy said im in trial lucky you the inspector spread his hands well there you go shell still be here tonight shes not going anywhere ill tell you that not today that bad manion bobbed his head pretty bad but hey shes alive it could be worse hardy knew he had caused it if he hadnt gotten the idea in the first place if he hadnt gone down with the subpoena if he hadnt tried to talk nancy into testifying then she and phil had gotten into it and now they were both in the hospital from his lack of a nights sleep he should have been exhausted but when he entered the small interrogation room on the seventh floor at a little after eight the adrenalin rush hadnt let up he felt like hed had a halfgallon of espresso jennifer had not yet dressed for court she was escorted in wearing her red jumpsuit so whats todays advice she began she acted like she was losing hope in him he told her she had been standing in what had become her usual posture in that room arms crossed leaning back against the door before hardy was half done she sat down shellshocked jennifer im here then what does this mean i think it means you r mother was going to testify for you and she and your dad had a fight about it but why would she risk that she knows him how about because she loves you jennifer just stared at him her mouth working in silence she put her head down on her arms and began to sob a very unhappy harlan poole was back on the witness stand the dentist appeared to have lost some fifteen pounds in the two weeks since he had been up before this time he was not going to be relating hearsay dean powell was zeroing in the election was around the corner and the candidates whole rhythm was picking up dr poole you have said that after jennifers first husband died you decided to call things off with her is that correct poole sweating almost before he had begun agreed can you tell us what happened then between you and jennifer we i just kind of tried to distance myself although she worked with you every day did she not poole nodded she was my receptionist and yet you needed to distance yourself i we stopped being intimate poole seemed to be looking in all directions at once pulling at his collar he mumbled it out just into the range of the audible i couldnt perform it may sound strange but i was afraid of her hardy jumped up objecting but was overruled he began to argue with villars saying that poole didnt answer the question of whether or not he had stopped being intimate villars pointing a finger asked hardy if he were hardofhearing she had ruled on it he had to stop he risked a contempt citation but worse he risked losing the jurys respect the former he could handle but the latter could doom jennifer he sat down powell for his part was not about to risk a mistrial repeating why dr poole had been afraid but then of course he didnt have to the hury would remember about ned he didnt need it anyway as it turned out the direction he did take was damaging enough so then what happened i tried to tell jennifer it was no good that it just wasnt working anymore but she uh she he looked at jennifer again take your time powell said poole thought about how to put it i finally decided id have to break it off with her and fire her at the same time there was a little rush in the courtroom several members of the jury sat forward so did hardy once again he hadnt heard about this one and what happened then well she got pretty crazy how do you mean crazy threatening violent both he stopped and swallowed a few times i dont know what to say sir im sorry powell was prepared did she physically attack you yes with a weapon well some things at the office yes sharp things medical instruments yes were you hurt she scratched me pretty badly on my arms and face he shook his head she was pretty crazy hardy stood up again your honor this is the second time this witness has characterized the defendant as crazy villars deadpan addressed the jury disregard the characterization she said youre sustained mr hardy she gave him a cold smile powell picked it right up she scratched you on your arms and face hardy instinctively rose again asked and answered your honor powell turned back to him to the jury arms outstretched villars wasted no time let the prosecutor question this witness mr hardy youll get your chance overruled for the third time the jury heard that jennifer had scratched pooles arms and face powell now asked youve also said that the defendant threatened you what was the nature of that threat poole swallowed and croaked it out she said if i didnt take her back shed kill me shed kill you powell repeated yes sir did you think she would hardy hating to but having to powell was baiting him stood to object again but powell graciously smiled ill withdraw the question your witness now was when the fatigue was hurting him if powell had found his own rhythm hardy felt that he had lost his but there was nothing to do but press on dr poole he began this attack you suffered at the hands of jennifer witt was it after you broke up with her or after you fired her well they were it was pretty much the same thing okay how long had you been intimate with mrs witt before that time i think about six months you dont remember exactly not exactly no this was hardys favorite answer from a hostile witness he thought hed try it again all right would you please tell us what weapons she used against you the sharp ones you mentioned earlier well they were office instruments yes you said that but which ones poole frowned i dont remember exactly she was throwing a lot of them oh she was throwing things at you you broke up with someone you had been intimate with for six months taking advantage of your position as her employer objection powell said it wasnt like that hardys voice was rising indignantly and it wasnt an act and fired her at the same time and she threw some things at you in anger is that the attack youre telling us about villars rapped her gavel badgering the witness your honor powell said sustained mr hardy is there a question in there hardy took a breath turned to the jury and gave them a halfsmile doctor can you tell us any instrument that jennifer threw at you well yes i mean no but it wasnt just that she trashed the office she cut me lets take those one at a time she trashed your office completely she did a lot of damage eight thousand dollars i had to close for a week eight thousand dollars you must have reported that kind of loss to the polce poole was silent dr poole did you report this incident to the police i didnt want to im sorry doctor but its a yes or no question did you report this to the police poole swallowed again and again no so theres no record that it happened as you say yes or no no theres probably no record all right lets go back to her cutting you did she cut you with one of your instruments perhaps no it was scratches oh hardy brought in the jury again now it wasnt cuts it was scratches she tore at my arms and face with her nails thats the scratches im talking about all right that clarifies that and youve testified that they were pretty bad did you see a doctor for them no i didnt want thank you do you have any scars from this alleged attack his hands went to his face as though there was a memory there its been almost ten years he said that would be a no yes thats a no thank you one last question doctor lets go on to this alleged threat do you remember the actual words jennifer used no i dont not exactly he was breathing hard and suddenly rose in the chair and actually pointed to jennifer but she did say she was going to kill me villars told him to control himself to calm down did she actually try to kill you did she follow you around call you on the telephone hound you after that no no nothing like that i never saw her again at least not until i got here you never saw her again in other words regardless of what she might have said in the heat and pain of the moment after being simultaneously jilted and fired by you she disappeared from your life isnt that true yes thats true thank you no further questions hardy might have won that round on points but he was afraid the victory would turn out to be pyrrhic the jury had been reminded forcefully of ned and regardless of what they were legally instructed to do he doubted that many people if convinced of jennifers guilt with larry and matt would not come to the conclusion that she had also killed her first husband additionally hardy worried that he had probably alienated villars once and for all and no good could come of that and though he had supplied a reasonable motive for jennifers outburst he had not been able to overcome the bare fact that she had gotten physically violent with poole poole might have come across as a user a wimp and a whiner but jennifers character kept slipping too a highly unstable person that you crossed at your serious peril wouldnt such a person be likely to repeat her violence on others john lescroart hardy th juror the powell had not relied much on photographs during the guilt phase but as a courtesy he assigned his young assistant justin morehouse to inform hardy as they broke for lunch that the prosecution was going to bring out the pictures in the afternoon a member of the forensics unit for the color shots from the witt home the coroner dr strout with the morgue shots it was gruesome but it made sense from the prosecutors point of view powell was out to prove that the killing must have been cold and deliberate his thrust in this phase was to emphasize the horror of matts death and hardy having seen the photos knew that they would be tremendously effective to that end justin was a strapping athletic young man in a welltailored suit he had been in powells shadow throughout the trial taking notes saying nothing doing the grunt work as most young lawyers did he had a fresh open face giving his message to hardy he seemed to be leaning over backward to avoid the appearance of the prosecutorial posturing that some startup assistant das adopted as their shield this is going to be very rough on jennifer hardy said maybe you could pass that along to dean what will lookiing at the pictures of her dead son justin shifted uncomfortably from foot to foot as though he had to go to the bathroom maybe she shouldnt have killed him then he said it seemed to come out reluctantly as though he didnt want to sound heartless but it happened to be his honest belief no shadow of doubt in it it was a good reminder for hardy to many people in the courtroom perhaps most hardy believed jennifer was an unredeemed multiple murderer who would likely do it again with the right provocation even justin morehouse a seemingly nice guy wasnt losing any sleep about getting her a death sentence in fact though he probably wouldnt admit it he didnt feel too badly about having her suffer a little too by the display of pictures hardy was afraid that justin might be a pretty good litmus for how the jury was feeling andif that were so jennifer was in serious trouble because for all the impression that his crossexaminations were having on morehouse hardy figured he might as well not have come to court as soon as court was called to order after lunch hardy rose and asked if the judge would allow counsel to approach the bench your honor he began and told villars about powells plans for showandtell in view of the highly emotional response these photographs are likely to produce i would like to request that you excuse jennifer witt from the courtroom during this testimony villars pulled her halfmoon reading glasses further down her nose looking over them at hardy we dont try murder cases in absentia in this country mr hardy your client stays this was the law but strict adherence to it under these conditions smacked of gratuitous cruelty however he couldnt very well argue that she may faint your honor this will be extremely difficult for her villars rearranged her glasses then took them off altogether if she faints mr hardy well adjourn until shes feeling better as it turned out and this seemed to be the trials trademark it was worse than he had feared an emotional outburst even a negative one might at least humanize jennifer but she had no reaction at all instead she seemed to hardy to go into shock sitting through it all dryeyed unmoving clutching hardys arm with her right hand as the succession of photographs blown up to fit on the easel next to the witness box showed her and the jury how her boy had looked after he had been shot half the jury reacted with tears or apparent nausea but jennifer sat still her hand on her attorneys arm looking straight ahead unfeeling dragging from fatigue hardy nevertheless forced himself back to shriners hospital after court adjourned there was still that bleak sunshine at the hall but he hit the fog just across van ness as he was heading west and had to slow to twenty miles per hour in san francisco the fog didnt creep in on little cats feet it was a blitzkrieg that rolled in off the ocean at about a block every three minutes in a wide front that engulfed everything before it the temperature dropped twenty degrees in a half a mile the wind whipped and wipers went on people suddenly decided to jump off the golden gate bridge hardys car crept out on lincoln the park on his right he briefly considered stopping at the shamrock again for a quick one but last night he had done that and it hadnt improved his life that hed noticed there was no guard outside the door to nancys room these were visiting hours and hardy was able to get right in jennifers mother was halfupright in her bed her eyes closed there was a wide bandage over the bridge of her nose and above that her eyes were swollen orbs of black and blue hardy cleared his throat and she stirred its the troublemaker she said yeah he agreed she pulled herself higher on her pillow and with some difficulty grimacing turned her head to face hardy i told phil id testify that youd been by hardy nodded i figured that how is he hardy had asked and been told at the nurses station hes critical nancy exhaled relief disappointment but then quickly sucked in a breath some of her ribs might be broken i dont know she said what did i do it sounds to me like you defended yourself against someone who was hurting you very badly i dont know im scared of him of what i did of whats going to happen now have you talked to the police she nodded though every slight move seemed to cost her theyve been by i told them what happened she sighed again but after that what what do you mean half a dry laugh turned to a sharp cry of pain it does hurt when you laugh she said i mean stabbing your husband i think it means its over the marriage now i dont know what im going to do what will happen hardy didnt have an answer for her and beyond that he thought her best bet was to figure it out on her own in his opinion she hadnt done badly so far what do the police say he asked are they charging you they say not not yet anyway she looked down at her body covered now they say phil might have killed me i think he just didnt realize she stopped herself no im not going to do that not anymore he knew what he was doing he just kept coming i asked him to stop i begged him and thats what you told the police thats what happened she said she met his eyes so when do you want me to testify when do you get out of here she shook her head defiantly echoes of jennifer after this beginning again you tell me when jennifer needs me ill be there if ive got to crawl the prosecution rested on wednesday afternoon for the better part of four days powell had called solid witnesses remarkable for their lack of stridency given that his goal in calling them was to persuade a jury to vote for the death penalty the jury had seemed to listen raptly as the psychiatrist that powell had retained related his professional opinion after three interviews during which jennifer had he said remained uncooperative that jennifer was irredeemably sociopathic unresponsive hostile dangerous such a psychiatric opinion would not have been admissible until after hardy had raised the subject by calling a psychiatrist of his own but jennifer had obliged the prosecution by assaulting their psychiatrist thereby making his testimony admissible whether hardy called a psychiatrist to testify or not in their last interview she had burned him stubbing out her cigarette on the back of his hand i barely touched him besides he asked me if maybe id killed matt to shut him up agbout my sexually abusing him was that a possibility i was repressing was i afraid to consider that then there was rhea thompson the woman from the jail who had exchanged identities with jennifer back in the spring so that she could escape hardy suspected rhea was a career snitch who had volunteered her information to cut a better deal for herself but when she told the jury that jennifer had said shed just have to kill anyone who tried to frustrate her escape it came across as credible that was just a joke anybody could see that jennifer had said if jennifers life at home with her husbands paralleled the way she was with hardy equal parts bad attitude and bad judgment he thought he was getting some notion of how she might have provoked the men not of course that he forgave them not that it was for a minute acceptable but so much of what jennifer did seemed to involve some sort of selfdestruction she seemed to need to lose to put herself in a position where she could say see i told you i was no good and proving that was what she seemed to do best hardy decided it was time for a heavy dose of reality talk they were in the suite for a fifteen minute recess after which hardy was going to call ali singh and let the chips fall jennifer dont you realize people out there are trying to get a handle on who you are thats really what this is about so you call powell an asshole in front of the whole world you use the states shrink for an ashtray you talk about killing other people if you have to youre killing yourself here jennifer you know that what am i supposed to do put on an act there was a time when he thought that was what she was doing not now yes that would be a beautiful thing i would love a little act right now let them see another jennifer some gentleness behind the front or rather maybe drop the tough guy act why why show it to them hardy put his face down in front of hers please weve only got a couple more days jennifer could you try he turned around away from her goddamn he said youre mad at me pacing across to the windows he looked across the short expanse to the freeway the faded buildings beyond the gray sky you are okay so im mad at you so what he was aware of her moving coming up behind him she pressed herself against his back he felt her hand come around to his stomach low and start to descend he whirled around backing against the window what the hell are you doing she looked up at him her eyes surprised dont be mad at me she said whispering hardy tried to back away again but there was no place to go she took a half step into him against him this wasnt going to happen for a second there was no room no light he gripped her shoulders pushing her back as hard as he could away from him as quickly as it happened somewhere in the middle of it a vestige of control kicked in made him hang on kept him from throwing her backward across the room he held her at arms length as he came back to himself he realized how tightly he was holding her shoulders she had her whipped look now he let her go dont you ever ever do that again she backed away he had to turn again to see something outside the room the fog the same freeway the city beyond he gulped air trying to get a breath to show his blood down behind him she whispered its just she began im sorry forget it he stared for a long minute at the nothing out the window he knew now she wouldnt move she was waiting he sucked in another breath then turned around dont be sorry he said his legs still unsteady weak under him he walked across the room to the door he was leaving her alone the bailiff could watch her until they reconvened dont be sorry he repeated change villars had them back in her chambers powell had let hardy question singh for about ten minutes before he had requested this private conference villars had as usual reluctantly agreed your honor powell was standing next to hardy in front of villars desk the people have been patiently listening to mr singhs fascinating story but i fail to see any relevance at all to these proceedings weve argued this before and mr hardy keeps saying hes going to tie this into the witt killings i dont think he can villars ruminated then spoke mr hardy i have to agree can you tell us where this is going hardy took a minute giving them the short version as well as he could that the victims in both scenarios were killed with their own guns the amount of money involved the suspicion in los angeles that there had been a paid assassin in the death of simpson crane and his wife when he finished villars was still puzzled youre saying this simpson crane was killed with jennifer witts gun hardy said no witt was killed with his own gun and crane had been killed by his the judge turned to powell am i missing it powell jumped in even if there is villars motioned him quiet is there an evidentiary connection mr hardy this is a plausible alternative theory to these murders that the jury at least ought to hear perhaps you didnt hear me i asked you if there was any evidentiary evidence yes of course after a beat villars asked if hardy would favor them by telling them what it was witt was with the yerba buena medical group your honor he got wind of this stock scam and was going to go public with it he was killed for that knowledge by whom by whoever killed simpson crane villars drummed on her desk how do you know that i think i can make a persuasive argument powell stepped into the breach your honor this is ridiculous this is neither the time nor place for alternative theories the jury has already found jennifer witt guilty if mr hardy had any evidence he should have had freeman bring it up during the guilt phase i didnt find out any of this until last weekend powell threw up his hands well thats either too damn bad or damn convenient isnt it villars held up a finger gentlemen please this is a womans life and if justice is served we ought to be able to find a place for it if there is evidence i want to hear about it anytime mr hardy this mr crane then was killed the investigating officer was a floyd restoffer hes with the lapd i could subpoena him to come up and they have a suspect no but theyre certain it was a professional hit villars paused not liking that very much all right so this restoffer what has he found about this group the group was represented by cranes firm as ive told you by crane himself hardy hesitated but there was no escaping it no by another of the partners now wait a minute powell exploded your honor does mr hardy mean to tell us crane didnt even represent this group i hope not villars said thats not your evidence is it mr hardy this was not turning out pretty well no ones bee charged if thats what you mean but villars face had clouded her volume increasing thats exactly what i mean does restoffer have a case that relates here or what its an open case down there ten months and its still open whats this man restoffer doing with a tenmonthold case nothing now your honor hes been taken off it hardy well knew that alleged linkage here came across as pretty farfetched perhaps no certainly he was damaging his professional credibility even bringing it up but what else could he do jennifer was going to get sentenced to death if he couldnt pull something out of his hat was there really a rabbit in there he didnt have any idea but in his desperation he sure as hell would argue it if the judge would let him all hardy felt he needed was another ten minutes at least to try to explain the latest news hed received from restoffer how hed been told to drop the case after questioning bachman the wealthy woman in san marino who was both a contributor to frank kelso the la supervisor and a member of the ybmg board there had to be something there he needed ten minutes alone with villars he had to get her ear your honor i wonder if we might speak in camera villars sat back in her chair no she said there is nothing off the record in a capital case nobodys going to cut any private deals her irritation with hardy was palpable your honor i must say something powell stepped into the pause polite but firm villars turned to him id like you to consider another possibility as mr hardy is having you do and that is this regardless of what you ruled or what the jury might have found had matters progressed differently lets consider the possibility that jennifers first husband ned was is fact killed by this same assassin ten years ago if we grant that could it then become in mr hardys words a plausible defense powell squared around right at hardy its absurd its insulting villars had given every indication shed reached her limit before but powells reductio ad absurdum hit its mark the judge nodded leaning forward i agree she said you know ive been listening hard mr hardy ive been paying attention ive been leaning over backward because as you point out this is a capital case but for the life of me i cant see any reason this should be admitted your honor theres got to be a connection did he really believe that or was it his own desperation talking give me a continuance for a couple of days ill fly down to la your honor please she held up a hand not needing powells input thats not going to happen weve already taken more than two months of this jurys lives she sat still in her robes her face set she lowered her voice which gave it even more authority to that she needed it there was no mistaking who was the boss in villars chambers you know mr hardy ive been trying to figure you out i hear you were a pretty good lawyer when you worked for the city you seem like a sincere man you appear to work hard but time and again in this trial ive come up against your refusal to deal with the way we do things here in this state or in any other state that i know of in the last couple of weeks ive had to listen to how i was personally hostile to you and how that was affecting my decisions then we get this specter of the batteredwoman syndrome which you raise once dont present any evidence of and then drop today your first real opportunity to bring up something to help your client some witnesses that might want to argue for her character or her background or something your honor villars slammed her hand on her desk but her voice remained low mr powell is correct here the guilt phase of this trial is over we have played strictly by the rules your side lost thats how we do it thats why its fair hardy waited a moment to make sure he wasnt interrupting that she was finished it may be fair your honor but they got it wrong jennifer did not kill her husband and son then prove it when this is over i guarantee you if you find another murderer mrs witt will go free but in the meantime your job is to argue mitigation i want to know if you are prepared to do that or not hardy let out a breath one of the main thrusts of my argument was that somebody else killed them with the evidence youve got id say that was probably illadvised strategy adjusting her robes villars checked the clock on the wall and shifted gears all right gentlemen its fourfifteen well go outside and adjourn for today she pointed a finger mr hardy tomorrow i expect witnesses who have something to say to the jury evidence talks here mr hardy its all that talks she rose and came around the desk leading the way to the door five steps ahead of the men powell hung back letting hardy come up abreast of him then whispered bullshit walks hardy left the courtroom head bowed shoulders hunched seeing nothing it had fallen apart not only had he let down his client he had sullied his reputation such as it was by misreading the fairest judge he was likely to appear before out of the corner of his eye he was aware of powell in front of the television cameras hed get a few seconds of air time looking good but he wasnt about to defy the gag order not at this late date and with things going his way instead he was carrying on about how crime was a huge problem all right he had a lot of thoughts on the subject hardy had had his fill of dean powell he wanted to slink back to his office but inspector walter terrell suddenly was standing in his way mr theoretical but hardy couldnt very well condemn him for that he himself had fallen into the same trap because something could have happened didnt necessarily mean that it did or in any case that it could be proved his job the trust hed taken on was to prove not speculate hed lost track of the obvious they sent me down to get you terrell said enigmatically theres somebody upstairs asking for you he stopped it never ended what did jennifer want now how did she get upstairs so soon then another question popped up why was terrell giving him the message on seven he asked meaning the jail no four the fourth floor was homicide were talking to mrs witts mother her dad died a couple of hours ago she wants her lawyer abe glitsky told her he thought he knew where you might be nancy had volunteered to come down homicide lieutenant frank batiste as well as glitsky and sean manion were on hand nancy was not being charged with anything yet in the death of her husband no one argued that she had killed him but they needed her statement even if it was selfdefense nancy was sitting in a yellow leatherette chair at the table in one of the interrogation rooms dressed up with black eyes and a bandage across her nose she could have passed for thirtyfive much as her daughter on a good day could pass for twenty barely nodding to the assemblage telling everyone that first thing he needed five minutes alone with her hardy entered the room and closed the door behind him she smiled weakly greeting him he saw immediately that her breathing was shallow her color bad too pale are you all right should you be walking around she nodded they let me out this morning im just a little weak i thought this would help she said anyway if i came down here maybe i could see jennifer we can probably arrange that but what do these guys want she shook her head i dont know the inspector i saw in the hospital manion he said they werent going to charge me with anything and then when when phil she forced a breath anyway after phil died the younger man came out and asked if id cooperate if youd cooperate he said that this wasnt adding up either they were going to charge her or they werent and either way there was no point in getting her downtown in her condition to sit in an interrogation room at the homicide detail he also wondered about the party outside bariste glitsky manion terrell everybody hanging around waiting on an interview with a woman they werent going to charge with anything have you talked to them yet he asked but before she could answer there was a loud buzz outside clearly audible even inside their room they stood and hardy opened the door the district attorney himself christopher locke had come in trailed by dean powell and half the television cameras in america it was all getting clearer hardy didnt look at locke their feelings about each other had been aired the year before he walked into the main room around locke and up to powell you know dean this is pretty outrageous not to mention insulting terrell stepped forward out of the pack explaining to powell she asked for her attorney why should terrell be explaining to powell i dont know what youre talking about powell said to hardy ill tell you what im talking about the room continued to backfill with camerawielding humanity im talking about this media circus im talking about using this womans there was nancy standing by the door about using this womans personal tragedy so that the jury in her daughters trial can read about it with their coffee tomorrow morning and not incidentally so you can be on television again just before election day thats ridiculous i dont think so i think its on the money i think you had terrell sitting in the wings at shriners in case jennifers father died so you could drag his wife down here in front of the cameras like mother like daughter right hardy wished california sequestered its juries frank batiste was a nononsense professional cop who was outgunned by the brass here but he was in charge in this room his domain he moved forward toward the press of media would all of you please step outside the door now he was herding them prodding just back up there thank you when the last camera had gone he closed the door and turned back to the room suppressing a smile im sure theyll wait locke thought he was trying to take charge its the district attorneys decision whether or not to charge a person with a crime not the police departments hey i already wrote it up manion da or no da had done his report and he wasnt about to stand by while his professionalism was questioned if this wasnt selfdefense you can have my badge im not saying it wasnt locke as usual in hardys view was temporizing until he saw which way the wind was blowing but it is my decision hardy didnt dispute that but it wasnt the issue why is dean here then chris you want to explain that one this drew blood but locke recovered quickly mr powell is a senior assistant district attorney hes got every right to be here batiste took another step forward no question sir so youve decided to charge this woman you want us to take her upstairs and book her hardy didnt know batiste well but suddenly he decided he admired him there was no irony in his tone in fact it was punctiliously correct he was telling the district attorney that if he had his facts right they should proceed with the next administrative step he was also calling lockes bluff the district attorney stood there flatfooted the room even without the media felt jammed and overheated locke batiste powell terrell manion nancy hardy three other homicide guys who happened to be there when it began locke for the first time looked at nancy distephano who was leaning wearily against the doorjamb to the interrogation room her arms crossed protecting her broken ribs i havent read the arresting officers report locke said i was under the impression he stopped after i read it ill make my decision powell followed him out no commenting all the way down the hall in the homicide room there was a long silence finally batiste spoke to terrell the district attorneys office hires its own investigators walt you want to be one go apply ill expedite the paperwork he walked into his office hardy walked back over to nancy who by now looked to be on the verge of fainting hardy got her to the chair helped her down she was panting from the exertion glitsky joined them she could have called freeman or you i told her you were probably closer hardy put a hand on glitskys shoulder squeezing it a thank you how about i take you home nancy she was obviously in pain but she looked up at him shaking her head would you mind id like to see jennifer if thats okay after a short rest she felt she could handle the walk to the elevators the short ride to the seventh floor when she got out of the elevator into the barred bullpen outside the heavy doors of the jail nancy put her hand to her mouth a caricature of shock except hardy was certain it was genuine there was the liniment of sweat smell familiar to him the way the sounds rang if they were close by the elevator the lock in the bullpen door keys jangling far off halfheard haunting voices were muffled yet the low hum was constant they heard somebody scream the crash of something being thrown it was dinnertime nancy clutched at his arm i didnt know it was she didnt finish she didnt have to nobody knew what it was like until theyd been there i should have come down but phil hardy knew that one too phil wouldnt let her hed gotten permission for nancy to enter the tiny attorneys room at the womens jail he was by the door as it opened when they led jennifer in nancy was sitting across the small room she bit her lip her face tilted up the door closed did they tell you about your father jennifer nodded her hands flat against her sides nancy stood up took a tentative step forward toward her daughter jenn she barely whispered it oh mom they stood there unmoving nancy held her hands out and jennifer moved to her uncertainly they came together embracing nancys arms around her daughters neck her face twisted with the agony of her broken ribs but not letting go squeezing from hardys perspective as tight as she could i have to find it no freeman said youve got to drop it i dont have anything else the woman doesnt have any friends shes got a mother but thats the only trace of her past shes legally as sane as you or me this is the only chance ive got to pursue it they were in hardys office it was closing on eleven he had remained in the interview room a fly on the wall for the hour that mother and daughter had talked or more precisely tried to reestablish some connection it had been strained a lot of the time with long silences and frequent tears but they had held hands throughout and everything was personal they never mentioned jennifers case after leaving the jail and making sure nancy was okay to get herself home in a cab he had come directly here freeman of course was working late already on a new murder as well as prepearing jennifers appeal now freeman was listening to his tenant and sometime partner who had swept half his files off his desk and was raving out of frustration and fatigue you know how many people ive talked to these six months and what do i have to show for it ive got jennifers mother and jennifers shrink and the jury wont believe her shrink thats it thats my case to save the womans life youve got jennifer herself leave it to freeman he had eye for detail oh theres a good idea hardy pacing stepped over a stack of folders call jennifer so she can look the jury in the eye and say if you vote to execute me then you can go fuck yourselves thatll soften em right up freeman had gone around to sit behind hardys desk in his chair thats really all youve got hardy stopped thats what ive been trying to tell you david shes totally separated from the world as if you didnt know shes too pretty to have other women trust her and shes not the platonic type with me except for her son she didnt seem to give kids the time of day after ned killed her cat she never even had another pet juries love cat lovers why didnt she get another one the fact is i havent found a soul whos got anything good to say about jennifer witt hardy leaned over and started picking up the files hed thrown i really think im right david i know simpson crane found someone there screwing up do you also really think they killed larry or had him killed at least its a reason so is the abortion remember weve been all through this dismas didnt jennifers brother hate larry too and isnt the union squabble with simpson crane just as good as your scan idea might he in fact have been killed over that i dont know i have no idea what restoffer found there it doesnt really matter but obviously it was enough to keep him interested all throughout the primary investigation wasnt it freemans point was clear enough though hardy wasnt in the mood to hear it he knew that any event in life could support an almost infinite number of possibilities even plausible scenarios to explain them if imagination were the only criterion trials would never end so long as attorneys were allowed to introduce another way something might have happened without regard to evidence which was why overworked as they were courts were intolerant of hearsay fabrication unsupported theories at a trial somebody had to see it smell it touch it or taste it then swear to it because in real life it had only happened one way and the courts job perhaps more than justice was making sure the story was righteous in synch with the evidence hardy sat on the floor picking up folders what am i going to do david i wasnt entirely kidding before freeman told him first id let her mother get up but then id call jennifer but you didnt even do that that was a different situation i had the luxury or thought i did you dont this is the last card the jury has got to get a chance to know her see who she is beyond powell will eat her he well may she may condemn herself its a risk he brightened but then lifes a risk my boy besides whats your option john lescroart hardy th juror the the kids werent awake yet a miracle it was just past six and frannie was reading the morning paper in the middle of the story even though charges werent being filed the mother of the convicted killer had killed her husband and that was hot news so powell in spite of hardys efforts had achieved his goals not only was his name and picture again on the front page the jury would get a glimpse of how the distephanowitt women solved their problems they killed their husbands they make it sound almost biblical frannie said like some curse through the generations hardy nodded wearily in his life he had probably been more tired but he couldnt remember when he hadnt gotten home last night until after midnight hadnt been able to get to sleep for at least an hour after that i just hope the jury doesnt see it that way frannie put the paper down something in her husbands voice are you going to lose its a possibility the prince of understatement frannie wrestled with the awful thought can i do anything like what i dont know help you in some way any way she reached across the table and took his hand i feel real bad about this you know like ive deserted jennifer they convicted her what am i supposed to think what am i supposed to do i just couldnt keep on denying you dont have to explain anything to me frannie shes one difficult woman she drives people away frannie bit her lip squeezed her hand what will happen i mean if you lose if powell get elected and stays on the case her odds on appeal go way down hell be the attorney general and shes his baby i mean even if he wanted to which he doesnt it would be hard for him politically to do anything but keep pushing this is just so wrong hardy covered frannies hand its not over yet he was going to have nancy take the stand then jennifer a society reporter named lucy pratt was in the newsroom at the los angeles times when hardy called from sutter street an hour later that early in the morning the place was deserted and she was happy to talk to somebody about her work a lot of people wanted to move on to hard news but she loved being a society reporter she loved people she didnt like violence world problems all that stuff she told hardy that sure she knew who margaret morency was in fact just the last weekend they had run her picture she and her fiance had hosted a wineandcheese auction to benefit the san marino library for some reason hardy said i thought she was this old woman san marino old money you know ms pratt laughed over the line old money doesnt mean youre old at least not with margaret i dont think shes thirty yet i could fax you her picture she was one of the rose court in you know hardy thought a picture wouldnt be necessary the weddings going to be at the huntington in december lucy said the whole towns talking about it hardy doubted whether the folks say in south central were as excited about the upcoming nuptials as lucy was but she seemed to be a nice kid so he listened it seemed the polite question before he said goodbye so he asked it whos the fiance its a real cinderella story she said jodys from the west side but down in the flats not exactly brentwood but now is that jody bachman the lawyer thats the lucky man do you know him sure hardy said all lawyers know each other its like a big fraternity lucy laughed again she sure had good manners though he doubted she got the joke he left a message with restoffer even with the cold he wanted time to think so he walked across market a block out of his way down th you took your life in your hands on th to the hall he rounded up powell and they caught villars alone in her chambers in that he was fortunate although she was less than delighted to see them i hope youve got something prepared for today mr hardy she began im not entertaining any continuance motions you still want to see me hardy said he did and she turned her back to him going back to the slingback chair where she had been reading the paper having her morning coffee but she didnt settle instead she lowered herself onto the outside of the chair and pointed a finger the time for personal appeal is after the jurys decision villars was referring to the orchestrated ballet that surrounded deathpenalty cases in california even after the jury returned with a verdict of death that was not the end of it the defense filed an automatic motion for a new trial on almost any grounds and without any prejudice in other words without a mistrial in the jargon the judge became the thirteenth juror in practice such motions were seldom granted if a judge sitting as the thirteenth juror did in fact overturn a verdict and a sentence after the time and expense of a jury trial the da by exercising his right to challenge out of any courtroom would make it hard for that person to find work still villars was tough and superior court judges it was true could amass a great deal of power hardy remained standing powell sat down silent listening i wanted to get a ruling on something he said and told her what he had discovered that morning about jody bachman and margaret morency she didnt interrupt him so your honor i have a member of the ybmg board who called off restoffers investigation in los angeles who is also engaged to the attorney for the group i think the jury should hear about this villars finally sat back how did this woman call off the police investigation she called kelso the supervisor l he passed it along to the chief do you have proof of that hardy knew this was the tough sell ms morency both contributed to kelsos campaign and is on the ybmg board i know it was kelso who called the chief after restoffer interrogated bachman villars spoke slowly now thats not proof the standard is less in this phase your honor im trying to get the jury to lingering doubt villars waited for more hardy gave it to her your honor these at least are facts not conjecture simpson crane was killed with his own gun there is a connection the group okay its tenuous but its there between these men and a line running through jody bachman and a lot of money unaccounted for cranes murder investigation is closed down the fiance of the groups attorney has access and leverage over kelso let the jury see all this and maybe theyll start to wonder about it its not just my theory it springs from the facts villars considered another moment but its a house of cards may i your honor villars nodded and powell stood up i took a hard line with you here yesterday mr hardy but in spite of what you may believe i am not anxious to see anyone condemned to death so after we adjourned last night do you know what i did i called down to los angeles and spoke to the head of homicide who referred me to the chief of police the homicide department is positive unquote that simpson crane was assassinated by someone paid by machinists local down there its not a closed case although this inspector restoffer isnt on it anymore its gone federal with rico there is again i quote no suspicion that he was killed by someone with the yerba buena medical group still they called restoffer off villars was following it all closely even taking some notes powell sighed evidently the inspector was a little miffed at the federal intervention when he thought he saw a way back in its a highprofile case he stepped on a few toes he was called off because he was hassling people because he wasnt being a good cop standing up not in her robes the judge might have been a friendly grandmother and her voice had no edge now mr hardy ive listened carefully to you one last time now im talking to you and i hope you listen to me all of what you say may be true as far as it toes there may be all kinds of financial shenanigans going on down in los angeles but it doesnt concern this case and where it might appear to intersect it still falls under coincidence larry witt just wasnt involved in any of this or if he was theres no evidence of it he called crane amp crane about this did he talk to crane himself or bachman and if so about what is there any telling she shook her head im sorry mr hardy i really am i can see you are trying your damnedest as you should but im not going to admit unsubstantiated theories and thats what this is she was moving him with her toward the door and now please excuse me ive got two hours of brief ive got to wade through in she looked at her watch forty minutes evidently a lot of people in the courtroom had read the morning paper or seen the news on television when hardy called nancy to the stand the reaction was audible she was sitting in the first gallery row next to dr lightner directly behind hardy and jennifer and she stood stiffly the way a person would be expected to stand with taped and broken ribs she still had the bandage over her nose her eyes black and swollen reporters were snapping photos as she inched painfully toward the center aisle villars was not having this she had allowed cameras inside the courtroom up to this time so long as their use was unobtrusive but this action crossed her line she rapped her gavel thats enough pictures all of you sit down as of this moment im forbidding cameras in this courtroom anybody whos got one can leave now bailiffs make sure that they do the bailiffs moved up to the rail in the ensuing hubbub as reporters either left with their own cameras or gave them to assistants to remove nancy distephano made it through the rail stopping at the defense table jennifer reached over and the two women held hands briefly wordlessly her mother straightened up and forced herself to the front of the courtroom to be sworn in hardy assumed his position about ten feet in front of the witness box mrs distephano what is your relationship to the defendant im her mother apparently not everyone had known what the earlier commotion surrounding this witness was about because this admission caused another ripple of sound across the back of the courtroom villars didnt act so hardy had to wait for it to subside mrs distephano may i call you nancy sure hardy reasoned that his best odds were to face it headon for the jurys benefit nancy i wonder if you could tell us about your injuries powell jumped up objection your honor irrelevant amazingly villars asked for an argument before her ruling mr hardy your honor mrs witt grew up in her mothers home the person she has become was formed there the jury should be aware of this environment villars said she would allow the line of questioning hardy thanked her it seemed to him that he and the judge had perhaps by osmosis reached some accord it might be the more relaxed rule governing admissibility in this phase of the trial but he sensed it was something more hardy approached the witness stand nancy youve recently been released from the hospital is that right yes would you tell us the extent of your injuries nancy described the broken ribs broken nose the kidney damage that caused her to urinate blood the bruises on her breasts torso thighs and how did you sustain these injuries my husband beat me up the courtroom was rapt silent your husband phil distephano the natural father of the defendant yes and was this the first time hed beaten you talking about it nancy was starting to withdraw to hunch her shoulders the way her daughter did or was it more the other way around she shook her head and villars leaned over speaking quietly youll have to answer with words please no nancy said it wasnt the first time to give her a moment hardy stepped toward the jury box turned to look at his client jennifer was frowning not liking this hardy came back to nancy did your husband beat you often the witness shook her head then remembering said yes how long has it been since your daughter the defendant moved out of the house about ten years and before she moved out did you suffer these beatings at the hands of her father yes its always been there phil would drink too much and get mad about something and hit me and did this ever happen in jennifers sight yes did he ever hit your daughter she shook her head no he threatened a couple of times but i wouldnt let him i got between them he loved her tears had begun to show on her cheeks he just lost control he just lost control hardy repeated taking a few steps again toward the jury he continued in your opinion nancy did this pattern of your husband beating you have any obvious effect on jennifers behavior nancy was toughing it out letting the tears come but as jennifer did she spoke clearly through them we didnt talk about it afterward this wasnt the answer to the question but it moved toward it you didnt talk about what they just happened and then they went away and everything went back to being the same you denied that this was happening the family denied it yes we just pretended and jennifer she got more and more quiet and then she moved out youd say she became withdrawn moody mistrustful this was leading her all over the meadow but he was allowed to do it in this phase and it would he hoped go a long way to explain to the jury jennifers apparent callousness in the face of the authority of the court yes nancy looked over at her daughter she was such a sweet little girl she was my baby girl although she was maintaining her composure nancys emotion lay over her like a blanket her face was blotching with tears villars leaned over again mrs distephano would you like to take break they were moving on nancy did your daughter ever talk about how she felt about matt matt was her life matt was her life he took in the jury then went back to the witness she loved her son completely oh god yes did you ever see any sign at all that she ever mistreated him abused him anything like that no nothing if anything i thought she was a little overprotective maybe she spoiled him more than i would have but i understand where that came from and where was that well what shed seen her father and me larry was the same way overprotective they just didnt want anything bad to happen to matt this was good it put larry and jennifer on the same side back at the defense table jennifer was staring straight ahead crying without a sound nancy hardy said abruptly could your daughter have killed matt her son even by mistake he held his breath waiting she shook her head no if she did even by accident like you say she would have killed herself powell got up slowly he knew this was emotional testimony and he didnt want to appear callous himself but he felt he had to object to the speculation villars sustained him but hardy at least had what he wanted he went on to his last prepared questions and to the answer he expected but that he believed was genuine what are your feelings for your daughter now i love her she said shes all i have left powell knew he had his work cut out for him especially since villars had denied a recess before his cross here was an emotionally charged physically abused woman and his job was to discredit her take her apart if he was going to be effective it had to be a slow dance he smiled breaking the ice he had no doubt that she remembered him from the previous night in the homicide detail but he had no choice he couldnt come out swinging he was going to be her friend just clarifying a few little things her shoulders were forward hunched defensive but she gave him a tentative smile it was a start mrs distephano you and your late husband also have a son dont you this from out of left field put her off balance yes tom and was tom ever the victim of your husbands abuse phil hit tom a few times when he was younger but it was more like just spankings he never hurt him and how are the two men now are they close hardy stood up your honor if it please the court mr powell knows full well that mr distephano is deceased it was casual and hardys phrasing of the objection sidestepped the overt admission tha nancy had killed him if anyone didnt already know powell gestured apologetically did tom ever witness your husband beating you yes just like jennifer did yes i mean until later what happened later well later when tom got older hed like he tried to protect me so phil would make sure tom wasnt around but that wasnt the case with jennifer im sorry what wasnt your late husband phil would hit you even if jennifer was around sometimes and she didnt try to stop it she couldnt stop my husband i couldnt she stopped realizing that finally she had done just that he was too strong jennifer just hid i think so jennifer hid and watched her father beat you up without trying to help you in any way but your son tom tried to step in how do you feel about your son now tom hes a good boy you love him of course hes my son and of course mothers love their sons yes powell let that sink in and yet you testified that jennifer was all you had left nancy glanced in panic around the room then looked at hardy he nodded it was okay she was doing fine that was just a figure of speech she said shes the only daughter i have left and are you very close to her yes very close youre very close i see can you tell the jury roughly how many times in the past year before your daughter was arrested that you visited her at her house hardy put a hand to his forehead the trap was going to spring here jennifer had her hand on his arm nancy hesitated sitting back now for the first time seconds crept by mrs distephano villars prodded please answer the question powell waited some more he wasnt pressing it was an obvious and simple question hanging in the room no one least of all nancy was apt to have forgotten it not last year she said at last you didnt visit your daughters home during the last year no not at all no powell did a threesixty his expressive face showing every nuance of his deep surprise well how about the year before that nancy started to sound a little snappish no we didnt see them very much larry was larry didnt want us to larry didnt want you to powell sparing nancys feelings a good guy tried to find a way out for her then with your very close relationship you and jennifer must have spoken on the phone quite a lot she looked down she was very busy your daughter was busy did she have a job i had a job i have a job which left nights and weekends is that right hardy stood up your honor this is badgering overruled powell asked again just approximately mrs distephano how often did you and your daughter speak nancy kept her eyes down every week once a month she always called on my birthday i always called on hers powell let the words speak for themselves he nodded then walked back to the prosecution table id like to explore one last point youve told us mrs distephano that matt was jennifers life that she even spoiled him i wonder if you could be more specific again the eyes came to hardy pleading for help what do you mean i mean if you didnt see much of jennifer and matt which youve just told us how do you know how she felt about him or how she treated him well when he was younger when he was a baby matt was jennifers life then yes and now yes powell was still trying to seem gentle generous he came close to the witness box speaking softly mrs distephano i just dont see how you can know please help me here nancy sat quietly for an hours worth of fifteen seconds finally hardy stood and asked if a question had been asked powell gave it some more time then sighed saying he supposed not mrs distephano could sit down finally after lunch the defendant took the stand she wore a taupecolored suit with a bright multicolored scarf hardy wasnt sure how he felt about the outfit it gave out conflicting messages on the one hand it cut jennifer away even further from the common thread shared by the rest of the people on the jury which was not good she needed their empathy not their envy but he had to admit and statistics supported it that there was a subtle dynamic at work in deathpenalty cases a natural reaction he guessed although not a particularly noble one a jury would only be likely to vote for the death penalty if it had become convinced that the defendant was in some tangible way a kind of monster a deformity cut off from the bonds of humanity to avoid this impression shallow as it might be jennifers clothes would help looking as she did dressed as she was she was very much a human presence not a nonperson certainly not a monster more than that there was something in her physical beauty and carriage that was generally highly valued in america hardy hoped the jury especially the men would not be inclined to vote to turn this suffering beauty into a corpse of course his fear in calling her to the stand was that by opening her mouth she would break the spell cast by her appearance and hardy well knew that from behind that appearance might erupt someone to turn off even the most predisposed in her favor they had discussed the format for this testimony and had decided that jennifer should say what she had to in her most modulated voice she would be her best self the risk would come with powells crossexamination meanwhile hardy tread lightly jennifer youre up here today to argue for your very life is there anything you would like the jury and the judge to know she turned to them i know that you have found the evidence was enough to convict me swallowing nervous she looked at hardy who nodded im really not here to make an argument for my life as mr hardy says im here to tell you that i did not do any of this i did not kill my husband i certainly did not kill my son she swallowed again i admit i may not have been the greatest mom in the world but i loved matt again she stopped bit down on her lower lip gathering herself she forced a weak smile i guess thats all powell was scribbling furiously about what hardy had intended to question her some about larry but this statement was so clean that he was tempted to stop right there the jury now had heard her deny the killings with her own voice it just might be all he needed or at least the best he was going to get but on the other side the jury might feel it was too easy to fake something so short he felt he had to bring her out a little more as freeman had said life was a risk do you want to tell us about the morning of december powell stood up your honor this testimony belonged in the guilt phase of this trial hardy had to get in a word before villars ruled this is jennifer witts story and the jury deserves to hear it your honor the judge frowned as she always did when counsel went at each other then she agreed with hardy turning to jennifer she said tell us about that morning mrs witt jennifer nodded i got up early because wed had dinner late and i hadnt done the dishes from the night before and larry was going to be home all day all week really so i wanted to be sure the house was perfect i wanted to go jogging later which i usually did so i just put on my running clothes and went downstairs it got pretty late maybe eightthirty but it was larrys vacation and i thought he should be able to sleep in if he wanted then finally he came down matt was still sleeping he was a good sleeper nice touch hardy thought shamelessly anyway larry reads the paper in the morning with his breakfast its just something he always does she paused collecting herself i mean he always did but this morning he came down angry over what hardy said she swallowed hard i wasnt dressed right didnt you say you were in your running clothes she nodded but that wasnt going to be for an hour or so you see i guess i still looked like i just rolled out of bed i mean my hair and no makeup but hadnt you just been up for a while cleaning house doing the dishes jennifer might not wasnt to talk about larry beating her but this was good stuff for her saint larry was taking a few hits and hardy was trying to keep jennifer swinging well yes but he just didnt like it did he yell at you no i could just tell he was upset you know i think so jennifer hardy included the jury and then what happened well i got his coffee and then i tried to rub his shoulders which he liked when he was tense about something but he shrugged me off he shrugged you off you mean he physically moved you away powell seemed to be willing to let him lead the witness and hardy would use a leash if he had to but jennifer wouldnt go along no you know he just didnt want me to look this way so i told him id go upstairs to change if he wanted me to even though you were still going running in an hour she nodded if he wanted it wasnt a big deal to me but then he told me not to bother he said hed been awake for an hour upstairs going over our bills he was worried about money christmas you know that sort of thing and what happened then it got to be a family budget argument jennifer was facing the jury you know everybody has them all right and then what then matt came down rubbing his eyes like he did when he woke up i didnt like to have matt hear us arguing and yelling so i stopped and went into the kitchen and made him some french toast which was his favorite then i went upstairs to make the beds i thought maybe it would all blow over and did it blow over no when i came down larry started in again on how i looked he thought id gone upstairs to change into something decent i told him i was going running now but he was still mad about the other about everything so we had more words and matt was crying i thought i could make it stop if i left so i did you went out running yes and what time did you leave the house i dont know i walked down a couple of blocks which is what i always do to warm up then i started running she told it well the stop at the bank her return to the house the inventory where she didnt list the gun as missing because she hadnt gone back into the bedroom hardy was coming to the opinion that in his fear over jennifers abrasive personality freeman had badly erred in not putting her on the stand she had a consistent story to tell and she told it well her voice gaining in confidence as she went on until her direct testimony came to an end just before they broke for lunch if only she could stand up as well to powells crossexamination id like to start by asking you to clarify something for me is that all right during lunch in the suite hardy had let her savor her partial victory for a few moments and then thought hed best begin to prepare her for powells expected onslaught perhaps it would work she was facing powell calmly now her eyes clear as she nodded youve said and i quote i didnt kill my husband i certainly did not kill my son do you mean that youre not as certain that you didnt kill larry this was a getyourgoat question and as such hardy thought it was good strategy but he wasnt about to let powell get away with it argumentative your honor whats the substance of that question villars agreed jennifer did not have to answer but hardy could see that the question had rattled her already chipped at her reserve he caught her eye and halflifted a palm keep cool jennifer dont let it get to you powell smiled at the defendant and started again if you dont mind mrs witt id like to clear up one part of your story i still dont understand youve testified that when you came back downstairs after making the beds and so on that you and your husband started fighting again larry started yelling again yes and matt started crying yes and as a mother your response to your sons crying was to leave the house i tried to stop it by leaving yes i see that but how did you try to comfort your son did you hug him tell him you loved him no not then i thought when the fight between larry and me stopped hed stop and that was the point wasnt it to get him to stop well no i mean he would so you just walked out on him hardy stood up asked and answered your honor disastrously powell withdrew the question before hardy could be sustained he stepped closer to the witness box all right mrs witt on another subject youve mentioned that you and your husband had this fight about money family budgets the kind we all have is that right yes and your husband dr witt was looking over your family budget before coming down to breakfast yes powell had something hardy realized relaxed taking his time he went back to the prosecution table and took a document from morehouse he walked back to the center of the courtroom your honor i have here a copy of a statement of an account of mrs witts from pioneers bank id like to introduce it into evidence as peoples jennifer visibly tensed hardys stomach tightened as powell came over to his table to show him the bank statement he decided to buy her some time your honor sidebar the judge scowling motioned powell and hardy forward what is it now mr hardy your honor this document wasnt on the peoples evidence list during discovery counsel for both sides were supposed to present the other side with complete lists of witnesses they intended to call and physical evidence they intended to present neither witnesses nor evidence had to be used but if they were not listed beforehand they normally could not be used in theory at least the courtroom was not a place to spring surprises in practice attorneys loved it when it worked out that way i object to its introduction now hardy said counsel is mistaken your honor powell was now holding up the thick sheaf these are the papers a complete copy of which we presented to defense counsel on he paused checking another page august hardy and freeman had of course received this package it was undoubtedly somewhere in hardys office among the seven book boxes filled with statements interviews police reports because powell hadnt seen fit to introduce it in the guilt phase hardy had allowed himself the faint hope that powell hadnt noticed it in the mass of documents no such luck the financial package powell now held was threeandahalf inches thick and contained nearly fivehundred pages of the witts past tax statements insurance forms bank accounts iras stock records copies of canceled checks receipts for most of their household items none of it was in any order and there was no index a ton of camouflage for the one thing that was going to hurt jennifer the one page statement revealing the existence of her secret account powell was flipping through the pages upon pages of photocopied copies of canceled checks until he found it hidden among them here it is your honor villars leaned over adjusted her reading glasses nodded there it is mr hardy it was entered into evidence and powell descended on jennifer now mr s witt take a look at peoples here is this your account the clear look in her eyes was gone panic had taken up residence there and hardy was not much help he felt it himself jennifer nodded yes thats my account did your husband know about this account jennifer swallowed yes of course hardy knew that perjury wasnt much compared to murder but he hated to hear the lie anyway even though he understood why she told it mrs witt would you read to the jury the address on that statement jennifer glanced at the copy she held po box san francisco california a post office box statements from this account werent sent to your home no and why was that mrs witt wideeyed jennifer turned to hardy i dont know you dont know powells voice rose and grew deeper you dont know he repeated isnt it true mrs witt that your husband had no knowledge of this account no land that he had discovered that something was wrong with your family budget what hed discovered was that you had been lying to him about money no thats not true but as hardy knew it was true and powell wasnt finished he backed up a step lowered his voice again came at her from another direction mrs witt have you received any money yet from your late husbands insurance thrown by the change in tack jennifer might have thought for a moment that powell was easing off she said she hadnt did you and larry have a large savings account no not really i think about twenty thousand something like that powell turned to the jury some people might call that large mrs witt but ill take your word for it then we had matts college fund jennifer not knowing where he was going was trying to be helpful that was about another twenty and what about the house hardy jumped up your honor where is this going powell turned to him then back ill tell you where its going your honor it clearly demonstrates that these murders happened because of greed he held up the pioneers bank statement again wound up now powell turned back to jennifer mrs witt this account of yours that got mailed to a post office box how much money did it contain when you were arrested for these murders jennifer studied her hands ill tell you how much it contained if you dont remember its here in these statements its a little over threehundredthousand dollars mrs witt money you had been stealing from your husband for almost seven years money you embezzled from your own household jennifer lost it voice shrill we never went out dont you understand that he never let me do anything you dont know what it was like what he was like he never even missed it but he did that morning didnt he mrs witt and your beloved matt was in the way too objection you didnt grab the gun in the heat of the fight you had planned the basics for some time your honor objection you went upstairs to get the gun objection hardys voice had gone up several octaves villars banged on her gavel powell rolled over both of them at the top of his voice moving closer to jennifer now suddenly this became the moment when you must act he said he was taking his money back isnt that it finally in her faceisnt that why you killed him exploding out of the witness chair nearly knocking it over jennifer lunged at powell her face distorted no i didnt kill him you son of a bitch sit down all of you mr powell villars slammed her gavel jennifer out of control was screaming order order bailiffs but even the bailiffs stood back letting jennifer wind down until spent she pulled the chair upright again and lowered herself back into it powell stared at her his shoulders sagged i just dont understand why you had to kill matt he whispered turning he said he had no further questions it took the jury two ballots two hours and seventeen minutes it was as the law prescribed it had to be unanimous and it was for the penalty of death part five hardy woke up sweating gasping for air the green room closing in around him as the almondscented corrosive gas burned its way down his windpipe into his lungs exploding them inward leaving him in mute agony in his dream the scream woke him in life in this style of death the scream would be silent choked off the instant it was born it was all right he was in his bedroom frannie curled in sleep next to him the clock next to the bed said it was a little after three oclock hed been asleep almost two hours he got up and went naked into the bathroom to throw water on his face hed been sweating his hair was stuck to the side of his head gulping water and aspirin he pulled at the skin around his eyes the blackened circles under them didnt smudge away at the front of his house still undressed he sat in his armchair it was cold colder than it ever got after a couple of minutes he heard footsteps and frannie was next to him bad dream she sat on his lap her arms around his neck youre all clammy she said he couldnt talk her hands moved over his head smoothing his hair he had his arms around her and held her tight against him im going to get a blanket when she got back he was shivering he couldnt stop she put the blanket over him then went to get another comforter when she returned he was out again breathing heavily she tucked the extra blanket around him rubbed a hand across his damp and burning forehead and lay down in the windowseat under an afghan her head on a sitting pillow near her husbands knees he woke up again it seemed to be a long time before dawn still in the chair he listened in the darkness trying to hear something beyond the sounds of his quiet house frannie breathing on the windowseat beside him the aquarium gurgling away in the back in their bedroom something he thought it might have been a noise had gotten into his consciousness a chill shook him bringing with it a sudden jolt of fear if he was on to what he thought he was suppose there was someone trying to make it impossible for him to tell what he might know he didnt remember getting into bed he didnt remember getting to this chair or why frannie was here throwing off the blanket he realized he must have come in taken off his shoes and collapsed his guns his guns from his cop days were locked in his safe when rebecca had moved into what had been his office he had moved the safe out behind the kitchen on the top shelf over his workbench now woozy and stumbling he forced himself up back through the house turning on lights as he went the safe was untouched he opened it the guns were still there he really was losing it no one was coming for him not here not at his home and then it occurred to him that maybe larry witt had thought the same thing and so had simpson crane and both had been shot with their own weapons in their own houses ridiculous the in his hand shivering he decided hed finish making sure there wasnt much of the house left to check vincents room rebeccas his own bedroom he passed back through the kitchen dining room living room back up the long hallway turning lights off behind him nothing he was crazy he looked at the loaded gun in his hand knowing that this was how domestic accidents occurred a halfdark house a wife or child walking in unexpectedly while the husband holds a loaded weapon thining hes heard somebody break in that somebody might have a reason to he went back to the work room as he was putting the damn thing back in the safe it came to him suddenly his legs went mushy on him no it was too grotesque to consider he had to sit larry had finally hit matt and more than once maybe matt had come in during the fight and taken sides with his mother pulling at his dad to leave his mom alone and larry had lost it entirely with the boy smashing the gun he was holding into the side of his face and then realizing what hed done that this couldnt be covered up or undone the boy maybe with a broken jaw a living indictment of what larry had become of who he really was his career would be over his carefully ordered totally controlled life and in a beat as matt lay on the floor by the bathroom and jennifer begged him to stop the only solution had come to him destroy the evidence of what hed done a bullet would erase any sign that hed ever hit his son they could never say that and then there would be nothing left no point in continuing your life so you turn the gun on yourself but before he does he turns to jennifer and says this is all your fault and being who she is she at that moment and beyond believes him hardy on the floor in the workroom followed it through to the end but of course it couldnt have happened that way the gun being gone eliminated that possibility except if jennifer blaming herself as she always did for the fight and everything it precipitated removed the gun herself took it to the dumpster that way it wouldnt be larrys fault the precious reputation of dr larry witt would be saved and she jennifer shed get what she deserved for having started it for being who she was it was too twisted it couldnt have been that and yet some of it did fit jennifers unyielding denial that she had killed her son and husband and more chillingly he thought it fit her profile selfhatred guilt the need to be punished because in fact her immediate feeling when it was done was her guilty joy that larry was dead shed hated him hated everything hed done though she almost couldnt physically bear the loss of matt it didnt in that first instant flush diminish her overriding happiness that larry was gone that she was free of him at last and if she could feel that way right after losing her son then she had to feel she truly was without a sould and deserved whatever punishment society gave her in fact she would help it she had helped it she was doing this to herself hardy leaned back against the wall feverish this wasnt what happened it couldnt have been what happened he had other ideas he had to explore and they made a lot more sense he was delirious you cant do it today hardys fever had leveled at which was also the age he felt he was on his third cup of black coffee having forced himself to down some hash toast and orange juice the appointments at nine ive got to go ive only got three days three days until villars the thirteenth juror gave the final ruling on the verdict tuesday at am hardy had his automatic motion to set aside the verdict due at that time and in spite of everything thought he still at least had a chance to reduce the sentence to life in prison if oly he could find something to bring villars to it something she could find admissible after the verdict he had spent half the night with jennifer talking about options he held back his trump on his own he had decided that he would at least lay out the batteredwoman issue to villars if it was the only thing that could mitigate death but in the meanwhile he had filled jennifer in on the ybmg situation and she had authorized him to go wherever he had to and do whatever was needed to get any proof he could at least she now wanted to live his first step at eight on a friday night had been calling the chairman of ybmg dr clarence stone lived in san francisco and persuaded by hardys urgency had cleared an hour in his home on a saturday morning for him so flu or no hardy had to go rebecca and vincent were playing with leggos in the nursery frannie said look youre sick youve been working around the clock you havent been home in a month youve got to take care of yourself he tried to smile through the haze thats my plan i will soon promise vincent let out a wail and frannie rushed to the back of the house hardy slowly got up and more slowly grabbing handholds as he passed them so he wouldnt fall down made his way to the nursery door vincent had caught his finger in one of the joints of the stroller and rebecca had sent up a sympathetic wail turning his head away from her he picked her up and bounced her in his arms in a minute or so the kids in their arms they bundled back to the kitchen frannie holding vincent was getting a piece of ice cream from the freezer to put on the pinch cant you just appeal like everyone else she said peel what rebecca asked banana peel vincent looked over frannies shoulder for the banana peel repeating it they started to chant banana peel banana peel it continued getting louder his kids were some comedians it was great that they loved each other had the same sense of humor this banana peel game was funny funny funny a real laugh riot hardy thought his head was going to levitate without him attached now of course the kids wanted bananas and predictably they were out of bananas you feel good enough to go out why dont you take them to the store and buy some he knew she was justified to some degree in feeling this way but that didnt make him appreciate her at the moment both of them she continued mommy needs a break clarence stone live in a mansion in the seacliff area geographically less than a mile from hardys house and psychologically in another galaxy the short walk from the head of the circular drive to the front door wiped hardy out he took nearly a minute getting his breath before he rang the doorbell a bona fide butler admitted him and they walked a long hallway their footfalls swallowed by the thick oriental runner the butler ushered him into a libraryoffice where a whitehaired man with a clipped mustache sat at a desk that rivaled the one in freemans office for expanse he wore a maroon silk robe and was writing with a fountain pen when hardy was introduced he finished writing put down the pen stood he was wearing black slacks under the robe came around the desk and offered his hand you dont look good son hardy didnt doubt it he also didnt feel good hed had chills driving over the thick fog seemed to insulate against any warmth or even light the heater in the car had been turned up high blasting him but it hadnt helped touch of the flu hardy said thats all stone the doctor told his butler to bring in some tea with lots of lemon and honey he had hardy sit down on a club chair and remove his coat he asked his permission to look him over no charge you getting much sleep you ought to stay in bed with this you know through his chattering teeth hardy laughed weakly i got my eight hours this week im fine stone had an oldfashioned black doctors satchel and he set it on the floor now taking out some instruments he listened to hardys chest stuck an instantread thermometer into his ear looked in his ears and at his throat yep youve got the flu the tea arrived and stone prepared a couple of glasses this must be important he said you really shouldnt be out walking around it is important hardy said he had his coat back on and pulled it close around him stone sat kittycorner to him turned in last night you said it concerned ybmg assuming stone was familiar with the background hardy gave him the short version concluding with larry witts concern over the timing and tone of the offering circular when he had finished stone did not answer immediately you know many doctors mr hardy hardy nodded some you know how many people try to sell them things he held up his hand no ill tell you not a day goes by that the average successful doctor doesnt get ten stock brochures two or three creditcard applications offers of linesofcredit you name it even if you go to the trouble of trying to get the post office to eliminate all this solicitation mail youre inundated believe me ive tried its out of our control all right all right but you seem to think a flashy presentation highprofile sales pitch is going to matter it is not we get them every day in fact the board specifically decided to issue a lowkey circular rather than a sensational one we didnt want to raise hopes in the groups future success after it went forprofit it was entirely within the realm of the possible that we could have gone under altogether no one certainly no one on the board anticipated pacrims interest or the windfall what about the short turnaround time you gave everyone it wasnt that short stone sat back apparently relaxed and crossed his legs doctors tend to be fairly literate people mr hardy they can read but like everybody else often they dont act until they have to so you give people a deadline it moves things along besides remember that this was a twentydollar investment at most twenty dollars not the kind of decision youd have to discuss with your wife or lawyer it was straightforward and everybody had an opportunity but not everybody bought stone shrugged nodded if you see a conspiracy in that im afraid we have to part company there it would have been easier if stone had shown the slightest sign of defensiveness but he was sitting so comfortably speaking so moderately and worst of all making such perfect sense hardy leaned forward ali singh said only thirty doctors bought stone agreed perhaps forty im not exactly sure certainly less than wish they had now he spread his arms palms up apologetic but thats the nature of these things who doesnt wish theyd bought apple when it opened or even mcdonalds but dr witt complained even before the windfall do you know that he complained who did he complain to maybe he just wanted to ask for an extension maybe he had a quick question maybe anything i didnt know dr witt personally so i have no idea this interview was taking on a sense of deja vu villars had had the same objections hardy just didnt know he was surmising and hoping but he didnt have a fact another wave of nausea hit him and he leaned back against the seat and closed his eyes mr hardy id better be going he said thank you youve been very helpful taking hardys arm stone walked with him across the room through the door to the hallway you know hardy said ive got one more question if you dont mind what happened to the shares no one bought this was just another administrative detail and stone was forthcoming about it some of them are in an escrow account part of the groups assets others we gave as bonuses some we traded for services such as legal fees stone smiled as a matter of fact yes mr bachman pulled quite a coup on that and we thought we were getting a very good deal an incredible deal in fact they had come to the door stone was still enjoying bachmans cleverness crane normally hits us for twofifty and hour and bachman suggested he handle the paperwork on the turnaround for fifty thousand shares we figured it would be a hundred hours of legal work and the shares were worth twentyfive hundred dollars at the time it was a steal so the board took it and actually it turned out to be more like three hundred hours so we thought wed done very well indeed fifty thousand shares at a nickel a share remember it was peanuts of course now hardy waited well we all made out well i shouldnt begrudge mr bachman he put in a lot of work and hes made us all much wealthier is that a sin how much did he wind up getting stone pursed his lips smiled i suppose thats in the public record i can tell you a little over seven million dollars hardy repeated the number slowly out loud stone agreed it was a great deal now youd better get home and get in bed take aspirin every four hours drink lots of liquids hardy said the doctor smiled right then send me fifty dollars the smile broke into a wide grin sorry forget the fifty dollars force of habit but he didnt go home david freeman was up and about conducting a classical concert hardy wasnt familiar with the piece in his living room hardy threw his briefcase on the floor and sank heavily onto freemans couch pulled a couple of stuffed pillows over him for warmth and watched freeman baton in hand direct his symphony he dozed when he woke up the fog still clung to the windows freeman had thrown a blanket over him it was quiet and the older man was working over his kitchen table reading a file taking notes what time is it hardys bones were too heavy to lift his wrist freeman looked up after two i usually get sick after a trial too i cant be sick hardy tried to straighten up he wasnt entirely successful why did i come here he asked half to himself why are you here what is life the great questions thats why i like you you feel like lunch im starving i dont think i can eat okay freeman however went to the refrigerator and started rummaging around i remember this time hardy got himself pulled up he wrapped the blanket around him jody bachman made seven million dollars the sound of rummaging stopped fifty thousand shares hardy said freemans head appeared above the refrigerator door which was it he asked it was both you mean he got seven million dollars plus fifty thousand shares of stock he shook his head were in the wrong business no he got fifty thousand shares of stock which turned out to be worth seven million dollars abandoning his foraging efforts freeman crossed the small living room and sat at the end of the couch his face was suddenly troubled he scratched at his stubble he took stock as payment is he the managing partner down there yes he took stock no hes not the managing partner why freeman sat back what were the shares worth a nickel each hardy said what are you thinking im thinking maybe you found something i thought that too hardy knew exactly what he thought but he wanted corroboration hed flown off too many times without getting his facts nailed down it wasnt going to happen again im not sure i know what it is though he waited the thought the argument seemed to be blossoming in freemans head he stood up and went to the window studied the fog hardy rode out another bout of the shakes then realized hed broken a sweat he threw off the blanket but then the chills started again turning around freemans face showed distaste you look like hell that said he moved right on coming back to the couch sitting close to hardy and explained his reasoning large corporate firms like crane amp crane did not usually allow associates and junior partners to trade essentially worthless stocks for eminently liquid billable hours jody bachman young and ambitious had somehow put together a deal with pacrim or knew pacrim might be a viable marriage with ybmg freeman said he wasnt sure of the details who could be but bachman then sold his contingency stock idea to the group all of which might have been fine except for simpson crane the managing partner of crane amp crane bachman was putting in hundreds of hours of billable time and not bringing in a dime for his efforts his utilization stunk simpson might have called him on it or bachman might have gone to simpson and asked permission for the contingency but if simpson made a habit of accepting stock with a maximum face value of twentyfive hundred dollars in lieu of a guaranteed fee of seventyfive thousand dollars in cash he wouldnt have a law firm for long he would have said no and that would have ruined jodys plans both for his advancement in the firm and for his own fortune it might have even jeopardized his engagement to his millionaire socialite girlfriend margaret morency if simpson crane were the only thing standing in the way between bachman and everything hed worked for and wanted in his professional and personal life and if simpson had threatened to pull the rug might that be worth killing for simpson might even have threatened to fire him outright freeman certainly would have so there it is freeman concluded how do you like it hardys eyes were burning now and his mouth was parched but he had been paying attention throughout the recital it was close enough to the scenario he had imagined now all he had to do was prove it i give it a nine he said my girlfriend can dance to it freeman looked at him as though he were a martian hardy was getting delirious and freeman told him hed call a cab to take him home he left him sitting on the couch and went to the kitchen to make the call in spite of everyones wellmeaning advice there were no odds in going home he didnt have time to go home he was seeing villars on tuesday morning and if this didnt work out he had to spend monday getting his lastditch motion prepared but this was his best chance this might work he called frannie from the san francisco airport and endured the expected anger she had every right to be angry he hadnt been much of a father or husband in the past months but he was going to make it up to her to the kids this trial had taught him something a lot it was an insane life and he had fallen into it but he was going to get out do something else or do this some other way as soon as this was done first though he was going to finish this when she cooled off shed understand she wouldnt in fact expect any less she was the one after all who had insisted he do all he could to find the truth behind larry witts murder and matts for jennifers sake and now sick or not unless he died trying thats just what he was going to do the plane was scheduled to land in burbank an hour before dusk he was sleeping in a window seat covered with a blanket when the pilot came on announcing their descent he opened his eyes taking in the view two or three times its normal size the sun shimmered through a red haze out over the ocean looking down hardy picked up the maze of freeways winding through the valley the hollywood jammed even now on an early saturday evening the golden state also packed heading downtown the pasadena wasnt yet a parking lot at least not from the air feeling wasted with fatigue and fever he closed his eyes again until they came to the famous complete stop at the gate this he told himself as he tried not to stagger walking to the nearest rentacar booth was a dumb idea but somehow he made it to pasadena he had taken a couple of da training classes at an embassy suites there and had a vague memory of where he was going within an hour of landing he had registered showered left a message for frannie that hed made it and passed out under the covers he slept fourteen hours and woke up in soaked sheets feeling he had a chance to survive it was close to noon sunday october after another shower still shaky he called home again and again no one answered he left another message he was feeling better which wasnt saying much hed try again tonight restoffer picked up after three rings the greeting was cordial enough but when hardy started to brief him on why he had come down here he hadnt gotten out two sentences when he sensed a change an almost ominous reserve restoffer interrupted him you gotta leave this or at least leave me out of it an unwelcome surprise last time theyd talked restoffer had told him hed be around if he was needed now he was backing out did something else happen nothing else happened except your prosecutor called my chief silence but nothing else needed to be said hardy had made some serious problems for floyd restoffer in the months before his pension was going to kick in he didnt want any more ive got to go the line went dead hardy squeezed the receiver now were having fun he said to no one he went into the bathroom and took three more aspirin catching a glimpse of himself in the mirror nice eyes backing up a step he realized the rest of him matched his eyes he needed a shave clean clothes another fourteen hours of sleep he didnt have the courage to take his temperature after pacing the room for fifteen minutes he ordered breakfast from room service then called restoffer again margaret morency is engaged to jody bachman you know that there was a long silence and hardy said ive got to start somewhere floyd im down here i need a little help please restoffers breath echoed on the line hardy waited believe it or not morency is in the book i checked after another moment the cop said san marino and hung up hardy left a message for jody bachman at crane amp crane he was sure it was just an oversight because he was so busy but bachman had never gotten back to him on the larry witt matter now he was down in la today and tomorrow maybe they could get together sometime perhaps for lunch he left the number of his hotel if bachman wanted to call him back also his room number his luck ran out yes clarence stone had been able to see him freeman had come up with pretty much the same conclusion the plane had had an open seat the hotel a vacant room that was it that had been the run of it now restoffer wouldnt talk to him frannie wasnt home bachman wasnt at work on a sunday and margaret morencys phone apparently didnt even have an answering machine steeling himself for the shock hardy drew the shades back the san gabriel mountains rose sparkling in front of him closer in squatting along the rose bowl parade route on colorado boulevard he noticed the low buildings were waging a losing fight with grafitti he pushed open his window the air was fragrant and warm with a latesummer softness to it a new rush of dizziness came over him and he was tempted to yield to the inertia to lay down call it a mistake and fly home this afternoon when he woke up sitting on the bed he flopped onto his back closed his heavy eyes suddenly anger forced him up he was disgusted with himself with his weakness with being sick if he was going to sleep fourteen hours he could have done it at home he hadnt come all the way down here to catch up on his sleep to let a run of bad luck do him in the sitting up cost him another hit of dizziness he knew the fever hadnt broken but hed done a lot yesterday feeling even worse he picked up his shirt soggy and wrinkled it wouldnt do he had to get some clothes he had to keep moving clarence stones home in seacliff had been a nice humanscaled runofthemill mansion margaret morencys place in san marino put things in perspective hardy was getting a lesson in the investment community there were the very comfortable then the rich and then there were the people who had houses that werent visible from the road the drive through the double iron gates would back into a forest of scrub oak up over the crest of a small knoll and disappeared it hadnt been as hard to find as he had expected the huntington library was open on sundays after noon and they carried back issues of the citys weekly society sheet in the past year there had been several charity events as margaret morencys pastille was on swan court pastille was the name of her place after those french breath candies maybe thats how ms morency thought of her home a trifle a confection to soothe the spirit hardy pulled his rentacar up to the gates he had to get out of the car to ring the bell no one had answered the last time hed tried the telephone but that had been nearly an hour before something might have changed if it hadnt hed try bachman again then come back here something a deep young female voice spoke through the box yes ms morency yes he didnt feel he could launch into a long story he had to see her i couldnt reach you on the phone he said she laughed i know i just let it ring i dont know why i keep the thing who is this hardy took a gamble he was an acquaintance of jodys oh just a minute there was a whirring sound and the gates began to open im back by the pool youll find it i give the staff sundays off they sat on thickcushioned picnic chairs under an umbrella two sweating pitchers iced tea and lemonade sat in a serving platter on the table she had taken crystal glasses from the bar at the gazebo near the head of the pool and poured lemonade for them it was crude he knew but hardys first reaction shaking her hand was that he had seen better heads on beer orange court debutante or not she had one of those faces that didnt quite work a jaw that was almost merely strong but it jutted a trace too much down clouding her cheeks her forehead reached her hairline a halfinch too soon being megarich could cover a multitude of sins she had also apparently perfected the art of diverting attention from her face blonde hair hung shining to her shoulders she wore black bikini bottoms and a white top tied halterfashion over her breasts the top was diaphanous a gold chain hugged her flat tan waist she was barefoot with long tapered legs another discreet chain encircled one ankle hardy noticed the top of the bathing suit draped over some flagstones by the flower bed on the opposite side of the pool she had obviously been swimming lounging topless i like being here alone they were certainly alone no other houses were visible only trees the pool the manicured garden and rolling lawn beyond the mansion behind them the perfect blue sky a jet flew high overhead how do you know jody she asked hardys every bone ached he could feel sweat gathering between his shoulder blades as the fever began to spike again he sipped the lemonade and smiled weakly im afraid im another lawyer she had he thought a great laugh deep fullthroated uninhibited she threw her head back seemingly delighted lawyers arent afraid of anything she said thats what jody tells me this lawyer is what are you afraid of mr hardy she looked directly at him her deep eyes a shade too dark you look pretty much able to take care of yourself right at this moment im fighting a cold i feel like an eightyearold could take me down without too much trouble she looked another question at him had she been coming on had he just turned her down whatever it didnt seem to bother her she seemed to think it was interesting it was such a different league here there must be different rules and maybe he didnt know them so where were we she asked how i knew jody i dont for a moment her eyes registered something fear annoyance youre not a policeman are you why is jody in trouble with the police theres no reason he should be and you didnt answer me i told you im a lawyer im not a cop she sat back and crossed her arms under her halter her face remained impassive what do you people think he did you ought to leave him alone hardy nodded yes thats what mr kelso told inspector restoffer but im on my own im not with him and im trying to save my clients life he gave her jennifers story in a nutshell by the time he finished she had uncrossed her arms she took a long drink of lemonade but jody didnt call frank mr kelso i did jody knew nothing about it probably still doesnt why did you call him because mr hardy she leaned forward again because jody doesnt need this hes very sensitive and he hasnt done anything wrong and then suddenly out of nowhere this restoffer person starts questioning him as if he were a criminal these accusations were tearing him apart and it was ridiculous do you know who jody is i know hes your fiance thats about it hes a oneinamillion person thats who he is he spends half his life helping people he came from nowhere and now hes moving into the citys elite he raises money for twenty causes thats where he is now at a charity golf function hes a partner at his firm and he makes a good living hes engaged to me so as you can see money will not be an issue he doesnt need to do anything criminal money just doesnt drive him if jody were so wonderful hardy wanted to ask her why did she give the impression she would have taken him to bed maybe still would it could be that all his goodness didnt satisfy her which of course didnt mean it wasnt there it could also be that oneinamillion jody didnt love her didnt find her desirable had arranged for himself a convenient marriage that would give him still more money more power but maybe in this strata of society marriages more resembled strategic alliances than love affairs connections and loyalty might count for more than sexual attraction he just didnt know he was out of his league and he was almost out of steam did jody tell you that restoffer had accused him of anything not specifically but it became obvious that he thought jody might have had something to do with simpson cranes death which is simply absurd simpson crane was like his father he cried when simpson was killed i was with him and i saw it thats not something you fake mr hardy its been known to happen hardy thought besides she continued everybody knows who killed simpson it was the damn union he was i guess everybody knows a union buster he believed unions were ruining the country and by the way he was right so he went after them he was just too good at it and one of them killed him or had him killed thats just the kind of people they are hardy wanted to ask her if she had ever had a meaningful conversation with a working person but thought hed save his breath that wasnt his fight he wasnt about to become a life influence on ms morency suddenly she pushed herself up from her chair and crossed the flagstones at the gazebo she grabbed a towel and draped it over her shoulders covering the halter it hadnt gotten any cooler the implied invitation if thats what it had been was withdrawn hardy stood up i appreciate you seeing me she came up to him and laid a hand on his arm i really wish you would leave jody alone she said he doesnt need this thanks for your time he said ill find my way out the phone was ringing it was sixthirty on the clock next to the bed and at first hardy didnt know where he was then whether it was morning or night the last time he had fallen asleep during daylight hed slept through the dark and for a moment there he wondered if hed done it again he picked up the telephone it was jody bachman personable jody bachman margaret said you came by im sorry i missed you also listen the other thing never calling you back what can i say i got busy again its been really crazy so i got your message at the office checking in but i was late for this event you know how it is you want to get together tonights out im fighting a cold here okay how about tomorrow you still in town if youre free for lunch ive got a table at the city club great food better view noon okay noons fine hardy answered noon then you know where it is hardy said hed find it bachman said hed see him there he collapsed back down on the bed when he closed his eyes he had a sensation of motion of the room spinning around him he forced himself up to a sitting position he was forgetting something it seemed important maybe crucial but he couldnt put his finger on it and the effort at thought was so tiring minutes passed he started to doze sitting up the telephone rang again are you still sick im still sick frannies earlier anger had given way to concern why dont you come home dismas you ought to see a doctor he told her about his scheduled meeting the next day with bachman one way or the other that would be the end of it he had to stay until then she stopped pushing okay if thats what he was going to do the kids she said were fine rebecca was really missing him that wasnt a guilt trip just a fact she frannie his wife remember missed him too would he please try to take care of himself be careful he told her he would he didnt have much choice he wasnt going anywhere feeling like he did hermetically sealed in his hotel room he was going to sleep right now for the night hed see her tomorrow in the bathroom he took some more aspirin drank two glasses of water his face in the mirror was drawn and sallow everything ached he crossed to the window to pull the shade closed a purple dusk lay on the city streets further off mount wilson up on the crest of the san gabriels glowed vermilion diamond glints of the gasping sunlight sparkling out of the rocky brush he put an arm up against the window and leaned heavily against it below him in the parking lot a lone man got out of his car closed the door and went to his trunk he took out a small carrying case looked around the lot closed the trunk then quickly without wasted motion bypassed the lobby entrance and walked directly underneath into hardys wing of the building it was just the way he had felt at home paranoid stupid but knowing that didnt help suddenly he knew he had to get out of here he had given jody bachman his room number told him hed be staying in all night jody bachman who by hardys scenario had hired someone to kill simpson crane cranes wife larry and matthew witt and now hardy was the only one standing between him and his seven million dollars there wasnt much to pack he gathered his old clothes still wearing his new ones there was no one in the hallway when he stepped into it the elevator opened and he was facing a thin dark welldressed man the man carried the small carrying case hed seen earlier or one very much like it hardy stepped by him into the elevator as the man got out he was looking for a room numbers as the door closed jody bachman was twenty minutes late and if he was surprised to see hardy sitting alive at the table he had reserved he showed no sign the fever had broken after another twelve hours of heavy sleep in a motel just outside of glendale hardy in new loafers slacks an indigo sports coat and regimental tie still hurt his muscles still ached he had given himself a couple of minutes of feeling like an idiot when he woke up but after all he had woken up and that was some consolation maybe even justification it had probably been fatigue and fever absolutely nothing to it but it was done he had changed hotels in all likelihood it had been foolish and unnecessary he could live with that had in fact he knew who bachman was before he got to the table entering the room as though he owned it he was one of those southern california exsurfers whose aging process didnt seem to run on the same battery as that of mere mortals he had to be thirtyfive or so if he was a partner at crane but he looked ten years younger chiseled cheeks a cleft in his chin not a worry line anywhere the hair which would have been peroxide blond fifteen years before was now a light chestnut and fell forward in a kennedy lock he either used a tanning salon or spent a lot of time at margaret morencys pool there was no question it was a power room bachmans first stop was where the mayor of los angeles sat at a table for six at least one of whom hardy recognized as a prominent and much photographed state legislator as bachman worked the room winding his way back to the window seat hardy sipped his club soda there was no smog los angeles south of downtown sprawled over some warehouses then expanded to a horizon of oil derricks rail yards power lines freeways gypsum quarries it was a view for those who favored expanse over anything pleasant to look at there were no bridges islands bodies of water distinctive buildings hills or green patches maybe bachman didnt yet rate the better window tables where the mayor and the congressman and whomever they ate with could glimpse the ocean the glittering and verdant west side the san gabriels sorry im late jody bachman bachman mouthed another greeting to someone he had missed on his first pass through the room then finally sat i cant seem to catch up he laughed it never ends you having a drink hardy tipped the glass club soda me too how guys have a martini or even a beer in the middle of the day he shook his head it wipes me out i might as well take a sleeping pill so what can i do for you im trying to get to the end of something myself my client got sentenced to death on friday bachman sipping his water stopped it halfway to his mouth jesus he said putting the glass down thats a different breed of law its not exactly boardrooms and bylaws death huh witts wife right thats right jennifer bachman whistled soundlessly the waiter arrived he wore a tuxedo and placed a glass of what looked like cranberry juice on the table just the special klaus for me whatever it is he included hardy sounds fine when klaus was gone he said im trying to get the judge to lower it to life i thought you appealed forever eventually hardy said if it comes to that he didnt intend to explain the protocol jennifer says shes innocent and hardy allowed a bemused grin for bachmans benefit im still tempted to believe her so what ive got to do is give the judge some doubt doesnt have to be much and you think witts call to me i dont know mr bachman its the only unturned stone at this point another power broker passed the table giving bachman a friendly shake of the shoulder he nodded absently then sat back in his chair reaching for his juice if this is your best bet he took in the view for a minute after we talked i tried to check the logs last night but i couldnt get into the computer until this morning hardy waited bachman reached into his coat pocket and extracted two pages stapled and folded he opened them handing them across to hardy i went ahead and copied my original timesheet on the back sometimes they get my writing wrong the first page was a section of typed summary of bachmans billable time on december beginning at pm he had billed to ybmg under descsvs was typed tcon wwitt bachman translated it was just a call to answer some questions i guess i got about ten or so and witt was one of them do you remember what his question was not a clue i billed it to the group so it must have been something to do with the offering but its gone sorry hardy looked again at the bill but the call lasted twenty minutes isnt that a long time to have no memory of at all for the first time bachman showed an edge of pique the pleasant smile faded for an instant he pursed his lips then drank some juice by the time he put the glass down he had recovered youve got it wrong isnt minutes in its wisdom the firms billing is done in tenths of an hour two tenths is twelve minutes he leaned forward confiding in hardy and even one second more than six minutes counts as twelve we round off the call itself might easily have been less than five minutes his smile held no warmth now but i really dont remember what more can i say hardy flipped to the original timesheet on the back whatever had been written after tcon wwitt about two line worth had been scratched out i know bachman seeing hardy on that page answered before hardy could put the question and the answer is i dont know maybe my pen ran maybe i just wrote an unnecessarily long description they ask us to keep it simple you should meet my secretary she flays me if i get redundant or wordy hardy stared at the scratching for another useless moment hed love to get his hands on the original see if some expert could get something to come up but even then what whatever bachman had originally written it couldnt have been so incriminating that by itself it would help jennifer now he looked up bachman was studying him you know im happy to help you if i can and i think ive been pretty forthcoming but i have to wonder when this ybmg inquisition is going to stop it gets old i mean is this what happens when you close a deal everybody wants a piece of it i dont want a piece of it well i know thats not what i meant but all these questions ive got a young woman whos got a good chance of getting executed unless i can prove somebody else killed her husband to me im sorry but thats worth a couple of questions klaus returned with lunch an avocado stuffed with baby shrimp three pieces of highend lettuce a wedge of pumpernickel bread bachman pushed the lettuce around thats understandable he said but what does dr witts phone call to me have to do with his death youre not suggesting that somebody with ybmg killed him are you i didnt know it was a question that wasnt answered i knew that witt had called you and his lawyer in san francisco told me he was upset about the circular i wondered if he threatened you somehow and then i killed him for what you just cant be serious hypothetically if youre interested i can explain it the shrimp all two ounces of them were sweet hardy thought it would be instructive to watch bachmans reaction he ran it all down to him from the phone call to simpson crane to restoffer being called off when he had fininshed bachman nodded his smile a distant memory a lot of lawyers are writing novels these days mr hardy maybe you ought to try your hand at it hardy spread his palms this is nonfiction yes and so is the fact that nobody is hiding anything here everything is completely out in the open simpson crane let you trade out your hours for stock this stopped him momentarily sure your firm does that often takes that kind of risk this had moved nicely from the hypothetical bachman rubbed a hand over his upper lip maybe he was starting to sweat hey in these times you take whatever business you can get its a buyers market out there and simpson had no problem with that thinking fast bachman said of course not simpson and i were friends i wouldnt have done anything to hurt simpson hardy realized he had never directly accused him of that we talked about it of course at length we figured there was a more than reasonable chance of downstream recovery which i might add has materialized the firm has made two million dollars on my time it took a risk sure but id say it was worth it wouldnt you bachmans hand seemed unsteady as he picked up his water glass hardy nodded what about the other five million he stopped the glass midway to his mouth then drank nearly slamming it back down there is no other five million finally hardy felt he had forced bachman into an outright lie time to call him on it clarence stone said the group paid you fifty thousand shareds thats seven million dollars if two went to your firm wheres the other five bachman swallowed that was a personal bonus he said you just said there wasnt any other five million i mean for the firm to the firm so there is another five million how was everything are you gentlemen finished it was klaus perhaps a little dessert some cappacino espresso weve got a marvelous tiramisu bachman had pushed himself back from the table nothing he said it was a dismissal klaus did not even look at hardy the interruption had given bachman enough time he had not gotten to where he was by giving in to panic this was another hurdle an obstacle to overcome yes i made a bundle he said and the last time i looked that was not a crime hardy leaned forward trying to regain his momentum witt threatened to call all the other doctors didnt he he wouldve blown the deal bachmans smile returned if youre going to be making those kinds of accusations mr hardy youd better have some proof there are libel and slander laws in this state that could make you a poor man in a heartbeat you should know that who did you hire bachman shook his head not amused i didnt mr hardy but if i did would i be so foolish as to leave a trail do you think i might have written the person a check now if youll excuse me he pushed his chair back standing ive got a one oclock im running late for he nodded one last time caught klaus eye and told him to put lunch on his bill whatever he found out or thought he had uncovered in los angeles the unpalatable truth remained that he still couldnt prove a goddamned word of it in the plane he scribbled notes on courses of action he ought to take he would call the fbi and try to have them pursue their rico investigation into simpsons death he thought it might be possible to trace a withdrawal of funds from one of bachmans accounts if he could get some federal agent interested in his theory a big if another possible avenue was getting through to todd crane simpsons son now the managing partner maybe hed be interested to learn that jody bachman had turned over to them only fifteen thousand or so of the fifty thousand shares he had earned or did todd already know it maybe he was plain thrilled and delighted with two million against seventyfive thousand in billables it was hardy realized only his personal fantasy unverifiable as fantasies tended to be that bachman would have traded all of his fifty thousand shares against his time who said he would have to do that if those two approaches failed maybe restoffer no not realistic restoffer was out of it it was down to judge villars sitting as the thirteenth juror down to what he could make her believe his own theories didnt matter he couldnt prove them they werent going to do jennifer any good he had to go another way he had to be lawyer and make an argument out of whole cloth if need be even if he hated what he had to do but to be fair it wasnt whole cloth at least hed be starting with one truth the one that had been denied throughout and yet had remained constant jennifer had been battered overriding jennifers objections he wouldnt even ask her again he was going to lay it out for villars jennifers intractability the freeman affidavit the defense decisions the irony did not escape him he could not use anything he knew about jody bachman and ybmg and what he could introduce probably had no direct bearing on what had happened in the witts bedroom on december the plane nosed down over the bay it was almost four oclock and he was to face villars tomorrow morning at ninethirty he was down to his last dart of course ill do anything dr lightner sat framed by the glass in his office his secretary had gone home the eucalyptus grove behind him was dark in shadow good i want you to tell the judge about larry beating her lightner sat forward ramrod stiff at the proposal hardy leaned forward almost pleading now i know what im asking doctor but its really jennifers only hope youve stood by her so long in all this but standing by someone and revealing their privileged communications were very different matters after a couple of seconds lightner stood up he turned his back to hardy and looked out into the grove i cant believe its come to this hardy came up next to him after larry died when you were seeing her she never lightner was already shaking his head she wouldnt talk about it he felt a sudden sinking in his gut a vertigo for an instant he thought it was the flu again unbidden the awful thought reoccurred had she done it after all stop it lightner walked back to the window put an arm against the door jamb looking out this is priest and confession isnt it hardy couldnt put a lighter face on it yes it is betray the privilege betray her trust save her life lightner turned and faced hardy the ruddy face pale and drawn under the beard what about the doctors i gave you couldnt they help what are they going to say where is there proof at this stage statements about her bruises and abrasions werent enough he needed her therapists confirmation lightner turned back toward the grove opened the door and stepped outside hardy followed and they walked a hundred feet over the duff what do you think happened that morning lightner let out a long breath there were muffled sounds of traffic on th avenue the doctor stared through the trees i think it was pretty much the way she told it except she left out the physical part the physical part larry hitting her he hit her that morning lightner turned to him lets say i saw the bruises the next time i saw her which was two days later i think he hit matt too im not saying he did im saying it could have happened matt didnt have any bruises lightner shook his head unable to get it out matts head he began and hardy saw what he meant if larry had struck matt in the head the bullet would have destroyed any sign of it it evoked his own delirious scenario of a few nights before i dont know what happened lightner repeated what do you think happened doctor this is jennifers life here ive got to make villars see it lightner was trying to walk a line trying to stay on the angels side of privilege all right this is what i believe happened lightner faced him the last low rays of the sun striking the red in his beard worn down by the tension by the moral and professional dilemma at last he appeared to have made up his mind she was leaving him taking matt with her that was the fight he had beaten her badly on christmas eve she called and told me and what did you do i told her to leave to get out she said she was afraid larry would kill her she told me about the gun it was in the headboard he would use it i told her to take it and get out obviously she didnt then what on monday it started again and he began to develop a scenario with chilling plausibility hardy could scarcely breathe as he listened he hits her and she says shes really going leaving for good she starts yelling for matt who is nowhere to be found maybe hes hiding somewhere in any event suddenly larry whos been after her apparently decides he has had enough he runs upstairs knowing what hes doing going for the gun jennifer starts running up after him to get him to stop to plead anything by now she is screaming hysterical just like that woman from next door said but larry isnt in the bedroom and the gun is she grabs it hears a noise behind her turns there is another gun coming out of the bathroom door hes gone in there she fires its matt she had hit matt who had been hiding in the bathroom all this time with his new christmas present a toy gun from his grandparents and then suddenly larry is out rushing her his hands raised to strike she fires once point blank blinking now as though coming back to himself from a place removed lightner turned to hardy it was over he said later she tried to cover up but she had no choice larry would have killed her hardy stood a long moment the sound of traffic was gone the sun was down a chill coming up off the leaves it was a great defense if it were true thats how i believe it may have happened larry went upstairs for the gun there was no premeditation all jennifer wanted to do was get out get away from him she should have done it long ago it was selfdefense im convinced will you testify to that tomorrow if i have an affidavit for you will you sign it to what theres no evidence there even i know that hardy knew it too but he needed lightner there needed his story a story but a highly educated one for his own ends let me worry about that my question is can i count on you will you at least tell the judge what you have just told me slowly sighing with the weight of it lightner nodded at last all right if shell let me rebecca had missed her daddy he was lying on the rug in front of the fireplace snuggling with her she hadnt let him get up wrestling him back down to the ground both of them laughing and talking their own language rebecca had given hardy ten minutes of unsullied joy with her repertoire of kisses rabbit kisses nose to nose butterfly kisses eyelashes against hardys cheek heart kisses which rebecca had invented herself where she kissed her hand held it to her heart then pressed it to hardys and held it there it was past the childrens bedtime dark out lights off inside but the family was together again the fire crackled vincent fell asleep and frannie laid him down on the couch she came down to the floor and rested her head on hardys stomach rebecca lay heavily across his chest her breathing became regular are you coming to bed isnt tomorrow it in a minute dismas her eyes were soft worried she crossed over to him and put a hand on his shoulder hon its eleven oclock hardy sat behind the manual typewriter at the kitchen table his forehead in his hands sick with exhaustion his brain a buzzsaw he could not stop thinking he had been writing for three hours first touching up lightners carefully worded affidavit then he had reviewed his motion under california penal code section e to modify the sentence down to life without parole which was within the judges absolute discretion the second brief was trickier because he knew he could not hope to prevail unless he had legitimate grounds to demand a new trial to this end he had two arguments the first one was that the packaging of the ned hollis murder count with those of larry and matt had fatally prejudiced the jury as a matter of law true both freeman and jennifer had personally waived this issue on the record but that could be dealt with hardy argued that no competent lawyer could have ever declined a mistrial under those circumstances and that jennifers acquiescence was the result of incompetent advice he knew freeman wouldnt bat an eye at such a tactic and in fact would have pointed it out to him if hardy hadnt thought of it himself the idea was to keep your client alive not to stroke egos this was a reasonable point although again villars had already ruled on it and was unlikely to change her mind his second argument was his last best hope evidence on jennifer as a battered wife had been suppressed and hardy knew that here legally things got shaky because who after all suppressed the evidence but jennifer herself he would need to try to explain why he was trying to bring up an argument for life in prison rather than death under guidelines outlined in the penal code the argument technically at this point could only be used in mitigation not in overturning the guilty verdict it was probably inadmissible under the other section as grounds for a new trial if he dared hope for a new trial then villars would have to make the connection and the leap and she would have to go out on a judicial limb to do it he had no idea if she would but he had no choice his eggs had to go into this basket he had to rely on villars being interested in justice in the truth as she thought she was she had told him she agonized over the death penalty that the responsibility staggered her but even so he would be asking her to reverse herself on rulings she had already made during the trials if she wavered at all here powell would scream and powell was going to be the states attorney general he would not be a good enemy for villars to acquire just now part of hardy knew that he was kidding himself he knew that in practice reversals at this stage didnt happen the final administrative motions might be dressed up as the defendants last stand but their true intent was to give the judge a chance to save herself from the stigma or reversible error only on paper might this last hurdle have an effect on fairer application of the death penalty in practice historically it rarely made any difference after he had gone over his motions he spent the rest of the night triplechecking the evidence folders and reviewing the interviews from the beginning his notes on tom distephano what the physicians had told him about jennifers accidents her bruises freemans affidavit about jennifers forbidding the batteredwife defense the abortions the dentist harlan pooles first testimony and thank god he had spoken up back then insisted it go on the record he thought that villars would give him an opportunity he would probably be allowed to start but his leeway would be severely constrained if it wasnt on the record she wasnt going to let him bring anything up for the first time tomorrow that was for sure frannie kissed the top of his head and went to the bedroom he noticed the light going off she had wisely given up on him for tonight he stood up and grabbed the telephone pulling it around the corner into the work area off the kitchen he closed the connecting door behind him a phone rang five times before a weary voice answered nancy im sorry to wake you up but theres one last thing i need to know he was at the hall of justice by seventhirty even at that time reporters were beginning to swarm this was judgment day and it attracted them like clover drew bees there were three minicams parked outside on bryant and a couple of knots of news professionals sipped coffee from styrofoam and ate danish as hardy approached the hall one of the stringers recognized him and trotted over asking for a statement hardy stopped his insides churning he wanted to avoid all of this it might jinx him what do you want to say it hasnt happened yet the verdict isnt verified chew on that he thought others followed do you have any new evidence what do you think of dean powell as attorney general hardy had to laugh lets say id rather have him in sacramento than in my courtroom do you think jennifer witt will be executed this sobered them all this was reality hardy didnt want to prejudice things at this point villars had warned them all about talking to the media and it would be unconscionable if he made a convincing case this morning in court only to have villars see him posturing on television like powell or freeman while she was considering her decision he started moving again he was sorry he couldnt comment through the press he spotted david freeman as his colleague turned from th onto bryant it should have been a surprising relief an ally to talk to but he had lost his stomach for freeman too still it was good of the old man to come down put on a show of solidarity talk to the media if he got the chance and hardy would see to it that he did here comes david freeman he said pointing the swarm moved to the next field of clover and hardy escaped up the wide and grimy steps into the lobby past the metal detector to an empty elevator down to the evidence lockers finally taking refuge in a deserted juryselection room on the third floor it was powersuit day both attorneys were dressed identically dark charcoal suits white shirts red ties hardys tie featured a nearly invisible pattern of tiny blue diamonds wild flamboyance they had gathered in the courtroom coming up the aisle hardy exchanged greetings with freeman and lightner who were sitting next to one another he handed lightner the affidavit he had prepared for him and waited making small talk with freeman until the psychiatrist had read it scratched corrections in a few places and signed it hardy nodded at powell who was leaning over his table alone this morning his assistant morehouse didnt need to be here he must have figured this wasnt going to take long now jennifer came through the doors she had dressed simply dark flat shoes and a blue skirt a white blouse with a small collar no makeup no jewelry as the bailiff left her she turned around and looked at the gallery raising a hand hardy saw lightner nod jennifers face brightened slightly my moms here she said and tom it was true nancy had just come in her son held her arm last night she had told him they had the funeral for phil over the weekend she hadnt been able to get back in to visit jennifer but tom and she had reconnected he was her good boy again she was getting her children back what a place to do it hardy thought the bailiff announced that the superior court of the state of california city and county of san francisco was now in session judge joan villars presiding the judge sat at the bench her familiar gray helmet of hair perfectly in place over the perennially stern visage she wore her reading glasses the court reporter adrienne had her machine set up and was waiting all right the judge began adjusting her robes good morning mr powell do you have a statement no your honor the jury has spoken loud and clear on this submitted by the prosecution he looked at his watch he obviously did not expect this to take long he sat back in his chair mr hardy hardy stood and handed his papers to the judge your honor i have two motions under sections of the penal code of the state of california i am presenting to the court a motion to grant a new trial concurrently under section e i have prepared a motion for the court to mitigate mrs witts sentence to life in prison without the possibility of parole villars nodded this was expected have you new evidence to present at this time in support of these motions yes your honor i do powell straightened up and looked across at him he continued i have two affidavits your honor if i may he approached the bench again and handed them to the judge who took a long moment looking them over pulling her glasses forward and peering over them she looked down at hardy then mr powell her little finger ordered him to approach when he got next to hardy she stood chambers she said then to the room at large court will recess for ten minutes villars had moved ahead of them and seated herself behind her desk hardy and powell had gone for their chairs and pulled them forward she sat glaring into space while powell read the affidavits finishing he placed them on the desk in front of her im not going to accept either of your arguments on your motion for a new trial mr hardy villars said ive ruled on these issues repeatedly during this trial and im certain the appeals court is going to uphold me slowly hardy let out a breath preparing himself for the worst next to him he could sense powells excitement his elation villars held the papers open before her her eyes scanning them again frowning perhaps hardy hoped searching for something else she had overlooked finally she asked lightner is the psychiatrist she was sleeping with was this an opening hardy jumped in that was never established your honor powell came up halfway out of his chair what do you mean it was never established your honor these affidavits should have been presented days ago so we could look into these matters mr powell please im asking the questions here mr hardy the affidavit speaks for itself your honor dr lightner says he has previously undisclosed information regarding jennifers situation on the morning of the murders her husband was beating her if she killed him it was to save her own life right then that morning there was no premeditation your honor please powell wasnt having this not at the eleventh hour selfdefense is a justification for homicide mr hardy if that was your defense you and mr freeman had every opportunity to bring it up earlier hardy had known this was coming and was prepared that point is addressed in the other affidavit your honor david freemans i did not have the opportunity mr freeman did he chose not to do it i was not mrs witts attorney in the guilt phase my client shouldnt be penalized now because of mr freemans strategy hardy knew this was a reach he and freeman had been acting as a team and villars knew it as well as powell still technically at least he wasnt wrong villars sat her face a mask your honor powell said this battered woman question had never been introduced its not part of the record hardy started to answer but villars stopped him i know mr hardy you dont have to remind me she gestured with her palm youll recall mr powell that it was explicitly included in the record by mr hardy himself but that was during the hollis phase of the trial it has no bearing on what jennifer witt was convicted of villars did not see it that way it was your decision to combine the counts in this trial mr powell its your problem if something leaks over but she turned back to hardy this affidavit does not say what lightners evidence is hardy knew that he had no immediate answer for it it will come out in his testimony oh for the love of god villars pointed at powell watch your language mr powell this court will not tolerate blasphemy im sorry your honor but i fail to see what were trying to get to here youve already said youre not allowing mr hardys socalled evidence on the motion for a new trial villars didnt like it but she understood her duty if there was a reason that jennifer should not be sentenced to death she had to consider it on the motion to mitigate i think i should listen to what dr lightner has to say if its a fact if mr hardy can prove by dr lightners testimony that mrs witt had been psychologically and physically abused she deserves consideration of that fact before i sentence her if its a fact at all your honor mr hardy gives no indication that hes got any facts villars pondered that mr hardy can you tell us anything of the substance of dr lightners proposed testimony this was hardys hand and he had to play it im sorry your honor you can read dr lightners affidavit im reluctant to try to paraphrase his testimony in any more detail i might inadvertently misinform the court this was something they all understood hardy wasnt sure how much he could get out of lightner but he couldnt say that villars rubbed the papers between her fingers the sound dull yet somehow insistent ill let dr lightner begin mr hardy she said at last but i warn you hardy knew what is he going to say jennifer whispered to hardy grabbing his arm he thinks im guilty hardy had to admire it she wasnt budging on her story there hadnt been the slightest slip or deviation from it in all these months she flat did not do it of course she would not be the first killer to deny it to the death he leaned over urgent trust me here dont interrupt i believe you it was his turn to squeeze her arm he pulled her toward him do you hear me i believe you villars was now looking down on lightner doctor she began i want to be clear here your testimony today will not be admissible regarding the guilt or innocence of mrs witt that has already been decided however the court understands that you have information that might have some influence in mitigating the death penalty that the jury has recommended lightner swallowed is that so the doctor shrugged looking to hardy for help yes your honor i believe so villars nodded okay mr hardy hardy rose slowly dr lightner what is your relationship with the defendant i am her friend and her psychiatrist how long have you been her psychiatrist about four years and her friend ive considered her my friend all along and in your role as friend doctor have you seen mrs witt other than in circumstances that might be described as professional lunches dinners that sort of thing he was fishing but regardless of the answer he was also giving lightner a big hole to skate through he could tell from lightners posture his eyes that he understood what was being offered yes what lightner did not realize was the price hardy would have to exact many times several yes then hardy dropped his bomb dr lightner at the time of larry and matt witts death were you jennifers lover lightner apparently stunned sat back in the witness chair then turned to the judge your honor villars shook her head no answer the question doctor although he already had hardy reminded him that he was under oath he cast a helpless glance across the room at the defense table at jennifer yes he whispered powell exploded your honor this witness has already testified under oath that he and mrs witt were not intimate villars leaned over youre admitting to perjury here doctor do you realize that soberly lightner nodded answered yes there was a ripple of noise in the courtroom and villars hit her gavel once she motioned the lawyers to the front of the bench this is your friendly witness she asked but it called for no answer hardy turned to check on his client jennifer was a statue her teeth over her lower lip biting he had told her to trust him that he believed her he had to let her know stepping back in front of lightner hardy asked doctor did you ever hypnotize the defendant yes did you tell her under hypnosis that she should deny having this affair with you lightner gulped some air swallowed i thought it would hurt her defense compromise her somehow she was having trouble enough handling what was happening to her you mean the deaths of larry and matt yes hardy took a moment stepped toward the jury box gathering his thoughts then turned again because you were in fact having an affair with jennifer some of your time with her therefore was not related to your practice or her psychiatric condition thats right this was the point and lightner understood it if jennifer was to have a chance at life though it cast her and lightner in a negative light the affair had to come out as he would try to demonstrate did you see jennifer either professionally or personally after december of last year yes of course ive told you almost every day she was devastated by the death of her son she blamed herself there was another buzz shortlived behind them but jennifer blames herself for everything and yet she denies killing her husband and her son thats correct this wasnt a question but powell didnt object and villars said nothing so hardy took a deep breath and continued doctor lightner did jennifer tell you about any decisions she had reached before december yes she was leaving her husband she called me on the telephone on christmas eve as a friend not as a psychiatrist yes hardy began to lead him through it slowly with a rhythm the fact that larry had threatened to kill her if she left the gun by the bed the increasing tension in the household he had to keep the story flowing slipping back and forth from conjecture to fact slowly working his way details details until they got to monday morning now dr lightner jennifer has never admitted to you that she shot larry or matt correct yes correct nevertheless based on your training and experience and sitting through this trial have you formed an opinion as to mrs witts state of mind at the time of the killing yes i have incidentally doctor all the information that you have received about this case has come from either mrs witt or from this trial that is correct no one has provided you with any police reports photographs or information out of court thats true tell us then doctor your professional opinion as to mrs witts state of mind basically she was in a panicked state due to batteredwife syndrome her husband had beaten her repeatedly they had just argued he was running upstairs after her she was in terror hardy picked up the pace keeping the rhythm setting the stage bringing lightner along with him larry was running upstairs and what did she do then doctor turning matt with the toy gun the new christmas present in the bathroom door and then matt larrys screaming rush toward her the single shot at pointblank range the courtroom was silent perhaps ten seconds elapsed without a sound now of course dr lightner as youve told us mrs witt categorically and consistently denies any part in these killings so this is your own reconstruction of events yes sir it is entirely yes of course hardy let it go until it had sunk in then stepped closer to the witness box dr lightner he said how do you know about the toy gun matt was holding the silence grew lightner telling his story had gotten caught up in the emotion of it now drained he slumped slightly finally he spoke i beg your pardon hardy repeated the question how did he know about the toy gun lightner blinked im not sure but this situation youve just described to us jennifer didnt describe it that way to you did she powell stood up your honor villars did not hesitate overruled id like the doctor to answer i must have seen it in the photographs then the ones at the trial here jennifer didnt tell you about it she told me matt didnt have any guns wasnt allowed to have them powell stood again villars shook her head no thats right she must not have it must have been the photographs hardy nodding walked back to his table and picked up the thick envelope containing all the forensic and murderscene shots id like you to go through these photographs and point out this toy gun if you can find it lightner took the envelope and began slowly turning the pages standing over him hardy waited villars was a sphinx halfway through lightner suddenly looked up but that was just a story there might not have been a gun thats just what i thought had happened its informed conjecture hardy again walked to the desk he reached down into his briefcase and removed a ziploc plastic evidence bag back at the witness box he opened it and removed terrells mistake the realistic toy gun that had been found in the same dumpster as the murder weapon this is the gun is it not doctor this is the gun matt was holding is it not the gun that you thought was real the gun that provoked you to shoot him god hardy heard jennifer behind him ken hardy did not trust himself to move but he could still talk this was the fedex package a christmas present from nancy matts grandmother how did you know in your story that it was a christmas present it didnt get to the house until after jennifer had left to go running you had removed it with the murder weapon by the time she got back jennifer never knew it had been there did she lightner shifted on the seat eyes on hardy then around the courtroom as though looking for help finally turning to villars i dont have to answer this do i i can take the fifth amendment he told villars im not saying anything else without an attorney it was his only chance his last chance she had called as she increasingly did when they had been fighting larry was beating her why wouldnt she leave him it wouldnt get any better all the literature and the facts agreed on that he had told her and still she wouldnt leave him she believed she had to keep trying so hed listened and counseled her and yes made love to her he lied to hardy and the court about that but hed told the truth to hardy about his caring for her caring that was putting it mildly yes she loved him more than transference he told himself but she had her family she just wasnt leaving them which meant he could never really have her the call on christmas eve wasnt that she had decided to leave it was another fight another beating another call for help he had responded as he always did and then she went back for more and now again here monday morning another call more terrible damage it had to stop it was his only chance her only chance he could save her and have her he would do anything for her anything olympia way her beautiful house the street empty dead silent under a cold brittle morning sun it took him ten minutes perhaps less jennifer was going jogging there was enough time shed be gone no one on the street he had been here three times in the afternoons matt and larry gone jennifer meeting him he knew his way around there he knew where the gun was not that he was really planning on using it was he no it would never come to that he would talk to the husband tell him what he had done what he was doing to jennifer now that he was here it seemed what is it dr witt weve got to

satisfied i told you shes out now you get the hell out of my house the gun right where she said he kept it in the headboard i dont think so he didnt need to think about it events were taking over what are you doing with that goddamnit coming toward him the noise the other sound maybe there all along subliminal water running into a sink he hadnt even heard it no the noise stopped that was it it was the noise stopping somebody was in there dont move to witt stopping him the blood rushing now what the hell do you think youre doing whos in there witt yelling over his shoulder matt stay in there halfturning trying to fake him dont come out just as the other gun appeared a blur really in the bathroom doorway somebody shooting at him but no one there nothing now but panic a shadow things moving too fast witt begins to lunge but something else too at the same instant off to the side in the bathroom door in his peripheral vision there is another gun god somebody else is here a witness more a threat he doesnt have a second no time for more than a glance at his side its a gun but somethings wrong its too low to the ground someone crouching it pops the gun pops he has no choice he spins points squeezes the trigger just as he sees the boy in a crouch stepping out holding a gun pointing it it pops again it cant be it cant be matt hes at school its a school day and the father is at home alone he has to stop he must but his hand has already squeezed too far his gun kicks exploding in the room with the sound of a bomb and the bathroom mirror splinters in a haze of sickly bright red no stopping now only an instant to move while witt is struck dumb immobilized by the explosion by what hes seen his eyes on the splayed body of his son a beat while the horror sinks in but it is enough lightner yanks the gun back on witt now coming with a choking scream hands raised the face eyes a wild man closing in impossible not to fire impossible to miss the reporters were rushing to telephones and minicams as hardy turned back away from the witness stand in a daze he was aware of villars using her gavel and of powell standing at his table mute of nancy standing in the gallery nancy had confirmed in the call last night that she had sent the toy gun to matt lightner slumped in the witness chair hardy sat down next to his client who turned her face against him crying out of control powell had terrell take lightner into custody on the perjury charge villars retired to her chambers alone a half hour later she returned to the bench hardy and jennifer remained at the defense table holding hands the whole time nancy and tom were in the front row and freeman had come inside the rail powell was across the room slumped in his hard chair pretending to study some papers his face was set villars face was flushed her mouth a thin line she looked below her over her reading glasses at hardy and jennifer then to powell she spoke clearly formally this court grants defendants motion for a new trial under penal code section hardy finally let himself lean back in his chair granting the motion for a new trial was a legal formality villars was ruling on hardys first motion and that was all she was doing it was clear that there was not going to be any new trial for jennifer witt as she had maintained all along she had not killed either her husband or her son and at last everyone in the courtroom knew it further the judge continued it is the decision of this court under california code of civil procedure section that the verdict of the jury in the people vs jennifer lee witt be set aside it is the judgment of this court that the evidence received is lacking in probative force to establish the proposition of fact to which it is addressed mr powell i cannot imagine you would oppose a motion for release of the defendant on her own recognizance at this time it was not a question mr hardy would you care to approach after the trial hardy had built a new brick border to enclose frannies roses by the fence in his backyard he had his foot on it now looking back toward the house isaac glitsky abes oldest was taking his job very seriously he lifted the top of the barbecue poked the turkey in the thigh with the long fork its still a little pink he said abe finally on thanksgiving holding what hardy thought was his first beer of the year spoke patiently gently the voice nothing like the one he used in his police life just close it up ike itll get done the boy did then went to join his brothers playing with hardys kids up under the overhang by the house it was unseasonably warm sunny with a westerly breeze moses and his pregnant bride susan were expected soon and frannie and flo were inside cutting things up setting up condiment trays cooking side dishes hardy was having what he called the traditional thanksgiving old fashioned bourbon and soda and sugar and bitters and oranges and cherries and god knew what else he wanted to enjoy it before moses the purist arrived and tried to ruin it for him he sat on his new low wall taking in his world this works he said he smelled the turkey smoke the newly mown grass then youll never believe who called me yesterday glitsky looked over at him orlando cepeda hardy shook his head michael jordan not a sports figure i know it wasnt clinton im sure he wouldve mentioned it when i talked to him hardy sipped his drink jennifer witt the warm breeze came up again for a moment isaac was back at the barbecue and abe told him to leave it and turn that hat around son weve talked about that isaac was wearing his giants hat backward his homicideinspector father agreed that while it was probably a harmless fashion he wasnt going to allow his son to affect even the smallest trademark of gang affiliation no baggy clothes raiders jackets turnedaround baseball caps for abe glitskys sons isaac flipped the cap around and abe shrugged at hardy im turning into a conservative its kind of sad lets see he said a conservative in san francisco would still leave you just to the left of lenin right the scar lightened slightly abes notquitebeaming smile so hows mrs witt shes rich really rich this soom they paid they had to she didnt do it the shade from the house had reached them and glitsky moved down a bit on the brick ive been meaning to ask hardy nodded there were no prints at all on the toy gun and this means something to a trained investigator like yourself id think so glitsky gave it a minute he actually took a sip of his beer it was wiped if some kid had ever played with it it would have had his prints on it see i knew youd get it anyway there was so much other stuff i just missed it something as they say was nagging at me but i couldnt get it into the picture until lightner slipped up it should have had some prints some partial prints some smudges at least but why did lightner frame jennifer if he loved her he didnt start out to he must have convinced himself she wouldnt get nailed for it he was so confident he confided to me he was afraid she did it but only to save herself from larry i hear even shrinks can get caught up in believing what they want to believe just like real people he should have stolen something abe said made it look like a botched burglary of course with your years of experience thats easy for you to say in any event jennifer getting arrested screwed up everything he hoped with larry gone shed eventually marry him her rod and staff and her comforter he said the obsession neurosis whatever was hers it seems it was the other way around he also didnt figure on matt being home christmas vacation he forgot about the boy why did he come just then i asked jennifer the same thing how did he know she had called him when larry started beating her up that morning i suppose she blames herself for that too anyway obviously hed been thinking about it jennifer at some point had told him about the gun where it was and now he thought with larry gone anyway jennifer told me she called him when she ran upstairs in the middle of the fight he told her to get out he must have figured it was the right time told his trusty secretary he was in conference closed the door and walked out through the patio its not ten minutes to jennifers house from his office glitsky drank again and terrell gave him his alibi hardy nodded im sure hell work out fine in his new position terrells job change to the das office had been finalized the previous week lightners secretary said he was there all morning and thats what terrell wanted to hear it fit his theory except now the secretary isnt so sure funny huh hysterical unprecedented and lightners going down it looks like it he gets to have his own trial anyway he should have split when they charged her hardy gave him the eye how could he without pointing the finger directly at himself no he thought he had an alibi he had to stay around to watch jennifers defense he couldnt leave me alone he had to push the batteredwife defense it was the only way to get jennifer off that didnt put it back on him and if that didnt work well everything had been for nothing and remember he really was and is obsessed with her but her husband did beat her didnt he hardy nodded but jennifer was always telling the truth about that she didnt kill him period she might have been full of guilt and other hangups but shed be damned if shed put up a defense for something she didnt do her big problem was getting people including her lawyers to believe her the back door opened and moses mcguire started down the steps hardy polished off his drink chewed the cherry and dropped the orange slice into the dirt behind him covering it he and glitsky stood up ike want to check the bird abe said moses was shaking hands his scotch in the other hand this is my first one you guys ahead of me what are you drinking diz hardy held up his empty glass bushmills straight up no ice my man moses said then turning to glitsky so hows the murder business still booming on saturday december hardys washout other dude jody bachman and margaret morency exchanged vows in a ceremony at ms morencys estate in san marino as one of the biggest society weddings of the year the event made the living section of the sunday chronicle over three hundred guests had been in attendance among the

in the south of france it was a small house three bedrooms two baths on a culdesac in belmont twentytwo miles south of san francisco the people who had lived there before had kept it up beautifully in the backyard the grass was trimmed and green just off the new deck some stone benches surrounded a small fountain on the periphery the fence was bordered by fruit trees two bearing oranges a lemon a cherry and two plums though now in the middle of january the cherry and plum trees were bare leafless jennifer witt had gotten up at dawn and run three miles down ralston and back up behind the college she had not had a cigarette since the trial sitting in the breakfast nook the window open a crack she drank coffee and ate a plain croissant from the good bakery down the street it was an overcast day but still outside she could hear the sounds of birds in the fountain it was the first day of the spring semester and she had showered and gotten dressed by eight her first class was at nine she did not have to declare her major for two years but she knew it was going to be psychology she wanted finally to understand herself and thought that might be a good place to start when she finished she put her dishes in the sink wrapping a sweater around her shoulders she walked back into the house and pushed open a door her mother was still sleeping she crossed the room and kissed her on the forehead im off she said you want to meet for lunch her mother had been sleeping a lot since they had moved now she stretched and put an arm aaround her daughters neck you have lunch nancy said make some friends stay at school what about you her mother pulled herself up dont worry about me but i do jennifer sat on the bed and her mother smoothed her daughters hair this is the best its ever
