john connolly the unquiet the sixth book in the charlie parker series for emily bestler with much affection and with thanks for persevering one where can a dead man go a question with an answer only dead men know nickel creek when in rome prologue this world is full of broken things broken hearts broken promises broken people this world too is a fragile construct a honeycomb place where the past leaches into the present where the weight of blood guilt and old sins causes lives to collapse and forces children to lie with the remains of their fathers in the tangled ruins of the aftermath i am broken and i have broken in return now i wonder how much hurt can be visited upon others before the universe takes action before some outside force decides that enough has been endured i once thought that it was a question of balance but i no longer believe that i think that what i have done was out of all proportion to what was done to me but that is the nature of revenge it escalates it cannot be controlled one hurt invites another on and on until the original injury is all but forgotten in the chaos of what follows i was a revenger once i will be one no more but this world is full of broken things old orchard beach maine the guesser removed the fold of bills from his pocket licked his thumb and discreetly counted the days takings the sun was setting shedding itself in shards of burning red like blood and fire on the water there were still people moving along the boardwalk sipping sodas and eating hot buttered popcorn while distant figures strolled along the beach some hand in hand with another and some alone the weather had altered in recent days the evening temperature dropping noticeably and a sharp wind a herald of a greater change to come toying with the grains of sand as dusk descended and the visitors no longer lingered as they once did the guesser felt his time there drawing to a close for if they would not pause then he could not work and if he could not work then he was no longer the guesser he would just be a small man standing before a rickety assemblage of signs and scales trinkets and baubles without an audience to witness their display his skills might as well not exist the tourists had begun to thin and soon this place would hold no appeal for the guesser and his fellows the hucksters the nickelaride merchants the carnies and the flimflam men they would be forced to depart for more rewarding climes or hole up for the winter to live on the summers earnings the guesser could taste the sea and the sand upon his skin salty and lifeaffirming he never failed to notice it even after all these years the sea gave him his living in its way for it drew the crowds to it and the guesser was waiting for them when they came but his affinity for it ran deeper than the money that it brought him no he recognized something of his own essence in it in the taste of his sweat that was an echo of his own distant origins and the origin of all things for he believed that a man who did not understand the lure of the sea was a man who was lost to himself his thumb flipped expertly through the bills his lips moving slightly as he ran the count in his head when he was done he added the sum to his running total then compared it with his earnings from the same time last year he was down just as last year had been down from the year before and that year less than its predecessor in turn people were more cynical now and they and their children were less inclined to stand before a strange little man and his primitivelooking sideshow he had to work ever harder to earn even less although not so little that he was about to consider giving up his chosen profession after all what else would he do clear tables at a buffet maybe work behind the counter at mickey ds like some of the more desperate retirees that he knew reduced to cleaning up after mewling infants and careless teenagers no that wasnt for the guesser he had been following this path for the best part of forty years and the way he felt he figured he was good for a few more yet assuming he was spared by the great dealer in the sky his mind was still sharp and his eyes behind the blackframed lenses were still capable of taking in all that he needed to know about his marks in order to continue to make his modest living some might term what he had a gift but he did not call it that it was a skill a craft honed and developed year upon year a vestige of a sense that was strong in our ancestors but had now been dulled by the comforts of the modern world what he had was elemental like the tides and currents of the ocean dave the guesser glovsky had first arrived in old orchard beach in when he was thirtyseven years old and since then both his pitch and the tools of his trade had remained largely unchanged his little concession on the boardwalk was dominated by an old wooden chair suspended by chains from a set of r h forschner scales a yellow sign handpainted roughly with a squiggly line drawing of daves face advertised his occupation and his location just for those folks who maybe werent entirely sure where they were or what they were seeing once they got there the sign read the guesser palace playland old orchard beach me the guesser was a fixture at old orchard he was as much a part of the resort as the sand in the soda and the saltwater taffy that sucked the fillings from teeth this was his place and he knew it intimately he had been coming here for so long plying his trade that he was acutely aware of seemingly inconsequential changes to his environment a fresh coat of paint here a mustache shaved there such things were important to him for that was how he kept his mind keen and that in turn was how he put food on the table the guesser noticed all that went on around him filing the details away in his capacious memory ready to extract that knowledge at the very moment when it would most profit him to do so in a sense his nickname was a misnomer dave glovsky did not guess dave glovsky noticed he estimated he gauged unfortunately dave the noticer glovsky did not have quite the same ring about it neither did dave the estimator so dave the guesser it was and dave the guesser it would stay the guesser would guess your weight to within three pounds or you won a prize if that didnt salt your baconand there were folks who didnt particularly want their weight broadcast to a goodhumored crowd on a bright summers day thank you for asking and be about your business just as the guesser wasnt overly anxious to test the strength of his scales by dangling three hundred pounds of allamerican womanhood from them just to prove a pointthen he was equally happy to take a swing at your age your birth date your occupation your choice of car foreign or domestic even the brand of cigarettes that you favored if the guesser proved to be incorrect then you went on your merry way clutching a plastic hair clip or a small bag of rubber bands happy in the knowledge that youd beaten the funny little man with his crooked childlike signswerent you the smart oneand it might take you a while to figure out that youd just paid the man fifty cents for the pleasure of knowing something that you already knew before you arrived with the added bonus of receiving ten rubber bands that cost about one cent wholesale and it could be that maybe you looked back at the guesser wearing his white dave the guesser tshirt the letters ironed on in black at the concession stand farther along the boardwalk as a favor to dave because everybody knew the guesser and you figured that maybe the guesser was a very smart guy indeed because the guesser was smart smart in the way that sherlock holmes was smart or dupin or the little belgian poirot he was an observer a man who could ascertain the main circumstances of anothers existence from his clothes his shoes the way he carried his cash the state of his hands and his fingernails the things that caught his interest and attention as he walked along the boardwalk even the minute pauses and hesitations the vocal inflections and unconscious gestures by which he revealed himself in a thousand different ways he paid attention in a culture that no longer put any value upon such a simple act people did not listen or see but only thought that they listened and saw they missed more than they perceived their eyes and ears constantly attuned to novelty to the next new thing that might be thrown at them by tv the radio the movies discarding the old before they had even begun to understand its meaning and its value the guesser was not like them he belonged to a different order to an older dispensation he was attuned to sights and smells to whispers that sounded loud in his ears to tiny odors that tickled at the hairs in his nose and showed up as lights and colors in his mind his sight was only one of the faculties that he used and often it played a subsidiary role to the rest like early man he did not rely on his eyes as his primary source of information he trusted all his senses utilizing them to the fullest his mind was like a radio constantly tuned to even the faintest transmissions of others some of it was easy of course age and weight were relatively simple for him cars were pretty much a done deal too at least at the beginning when most of the people who came to old orchard for their vacations did so in americanmade cars it was only later in the eighties and nineties that imports would become more prevalent but even then the odds were still about fiftyfifty occupations well sometimes useful details might emerge in the course of the pitch as the guesser listened to their greetings their answers the way they responded to certain key words even while he was listening to what they were saying dave was examining their clothes and skin for telltale signs a worn or stained shirt cuff on the right hand indicated someone who might have a desk job and a lowly one if they had to wear their work shirt on vacation while a closer examination of their hands might reveal the impression of a pen upon the thumb and index finger sometimes there was a slight flattening to the fingertips on one or both hands the former perhaps suggesting that here was someone who was used to pounding an adding machine the latter almost certainly the sign of a typist chefs always had little burns on their forearms grill marks on their wrists calluses upon the index fingers of their knife hands healed and semihealed lines upon their flesh where the blades had nicked them and the guesser had yet to meet a mechanic who could scrub every trace of oil from the grooves of his skin he could tell a cop simply by looking at him and military types might just as well have arrived in full regalia but observation without memory was useless and the guesser was constantly taking in details from the crowds that thronged the seashore from fragments of conversations to flashes of possessions if you decided to light up then dave would remember that the pack was marlboro and that you were wearing a green tie if you parked your car within sight of his concession then you were red suspenders ford everything was compartmentalized in case it might prove useful for although the guesser never really lost out on his bets there was the small matter of professional pride and also the necessity of providing a good show for the watching folks the guesser hadnt survived at old orchard for decades just by guessing wrong then fobbing off the tourists with rubber bands by way of apology he pocketed his earnings and took a last look around before he prepared to close up he was tired and his head hurt a little but he would miss being here once the crowds were gone the guesser knew that there were those who bemoaned the state of old orchard and felt that the beautiful beach had been ruined by a century of development by the arrival of roller coasters and fun houses and merry gorounds by the smell of cotton candy and hot dogs and suntan lotion maybe they were right but there were plenty of other places for folks like that to go while there werent so many where people could come for a week with their kids and live relatively cheaply while enjoying the sea the sand and the pleasure of trying to beat men like the guesser true old orchard wasnt like it once was the kids were tougher maybe even a little more dangerous the town was looking more tawdry than before and there was a sense of innocence lost rather than innocence recaptured ocean park the familyoriented religious resort that was part of old orchard now looked increasingly like a throwback to another era when education and selfimprovement were as much a part of ones vacation time as amusement and relaxation he wondered how many of those who came here to drink cheap beer and eat lobster from paper plates knew of the methodists who had formed the old orchard campground association back in the s sometimes attracting crowds of ten thousand or more to hear speakers extoll the benefits of a virtuous sinfree life good luck trying to convince todays tourists to give up an afternoon of sunbathing to listen to stories from the bible you didnt have to be dave the guesser to figure out the odds on that one nevertheless the guesser loved old orchard through his little concession he had been privileged to meet men like tommy dorsey and louis armstrong and he had the pictures on his wall to prove it but while those encounters represented the great peaks of his career his dealings with ordinary people had given him consistent pleasure and allowed him to stay young and sharp inside without people old orchard would have meant far less to him sea or no sea the guesser was already putting away his signs and his scales when the man approached or perhaps it would be truer to say that the guesser became aware of his approach before he even saw the man for his longdeparted ancestors had not relied on their senses to play guessing games in flamelit caves no they had required these senses to stay alive to warn them of the coming of predators and enemies and so their continued survival was dependent upon their constant engagement with the world around them immediately the guesser turned casually and began taking in the stranger late thirties but looking older than his years his blue jeans looser than was the current fashion his tshirt white but stained slightly at the belly his boots heavy and suited to a motorcycle not a car yet without the wear on the soles that might have come from riding a hog his hair dark and greased back in a da his features sharp and almost delicate his chin small his head compressed as if from long suffering beneath a great weight placed upon it the bones in his face shaped like a kite beneath his tanned skin he had a scar below his hairline three parallel lines as though the tines of a fork had been inserted into his flesh and dragged down toward the bridge of his nose his mouth was crooked permanently downturned on one side and upturned slightly on the other giving the impression that the symbolic masks of drama had been bisected and their disparate halves fused together over his skull the lips were too big they might almost have been called sensuous but this was not a man whose demeanor spoke of such things his eyes were brown but flecked with tiny white flaws like stars and planets suspended in their darkness he smelled of eau de cologne and lurking beneath the rank stink of rendered animal fats of blood and decay and waste voided in the final moment when living became dying suddenly dave the guesser wished that he had decided to pack up fifteen minutes earlier that his concession stand were firmly locked and bolted and that he had already put as much distance between him and his beloved scales and signs as it was possible for a man of his advancing years to do but even as he tried to break eye contact with the new arrival he still found himself analyzing him drawing information from his movements his clothing his scent the man reached into one of the front pockets of his denims and drew from it a steel comb which he raked through his hair with his right hand his left following along behind to smooth down any stray strands he cocked his head slightly to the right as he did so as though sizing himself up in some mirror visible only to him and it took the guesser a moment to realize that he himself was that mirror the stranger knew all about dave and his gift and even as he willed himself to stop the guesser was separating the preening man into his constituent parts and the man was aware of what was being done and was enjoying seeing himself refracted through the older mans perceptions clean pressed denims but with dirt on the knees the stain on the tshirt like dried blood the earth beneath the nails the smell sweet god the smell and now the stranger was in front of him and the comb was being eased back into the tight sheath of his pocket the smile widened all false bonhomie and the man spoke you the guessin man he asked his accent had an element of the south to it but there was down east there as well he was trying to hide it but daves ear was too acute the touch of mainer to it wasnt native though no this was a man who could blend in when he chose who picked up the speech patterns and mannerisms of those around him camouflaging himself the way the way predators did im all done for today the guesser said tired out i got nothing left ah you got time for one more came the reply and the guesser knew that he was not being cajoled he was being told he looked around seeking a distraction an excuse to depart but now it seemed as if the stranger had cleared a space for himself for there was no one else within earshot and the attention of those who passed was clearly directed elsewhere they looked at the other concessions at the sea at the shifting sands they looked at distant cars and the unfamiliar faces of those who passed them by they looked at the old boardwalk and at their feet and deep into the eyes of husbands and wives whom they had long since ceased to find interesting but who now held inside them some previously unsuspected if fleeting source of fascination and had one suggested to them that they had somehow decided to turn their attention away from the little guesser and the man who now stood before him they would have dismissed the idea without appearing to give it a moments serious thought but to an observant personto someone like dave the guesserthe fleeting expression of unease upon their faces as they spoke would have been enough to give the lie to their protestations in that moment they had become a little like the guesser some ancient primal instinct woken from dormancy on a bright summer evening with the sun setting bloodily in the west maybe they truly didnt realize that they were doing it or perhaps selfrespect and selfpreservation prevented them from acknowledging it even to themselves but they were giving space to the man with the slickedback hair he exuded menace and threat and harm and just to acknowledge his existence was to risk drawing attention to oneself better then to look away better for another to suffer for a stranger to incur his displeasure than to have him take an interest in ones own affairs better to keep walking to get into ones car to drive away without a single backward glance for fear that one might find him staring into ones eyes his lazy half smile slowly widening as he memorized faces the numbers on a license plate the color of the paintwork the dark hair of a wife the budding body of an adolescent daughter better to pretend then better not to notice better that than to wake up in the night to find such a man staring down at you blood warm upon him and a telltale light coming from a nearby bedroom something dripping softly upon the bare floorboards within something that was once alive there now alive no longer dave knew then that this man was not so different from himself he was an observer a cataloger of human characteristics but in the strangers case the observations were a prelude to harm and now there were only the sounds of waves breaking and voices fading and the noises of the fairground rides dulling and muting as the stranger spoke his tone insisting upon the attention of the listener to the exclusion of all else i want you to guess somethin about me he said what do you want to know said the guesser and all pretense of goodwill departed from his own voice it would serve no purpose here they were equals of a sort the man closed his right hand into a fist two quarters rose from between his clenched fingers he raised the hand toward dave and dave removed the coins with fingers that barely trembled tell me what i do for a livin said the stranger and i want you to make your best guess your very best guess dave heard the warning he could have come up with something harmless something innocent you dig roads maybe youre a gardener you you work in an abattoir no too close mustnt say that you tear things apart living things you hurt and you kill and you bury the evidence beneath the ground and sometimes they fight back i see the scars around your eyes and in the soft flesh beneath your jaw theres a cluster of rough strands just above your forehead and an inflamed patch of red at its base where the hair hasnt grown back properly what happened did a hand get free did fingers grasp in desperation and tear a clump from your head and even in your pain was there not a part of you that relished the struggle that enjoyed having to work for its prize and what of those incisions below your hairline what of them you are a violent man and violence has been visited upon you you have been marked as a warning to others so that even those who are foolish and distracted might know you when you come too late for the one who did it perhaps but a warning nonetheless a lie might be the death of him maybe not now maybe not even a week from now but the man would remember and he would return some night dave the guesser would go back to his room and the stranger would be sitting in an easy chair in the darkness opposite the window taking long drags from a cigarette in his left hand his right toying with a blade glad you could make it at last i been waitin for you you remember me i asked you to guess somethin about me but you guessed wrong you gave me a childs toy as a prize a prize for beating the guesser but that aint prize enough for me and you was wrong to think that it was i figure i ought to correct your misapprehension i figure you really ought to know what i do for a livin here let me show you the stranger turned his hands slowly for dave displaying the palms then the backs of the hands and finally the almost delicate fingers a thin sliver of dirt visible beneath the tip of each nail so tell me he said tell me true dave looked him in the eye you cause pain said dave the stranger looked amused is that so he said you hurt people uhhuh youve killed and dave both heard himself say the words and saw himself from without he was floating apart from the scene unfolding before him his soul already anticipating the separation from this life that was to come the stranger shook his head and looked at his own hands as though quietly astonished at what they had revealed well he said at last i reckon thats worth fifty cents of any mans money and no mistake thats quite the tale quite the tale he nodded to himself uhhuh he said softly uhhuh you want to claim a prize said dave you can have a prize if i guessed wrong he gestured behind him at the rubber bands the hair clips the packs of balloons take one please take one take em all anything you want just get away from me walk away and keep walking and never ever come back here and if its any consolation know that ill never forget the smell of you or the sight of you not ever ill keep it with me and ill always be watching for you in case you come again nah said the stranger you keep em i was entertained you entertained me he backed away from dave the guesser still nodding still softly uhhuhing just as the guesser felt certain he was about to be rid of him the stranger stopped professional pride he said suddenly pardon me said the guesser i think thats what we got in common we take pride in what we do you could have lied to me but you didnt i could have lied to you and taken one of them shitty balloon packs but i didnt do that either you respected me and i respected you in return were men you and i the guesser didnt reply there was nothing to say he tasted something in his mouth it was sour and unpleasant he wanted to open his mouth and breathe in the salt sea air but not yet not while the stranger was nearby he wanted to be rid of him first for fear that some of his essence might enter him in that single breath polluting his being you can tell folks about me if you like said the stranger i dont much care either way ill be long gone before anybody takes it into his head to come looking for me and even if they do find me what are they gonna say that some little sideshow huckster in a cheap tshirt told them to look me up that maybe i might have somethin to hide or a story to tell his hands busied themselves retrieving his pack of cigarettes from his jeans the pack was battered and slightly flattened he shook a slim brass lighter from within then followed it with a cigarette he rolled the cigarette between his finger and thumb before lighting up the lighter and the pack disappearing back into his pocket maybe ill be through here again someday he said ill look you up ill be here said the guesser come back if you like then you animal make no mistake im scared of you and i believe that i have good cause to be but dont think im going to show it you wont get that satisfaction not from me i hope so said the stranger i surely do hope so but the guesser never saw him again although he thought of him often and once or twice in his remaining years as he stood on the boardwalk and appraised the passing crowds he was conscious of eyes upon him and he felt certain that somewhere nearby the stranger was watching him perhaps in amusement or as the guesser often feared perhaps with regret for ever allowing the truth about himself to be revealed in such a way and with the desire to undo that mistake dave the guesser glovsky died in nearly fifty years after he had first arrived in old orchard beach he spoke of the stranger to those who would listen of the stink of fats that arose from him and the dirt beneath his nails and the copper stains upon his shirt most of those who heard merely shook their heads at what they believed was just another attempt by the showman to add to his own legend but some listened and they remembered and they passed on the tale so that others might be watchful for such a man in case he returned the guesser of course had been right the man did come back in the years that followed sometimes for his own purposes and sometimes on the orders of others and he both took and created life but when he returned for the last time he drew the clouds around him like a cloak darkening the skies as he came seeking death and the memory of a death in the faces of others he was a broken man and he would break others in his anger he was merrick the revenger chapter i it was an overcast late november morning the grass splintered by hoarfrost and winter grinning through the gaps in the clouds like a bad clown peering through the curtains before the show begins the city was slowing down soon the cold would hit hard and like an animal portland had stored its fat for the long months ahead there were tourist dollars in the bank enough it was hoped to tide everyone over until memorial day the streets were quieter than they once were the locals who coexisted sometimes uneasily with the leaf peepers and outlet shoppers now had their home almost to themselves once more they claimed their regular tables in diners and coffee shops in restaurants and bars there was time to pass idle conversation with waitresses and chefs the professionals no longer run ragged by the demands of customers whose names they did not know at this time of year it was possible to feel the true rhythm of the small city the slow beating of its heart untroubled by the false stimulus of those who came from away i was sitting at a corner table in the porthole eating bacon and fried potatoes and not watching kathleen kennedy and stephen frazier talking about the secretary of states surprise visit to iraq there was no sound from the tv which made ignoring it a whole lot easier a stove fire burned next to the window overlooking the water the masts of the fishing boats bobbed and swayed in the morning breeze and a handful of people occupied the other tables just enough to create the kind of welcoming ambience that a breakfast venue required for such things rely on a subtle balance the porthole still looked like it did when i was growing up perhaps even as it had since it first opened in there were greenmarbled linoleum tiles on the floor cracked here and there but spotlessly clean a long wooden counter topped with copper stretched almost the entire length of the room its blackcushioned metal stools anchored to the floor the counter dotted with glasses condiments and two glass plates of freshly baked muffins the walls were painted light green and if you stood up you could peer into the kitchen through the twin serving hatches divided by a painted scallops sign a chalkboard announced the days specials and there were five beer taps serving guinness a few allagash and shipyard ales and for those who didnt know any better or who did and just didnt give a rats ass coors light there were buoys hanging from the walls which in any other dining establishment in the old port might have come across as kitsch but here were simply a reflection of the fact that this was a place frequented by locals who fished one wall was almost entirely glass so even on the dullest of mornings the porthole appeared to be flooded with light in the porthole you were always aware of the comforting buzz of conversation but you could never quite hear all of what anyone nearby was saying not clearly this morning about twenty people were eating drinking and easing themselves into the day the way mainers will do five workers from the harbor fish market sat in a row at the bar all dressed identically in blue jeans hooded tops and baseball caps laughing and stretching in the warmth their faces bitten red by the elements beside me four businessmen had cell phones and notepads interspersed with their white coffee mugs making out as if they were working but from the occasional snatches that drifted over to me and could be understood seemingly more interested in singing the praises of pirates coach kevin dineen across from them two women a mother and daughter were having one of those discussions that required a lot of hand gestures and shocked expressions they looked as if they were having a ball i liked the porthole the tourists dont come here much certainly not in winter and even in summer they hadnt tended to disturb the balance much until someone strung a banner over wharf street advertising the fact that there was more to this seemingly unpromising stretch of waterfront than met the eye boones seafood restaurant the harbor fish market the comedy connection and the porthole itself even that hadnt exactly led to an onslaught banner or no banner the porthole didnt scream the fact of its existence and a battered soda sign and a fluttering flag were the only actual indication of its presence visible from the main drag of commercial in a sense you kind of needed to know that it was there to see it in the first place especially on dark winter mornings and any lingering tourists walking along commercial at the start of a bitter maine winters day needed to have a pretty good idea of where they were headed if they were going to make it to spring with their health intact faced with a bracing noreaster few had the time or the inclination to explore the hidden corners of the city still offseason travelers sometimes made their way past the fish market and the comedy club their feet echoing solidly on the old wood of the boardwalk that bordered the wharf to the left and found themselves at the portholes door and it was a good bet that the next time they came to portland they would head straight for the porthole again but maybe they wouldnt tell too many of their friends about it because it was the kind of place that you liked to keep to yourself there was a deck outside overlooking the water where people could sit and eat in summer but in winter they removed the tables and left the deck empty i think i liked it better in winter i could take a cup of coffee in hand and head out safe in the knowledge that most folks preferred to drink their coffee inside where it was warm and that i wasnt likely to be disturbed by anyone i would smell the salt and feel the sea breeze on my skin and if the wind and the weather were right the scent would remain with me for the rest of the morning mostly i liked that scent sometimes if i was feeling bad i didnt care so much for it because the taste of the salt on my lips reminded me of tears as if i had recently tried to kiss away anothers pain when that happened i thought of rachel and of sam my daughter often too i thought of the wife and daughter who had gone before them days like that were silent days but today i was inside and i was wearing a jacket and tie the tie was a deep red hugo boss the jacket armani yet nobody in maine ever paid much attention to labels everyone figured that if you were wearing it then youd bought it at a discount and if you hadnt and had paid ticket instead then you were an idiot i hadnt paid ticket the front door opened and a woman entered she was wearing a black pantsuit and a coat that had probably cost her a lot when she bought it but was now showing its age her hair was black but colored with something that lent it a hint of red she looked a little surprised by her surroundings as though having made her way down past the battered exteriors of the wharf buildings she had expected to be mugged by pirates her eyes alighted on me and her head tilted quizzically i raised a finger and she made her way through the tables to where i sat i rose to meet her and we shook hands mr parker she said ms clay im sorry im late there was an accident on the bridge the traffic was backed up a ways rebecca clay had called me the day before asking if i might be able to help her with a problem she was having she was being stalked and not surprisingly she didnt much care for it the cops had been able to do nothing the man she said seemed almost to sense their coming because he was always gone by the time they arrived no matter how stealthily they approached the vicinity of her house when she reported his presence i had been doing as much general work as i could get in part to keep my mind off the absence of rachel and sam we had been apart on and off for about nine months im not even sure how things had deteriorated so badly and so quickly it seemed like one minute they were there filling the house with their scents and their sounds and the next they were leaving for rachels parents house but of course it wasnt like that at all looking back i could see every turn in the road every dip and curve that had led us to where we now were it was supposed to be a temporary thing a chance for both of us to consider to take a little time out from each other and try to recall what it was about the other person with whom we shared our life that was so important to us we could not live without it but such arrangements are never temporary not really there is a sundering a rift that occurs and even if an accommodation is reached and a decision made to try again the fact that one person left the other is never really forgotten or forgiven that makes it sound like it was her fault but it wasnt im not sure that it was mine either not entirely she had to make a choice and so did i but her choice was dependent upon the one that i made in the end i let them both go but in the hope that they would return we still talked and i could see sam whenever i wanted to but the fact that they were over in vermont made that a little difficult distances notwithstanding i was careful about visiting and not just because i didnt want to complicate an already difficult situation i took care because i still believed that there were those who would hurt them to get at me i think that was why i let them leave its so hard to remember now the last year had beendifficult i missed them a great deal but i did not know either how to bring them back into my life or how to live with their absence they had left a void in my existence and others had tried to take their place the ones who waited in the shadows the first wife and the first daughter i ordered coffee for rebecca clay a beam of morning sunlight shone mercilessly upon her exposing the lines in her face the gray seeping into her hair despite the color job the dark patches beneath her eyes some of that was probably due to the man she claimed was bothering her but it was clear that much of it had deeper origins the troubles of her life had aged her prematurely from the way her makeup had been applied hurriedly and heavily it was possible to guess that here was a woman who didnt like looking in the mirror for too long and who didnt like what she saw staring back at her when she did i dont think ive ever been here before she said portland has changed so much these last few years its a wonder that this place has survived she was right i supposed the city was changing but older quirkier remnants of its past somehow contrived to remain used bookstores and barbershops and bars where the menu never changed because the food had always been good right from the start that was why the porthole had survived those who knew about it valued it and made sure to pass a little business its way whenever they could her coffee arrived she added sugar then stirred it for too long what can i do for you ms clay she stopped stirring content to begin speaking now that the conversation had been started for her its like i told you on the phone a man has been bothering me bothering you how he hangs around outside my house i live out by willard beach ive seen him in freeport too or when ive been shopping at the mall was he in a car or on foot on foot has he entered your property no has he threatened you or physically assaulted you in any way no how long has this been going on just over a week has he spoken to you only once two days ago what did he say he told me that he was looking for my father my daughter and i live in my fathers old house now he said he had some business with him how did you respond to that i told him that i hadnt seen my father in years i told him that as far as i was aware my father was dead in fact since earlier this year hes been legally dead i went through all of the paperwork i didnt want to but i suppose it was important to me and to my daughter that we finally achieved some kind of closure tell me about your father he was a child psychiatrist a good one he worked with adults too sometimes but they had usually suffered some kind of trauma in childhood and felt that he could help them with it then things started to change for him there was a difficult case a man was accused of abuse by his son in the course of a custody dispute my father felt that the allegations had substance and his findings led to custody being granted to the mother but the son subsequently retracted his accusations and said that his mother had convinced him to say those things by then it was too late for the father word had leaked out about the allegations probably from the mother he lost his job and got beaten up pretty badly by some men in a bar he ended up shooting himself dead in his bedroom my father took it badly and there were complaints filed about his conduct of the original interviews with the boy the board of licensure dismissed them but after that my father wasnt asked to conduct any further evaluations in abuse cases it shook his confidence i think when was this about six years ago maybe a little more it got worse after that she shook her head in apparent disbelief at the memory even talking about it i realize how crazy it all sounds it was just a mess she looked around to reassure herself that nobody was listening then lowered her voice a little it emerged that some of my fathers patients were sexually abused by a group of men and there were questions asked again about my fathers methods and his reliability my father blamed himself for what happened other people did too the board of licensure summoned him to appear for an initial informal meeting to discuss what had happened but he never made it he drove out to the edge of the north woods abandoned his car and that was the last anyone ever saw or heard of him the police looked for him but they never found any trace that was in late september clay rebecca clay youre daniel clays daughter she nodded something flashed across her face it was an involuntary spasm a kind of wince i knew a little about daniel clay portland is a small place a city in name only stories like daniel clays tended to linger in the collective memory i didnt know too many of the details but like everyone else id heard the rumors rebecca clay had summarized the circumstances of her fathers disappearance in the most general terms and i didnt blame her for leaving out the rest the whispers that dr daniel clay might have known about what was happening to some of the children with whom he was dealing the possibility that he might have colluded in it might even have engaged in abuse himself there had been an investigation of sorts but there were records missing from his office and the confidential nature of his vocation made it difficult to follow up leads there was also the absence of any solid evidence against him but that didnt stop people from talking and drawing their own conclusions i looked closer at rebecca clay her fathers identity made her appearance a little easier to understand i imagined that she kept herself to herself there would be friends but not many daniel clay had cast a shadow upon his daughters life and she had wilted under its influence so you told this man the one whos been stalking you that you hadnt seen your father for a long time how did he react he tapped the side of his nose and winked she replicated the gesture for me then he said liar liar pants on fire he told me that hed give me some time to think about what i was saying after that he just walked away why would he call you a liar did he give any indication that he might know something more about your fathers disappearance no and the police havent been able to trace him he melts away i think they believe im making up stories to get attention but im not i wouldnt do that i i waited you know about my father there are those who believe that he did something wrong i think the police believe it too and sometimes i wonder if they think i know more than i do about what happened and that ive been protecting my father for all this time when they came to the house i knew what was on their minds that i did know where he was and somehow ive been in contact with him over the years and have you she blinked hard but she held my gaze no but now it seems like the police arent the only ones who doubt your story what does this man look like hes in his sixties i think his hair is black it looks dyed and its in kind of a quiff the way those fifties rock stars used to wear their hair he has brown eyes and theres scarring here she pointed to her forehead just below her hairline there are three parallel marks like someone dug a fork into his skin and dragged it down hes short maybe fivefive or so but stocky his arms are real big and there are folds of muscle at the back of his neck he mostly wears the same clothes blue jeans and a tshirt sometimes with a black suit jacket other times with an old black leather jacket he has a paunch but hes not fat not really his nails are very short and he keeps himself real clean except she stopped i didnt disturb her as she tried to figure out the best way of formulating what she wanted to say he wears some kind of cologne its wicked strong but when he was speaking to me it was like i caught a hint of whatever it was masking it was a bad smell a kind of animal stench it made me want to run away from him did he tell you his name no he just said that he had business with my father i kept telling him my father was dead but he shook his head and smiled at me he said he wouldnt believe any man was dead until he could smell the body have you any idea why this man should have turned up now so many years after your fathers disappearance he didnt say it could be that he heard news of the legal declaration of my fathers death for probate purposes under maine law a person was presumed dead after a continuous absence of five years during which time he had not been heard from and his absence had not been satisfactorily explained in some cases the court could order a reasonably diligent search the notification of law enforcement and public welfare officials about the details of the case and require that a request for information be posted in the newspapers according to rebecca clay she had complied with all the conditions that the court had set but no further information about her father had emerged as a result there was also a piece about my father in an art magazine earlier this year after i sold a couple of his paintings i needed the money my father was a pretty talented artist he spent a lot of time in the woods painting and sketching his work doesnt go for much by modern standardsthe most i ever got for one was a thousand dollarsbut ive been able to sell some from time to time when money was scarce my father didnt exhibit and he produced only a relatively small body of work he sold by word of mouth and his paintings were always sought after by those collectors familiar with him by the end of his life he was receiving offers to buy work that didnt even exist yet what kind of paintings are we talking about landscapes mostly i can probably show you some photographs if youre interested ive sold them all now apart from one i knew some people in portland s art scene i thought i might ask them about daniel clay in the meantime there was the matter of the man who was bothering his daughter im not just concerned for my own sake she said my daughter jenna shes just eleven im afraid to let her out of the house alone now ive tried to explain to her a little of whats been happening but i dont want to frighten her too much either what do you want me to do about this man i said it seemed like a strange question to ask i knew but it was necessary rebecca clay had to understand what she was getting herself into i want you to talk to him i want you to make him go away thats two different things what talking to him and making him go away she looked puzzled youll have to excuse me she said im not following you we need to be clear on some things before we begin i can approach him on your behalf and we can try to clear all of this up without trouble it could be that hell see reason and go about his business but from what youve told me it sounds like hes got some notions fixed in his head which means that he might not go without a fight if thats the case either we can try to get the cops to take him in and look for a court order preventing him from approaching you which can be hard to get and even harder to enforce or we can find some other way to convince him that he should leave you alone you mean threaten him or hurt him she seemed to quite like the idea i didnt blame her i had met people who had endured years of harassment from individuals and had seen them worn down by tension and distress some of them had resorted to violence in the end but it usually just led to an escalation of the problem one couple i knew had even ended up being sued by the wifes stalker after the husband threw a punch in frustration further entangling their lives with his theyre options i said but they leave us open to charges of assault or threatening behavior worse if the situation is not handled carefully then this whole affair could get much worse right now he hasnt done more than make you uneasy which is bad enough if we strike at him he may decide to strike back it could put you in real danger she almost slumped with frustration so what can i do look i said im not trying to make out that theres no hope of resolving this painlessly i just want you to understand that if he decides to stick around then there are no quick fixes she perked up slightly so youll take the job i told her my rates i informed her that as a oneman agency i wouldnt take on other jobs that might conflict with my work on her behalf if it became necessary to call on outside help i would advise her of any additional costs that might arise at any point she could call a halt to our arrangement and i would try to help her find some other way of handling her problem before i left the job she seemed content with that i took payment up front for the first week i didnt exactly need the money for myselfmy lifestyle was pretty simplebut i made a point of sending some money to rachel every month even though she said it wasnt necessary i agreed to start the following day i would stay close to rebecca clay when she headed out to work in the mornings she would inform me when she was leaving her office for lunch for meetings or to go home in the evening her house was fitted with an alarm but i arranged to have someone check it out just in case and to fit extra bolts and chains if necessary i would be outside before she left in the morning and i would remain within sight of the house until she went to bed at any time she could contact me and i would be with her within twenty minutes i asked her if by any chance she might have a photograph of her father that she could give me she had anticipated the request although she appeared slightly reluctant to hand it over after she had taken it from her bag it showed a thin gangly man wearing a green tweed suit his hair was snowwhite his eyebrows bushy he wore a pair of steelrimmed spectacles and he had a stern oldfashioned air of academia about him he looked like a man who belonged amid clay pipes and leatherbound volumes ill have some copies made and get it back to you i said i have others she replied hold on to it for as long as you need to she asked me if i would keep an eye on her while she was in town that day she worked in real estate and had some business to attend to for a couple of hours she was worried that the man might approach her while she was in the city she offered to pay me extra but i declined i had nothing better to do anyway so i followed her for the rest of the day nothing happened and there was no sign of the man with the dated quiff and the scars upon his face it was tedious and tiring but at least it meant that i did not have to return to my house my notquiteempty house i shadowed her so that my own ghosts could not shadow me chapter ii the revenger walked along the boardwalk at old orchard close to where the guessers concession had stood for summer upon summer the old man was gone now and the revenger supposed that he was probably dead dead or no longer capable of performing the feats that he once had his eyes unable to see as clearly his hearing muffled and decayed his memory too fragmented to record and order the information being fed to it the revenger wondered if the showman had remembered him until the end he thought that might have been the case for was it not in the mans nature to forget little to discard nothing that might prove useful he had been fascinated by the guessers talent had watched him discreetly for an hour or more before he had eventually approached him for the first time on that cool evening close to summers end it was an extraordinary talent to find in such a small strangelooking little man surrounded by cheap trinkets in a simple booth to be able to tell so much at a glance to deconstruct an individual almost without thinking forming a picture of his life in the time that it took most people to glance at a clock from time to time he had come back to this place and had hidden himself in the crowds watching the guesser from a distance and even then had the little man not been aware of him had he not seen him scan the crowds uneasily seeking the eyes that examined him too closely his nostrils twitching like a rabbit sensing the approach of the fox perhaps that was why he had come back here as if by some faint chance the guesser had chosen to remain in this place seeing out the winter close by the waters edge instead of fleeing it for warmer climes if the revenger had found him here what would he have said teach me tell me how i may know the man whom i seek i will be lied to i want to learn how to recognize the lie when it comes would he have explained why he had come back to this place and would the little man have believed him of course he would for a lie would not slip past him but the guesser was long gone and so the revenger was left only with the memory of their single meeting there had been blood on his hands that day it had been a comparatively simple task to accomplish a vulnerable man laid to rest a man who might have been tempted to barter what he knew for protection from those who sought him from the moment that he had fled his time left on this earth had been counted in seconds and minutes hours and days and no more than that as five days became six he had been found and he had been killed there was fear at the end but little pain it was not for merrick to torture or torment though he did not doubt that in those final moments as the victims understood the implacable nature of the one who had come for them there had been torment enough he was a professional not a sadist merrick that was his name then it was the name on his record the name that he had been given at birth but it now meant nothing to him merrick was a killer but he killed for others not himself it was an important distinction a man who killed for his own purposes his own ends was a man at the mercy of emotions and such men made mistakes the old merrick had been a professional he was detached disengaged or so he told himself although in the quiet after the kill he sometimes allowed himself to acknowledge the pleasure that it gave him but the old merrick merrick the killer no longer existed another man had taken his place dooming himself in the process but what choice was there perhaps the old merrick had been dying from the moment his child was born his will weakened and ultimately broken by the knowledge that she was in the world the revenger thought again of the guesser and of the moments they had passed together in this place if you looked at me now old man what would you see you would see a man without a name a father without a child and you would see the fire of his rage consuming him from within the revenger turned his back on the sea for there was work to be done the house was silent when i returned a brief welcome bark from my dog walter i was grateful for that since rachel and sam had left it seemed that those other presences long denied had found ways to colonize the spaces once occupied by the two who had taken their place i had learned not to answer their call to ignore the creaking of boards or the sound of footsteps upon the bedroom ceiling as though presences paced the attic space seeking what was once theirs among the boxes and cases that filled the room to dismiss the gentle tapping upon the windows when darkness came choosing instead to call it something other than what it was it sounded like branches stirred by the wind their very tips glancing against the glass except that there were no trees near my windows and no branch had ever tapped with such regularity or such insistence sometimes i would awaken in the darkness without quite knowing what had disturbed my rest conscious only that there had been sound where no sound belonged and perhaps faintly aware of whispered words trailing off as my conscious mind began reerecting the barriers that sleep had temporarily lowered the house was never truly empty something else had made its home there i should i know have spoken to rachel about it long before she left i should have been honest with her and told her that my dead wife and my lost daughter or some phantasms that were not quite them would not give me peace rachel was a psychologist she would have understood she loved me and she would have tried to help me in whatever way she could it may be that she would have spoken of residual guilt of the minds delicate balance of how some suffering is so great and so terrible that a full recovery is simply beyond the capacities of any human being and i would have nodded and said yes yes it is so knowing that there was some truth in what she said and yet that it was not enough to explain the nature of what had occurred in my life since my wife and child were taken from me but i did not say those words afraid that to speak them aloud would be to give what was occurring a reality i did not want to acknowledge i denied their presence and my doing so tightened their grip upon me rachel was very beautiful her hair was red her skin pale there was much of her in sam our daughter and just a little of me when last we spoke rachel told me that sam was sleeping better now there were times while we had lived together beneath this roof when her sleep had been disturbed when rachel or i would wake to the sound of her laughter and occasionally her tears one or the other of us would check on her and watch as she reached out with her small hands snatching at unseen things in the air before her or as she turned her head to follow the progress of figures that only she could see and i would notice that the room was cold colder than it should have been and rachel i thought although she said nothing noticed it too three months before i had attended a talk at the portland public library two people a doctor and a psychic had debated the existence of supernatural phenomena frankly i was slightly embarrassed to be there i seemed to be keeping company with some people who didnt wash often enough and who judging by the questions that followed the session were intent upon accepting as true every manner of mumbo jumbo of which the spirit world appeared merely to be one small part taking its place alongside angels who looked like fairies ufos and alien lizards in human form the doctor spoke of auditory hallucinations that he said were by far the most common experienced by those who spoke of ghosts older people he continued particularly those with parkinsons sometimes suffered from an ailment called lewy body dementia which caused them to see foreshortened bodies that explained the prevalence of stories in which the spirits allegedly glimpsed appeared to be cut off at the knees he spoke of other possible triggers of diseases of the temporal lobe of tumors and schizophrenia and of depression he described hypnagogic dreams those vivid images that come to us in the spaces between sleeping and waking and yet he concluded he still could not entirely explain away all reported supernatural experiences using science alone there was too much that we did not know he said about the workings of the brain about stress and depression about mental illness and the nature of grief the psychic by contrast was an old fraud full of the nonsense that seems to come with the worst of her kind she spoke of beings with unfinished business of seances and messages from the world beyond she had a cable tv show and a premiumrate telephone line and she performed her routine for the poor and the gullible at community halls and elk lodges across the northeast she said that ghosts haunt places not people i think that is a lie someone once told me that we create our own ghosts that as in dreams each one of them is a facet of ourselves our guilt our regrets our grief perhaps that may be an answer of sorts each of us has our ghosts not every one of them is of our own creation and yet they find us all in the end rebecca clay sat in her kitchen there was a glass of red wine before her although it remained untouched and all of the lights were extinguished she should have asked the detective to stay with her the man had never approached her house and she was confident in the security of its doors and windows and the efficiency of its alarms particularly after they had been checked by a consultant recommended by the detective but as the night had drawn in such precautions began to seem insufficient and now she was aware of every noise in the old building every settling of boards and rattling of cupboards as the wind played through the house like an errant child the window above the kitchen sink was very dark quartered by the white frame with nothing visible beyond she might have been floating through the blackness of space with only the thinnest of barriers separating her from the vacuum beyond were it not for the gentle exclamation of unseen waves breaking upon the beach for want of something better to do she brought the glass to her lips and sipped carefully noticing just too late the musty smell that arose from the wine she grimaced then spit it back into the glass and rose from the table she walked to the sink and poured the liquid away before turning on the faucet and washing the red splashes from the metal leaning down she sipped water straight from the flow cleansing her mouth of the taste it reminded her uncomfortably of the way her exhusband had tasted and the rankness of his kisses in the night as their marriage entered its final terminal decline she knew that he had detested her then just as much as she now hated him and he had wanted to be rid of this burden that they shared rebecca had no longer wished to offer her body to him and had felt not even the tiniest residue of the attraction she had once enjoyed but he had found a way to separate love and need she wondered sometimes of whom he fantasized as he moved upon her sometimes his eyes grew vacant and she knew that even as his body was bound to hers his true self was far away at other times though there was an intensity to his gaze a kind of loathing as he stared down at her that made the sexual act feel like a violation there was no love in it then and as she looked back upon those years she found it hard to remember if there had ever been love there she had tried to do the same of course to conjure up images of past or potential lovers to make the experience less unpleasant but they were too few and they brought with them their own troubles and in the end she had simply given up her appetites had faded to such a degree that it was easier just to think of other things entirely or to look forward to the time when this man would be gone from her life she could not even recall why she had wanted to be with him to begin with and he with her she supposed that with a young daughter and all that had happened with her father she had just desired some stability for a time but he had not been the man to give it to her there had been a debased element to his attraction to her as though he saw something within her that was corrupted and he had enjoyed touching it by entering her he had not even liked her daughter very much the product of a relationship begun before she was fully ready to have one and who knows perhaps she was never meant to have a proper relationship not really jennas father had drifted away he had seen his child only a handful of times and then only in the early years he would not even recognize her now rebecca thought then realized that she was thinking of him as if he were still alive she tried to feel something for him but she could not his life had ended prematurely on a dark minor road far from home his body dumped in a ditch his hands tied roughly behind his back with fuse wire blood soaking into the soft ground to feed the small scurrying things that burrowed up from below to scavenge upon him he had not been good for her he had probably not been good for very much at all which was why he had ended up the way he did he had never been one to keep his promises to make good on his commitments it was inevitable she supposed that one day he would encounter someone who would not forgive him his trespasses and would instead extract a final grim payment from him for a time jenna had asked a lot of questions about him but in recent years they had become fewer and fewer until at last they were either forgotten or she elected to keep them unspoken she had not yet worked out how to inform jenna that her father was dead he had been killed earlier that year and she had not found the right opportunity to talk with jenna of his death she was deliberately putting it off she knew yet still she waited now in the darkness of her kitchen she decided that when jenna next raised the subject of her father she would tell her daughter the truth about him she thought again about the private detective in a sense jennas father was the reason that she had approached him jennas paternal grandfather had talked of the detective he had wanted him to look for his son but the detective had turned him down she thought that the old man might have felt bitterness toward him especially after the way things had worked out but he had not perhaps he understood that his son was already a lost cause even if he refused to surrender himself to the consequences of that understanding if he had no faith in his son then how could he expect another a stranger to believe in him instead so he did not blame the detective for declining to help him and rebecca had remembered his name when the stranger came asking about her own father the faucet was still running so she began to pour the rest of the bottle down the sink the water circled around the drain stained with red jenna was asleep upstairs rebecca was making plans to send her away if the detective could not quickly rid her of the strangers attentions so far the man had not approached jenna but she was concerned that such a situation might not last and he would use the daughter to get at the mother she would tell jennas school that the child was sick and she would deal with the repercussions when the time came then again perhaps she might simply tell them the truth that a man was bothering her that jenna might be at risk if she stayed in portland surely they would understand why now she wondered it was the same question the detective had asked her why after so many years had gone by would someone come asking about her father what did he know about the circumstances of the disappearance she had tried to ask him but he had only tapped his forefinger against his nose in that knowing way of his before saying it aint his disappearance im interested in missy its anothers hell know though hell know the stranger had spoken of her father as though he were certain that he was still alive more to the point he seemed to think that she knew it too he wanted answers she could not give him she lifted her head and saw herself reflected in the window the sight gave her a sudden shock so that she jerked slightly the face before her turning from a single image to a double through a flaw in the glass but when she had regained her composure the second image still remained it was like her yet not like her as though she had somehow shed her skin as a snake might and the discarded membrane had settled upon the features of another then the figure outside drew closer and the impression of a doppelgänger faded leaving only the stranger in a leather jacket his dark hair slick with grease she heard his voice distorted by the thickness of the glass but she could not understand his words he pressed his hands against the glass then slid the palms down until the tips of his fingers were resting against the window frame he pushed but the lock inside held his face contorted in anger and he bared his teeth you get away from me she said you get away now or so help me his hands withdrew and then rebecca saw a fist punch its way through the glass shaking the frame and showering the sink with fragments she screamed but the sound was caught up in the screeching of the alarm blood coursed down the shattered pane as the stranger pulled his hand back through the glass not even attempting to avoid the jagged edges that ripped at his skin tearing red channels across his palms and severing veins he stared at the wounded fist as if it were a thing beyond his control surprising him with its actions she heard the phone ring and knew that it was the monitoring company if she didnt reply the police would be called and someone would be sent to check up on her i shouldnt ought to have done that said the man i apologize but she could barely hear him over the shrieking of the alarm he tilted his head to her it was a strangely respectful gesture almost oldfashioned in its courtliness she stifled the urge to giggle fearful that if she started to laugh she would never stop that she would descend into hysteria and never surface from it again the phone stopped then began to ring again she made no move toward it instead she watched as the stranger retreated leaving her sink covered with his blood she smelled it as slowly it combined with the stink of the corked wine to create something terrible and new lacking only a chalice from which it might be sipped chapter iii i sat at rebecca clays kitchen table watching as she cleaned the broken glass from the sink with a brush and pan there was still blood on the windowpane she had notified the cops immediately after calling me and a south portland cruiser had arrived shortly before i did i had identified myself to the patrolman and listened as rebecca gave her statement but otherwise i had not interfered in any way her daughter jenna sat on a sofa in the living room clutching a china doll that looked like it might once have belonged to her mother the doll had red hair and wore a blue dress it was obvious that it was an old and cherished possession the mere fact that the girl was seeking comfort from it at this time attested to its value she did not seem as shaken as her mother appearing more puzzled than disturbed she also struck me as both older and younger than her years older in appearance yet younger in her demeanor and i wondered if perhaps her mother sheltered and protected her a little too much there was another woman sitting with jenna rebecca introduced her as april a friend who lived nearby she shook my hand and said that since i was there and jenna seemed okay shed go home so that she wouldnt be in the way rebecca kissed her on the cheek and they hugged then april leaned back and held rebecca at arms length a look passed between them one that spoke of shared knowledge of years of friendship and loyalty you call me said april anytime i will thanks hon april kissed jenna goodbye then left i watched jenna while rebecca walked the cop around the outside of the house pointing out the place where the stranger had stood the child would grow up to be a very beautiful young woman there was something of her mother in her but it was rendered more striking by a slim aquiline grace that came from elsewhere i thought i saw something of her grandfather in her as well you doing okay i asked her she nodded when something like this happens it can be kind of scary i continued its happened to me and i was scared i wasnt scared she said and her tone was so matteroffact that i knew she wasnt lying why not the man didnt want to hurt us hes just sad how do you know that she just smiled and shook her head it doesnt matter have you spoken to him no then how do you know that he doesnt mean you harm she looked away that almost beatific smile still on her face the conversation was clearly over her mother came back inside with the cop and jenna told her that she was going back to bed rebecca hugged her and told her that shed check on her later jenna said goodbye to the cop and me then went upstairs to her room rebecca clay lived in an area known as willard her house a compact but impressive nineteenthcentury structure in which she had grown up and to which she had returned after her fathers disappearance stood on willard haven park a dead end that ran perpendicular to willard beach a few steps across willard haven road when the cop eventually left promising that a detective would call either later that night or the next morning i took a look around walking in his footsteps but it was clear that the man who had broken the glass was long gone i followed a trail of blood to deake street which ran parallel to willard haven park on the right then lost it where he had climbed into a car and driven away i called rebecca clay from the sidewalk and she gave me the names of some of the neighbors who lived within sight of where the car had been parked only one of them a middleaged woman named lisa hulmer who sported the kind of look that suggested she might consider the description whorish a compliment had seen anything and even that wasnt much help to me she remembered a dark red car parked across the street but she couldnt tell me the make or the tag number she did invite me into her home though and suggested that i might like to join her for a drink i had clearly disturbed her in the act of consuming a jug of something fruity and alcoholic when she closed the front door behind me it reminded me uncomfortably of a cell slamming shut on a condemned man its a little early for me i said but its after tenthirty im a late sleeper me too she grinned and arced an eyebrow in what would only have passed for a suggestive manner if you were especially susceptible to suggestion like a dog or a small child once you get me into bed you just cant get me out of it thatsnice i said for want of a better word youre nice she said she swayed a little and fiddled with a seashell chain that hung between her breasts but by then i had opened the door and was backing out of the house before she shot me with a dart and chained me to a wall in her basement did you find out anything rebecca clay asked me when i got back to her house not much apart from the fact that one of your neighbors is in heat lisa she smiled for the first time since id arrived shes always in heat she even propositioned me once youre making me feel less special i said i suppose i should have warned you about her but she waved a hand at the broken window well she was the only one who saw anything she said there was a red car parked outside her house for a while but the lighting isnt so good there she could be mistaken rebecca threw the last of the glass in her trash can and put the brush and pan in a closet she then called a glazier who promised to be out to her first thing in the morning i helped her to tape some plastic over the damaged pane and when all of that was done she made a pot of coffee and poured each of us a cup we both stayed standing while we drank i dont trust the police to do anything about this she said can i ask why they havent been able to do anything about him so far why should this time be any different this time he busted through a window thats criminal damage its escalating theres blood and the blood could be useful to the cops how so they can use it to identify him if he kills me by then it may be a little late for me this man isnt scared of the police i was thinking about what you told me when we first met about how this man might have to be forced to leave me alone i want you to do that i dont care how much it costs i have some money i can afford to pay you to do it and whomever else you want to hire to help you look at what he did here hes not going to go away not unless someone makes him im afraid for myself and im afraid for jenna jenna seems like a very selfpossessed girl i said hoping to distract her from the subject until she had calmed down what do you mean i mean that she didnt seem particularly frightened or shaken by what happened rebecca frowned i guess shes always been that way ill talk to her later though i dont want her bottling something up just because she doesnt want to upset me can i ask where her father is her fathers dead im sorry to hear that its okay he never had much to do with her anyway and we werent married but i meant what i said i want this man stopped whatever it takes i didnt reply she was angry and frightened her hands were still shaking from the shock of the incident there would be time to talk in the morning i told her that id stay if it made her feel better she thanked me and made up the sofa bed in her living room do you carry a gun she asked as she prepared to head up the stairs to her bedroom yes good if he comes back use it to kill him thatll cost extra she looked at me and for a moment i could tell that she was wondering if i was serious worryingly i thought that she might even have been willing to pay the glazier arrived shortly after seven to replace the broken pane he took a look at the sleeper couch the busted window and me and clearly decided that he was entering the aftermath of a domestic dispute it happens he whispered to me conspiratorially they throw stuff but they dont mean it to hit you not really still always pays to duck i thanked him it was probably good advice in any case he nodded pleasantly to rebecca and went about his work when he was done i followed rebeccas hyundai as she drove jenna to school then kept behind her all the way to her office she worked a stones throw from where she lived at willard square just by the junction of pillsbury and preble she had told me that she planned to be in the office until lunchtime then had properties to visit in the afternoon i watched her go inside i had tried to keep a discreet distance from her while she drove i hadnt yet seen any sign of the man who was following her but i didnt want him to spot me with her not yet i wanted him to try to get close to her again so that this time i could be waiting if he was good though hed pick me out easily and i had already resigned myself to the fact that i would need to bring in more bodies if this thing was to be done right while rebecca worked in her office i drove back to scarborough walked and fed walter then showered and changed my clothes i switched cars substituting the mustang for a green saturn coupe bought coffee and a danish in foleys bakery on route and headed back to willard willie brews auto shop in queens had sourced the coupe for me and sold it on for what seemed like less than it must have cost to buy the tires it was useful as a backup at times like this but driving it made me feel like a rube somebody die in it i had asked willie when he had first presented it to me as a possible second car willie had made a show of sniffing the interior i think its damp he had answered probably maybe anyway at what im asking for it the corpse could be stuck to the seat and it would still be a bargain he was right but it remained kind of embarrassing to drive then again it was hard to be inconspicuous in a mustang boss even the dumbest criminal is likely to look in his rearview at some point and think i wonder is that the same mustang with gofaster stripes that was behind me earlier hey maybe im being followed i checked in with rebecca by phone then took a walk around willard to clear my head a little more and to pass some time sleeping on a couch with a cold wind whistling through a broken window wasnt conducive to a good nights sleep even after my shower i still felt out of sync people across the water in portland tended to look down some on south portland it had been a city for only a hundred years or so which made it a baby by maine standards the building of the million dollar bridge the construction of interstate and the opening of the maine mall had taken away some of its charm by forcing local businesses to close but it still had a character all its own the area in which rebecca clay lived used to be called point village but that was way back in the s and by the time south portland became a separate entity from cape elizabeth in it had become known simply as willard it was home to ships captains and fishermen descendants of whom still lived in the area to this day during the last century a man named daniel cobb used to own a lot of the land around here he grew tobacco and apples and celery it was also said that he was the first person to grow iceberg lettuce in the east i walked down willard street to the beach the tide was out and the sand changed color dramatically from white to dark brown where the seas advance had halted to the left the beach stretched in a halfmoon ending at the spring point ledge light which marked the dangerous ledge on the west side of the main shipping channel into portland harbor beyond lay cushing island and peaks island and the ruststreaked façade of fort gorges to the right a set of concrete steps led up to a pathway along the promontory that ended in a small park a trolley line used to run down willard street to the beach in summer even after the trolley stopped running an old refreshment stand remained near what used to be the end of the line it dated back to the s and it was still selling food as late as the s when it was called the dory and the carmody family passed out hot dogs and fries through its window to the beachgoers my grandfather sometimes brought me there as a child and he told me that the stand had once been part of the empire of sam silverman who was kind of a legend in his time it was said that he kept a monkey and a bear in a cage in order to attract people to his businesses including the willard beach bath house and sams lunch the carmodys hot dogs had been pretty good but they couldnt really match up to a bear in a cage after we had spent a little time on the beach my grandfather would always take me over to mr and mrs bs store the bathras market on preble street where he would order some italian sandwiches to bring home for supper and mr b would carefully record the sale on my grandfathers tab the bathras family had the most famous tab in south portland so that it seemed like every customer settled bills there on a weekly or biweekly basis with cash rarely changing hands for small items i wondered if it was nostalgia that caused me to reflect warmly on something as simple as a grocery store or an old refreshment stand that was part of it i supposed my grandfather had shared these places with me but now both he and they were gone and i would not have the opportunity to share them with another still there were other places and other people jennifer my first child had never been given the chance to see them not really she was too young when she and her mother came up here with me and before she was old enough to appreciate what she was encountering she was dead but there was still sam her life was just beginning if i could keep her safe from harm then in time she might be able to join me on a stretch of sand or on a quiet street along which trolleys used to rumble or by a river or on a mountain path i could pass on some of these secrets to her and she could hold them to herself and know that the past and the present were speckled with brightness and that there was light as well as shade in the honeycomb world i turned back toward willard haven road following the slatted path across the sand then stopped halfway up willard street a red car sat idling by the curb the windshield was almost reflective so that when i looked at it i saw only the sky as i began to approach the driver put it into reverse backing slowly up willard keeping the distance between us constant then found space to turn and headed for preble the car was a ford contour probably a midnineties model i didnt get the number of the plate i couldnt even be sure that inside was the man who was stalking rebecca clay but i had a feeling it was he i guessed that it had been too much to hope that he might not have connected me to her yet but it wasnt a disaster my presence might be enough to rattle his cage it wouldnt frighten him off but it might make him try to frighten me off instead i wanted to meet him facetoface i wanted to hear what he had to say until then i couldnt begin to solve rebecca clays problem i walked back up willard street to where my car was parked if the guy had made me then at least i wouldnt have to drive the saturn any longer so that was some cause for celebration i called rebecca and told her that i thought the man who was bothering her might be nearby i gave her the color and the make of the car and told her not to leave the office even for a short time if her plans changed suddenly she was to call me and i would come and get her she informed me that she planned to eat lunch at her desk and she had called jennas principal and asked that jenna be allowed to wait with his secretary until she came to pick her up the fact that rebecca was staying at her office for a while gave me an hour or so to play around with while she had told me a little about her father i wanted to find out more and i thought i knew someone who might be able to help i headed into portland and parked across from the public market i picked up two coffees and some scones from the big sky bakery on the grounds that it always paid to arrive somewhere with a bribe in hand and headed over to the maine college of art on congress june fitzpatrick owned a pair of galleries in portland and a black dog that took a dim view of anyone who wasnt june i found june in her gallery space in the college setting up an exhibition of new work against its pristine white walls she was a small enthusiastic woman with a voice that had lost only a little of its english accent during her years in maine and a good memory for faces and names in the art world her dog barked at me from a corner then contented itself with keeping a close eye on me in case i decided to snatch a canvas daniel clay she said as she sipped her coffee i remember him although ive only ever seen a couple of examples of his work he fell into the category of the gifted amateur it was all verytortured initially i suppose youd say intermingled bodies pale with eruptions of reds and blacks and blues and all sorts of catholic iconography going on in the background then he stopped doing those and moved on to landscapes misty trees ruins in the foreground that kind of thing rebecca had shown me some slides of her fathers work earlier that day along with the single canvas she had retained it was a painting of rebecca as a child although it was a little dark for my liking the child a pale blur amid gathering shadows i confessed to june that i hadnt been very impressed with the rest of his work either theyre not to my taste it must be said i always thought his later work was one step above paintings of moose and yachts but then it wasnt really an issue he sold privately and didnt exhibit so i never had to find a polite way of saying no there are one or two people in portland who were quite serious collectors of his work though and i know he gave away some of his paintings to friends his daughter occasionally sells some of those that are still in her possession and a couple of potential buyers usually come out of the woodwork i think most of those who collect him probably knew him personally or are attracted by the mystery surrounding him for want of a better term i heard that he stopped painting entirely sometime before he went missing so i suppose they have a certain rarity value you remember anything about his disappearance oh there were rumors there wasnt much in the newspapers about the circumstancesthe local press tends to be circumspect about such things at the best of timesbut most of us knew that some of the children hed been trying to help were subsequently abused again there were people who wanted to blame him i suppose even among those who were prepared to believe that he wasnt directly involved you have an opinion on it there can be only two views either he was involved or he wasnt if he was then theres nothing more to say if he wasnt well im no expert but it cant have been easy getting some of those kids to talk about what happened to them to begin with perhaps the additional abuse just pushed them further and further into their shells i really cant say did you ever meet clay here and there i tried to speak with him at a dinner we both attended but he didnt say very much he was quiet and distant very softspoken he appeared overburdened by life that would have been very shortly before his disappearance so in this case appearances may not have been deceptive she broke off to give instructions to a young woman who was hanging up a canvas by the window no no thats upside down i looked at the canvas which appeared to be a painting of mud and not pretty mud either the young woman looked at the canvas the young woman then looked at me how can you tell i said and heard my words echoed the young woman and i had both spoken at precisely the same moment she smiled at me and i smiled back i then did a rough calculation of the difference in our ages and decided that i should limit myself to smiling at people who were born before philistines said june whats it supposed to be i asked her its an untitled abstract does that mean the artist doesnt know what it is either possibly june conceded back to daniel clay you said that the people who collected his work probably knew him any idea who some of those people might be she walked over to the corner and absentmindedly scratched her dog behind the ear the dog barked at me again just to disabuse me of any notions i might have had about joining in joel harmon is one the banker yes do you know him i know of him i said joel harmon was the retired president of ibp the investment bank of portland he was one of those credited with rejuvenating the old port during the eighties and his picture still appeared in newspapers whenever the city threw a celebration of something or other usually with his wife on one arm and a crowd of slavering admirers surrounding them all aroused by the lingering smell of fresh dollar bills his popularity could fairly be ascribed to his wealth his power and the attraction those two elements generally arouse in those with significantly less of either it was whispered that he had an eye for the ladies even though his looks came pretty far down on the list of his attributes probably somewhere between can carry a tune and cooks spaghetti id seen him around but wed never been introduced he and daniel clay were friends i believe they might have met at college i know that joel bought a couple of clays paintings after he died and was given others as gifts during his lifetime i suppose he passed clays test of suitability clay was very particular about those to whom he sold or gave his work i cant imagine why you really didnt like his paintings did you or him i guess he made me uneasy there was something peculiarly joyless about him joel harmon is having a dinner party in his house later this week by the way theyre a pretty regular occurrence and i have a standing invitation anytime i wish to attend ive put some interesting artists his way hes a good customer are you asking me to be your date no im offering to be yours im flattered you should be perhaps youll get to see some of clays paintings just try not to offend joel too grievously theres a dear i have bills to pay i assured june that i would be on my best behavior she didnt look impressed chapter iv i drove back to scarborough and dumped the saturn instantly feeling ten years younger in the mustang or at least ten years less mature which wasnt the same thing at all i called rebecca clay to confirm that she was still planning to leave at the agreed time then asked her to get someone to walk her to her car she was due to look at a vacant storefront on longfellow square so i waited for her in the parking lot behind joes smoke shop there were fifteen or sixteen cars parked there none of them occupied i found a space that allowed me a view of congress and the square bought a grilled chicken sandwich with green peppers at joes sandwich counter then ate in the car while i waited for rebecca clay to arrive a couple of homeless guys with shopping carts stood smoking in the alley beside the lot neither of them matched the description of the man who was following rebecca she called me when she was passing the bus depot at st john and i told her to park in front of the building she was visiting the woman who was trying to rent the firstfloor space was waiting outside for her when she arrived the two of them entered together and the door closed safely behind them the windows were large and clean and i could see both of them clearly from where i sat i didnt notice the squat man until he went through an odd routine while lighting a cigarette he seemed to have appeared from out of nowhere to take up a spot on one of the metal crash barriers outside the lot he was holding a cigarette vertically between the thumb and forefinger of his right hand and rotating it gently probably to get a smoother draw and his attention was entirely fixed on the women across the street still there was something sensual about the motion of his fingers a product perhaps of the way he was staring so intently at rebecca clay through the window of the store after a time he slid the cigarette slowly into his mouth wetting it against his lips for a moment before applying a match to the tip then instead of simply throwing the match away or blowing it out he held it between the same thumb and forefinger as before and allowed the flame to burn down toward the tips of his fingers i waited for him to discard it as the pain increased but he did not when the end of the match was no longer visible he released his grip upon it and allowed it to fall into the palm of his hand where it burned into blackness against his skin he turned his hand allowing the charred wood to fall upon the ground i clicked off a picture of him on the little digital camera that i kept in the car as i did so he looked around seemingly aware now that the attention of another was fixed upon him in turn i slid down farther in my seat but i had caught a glimpse of his face and had seen the three parallel scars on his forehead of which rebecca had spoken when i looked back he appeared to be gone but i sensed that he had merely retreated into the shade offered by joes building for i saw a wisp of smoke carried out upon the street by a stray breeze rebecca emerged from the store carrying some papers the other woman was beside her talking and smiling i called rebecca on her cell and told her to keep smiling as she listened turn your back to joes smoke shop i said i didnt want the watcher to see her reaction when i told her that i had spotted him your fan is over at joes dont look in that direction i want you to cross the street and go into cunningham books just act casual like you have some time to kill stay there until i come and get you okay okay she said she sounded only a little frightened to her credit she did not pause or even betray any emotion by a change of expression she shook hands with her client glanced left then right and proceeded to cross casually to the bookstore she walked straight inside as though that had been her intention all along i got out of my car and headed quickly to the front of joes there was nobody outside only the butt of a cigarette and the fragmented remains of a match indicated that the squat man had ever been there the tip had been squeezed flat something told me that it might well have been glowing redly when the fingers were applied to it i could almost smell the scorching of skin i looked around and saw him he had crossed congress and was walking toward the center of town he turned right onto park and i lost sight of him i figured that his car was probably there and he would wait for rebecca to leave the bookstore before either following her or approaching her again i walked to the corner of park and risked a glance down the street the squat man was at the door of the red ford his head down i stayed low and used the parked cars to approach him from the opposite side of the street i had my in a holster at my beltit was a little more discreet than my big smith for work like thisbut i was reluctant to show it if i was forced to confront the watcher with a gun in my hand then whatever chance i had of reasoning with him would evaporate and the situation would deteriorate before i had even begun to understand its nature i had an image of this man burning himself and the apparent ease with which he had done it it suggested an individual who had a considerable tolerance for pain and such tolerance was usually hardearned a facetoface with him would have to be delicately handled a grand cherokee turned down park an archetypal soccer mom at the wheel and as it passed i slipped behind it and approached the ford from the drivers side i could make out the outline of his quiff and the folds of muscle at the back of his neck as he sat at the wheel fumes already emerging from the exhaust his hands rested on the steering wheel the fingers of the left tapping a rhythm upon the plastic the right hand was roughly bandaged bloodstains showed through the fabric at last i let him see me approach i kept my arms out and my fingers splayed slightly but i was ready to scuttle for cover if his hands left the wheel the problem for me was that once i got close enough to talk to him there would be nowhere for me to run i was relying on the fact that there were people around and the hope that he would see no percentage in reacting with hostility until he heard what i had to say how you doing i said he peered lazily at me as though it were all that he could do just to rouse himself enough to respond he had another cigarette between his lips and a blue pack of american spirit rested on top of the dashboard in front of him fine he said just fine he raised his right hand to his mouth drawing on the cigarette so that the tip glowed brightly he looked away from me and stared through the windshield thought someone was paying me mind he said i see you got a gun the bulge of the was barely visible beneath my jacket unless someone knew what he was looking for cant be too careful i said you dont need to worry about me i dont carry a gun i got no call for one i guess youre just a gentle soul nah i cant claim that the woman hire you shes concerned she has no cause to be if she tells me what i want to know ill be on my way and if she doesnt or if she cant well thats two different things aint it one cant be helped and one can his fingers shifted from the wheel instantly i was reaching for the gun at my waist whoa whoa he said he held his hands up in mock surrender i done told you i got no gun i kept my hand close to the butt of the pistol id still prefer it if your hands stayed where i can see them he shrugged exaggeratedly then allowed his palms to rest against the top of the wheel do you have a name i asked i have lots of names thats very mysterious of you try one and see how it fits he seemed to give the issue some thought merrick he said at last and something in his face and his voice told me that this was as much as i was likely to get from him where names were concerned why are you bothering rebecca clay i aint bothering her i just want her to be straight with me about what about her father her fathers dead he aint dead she got him declared dead but that dont mean nothing you show me the worms crawling in the sockets of his eyes then ill believe hes dead why are you so interested in him i got my reasons try sharing them his fingers tightened on the wheel there was a small indiaink tattoo on the knuckle of his left middle finger it was a crude blue cross a jailhouse tattoo i dont think so i dont like strangers questioning me about my business well then youll know just how ms clay feels his teeth worried at the inside of his lower lip he kept his gaze fixed straight ahead i could feel the tension building up inside him i had allowed my hand to drift to the butt of my gun and my own forefinger was now extended above the trigger guard ready to slip into place if necessary then the tightness released itself from merrick s body i heard him exhale and he seemed to grow smaller and less threatening you ask her about the project he said softly you see what she says what is the project he shook his head ask her then come back to me maybe yought to talk to her exhusband too while youre about it i didnt even know that rebecca clay had been married i was only aware that she hadnt married the father of her child some investigator i was why would i do that a husband and wife they share things secret things you talk to him and it could be youll spare me the trouble of talking to him myself ill be around you wont have to come looking for me because ill find you you got two days to make her tell me what she knows then i lose my patience with yall i gestured at his wounded hand it seems to me like you lost your patience once already he looked at the bandaged limb and stretched the fingers as if testing the pain in the wounds that was a mistake he said softly i didnt mean to strike out like that im being sorely tested by her but i dont mean to do her harm maybe he believed that was true but i didnt there was a rage inside merrick it pulsed redly animating his eyes and keeping every muscle and sinew in his body taut with barely suppressed emotion merrick might not mean to hurt a woman might not set out to do it but the blood on his hand said all that needed to be said about his capacity to control his impulses i lost my temper is all he continued i need her to tell me what she knows its important to me he drew on his cigarette again and since were getting all friendly here you didnt give me your name its parker what are you a private cop you want to see my license no a piece of paper wont tell me nothing that i dont already know i dont want trouble from you sir ive come here with business to conduct business of a personal nature maybe you can make that little lady see reason so i can conclude it and be on my way i hope so i surely do because if you cant then youre no good to either of us youll just be in my path and i might have to do something about that he still had not looked at me again his eyes were fixed on a small photograph that hung from the rearview mirror it was a picture of a girl with dark hair perhaps jenna clays age or a little older the image encased in plastic to protect it a cheap crucifix dangled beside it who is she i asked that doesnt concern you nicelooking kid how old is she he didnt reply but i had clearly struck a nerve this time though there was no anger just a kind of disengagement if you told me something of why youre here then maybe i could help you i persisted like i told you sir my business is personal then i guess weve nothing left to discuss i said but you need to stay away from my client the warning sounded hollow and unnecessary somehow the balance had shifted i wont trouble her no more least of all not until you talk to me again he reached down for the ignition key no longer intimidated by the gun if he had ever really been in the first place but heres two warnings for you in return the first is that when you start asking about the project youd best keep a keen eye in your head because the others are going to hear about it and they wont like it that people are looking into it they wont like it one little bit what others the engine sputtered into life youll find out soon enough he said and the second warning he raised his left hand and clenched it into a fist so that the tattoo stood out starkly against the white of his knuckle dont interfere you do and ill leave you for dead mark me now boy he pulled away from the curb the exhaust pumping thick blue smoke into the clear fall air before it was entirely engulfed by fumes i caught a glimpse of his license plate merrick now i thought well see what we can find out about you in the next two days i walked back to the bookstore rebecca clay was seated in a corner flicking through an old magazine did you find him she asked yes she flinched what happened we talked and he went away for now what does that mean for now i hired you to get rid of him to make him leave me alone permanently are you saying hes going to come back her voice was steadily rising but there was a tremor beneath it i walked her from the store ms clay i said i told you that a warning might not be enough this man has agreed to stay away from you until i make some inquiries i dont know enough about him to trust him entirely so id suggest that for the moment we continue to take every precaution i have people whom i can call so there will always be someone watching over you while i try to find out more about him if that will make you rest any easier fine i think ill send jenna away for a while though until this is all over thats a good idea does the name merrick mean anything to you ms clay we had reached her car no i dont believe so she said thats our friends name or thats what he told me he had a photograph of a little girl in his car it might have been his daughter i was wondering if she was one of your fathers patients assuming she shared his surname my father didnt discuss his patients with me i mean not by name if she was referred to him by the state then there might be a record of her somewhere i guess but youll have trouble getting anyone to confirm it it would be breach of confidentiality what about your fathers patient records my fathers files were placed with the court after his disappearance i remember that there was an attempt to get a court order authorizing some of his colleagues to examine them but it failed access can only be obtained through an in camera review and theyre rare the judges have been reluctant to grant them in order to protect the privacy of the patients it seemed time to broach the subject of her father and the accusations made against him this is a difficult question for me to ask ms clay i began she waited she knew what was coming but she wanted to hear me say it aloud do you believe that your father abused the children in his care no she said firmly my father didnt abuse any of those children do you think he enabled others to do so perhaps by feeding them information about the identities and whereabouts of vulnerable patients my father was devoted to his work when they stopped sending children to him for evaluation it was because it was felt that he was no longer sufficiently objective his inclination was to believe the children from the outset and that was what got him into trouble he knew what adults were capable of doing did your father have many close friends her brow furrowed a few there were some professional colleagues too although most didnt stay in touch after he disappeared they wanted to put as much distance as possible between my father and themselves i didnt blame them id like you to make a list business associates college buddies people from the old neighborhood anyone with whom he maintained regular contact ill do it as soon as i get home by the way you didnt tell me that you were once married she looked surprised how did you find out merrick told me jesus it didnt seem important to tell you it didnt last long i dont see him anymore whats his name jerry jerry legere and he isnt jennas father no where would i find him hes an electrician he works all over why do you want to talk to him im going to talk to a lot of people thats how these things work but thats not going to make this man this merrick go away her voice was rising again thats not why i hired you hes not going to go away ms clay not yet hes angry and that anger has something to do with your father i need to find out the connection between your father and merrick to do that im going to have to ask a lot of questions she folded her arms on the roof of her car and laid her forehead against them i dont want this to drag on she said her voice slightly muffled by her posture i want things to go back to the way they were do what you have to do talk to whomever but make it stop please i dont even know where my exhusband lives anymore but he used to do some work for a company called asecure and he probably still does they install security systems in businesses and homes a friend of jerrys raymon lang does a lot of the maintenance on the systems and he used to put business jerrys way youll probably find jerry through asecure merrick thinks that you and your exhusband might have spoken about your father sometime in the past well of course we did but jerry doesnt know anything about what happened to him i can tell you that for sure the only person jerry legere ever cared about was himself i think he believed that my father would turn up dead somewhere and he could start spending the money that would come to me was your father wealthy theres a good sixfigure sum still tied up in probate so yes i suppose you could say that he was comfortable then theres the house jerry wanted me to sell it but obviously i couldnt because it wasnt mine to sell in the end jerry just got tired of waiting and of me it was mutual though jerry wasnt exactly a great catch one last thing i said did you ever hear your father mention something about a project or the project no never have you any idea what that might mean none she raised her head and got into her car i stayed behind her all the way to her office then remained there until it was time for her to collect jenna the principal escorted the girl to the door of the school and rebecca spent a little while talking to him presumably to explain why jenna would not be in class for a while then i followed them both back to the house rebecca parked in the drive and kept the car doors locked while i checked every room i went back to the front door and indicated that everything was okay once she was inside i sat in the kitchen and watched while she put together a list of her fathers friends and colleagues it wasnt very long some she said were dead and others she could not remember i asked her to let me know if she thought of any additions and she assured me that she would i told her that i would deal with the issue of extra protection that evening and would call her with the details before she went to bed that night with that i left her i heard her turning the key in the lock behind me and a series of electronic beeps as she entered the alarm code to secure the house already the daylight had departed the waves broke on the shore as i walked to my car usually i found it restful but not now there was an element missing something out of kilter and the lateafternoon air carried the scent of burning upon it i turned to the water for the smell was coming off the sea as though a distant ship were aflame i looked for its glow upon the horizon but there was only the rhythmic pulse of the lighthouse the movement of a ferry upon the bay and the lit rooms in the houses on the islands beyond everything spoke of calm and routine and yet i could not shake my sense of unease as i made my way home two shape without form shade without colour paralysed force gesture without motion those who have crossed with direct eyes to deaths other kingdom remember usif at allnot as lost violent souls but only as the hollow men t s eliot the hollow men chapter v merrick had promised us two days of peace but i wasnt prepared to gamble the safety of rebecca and her daughter on the word of a man like that i had seen his kind before merrick was a simmerer his temper always on the verge of boiling over i recalled the way he had reacted to my comment about the girl in the picture and the warnings about his personal business despite his assurances there was always the chance that he might go to a bar down a couple of drinks and decide now was the time to have another word with daniel clays daughter on the other hand i couldnt spend all my time watching her i needed to call in some help i had few options there was jackie garner who was big and strong and wellmeaning but also had a couple of screws loose in addition where jackie went two meat wagons on legs called the fulci brothers usually followed and the fulcis were to subtlety what an egg beater was to an egg i wasnt sure how rebecca clay would take it if she found them standing on her doorstep in fact i wasnt sure how the doorstep would take it either louis and angel would be preferable but they were over on the west coast for a couple of days wine tasting in the napa valley clearly i had sophisticated friends but i couldnt afford to leave rebecca clay unprotected until they returned it seemed that i had no other choice reluctantly i called jackie garner i met him at sangillos tavern a little place on hampshire that was always lit up like christmas inside he was drinking a bud light but i tried not to hold that against him i joined him at the bar and ordered a sugarfree sprite nobody laughed which was kind of them you on a diet asked jackie he was wearing a longsleeved tshirt that bore the logo of a portland bar that had closed down so long ago its patrons had probably paid for their drinks in wampum his hair was shaved close to his skull and there was a faded bruise beside his left eye his belly pressed tightly against the shirt so that a casual glance might have dismissed him as another fat guy at a bar but jackie garner wasnt that at all in all the time that id known him no one had ever knocked him down and i didnt like to think about what had happened to whoever had left that bruise on jackies face im not in the mood for beer i said he raised his bottle squinted at me and announced in a deep baritone this isnt beer this is bud he looked pleased with himself thats very catchy i said he smiled widely ive been entering competitions you know the ones where you think up a slogan like this isnt beer this is bud he picked up my sprite or this isnt soda this is sprite these arent nuts these are well these are nuts but you get the point i see a pattern emerging i figure its adaptable to any product except nuts in bowls pretty much dont see how it can fail you busy these days jackie shrugged as far as i could tell he was never busy he lived with his mother did a little bar work a couple of days a week and spent the rest of the time manufacturing homemade munitions in a tumbledown shack in the woods behind his house occasionally someone would report hearing an explosion to the local cops even less occasionally the cops would send a car along in the faint hope that jackie had blown himself up so far they had been sorely disappointed you need something done he asked his eyes gleamed with new light at the prospect of potential mayhem just for a couple of days theres a woman whos being bothered by a guy you want us to hurt him us whos us you know he gestured with his thumb at some indefinable place beyond the confines of the bar despite the cold i felt a prickle of sweat on my forehead and aged about one year in an instant theyre here what are you joined at the hip i told them to wait outside i know they make you nervous they dont make me nervous they scare the hell out of me well theyre not allowed in here no more anyway theyre not allowed anywhere i guess not since the uh the thing there was a thing where the fulcis were concerned there was always a thing what thing the thing over at the bline the bline was just about the roughest joint in the city a dive bar that offered a free drink to anyone who could produce a onemonth aa badge getting banned from the bline for causing trouble was like getting thrown out of the eagle scouts for being too good with knots what happened they hit a guy with a door by comparison with some of the stories i had heard about the fulcis and the bline that seemed comparatively minor you know that doesnt sound so bad for them well it was really a couple of guys and two doors and they took the doors off their hinges so they could hit the guys with them now they cant go out so much no more theyre kind of sore about it but they dont mind sitting in the lot here they think the lights are pretty and i bought them a couple of familystyle takeouts from norms i took a deep calming breath i dont want anybody hurt which means im not sure that i want the fulcis near this jackie scowled theyll be disappointed i told them i was meeting you and they asked to come along they like you how can you tell because they havent hit me with a door yet they dont mean no harm its just that the doctors keep changing their medication and sometimes it dont take like it should jackie spun his bottle sorrowfully he didnt have a lot of friends and it was clear that he felt society had misjudged the fulcis on a great many levels society by contrast was certain that it had the fulcis down pat and had taken all appropriate steps to ensure that contact with them was kept to a minimum i patted jackie on the arm well find something for them to do okay he brightened theyre good guys to have around when things get messy he said conveniently ignoring the fact that things tended to get messy precisely because they were around look jackie this guys name is merrick and hes been following my client for a week now hes been asking about her father but her father has been missing for a long time so long that hes been declared legally dead i cornered merrick yesterday and he said that hed ease off for a couple of days but im not inclined to trust him hes got a temper was he carrying i didnt see one but that doesnt mean anything jackie sipped his beer how come hes only showing up now he asked what if this guys been missing so long how come this other guy is only asking about him now i looked at jackie that was the thing about him something definitely rattled in his head when he walked but he wasnt dumb id considered the question of why merrick was now asking about daniel clay but not what might have prevented him from doing so before i thought again of that tattoo on his knuckle could merrick have been doing time since daniel clay disappeared maybe i can find that out while youre watching the woman her name is rebecca clay ill introduce you to her tonight and look keep the fulcis away from facetofaces with her but if you want to have them close by then thats okay with me in fact it might not be a bad idea to let them be seen keeping an eye on the house even a man like merrick was likely to be discouraged from approaching rebecca by the sight of three big men two of whom made the third look underfed i gave jackie a description of merrick and his car including the tag number dont bank on the car though he may ditch it now that its been connected with him century and a half a day said jackie ill look after tony and paulie out of it he finished his beer now you gotta come out and say hello theyll be offended if you dont and we wouldnt want that i said and i meant it too damn straight tony and paulie hadnt arrived in their monster truck which was why i hadnt spotted them when id parked instead they were sitting in the front of a dirty white van that jackie sometimes used for what he euphemistically termed his business as i approached the fulcis opened the van doors and climbed out i wasnt even sure how jackie had managed to get them in there to begin with it looked like the van had been assembled around them the fulcis werent tall but they were wide even doublewide the kind of places that they shopped for clothes opted for practical over fashionable so they were twin visions in polyester and leather blousons tony clasped my hand in one of his paws smearing it with barbecue sauce and i felt something pop paulie patted me softly on the back and i almost coughed up a lung were back in business fellas announced jackie proudly and for a brief moment before common sense prevailed i felt strangely happy i drove with jackie over to rebecca clays house she looked relieved to see me again i made the introductions and told rebecca that jackie would be looking after her for the next few days but that id also be around if anything came up i think jackie looked more like her idea of a bodyguard than i did so she didnt object in the interest of almost full disclosure i also told her that there would be two other men nearby in case of trouble and gave her a rough description of the fulcis that erred on the side of flattery without resorting to outright lies are three men really necessary she asked no but they come as a package theyll cost onefifty a day which is cheap but if youre worried about the cost we can work something out its okay i think i can afford it for a while good im going to try to find out more about merrick while we have breathing space and im going to talk to some of the people on your list if were no closer to figuring out merrick at the end of this twoday grace period and he still wont accept that you cant help him well go to the cops again and try to have him picked up before running the whole thing by a judge right now i know youd prefer a more physical approach but we need to exhaust the other possibilities first i understand i asked after her daughter and she told me that shed arranged for jenna to go to dc with her grandparents for a week her absence had been cleared with the school and jenna would leave first thing in the morning she walked me to the door and touched my arm do you know why i hired you she asked i used to date a guy called neil chambers he was jennas father neil chambers his father ellis had approached me earlier in the year seeking help for his son neil owed money to some men in kansas city and there was no way that he could pay the debt ellis wanted me to act as an intermediary to find some way to solve the problem i couldnt help him not then i had suggested some people i thought might be able to work something out but it was too late for neil his body was dumped in a ditch as a warning to others shortly after ellis and i had spoken im sorry i said dont be neil didnt see jenna much hadnt seen her in years to tell the truth but im still close to ellis he and his wife sara are the ones who are looking after jenna this week and he was the one who told me about you i turned him down i couldnt give him help when he asked for it he understood he didnt blame you he still doesnt neil was lost to him ellis knew that but he loved him when i told ellis about merrick he said that i should talk to you hes not the kind of man to bear a grudge she released her hold on my arm do you think theyll ever get the men who killed neil she asked man i said it was one man who was responsible his name was donnie p will anything ever be done about it something was done i said she stared at me silently for a time does ellis know she asked would it help him if he did no i dont think so like i told you hes not that kind of man her eyes shone and something uncurled itself deep inside her stretching sinuously its mouth soft and red but you are she said arent you we found the girl in a glorified kennel in independence east of kansas city and within sight and sound of a small airport our information had been good the girl didnt open the door when i knocked angel small and apparently unthreatening was beside me and louis tall dark and very very threatening was at the back of the house in case she tried to run we could hear someone moving inside i knocked again whos there the voice sounded cracked and strained mia i said theres nobody called mia here we want to help you i told you theres no mia here you have the wrong address hes coming for you mia you cant keep one step ahead of him forever i dont know what youre talking about donnie mia hes closing in and you know it who are you cops you ever hear of a guy named neil chambers no why would i have donnie killed him over a bad debt so he left him in a ditch he tortured him then he shot him hell do the same to you except in your case nobody is going to come knocking on doors to try to even things out later not that it will matter to you youll be dead if we can find you then he can find you too you dont have much time left there was no reply for so long that i thought she might have slipped away from the door then there was the sound of a security chain being removed and the door was unlocked we stepped into semidarkness all the drapes were closed and no lights burned in the room the door slammed shut behind us and the girl named mia retreated into the shadows so that we couldnt see her face the face that donnie p had beaten on for some offense that she had given him real or imagined can we sit down i asked you can sit if you like she said ill stay here does it hurt not so much but i look bad her voice cracked further who told you i was here it doesnt matter it does to me someone whos concerned for you thats all you need to know what do you want we want you to tell us why donnie did this to you we want you to share what you know about him what makes you think i know something because youre hiding from him and because the word is he wants to find you before you talk my eyes were growing accustomed to the gloom i could make out some of her features now they looked distorted her nose misshapen and her cheeks swollen a shard of light from beneath the door caught the edge of her bare feet and the hem of a long red dressing gown the varnish on her toenails was red too it looked freshly applied she removed a pack of cigarettes from a pocket of her gown tapped one out and lit it with a cigarette lighter she kept her head down her hair hanging over her face but i still caught a glimpse of the scars that ran across her chin and her left cheek i should have kept my mouth shut she said softly why he came around and threw two grand in my face after all that hed done to me a lousy two grand i was angry i told one of the other girls that i had a way of getting even with him i told her that id seen something i shouldnt have next i hear shes sharing donnies bed donnie was right i am just a dumb whore why didnt you go to the cops with what you know she drew on the cigarette her head was no longer lowered absorbed by the details of her story she had briefly forgotten to hide her face from us beside me i heard angel hiss in sympathy as he caught sight of her ruined features because they wouldnt have done anything about it you dont know that oh but i do she said she took another drag on the cigarette and toyed with her hair nobody said anything eventually mia broke the silence so now you say youre going to help me thats right how look outside back window she put her hand to her face and stared at me for a moment then walked to the kitchen i heard a soft swishing sound as she parted the curtains when she returned her demeanor had changed louis had that effect on people especially if it seemed like he might be on their side who is he a friend he looks she tried to find the right word intimidating she said at last he is intimidating she tapped her foot on the floor is he going to kill donnie we were hoping to find another way of dealing with him we thought that you might be able to assist us we waited for her to make her decision there was a tv on in another room probably her bedroom it struck me that she might not be alone and that we should have checked the house first but it was too late now finally she reached into the pocket of her gown and withdrew her cell phone she tossed it across the room to me i caught it open the picture file she said the ones you want are five or six photos in i flicked through images of young women smiling together at a dinner table of a black dog in a yard and a baby in a high chair until i came to the pictures of donnie the first showed him standing in a car park with another man taller than he was and wearing a gray suit the second and third pictures were different shots of the same scene but this time the faces of the two men were a little clearer the photos had been taken from inside a car because the frame of a door and a wing mirror were visible in two of them who is the second man i asked i dont know she said i followed donnie because i thought he was cheating on me hell i knew he was cheating on me hes a dog i just wanted to find out who he was cheating with she smiled the effort seemed to cause her pain you see i thought i loved him how stupid is that she shook her head i could tell that she was crying and this is what you have on him this is why he wants to find you because you have pictures of him on your phone with a man whose name you dont know i dont know his name but i know where he works when donnie left him the guy was joined by two other people a woman and a man theyre in the next picture i flicked on and saw the trio they were all dressed for business i thought they looked like cops said mia they got in the car and drove away i stayed with them where did they go thirteen hundred summit and then i knew why donnie wanted mia found and why she couldnt go to the cops with what she had thirteen hundred summit was the fbis kansas city field office donnie p was an informer in a field off a deserted road in clay county where cars rarely traveled and only birds kept vigil donnie p the man who killed neil chambers over a meatandpotatoes debt now lay buried in a shallow grave it had taken one phone call to his bosses one phone call and a handful of blurred photographs sent from an untraceable email account it was revenge revenge for a boy i barely knew his father wasnt aware of what had happened and i would not tell him which raised the question of why i had done it it didnt matter to neil chambers and it wouldnt bring him back to his father i guess i did it because i needed to strike out at something at someone i chose donnie p and he died for it as rebecca clay said i was that kind of man that night i sat on my porch with walter asleep at my feet i wore a sweater under my jacket and drank coffee from a mustang travel cup that angel had given me as a birthday present the plumes of my breath mingled with the steam that rose from the coffee with each sip the sky was dark and there was no moon to guide the way through the marshes no light to turn its channels to silver the air was still but there was no peace to the stillness and once again i was aware of a faint smell of burning in the distance and then everything changed i couldnt say how or why but i sensed the sleeping life around me wake for an instant the natural world troubled by a new presence yet afraid to move for fear of attracting attention to itself birds beat their wings in a flurry of concern and rodents froze in the shadows cast by tree trunks walters eyes opened and his muzzle twitched warily his tail beat nervously upon the boards then abruptly ceased for even that slight disturbance in the night seemed too much i stood and walter whined i walked to the porch rail and felt a breeze arise from the east blowing in across the marshes troubling the trees and causing the grass to flatten slightly as it passed over the blades it should have brought with it the smell of sea but it did not instead there was only the scent of burning stronger now and then that faded to be replaced by a dry stench as of a hole in the ground that had recently been opened to reveal the hunched wretched thing lying dead in the earth i thought of dreams that i had had dreams of a great mass of souls following the shining pathways of the marshes to lose themselves at last in the sea like the molecules of river water drawn inexorably to the place where all things were born but now something had emerged traveling from not to moving away from that world and into this one the wind appeared to separate as though it had encountered some obstacle and been forced to seek alternative paths around it but it did not come together again its constituent parts flowed away in different directions then as suddenly as it had arisen it was gone and there was only that lingering odor to indicate that it had ever existed just for a moment i thought i caught sight of a presence among the trees to the east the figure of a man in an old tan coat the details of his features lost in the gloom his eyes and mouth dark patches against the pallor of his skin then just as quickly he was gone and i wondered if i had truly seen anything at all walter rose to his feet and walked to the porch door using his paw to ease it open before disappearing into the safety of the house i stayed waiting for the night creatures to settle once more i sipped at my coffee but now it tasted bitter i walked onto the lawn and emptied my cup on the grass above me the attic window at the top of the house moved slightly in its frame the rattle that it made causing me to turn around it could have been the house settling adjusting itself after the sudden breeze but as i looked up at the window the clouds briefly parted and moonlight at last shone upon the glass creating the impression of movement in the room beyond then the clouds came together again and the movement ceased a fraction after just a fraction i went back inside and took the flashlight from the kitchen i checked the batteries then climbed the stairs to the top of the house using a hook on the end of a pole i pulled down the steps leading to the attic the light from the hallway penetrated reluctantly into the space revealing the edges of forgotten things i climbed up this attic was used for storage nothing more there were still some of rachels things here packed away into a pair of old suitcases i kept meaning to send them on to her or to take them with me when next i visited her and sam but to do so would be to admit finally that she was not coming back i had left sams cot as it was in her room for the same reason another link to them that i did not wish to see disappear but there were other items here too belonging to those who preceded rachel and sam clothes and toys photographs and drawings even gold and diamond jewelry i had not kept much but what i did keep was here afraid i could almost hear the word spoken as though a childs voice had whispered softly in my ear fearful of being heard yet anxious to communicate something small scuttled through the darkness disturbed by the coming of the light they were not real that was what i told myself again a fragment of my sanity was jarred loose on the night that i found them the night that they were taken from me my mind was shaken up and was never the same again they were not real i created them i conjured them up out of grief and loss they were not real but i could not convince myself for i did not believe that it was true i knew that this was their place the refuge of the lost wife and the lost daughter whatever traces of them remained in this world clung tenaciously to the possessions stored amid the dirt and cobwebs the fragments and relics of lives now almost gone from this world the flashlight chased shadows across the wall and floor a thin layer of dust lay over everything on boxes and cases on old crates and old books my nose and throat itched and my eyes began to water afraid that patina of dust lay also on the glass of the window but it was not undisturbed the flashlight picked out lines upon it as i approached a pattern that formed itself into a message carefully drawn in what might have been a childs hand make them go away my fingers touched the glass tracing the curves and the uprights following the shapes of the letters there were tears in my eyes but i could not tell if it was the dust that brought them or the possibility that here in this room filled with regret and loss i had found some trace of a child long gone that her finger had made these letters and that by touching them i might in turn touch something of her please daddy i stood back the flashlights beam showed me the dirt upon my fingers and all of my doubts returned were the letters really there before i came written by another who lived in this dark place or had i given deeper meaning to random scratches upon the dirt perhaps left by rachel or me and in moving my finger upon them had somehow found a way to communicate something of which i was afraid to give form and identity to a previously nameless fear the rational side of me reasserted itself erecting barricades and providing explanations however unsatisfactory for all that had occurred for smells on the breeze for a pale figure at the edge of the forest for movement in the attic and words scratched in the dust now the flashlight picked out the message and i saw my face reflected in the glass hovering in the night as though i were the unreal element the lost being so that the words were written across my features so afraid they read hollow men chapter vi i slept badly that night my dreams punctuated by recurrent images of eyeless men who yet could somehow see and a faceless child curled up in ball in a darkened attic whispering only the single word afraid to herself over and over again i checked in with jackie garner first thing it had been a quiet night in willard and for that much i was grateful jenna had departed for dc with her grandparents shortly after seven and jackie had stayed with their car as far as portsmouth while the fulcis remained with rebecca there was no sign of merrick or of anyone else showing an unhealthy interest in the clay family i went for a run to prouts neck walter racing ahead of me in the still morning air this part of scarborough was still relatively rural the presence of the yacht club and the country club ensuring that the area retained a certain exclusivity but elsewhere the town was changing rapidly it had begun as far back as when walmart arrived near the maine mall bringing with it minor irritations like the rv owners who were allowed to park overnight on the stores lot soon other bigbox retailers followed walmarts lead and scarborough started to become like many other satellite towns on the edge of larger cities now residents at eight corners were selling out to allow walmart to expand further and despite a cap on residential building permits more and more families were moving into the area to take advantage of its schools and the towns recreational pursuits pushing property prices up and causing increases in taxes to pay for the infrastructure needed to support the new arrivals who were taking root at four times the county average in my darker moments i sometimes saw what was once a fifty foursquaremile town encompassing six distinct villages each with its own distinct local identity and the largest salt marsh in the state becoming a single homogenous sprawl populated almost entirely by those with no concept of its history and no respect for its past there were two messages on my answering machine when i returned one was from a guy in the dmv who charged me for every search he ran on vehicle plates according to him merricks car was a company vehicle recently registered to a law office down in lynn massachusetts i didnt recognize the name of the firm eldritch and associates i scribbled the details on a notepad merrick could have stolen a lawyers carand a call to the firm would quickly confirm whether or not a theft had occurredor he might have been employed by the attorney or attorneys which didnt seem very likely there was a third option that the firm had provided merrick with a car either out of choice or at the instigation of a client thereby offering at least some degree of protection if someone came around asking questions about what merrick was doing as the firm could offer client confidentiality as a defense unfortunately if that was the case the individual involved had underestimated merrick s capacity for causing trouble or just didnt care i thought again about merrick s sudden appearance so many years after daniel clay had vanished either some evidence had emerged recently to convince merrick that clay was still alive or merrick had been out of the loop for a long time and had just emerged to rattle a few cages increasingly i was drawn to the view that merrick might have been in jail but i didnt have his first name assuming merrick even was his real name if i had it i could run searches in correctionscom and bopgov in the hope of turning up a release date still i could make some calls and see if the name rang any bells and there was always eldritch and associates although in my experience lawyers tended to be unhelpful at best in these situations i wasnt even sure that merrick s pursuit of rebecca clay and the broken pane of glass would be enough to force some information out of them the second message was from june fitzpatrick confirming our dinner at joel harmons house the following night i had almost forgotten about harmon it might be a wasted evening then again i still knew next to nothing about daniel clay apart from what his daughter had told me and the little extra that i had found out from june i would drive down to the commonwealth early the next morning see what i could wring out of eldritch and associates and try to fit in a conversation with rebecca clays exhusband before harmons dinner i remained aware that a clock was ticking slowly counting down the minutes to merrick s promised return and what was certain to be an escalation of his campaign of intimidation against daniel clays daughter rebecca clay sat in her employers washroom and wiped away her tears she had just spoken to her daughter on the phone jenna had told her that she missed her already rebecca had told her that she missed her too but she knew that sending her away was the right thing to do the night before she had walked into jennas bedroom to make sure that she had packed everything that she needed for her trip jenna was downstairs reading from her daughters bedroom window rebecca could see the man named jackie sitting in his car probably listening to the radio judging by the slight glow that came from the dashboard illuminating his features his presence made her feel a little better she had also briefly met the other two men the massive brothers who gazed adoringly at jackie hanging on his every word although big they did not fill her with the same sense of assurance as jackie did they were intimidating though she had to give them that one of her neighbors had been so disturbed by their presence that she had called the police the cop who drove by in response had taken one look at the pair recognized them for who they were and immediately driven away without exchanging a single word with either of them nobody had seen a cop in the vicinity since all in jennas room was neat and in its place because that was the kind of girl her daughter was rebecca looked down at the little desk that jenna used for homework and for her painting and drawing she had clearly been working on something quite recently a sketch of some kind for a pack of colored pencils lay open beside a couple of sheets of paper rebecca picked up one of the sheets it was a drawing of their house and two figures stood beside it they were dressed in long tan coats and their faces were pale so pale that her daughter had used a white wax crayon to accentuate it as though the paper itself was not sufficient to convey the depth of their pallor their eyes and mouths were black circles draining light and air from the world the same figures appeared in each of the drawings they looked like shadows given form and the fact that her daughter was imagining such beings had made rebecca shudder perhaps jenna had been more disturbed by the actions of the man named merrick than she had pretended to be and this was some manifestation of that fear rebecca had gone downstairs to jenna and shown her the drawings who are they supposed to be honey she said but jenna had merely shrugged i dunno i mean are they supposed to be ghosts they look like ghosts jenna had shaken her head no i saw them you saw them how how could you have seen something like this she had knelt beside her daughter genuinely troubled by what she was hearing because theyre real jenna had replied she had looked puzzled for a moment then had corrected herself no i think theyre real its hard to explain you know its like when theres a little fog and it makes everything fuzzy but you cant see whats making it fuzzy then i took a nap this evening after packing and it was almost like i dreamed them but i was awake because i was drawing them at the same time that i saw them it was like i woke up with them still in my mind and i had to put their images down on paper and when i looked out of the window they were there except she had paused except what tell me jenna the girl had looked uncomfortable except i could only see them if i didnt look directly at them i know it makes no sense mom but they were both there and not there she took the drawing from her mother i think theyre kind of cool they were here jenna jenna had nodded they were outside what did you think i meant rebeccas hand went to her mouth she felt ill jenna rose and hugged her and kissed her on the cheek dont worry mom it was probably just some weird mind thing if it helps i didnt feel scared or anything they dont mean us any harm how do you know i just do i kind of heard them in my head while i was sleeping or waking or whatever it was i was doing they werent interested in us then for the first time jenna had looked thoughtful as though she had only just begun to understand how truly odd her words sounded rebecca tried to stop her voice from trembling when she spoke honey who are they the question distracted jenna she giggled thats the weirdest part of all i woke knowing who they were like sometimes ill have a painting and a title in my head both at the same time and i wont know where they came from i made this first drawing and i knew who those figures were almost before the pencil touched the paper she held the drawing up before her both admiring it and yet slightly concerned at what she had created theyre the hollow men chapter vii i had strawberries and coffee for breakfast there was a delgados cd universal audio in the stereo and i let it play while i ate walter fooled around in the garden relieved himself in the bushes then came back inside and fell asleep in his basket when i was done eating i spread the list of daniel clays former associates on the kitchen table and added eldritch to the bottom then i worked out a rough order in which to approach them all starting with those who were local yet farthest from town i began to make calls to arrange appointments but the first three were washouts the people in question had either moved or were dead or in the case of a third man a former professor of clays who had retired to bar harbor were suffering from such severe alzheimers that according to his daughterinlaw he no longer even recognized his own children i had better luck of a sort with the fourth name an accountant named edward haver he had died a decade earlier but his wife celine said that she wouldnt mind talking about clay even over the phone particularly when i explained that i had been hired by clays daughter she told me that she had always liked dan and had never found him to be anything other than good company she and her husband had attended his wifes funeral back when rebecca was only four or five his wife had died of cancer then twenty years later her own husband had succumbed to a form of the same illness and daniel clay had attended that funeral for a time she admitted she thought that there might have been a chance that they would get together for they had similar tastes and she liked rebecca but it seemed that clay had become used to living without a partner and then he vanished she concluded i was about to press her about the circumstances of his disappearance but in the end i didnt have to i know what people said about him but that wasnt dan not the dan that i knew she said he cared about the children he counseled maybe too much you could see it in his face when he spoke about them he talked about his cases with you he never mentioned names but sometimes hed tell me about what a child had been through beatings neglect and well you know other things too it was clear that it troubled him he couldnt bear to see a child hurt i think that brought him into conflict with people sometimes what kind of people other professionals doctors who didnt always see things the way that he did there was one man namedoh what was it again ive seen his name somewhere recentlychristian thats it dr robert christian over at the midlake center he and dan were always disagreeing about things in papers that they wrote or at conferences i guess it was a small field that they worked in so they were forever encountering each other and arguing over how best to deal with the children who came to them you seem to have a good memory for events that were sometime in the past mrs haver i tried not to make it sound like i was doubting her or that i was suspicious in any way although i felt a little of both i liked dan a lot and we shared parts of our life over the years i could almost see her smiling sadly he rarely got angry but i can still remember the look that used to come over his face when the subject of robert christian was raised they were competing in a way dan and dr christian were both involved in evaluating allegations of child abuse but each had a very different approach i think dan was a little less cautious than dr christian thats all he was inclined to believe the child from the start on the grounds that his priority was the protection of children from harm i admired that about him he had a crusading impulse and you dont see that kind of devotion much anymore dr christian didnt see his calling in the same way dan said robert christian was too skeptical that he confused objectivity with distrust then there was some trouble dan gave an evaluation that turned out to be wrong and a man died but i guess you probably know about all that already afterward i think dan was offered fewer evaluations or maybe they stopped altogether do you remember the name of the man who died i think it was a german name muller perhaps yes im almost sure that was the name i would imagine that the boy involved must be in his late teens by now i cant imagine what his life has been like knowing that his allegations led to his fathers death i wrote down the name muller and drew a line connecting it to dr robert christian then of course the rumors started she said the rumors of abuse thats right did he discuss them with you no we werent really seeing much of each other by that time after the death of mr muller daniel became less sociable dont get me wrong he was never what you might call a party animal but he would attend dinners and sometimes he would come over here for a coffee or a glass of wine that all stopped after the muller incident it did something to his confidence and i can only imagine that the allegations of abuse shattered it entirely you didnt believe them i saw how committed he was to his work i could never believe the things some people said about dan it sounds like a cliché but his problem was that he cared too much he wanted to protect them all but he couldnt in the end i thanked her and she told me to call her anytime before she hung up she gave me some names of people to whom i might talk but they were all on rebeccas list still she was helpful which was more than could be said for the next two people i called one was a lawyer named elwin stark who had acted for clay as well as being his friend i knew stark to see around town he was tall and unctuous and favored the kind of darkstriped suits beloved of oldstyle mobsters and upmarket antiques dealers it was true to say that he wasnt the pro bono kind when it came to legal matters and he seemed to apply the same principle to telephone conversations for which he wasnt being paid it was stark who had dealt with the paperwork surrounding the declaration of clays death hes gone stark told me after his secretary had left me hanging in the ether for a good fifteen minutes then advised me that stark wouldnt have time to see me in person but might just might have two minutes free during which he could squeeze in a brief talk on the phone theres nothing more to be said about it his daughter is having trouble with someone who disagrees he doesnt seem willing to accept that clay is dead well his daughter has a piece of paper that says otherwise what do you want me to tell you i knew daniel i went fishing with him a couple of times a year he was a good guy a bit intense maybe but that came with the territory did he ever speak about that territory with you nope im a business lawyer that kid shit depresses me do you still act for rebecca clay i did that one thing as a favor for her i didnt expect to be chased up by a pi for doing it so you can safely say that i wont be doing her any more favors look i know all about you parker even talking to you makes me uneasy no good can come from a lengthy conversation with you so im ending this one now and he did the next conversation with an md named philip caussure was even shorter caussure was clays former physician it seemed like clay had a lot of relationships that blended the personal with the professional i have nothing to say said caussure please dont bother me again then he hung up too it seemed like a sign i made one more call but this time it was to secure an appointment with dr robert christian the midlake center was a short drive from where i used to live just off the gorham road it stood in a treeshrouded lot and looked like any other anonymous office building it could have housed a lawyers office or a realtors instead it was a place for children who had suffered abuse or neglect or who had made such allegations or who were having those claims made on their behalf by others inside the main door was a waiting area painted in bright yellow and orange with books for children of various ages lying on tables and a play area in one corner trucks and dolls and packets of crayolas lying on its foam matting there was also a rack of information leaflets on the wall slightly higher than a child could reach containing contact details for the local sexual assault response team and various social services the secretary behind the desk took my name and made a call a minute or two later a small spry man with white hair and a neatly trimmed beard appeared at the door connecting the reception area to the clinic he was probably in his early fifties and dressed in chinos and an opencollared shirt his handshake was firm but he seemed a little cautious he led me to his office which was furnished in yellow pine and dominated by shelves of books and reports i thanked him for seeing me at such short notice and he shrugged curiosity he said its a long time since anyone has mentioned daniel clay to me at least outside this branch of the medical community he leaned forward in his chair just so were clear ill be straight with you if youre straight with me clay and i disagreed on certain matters i dont think he cared much for me i didnt care much for him professionally most people believed that his heart was in the right place for what its worth at least until the rumors began circulating but that element needed to be balanced by objectivity which i dont think daniel clay had in sufficient quantities for his opinions to be taken seriously i heard that youd clashed i said thats why im here his daughter hired me someone has been asking about her father shes worried so now youre going back over the trail trying to find out why someone should be concerned about him so many years after his disappearance something like that am i under suspicion he smiled should you be there were certainly times when i would cheerfully have strangled him he had a way of getting under my skin both personally and professionally would you care to explain well i guess to understand him and what happened prior to his disappearance you need to know something about what we do here we perform medical examinations and psychological evaluations in cases where there are allegations of abuse of children whether that abuse is physical or sexual emotional or the result of neglect a call comes through to central intake in augusta its referred to a supervisor screened then a decision is made on whether or not to send out a social worker sometimes that call may have originated with local law enforcement or child protection services it may have come from a school a parent a neighbor even from the child in question the child is then referred to us for evaluation were the main provider for this service in the state when daniel clay first started performing evaluations we were still finding our feet a little hell everyone was now things are a little better organized we can do everything in this one building examination evaluation initial counseling interviewing of the child and the alleged perpetrator it can all be handled here and before the center opened the child might have been examined by a doctor then sent elsewhere for an interview and evaluation which is where clay came in yes but again i dont think daniel clay was careful enough its a delicate business what we do and there are no easy answers everyone wants a definite yes or nothe prosecutors the judges obviously the people directly involved like the parents or guardiansand theyre disappointed when we cant always give it im not sure that i understand i said isnt that why youre here christian sat forward in his chair and opened his hands they were very clean the nails cut so short that i could see the soft pale flesh at the fingertips look we deal with eight to nine hundred children every year in terms of sexual abuse maybe five percent of those children will have positive physical findings say small tears in the hymen or rectum many of those kids will be teenagers and even if there are indications of sexual activity it can be hard to tell if it was consensual or not a lot of adolescent females can even be penetrated and still have a normal exam that reveals an unbroken hymen if we do establish nonconsensual sex then we often cant tell who did it or when all we can say is that sexual contact did occur even in a very young child there may be little or no evidence especially taking into account the normal anatomical variations that may occur in childrens bodies physical findings that used to be considered abnormal have now come to be regarded as nonspecific the only surefire way to establish sexual abuse is to test for stds but that assumes that the perpetrator was infected if the test is positive then abuse is a done deal but even then youre no closer to establishing who did it not unless you have dna marking if the perpetrator wasnt infected with an std then you have nothing but what about the childs behavior wouldnt that change after abuse the effects vary and there are no specific behavioral indicators to suggest abuse we may see anxiety difficulty sleeping sometimes night terrors where the child wakes up screaming inconsolable yet will have no memory of the event in the morning there may be nail biting the pulling out of hair refusal to go to school an insistence on sleeping with a trusted parent boys will tend to act out becoming more aggressive while girls will tend to act in becoming withdrawn and depressed but those types of behavior may also occur if say the parents are going through a divorce and the child is becoming stressed by themselves they dont offer proof one way or the other of abuse at least a third of abused children will have no symptoms whatsoever i took off my jacket then continued making notes christian smiled more complicated than you thought isnt it a little thats why the evaluation process and the interview technique employed for it are so important the professional cant lead the child which is what i believe clay did in a number of cases like the muller case christian nodded the muller case should be offered as a textbook example of all the things that can go wrong during the investigation of alleged child abuse a child being manipulated by a parent a professional who sets aside his objectivity as part of some misguided crusading impulse a judge who prefers blackandwhite to shades of gray there are those who believe that the vast majority of sexual abuse allegations that arise during custody disputes in divorce cases are fabricated theres even a term for the childs behavior in such disputes parental alienation syndrome where a child identifies with one parent and in so doing alienates the other the negative behavior toward the alienated parent is a reflection of the alienating parents own feelings and perceptions not the childs its a theory and not everyone accepts it but looking back at the muller case it should have been clear to clay that the mother was hostile and had he asked more questions about her own medical background he would have discovered that there were indications of personality disorder instead he sided with her and appeared to accept the childs version of events unquestioningly the whole affair was a disaster for everyone concerned and damaged the standing of those who work in the field worst of all though a man lost not only his family but his life christian realized how tense he had become he stretched and said sorry i got us kind of sidetracked there not at all i said i asked you about the mullers you were talking about interview techniques well its pretty simple in one way you cant ask questions like has something bad happened to you or did x touch you somewhere special or somewhere private thats particularly the case when youre dealing with very young children they may try to please the evaluator with the right answer just so they can leave we also have instances of whats called source misattribution where a kid may have heard something and applied it to himself perhaps as a way of seeking attention sometimes you may get a good disclosure from a younger child initially but find that the child then recants under pressure from say family members it happens also with teenagers where mom has a new boyfriend who starts abusing the daughter but mom doesnt want to believe it because she doesnt want to lose the guy whos supporting her and would rather blame the child for telling lies teenagers in general bring with them their own challenges they may lie about abuse for gain but generally theyre pretty resistant to suggestion the problem with them is that if they have been abused it can take a couple of sessions just to get the details from them they wont want to talk about it maybe out of guilt or shame and the very last thing theyll want to discuss with a stranger is oral or anal abuse so the evaluation has to be conducted with all of these elements borne in mind my position is that i dont believe anybody i only believe the data thats what i present to the police to the prosecutors and to the judges if the case gets to court and you know what they get frustrated with me like i said they want definite answers but a lot of the time we cant give them those answers thats where daniel clay and i differed there are some evaluators out there who have almost a political position on abuse they believe that its rampant and they interview children with the presumption that abuse has occurred it colors everything that follows clay became the goto guy to confirm abuse allegations whether in the first instance or where a lawyer decided to seek a second opinion on abuse that was what got him into trouble okay can we go back to the muller case for a moment sure erik muller its a matter of record the papers reported a lot of the details at the time it was a nasty divorce case and the wife wanted custody it seems like she may have pressured her son who was then twelve into making allegations against his father the father denied the allegations but clay offered a pretty damning evaluation there still wasnt enough evidence for the da to indict so it went to family court where the burden of proof is lower than at criminal level the father lost custody and killed himself a month later then the child recanted to a priest and it all came out clay went before the board of licensure it took no action against him but the whole thing looked bad and he ceased to do case evaluations shortly afterward was that his decision or was it forced upon him both he decided not to conduct evaluations again but he would not have been offered them even had he decided to continue by that time we had been up and running for some time so the burden of evaluation in most cases fell on us well i say burden but it was one that we were willing to accept were as committed to child welfare as daniel clay ever was but we never lose sight of our responsibilities to all of those involved and most of all to the truth do you know where the muller boy is now dead how he became an addict and died of a heroin overdose that was um about four years ago up in fort kent i dont know what happened to the mother last i heard she was living somewhere in oregon she married again and i think she has another child now i hope she does better with this one than the last it sounded like the muller angle wasnt going to lead anywhere i moved on to the subject of the abuse of some of clays patients christian seemed to have the details at his fingertips maybe he had gone over them before i arrived or it could simply have been one of those cases that nobody was very likely to forget two cases of alleged abuse were referred to us in the space of three months said christian each with similar elements alleged stranger abuse or abuse by someone apparently unknown to the child and the use of masks masks bird masks the abusersthree in one case four in the otherdisguised their faces with bird masks the kidsthe first a twelveyearold girl the second a fourteenyearold boywere abducted one on the way home from school the other while drinking beer by a disused railroad track then taken to an unknown location systematically abused over a period of hours then dumped close to where theyd been abducted the alleged abuse had occurred some years back one in the mideighties and another at the start of the nineties the first case emerged after a suicide attempt by the girl shortly before she was due to be married at the tender age of eighteen the second came about when the boy went before the courts on a whole range of misdemeanor offenses and the lawyer decided to use the alleged abuse as mitigation the judge wasnt inclined to believe him but when the two cases came to us the similarities were impossible to ignore these kids didnt know each other and came from towns a hundred miles apart yet the details of their stories matched perfectly even down to details of the masks used you know what else they had in common both children had been treated by daniel clay in the past the girl had made allegations of abuse against a teacher that turned out to be untrue motivated by a belief that the teacher was secretly attracted to one of her friends it was one of the rare instances where clays evaluation did not find reason to support the allegations the boy was sent to clay after hed engaged in inappropriate sexual contact with a tenyearold girl in his class clays evaluation suggested possible indicators of abuse in the boys past but went no further since then weve uncovered six more cases with the bird element to them three of those involved were former patients of daniel clay but none of the cases took place after his disappearance in other words there have been no new reports of similar incidents since late that doesnt mean that they havent occurred but we havent heard about them most of the children involved were also um slightly troublesome in certain ways which is why the allegations took so long to emerge troublesome their behavior was antisocial some had made allegations of abuse before which may or may not have been true others had engaged in criminal activity or had simply been allowed to run wild by parents or foster parents taken together it might have made authority figures less willing to believe them even if they had made an effort to talk about what had taken place and police especially male cops tend to be reluctant to believe allegations of abuse from teenage girls in particular anyway it also made the children in question vulnerable since nobody was inclined to look out for them then before anyone could ask clay about all of this in detail he disappeared well most of the cases emerged subsequent to his disappearance but thats about right said christian the problem for us is that weve had to wait for indications of similar abuse to come to us instead of being able to seek out the children for ourselves there are issues of patient confidentiality sealed records even the natural dispersal of families and children that occurs over time any child who had undergone abuse similar to what ive outlined to you would be in his or her late teens at least by now given that the victims of whom were aware were aged between nine and fifteen at the time when the abuse is alleged to have occurred to put it simply we cant really place an advertisement in the newspapers asking people who may have been abused by men in bird masks to come forward it just doesnt work that way any suggestion that clay could have been one of the abusers christian let out a long breath thats the big question isnt it there were certainly rumors but did you ever meet daniel clay no he was a tall man very tall sixsix at least very thin all in all he was quite distinctivelooking when we went back over those cases none of the children involved described any of their alleged abusers in terms that could be applied to daniel clay so it could be a coincidence that some of these kids were his patients its certainly possible he was well known for dealing with children who claimed to have been abused if someone was sufficiently committed then its possible that children could have been targeted because they were his patients perhaps someone among the various professions involved with the children along the way might also have leaked details whether deliberately or accidentally although our own inquiries have proved negative on that front its all supposition though do you have any idea where these children are now some of them i cant give you any details im sorry i could perhaps show you details of their allegations with their identities removed but it wont tell you much more than you already know id appreciate it if you would he led me back to the reception area then returned to his office twenty minutes later he returned with a handful of printed pages this is all that i can give you im afraid i thanked him for the papers and for his time he told me to contact him if i needed anything more and gave me his home number do you think daniel clay is dead dr christian i asked if he was involvedand im not saying that he wasthen he would not have wanted to face ruin disgrace and imprisonment we may have disagreed on most things but he was a proud cultured man under the circumstances he might have taken his own life if he wasnt involved in some way well why did he run perhaps the two events the revelations of possible abuse and clays disappearance were entirely unconnected and we are besmirching an innocent mans reputation i simply dont know it is strange though that no trace of daniel clay has ever been found i work with the available data and nothing more but from the data i have before me id have to say that clay is dead the question then is did he take his own life or did someone deprive him of it i left the midlake center and drove home at my kitchen table i read the sections of the case reports that christian had given to me as he had promised they added little to what he had told me except to make me despair if i ever needed reminding at what adults were capable of doing to children the details of the abusers bodies were vague especially given that in a number of cases the children had been blindfolded throughout the abuse or had been so traumatized by it that they were unable to recall anything about the men themselves but christian was right none of the available descriptions matched the physical appearance of daniel clay when i was done i took walter for a walk he had matured a lot in the last year even for a young dog he was quieter and less skittish although he was still but a shadow of his ancestors the big hunting dogs owned by the original planters and settlers of scarborough my grandfather once told me of a traveling showman who stopped for a night at the house of the local ferryman the showman was carrying a lion east and a hunter proposed after some liquor was taken to match one of his dogs against the lion for a wager of a barrel of rum the showman agreed and in front of a gathering of townsmen the dog was put in the lions cage the dog took one look at the lion sprang for its throat then forced it onto its back and set about killing it the showman intervened and paid the hunter the barrel of rum and fifty dollars to be allowed to shoot the dog in the cage before it tore the lion apart walter wasnt the lionkilling kind but he was my dog and i loved him nonetheless my neighbors bob and shirley johnson looked after him for me if i had to go away for a few days walter didnt mind staying with them he was still free to roam his territory and they spoiled him they were retired and didnt have a dog of their own so bob was always happy to take walter for a stroll it worked out well for everybody by now we had reached ferry beach it was late but i needed the air i watched walter tentatively dip a paw into the water then withdraw it rapidly he barked once in reproof then looked at me as if there was something that i could do to raise the temperature of the sea so he could splash away he wagged his tail then all of the hairs on his back seemed to rise at once he grew very still and stared past me his lips parted exposing his sharp white teeth he growled very low in his throat i turned a man appeared to be standing among the trees if i looked directly at him i could see only branches and spots of moonlight where i thought he was standing but he seemed to appear more clearly when i looked at him with my peripheral vision or if i tried not to focus on him at all he was there though walters reaction was evidence of that and i still recalled the events of the night before the glimpse i had caught of something at the edge of the forest before it faded away a childs voice whispering from the shadows words scrawled on a dusty windowpane hollow men i didnt have my gun i had left the in the car while i was talking to dr christian and had not retrieved it before taking walter out while the smith was in my bedroom i now wished i had either one of them with me or maybe both how you doing i called i raised my hand in greeting the man didnt move his coat was a dirty tan in color so that it blended with the shadows and the sandy earth only a little of his face was visible a hint of pale cheek of white forehead and chin his mouth and eyes were black pools fine wrinkles visible where the lips might have been and at the edges of the dark sockets as though the skin in those places had become shrunken and dried i walked closer walter advancing beside me hoping to see him more clearly and he began to retreat into the trees the darkness embracing him and then he was gone walters growls ceased warily he approached the spot where the figure had been standing and sniffed at the ground clearly he didnt like what he smelled there because his muzzle wrinkled and he ran his tongue over his teeth as though trying to rid it of a bad taste i walked on through the trees until i came to the boundary of the beach area but there was no sign of anyone i didnt hear a car start all seemed quiet and still we left the beach and walked home but walter stayed close to me all the way only pausing at times to stare into the trees to our left his teeth slightly bared as though waiting for the approach of some threat as yet unknown chapter viii i drove down to lynn the next morning the sky was clear and blue the color of summer but the deciduous trees were bare and the workers employed on the neverending turnpike extension were wrapped in hooded sweaters and wore thick gloves to ward off the cold i drank coffee on the ride and listened to an album of north african protest music it drew disapproving looks when i stopped for gas in new hampshire where the sound of clash songs being bellowed in arabic was clearly regarded as evidence of unpatriotic leanings the songs kept my mind off the figure glimpsed in the trees at ferry beach the night before the memory of it evoked a curious response as though i had witnessed something that i was not really meant to see or had broken some taboo the strangest part of it was that the figure had seemed almost familiar to me as if i had at last encountered a distant uncle or cousin about whom i had heard a great deal but whom i had never before met i left the interstate for route as ugly a stretch of uncontrolled commercial development as could be found anywhere in the northeast and then took north which wasnt much better heading through revere and saugus toward lynn i passed the huge wheelabrator waste management plant on the right then ge aviation the big employer in the area usedcar lots and vacant sites dotted the landscape as i entered lynn its streetlights adorned with stars and stripes banners welcoming all comers each sponsored by a local business eldritch and associates wasnt among them and when i came to their offices it wasnt hard to see why it didnt look like a particularly prosperous operation occupying the top two floors of an ugly gray building that squatted defiantly on the block like a mongrel dog its windows were filthy and nobody had refreshed the gold lettering upon them announcing the presence of a lawyer within in a long long time the premises were sandwiched between tulleys bar on the right itself a pretty austere place that appeared to have been built to repel a siege and some graygreen condos with businesses on the lower level a nail salon a store called angkor multi services with signs in cambodian and a mexican restaurant advertising pupusas tortas and tacos at the end of the block was another bar that made tulleys look like it had been designed by gaudi it was little more than a doorway and a pair of windows with the name above the entrance painted in jagged white letters by someone who might have been suffering from serious delirium tremens at the time and who had offered to do the job in return for a handsteadying drink it was called eddys without the apostrophe maybe if theyd called it steady eddys they might have gotten away with the sign on ironic grounds i wasnt optimistic about eldritch and associates as i parked in tulleys lot in my experience lawyers didnt tend to open up much for private investigators and the previous days conversation with stark hadnt done much to change my opinion in fact now that i thought about it my encounters with lawyers had been almost uniformly negative maybe i just wasnt meeting enough of them then again maybe i was just meeting too many the streetlevel door of eldritchs building was unlocked and a narrow flight of battered steps led to the upper floors the yellow wall to the right of the stairs had an extended greasy smear at the level of my upper arm where countless coat sleeves had brushed against it over the years there was a musty smell that grew stronger the farther up i went it was the odor of old paper slowly decaying of dust piled upon dust of rotting carpet and law cases that had dragged on for decades it was the stuff of dickens had the problems of jarndyce and jarndyce found their way across the atlantic they would have enjoyed familiar surroundings in the company of eldritch and associates i reached a door marked bathroom on the first landing ahead of me on the second floor was a frostedglass door with the firms name etched upon it i climbed on careful not to place too much faith in the carpet beneath my feet which was fatally undermined by an absence of enough nails to hold it in position to my right a further flight of steps led up into the dimness of the top floor the carpet there was less worn but it wasnt much of a claim out of politeness i knocked on the glass door before entering it seemed like the olde worlde thing to do nobody answered so i opened the door and entered there was a low wooden counter to my left behind it was a large desk and behind the large desk was a large woman with a pile of big black hair balanced precariously on her head like dirty ice cream on a cone she was wearing a bright green blouse with frills at the neck and a necklace of yellowing imitation pearls like everything else there she looked old but age had not dimmed her affection for cosmetics or hair dye even if it had deprived her of some of the skills required to apply both without making the final effect look less like an act of vanity than an act of vandalism she was smoking a cigarette given the amount of paper surrounding her it seemed an almost suicidal act of bravado as well as indicating an admirable disregard for the law even for someone who worked for a lawyer help you she said she had a voice like puppies being strangled high and gasping id like to see mr eldritch i said senior or junior either seniors dead junior it is then hes busy hes not taking on any new clients were run off our feet already i tried to imagine her even getting to her feet let alone being run off them and couldnt there was a picture on the wall behind her but the sunlight had faded it so much that only a hint of a tree was visible in one corner the walls were yellow just like those on the stairway but decades of nicotine accumulation had given them a disturbing brown tint the ceiling might once have been white but only a fool would have placed a bet on it and everywhere there was paper on the carpet on the womans desk on a second unoccupied desk nearby on the counter on a pair of old straightbacked chairs that might once have been offered to clients but was now assigned to morepressing storage duties and on the fulllength shelves that stood against the walls hell if they could have found a way to store paper on the ceiling they probably would have covered that as well none of the documents looked like theyd been moved much since quills went out of fashion its about someone who may be a current client i replied his name is merrick she squinted at me through a plume of cigarette smoke merrick doesnt ring a bell hes driving a car registered to this firm howd you know its one of ours well it was hard to tell at first because it wasnt filled with paper but it checked out in the end her squint grew narrower i gave her the tag number merrick i said again i pointed at her phone you may want to call someone who isnt dead take a seat she said i looked around there isnt one she almost smiled then thought better about cracking the makeup on her face guess youll have to stand then i sighed here was more proof if proof were needed that not all fat people were jolly santa claus had a lot to answer for she lifted the receiver and pressed some buttons on her beige phone name parker charlie parker like the singer saxophonist whatever you got some id i showed her my license she looked at it distastefully like id just taken my weenie out and made it do tricks pictures old she said lot of stuff s old i replied cant stay young and beautiful forever she tapped her fingers upon her desk while she waited for an answer at the other end of the line her nails were painted pink the color made my teeth hurt you sure he didnt sing pretty sure huh so who was the one who sang he fell out of a window chet baker huh she continued drumming her nails you like chet baker i asked we were forming a relationship no or maybe not mercifully somewhere above us a phone was answered mr eldritch theres a she paused dramatically gentleman here to see you hes asking about a mr merrick she listened to the answer nodding when she hung up she looked even unhappier than before i think she had been hoping for an order to release the hounds on me you can go up second door at the top of the stairs its been a blast i said yeah she said you hurry back now i left her like an overweight joan of arc waiting for the pyre to ignite and went up to the top floor the second door was already open and a small old man seventy or more stood waiting for me he still had most of his hair or most of someones hair he wore gray pinstriped trousers and a black jacket over a white shirt and a gray pinstriped vest his tie was black silk he looked slightly unhappy like an undertaker who had just mislaid a corpse a faint patina of dust seemed to have settled upon him a combination of dandruff and paper fragments paper mostly wrinkled and faded as he was he might almost have been made of paper himself slowly crumbling away along with the accumulated detritus of a lifetime in the service of the law he stretched out a hand in greeting and conjured up a smile compared to his secretary it was like being greeted with the keys of the city im thomas eldritch he said please come in his office was tiny there was paper here too but less of it some of it even looked like it had been moved recently and box files were stored alphabetically on the shelves each carefully marked with a set of dates they went back a very long time he closed the door behind me and waited for me to sit before he took his own seat at his desk now he said steepling his hands before him whats this about mr merrick you know him i am aware of him we provided him with a car at the request of one of our clients can i ask the name of the client im afraid i cant tell you that is mr merrick in some kind of trouble hes getting there ive been employed by a woman who seems to have attracted merrick s attentions hes stalking her he broke a window in her house eldritch tuttutted has she informed the police she has weve heard nothing from them surely a complaint of this kind would have made its way back to us by now the police didnt get to talk to him i did i took the tag number from his car and traced it back to your firm very enterprising of you and now instead of informing the police you are here may i ask why the lady in question is not convinced that the police can help her and you can it sounded like a statement not a question and i had an uneasy sensation that eldritch already knew who i was even before his secretary gave him my name i treated it as a question anyway im trying we may have to involve the police if this situation persists which i imagine might be embarrassing or worse for you and your client neither we nor our client are responsible for mr merricks behavior even if what you say is true the police may not take that view if youre acting as his personal carrental service and theyll get the same reply that i have just given you we simply provided a car for him at a clients request and nothing more and you cant tell me anything at all about merrick no i know very little about him as ive said do you even know his first name eldritch considered his eyes were cunning and bright it struck me that he was enjoying this i believe its frank do you think that frank might have served some time i couldnt possibly say there doesnt seem to be very much that you can say i am a lawyer and therefore a certain degree of discretion is to be expected by my clients otherwise i would not have remained in this profession for as long as i have if what you say is true then mr merricks actions are to be regretted perhaps if your own client were to sit down with him and discuss the matter then the situation could be resolved to everyones satisfaction as i can only assume that mr merrick believes she may be of some assistance to him in other words if she tells him what he wants to know then hell go away it would be logical to assume so and does she know something i let the question dangle he was baiting me and wherever you found bait you could be pretty certain that there was a hook hidden somewhere within it he seems to think so then it would appear to be the natural solution im sure that mr merrick is a reasonable man eldritch had remained impossibly still throughout our discussions only his mouth moved even his eyes appeared reluctant to blink but when he said the word reasonable he smiled slightly imbuing the word with an import that was entirely the opposite of its apparent meaning have you met merrick mr eldritch i have had that pleasure yes he seems to have a lot of anger in him it may be that he has just cause i notice that you havent asked me the name of the woman who is employing me which suggests to me that you already know it in turn that would seem to indicate that merrick has been in touch with you i have spoken to mr merrick yes is he also a client of yours he was in a sense we acted on his behalf in a certain matter he is a client no longer and now youre helping him because one of your other clients has asked you to that is so why is your client interested in daniel clay mr eldritch my client has no interest in daniel clay i dont believe you i will not lie to you mr parker if i cannot answer a question for whatever reason then i will tell you so but i will not lie i will repeat myself to my knowledge my client has no interest in daniel clay mr merricks line of inquiry is entirely his own what about his daughter is your client interested in her eldritch seemed to consider confirming it then decided against it but his silence was enough i could not possibly say that is something you would have to discuss with mr merrick my nostrils itched i could feel the molecules of paper and dust settling in them as though eldritchs office were slowly making me part of itself so that in years to come a stranger might enter and find us here eldritch and me still batting questions and answers back and forth to no end a thin layer of white matter covering us as we ourselves dwindled into dust do you want to know what i think mr eldritch what would that be mr parker i think merrick is a dangerous man and i think somebody has set him on my client you know who that person is so maybe youll pass on a message for me you tell him or her that im very good at what i do and if anything happens to the woman ive been hired to protect then im going to come back here and someone will answer for what has taken place am i making myself clear eldritchs expression did not alter he was still smiling benignly like a little wrinkled buddha perfectly mr parker he said this is purely an observation and nothing more but it appears to me that you have adopted an adversarial position with regard to mr merrick perhaps if you were to be less confrontational you might find that you have more in common with him than you think it may be that you and he share certain common goals i dont have a goal beyond ensuring that no harm comes to the woman in my care oh i dont think thats true mr parker you are thinking in the specific not the general mr merrick like you may be interested in a form of justice for himself or for someone else have you tried asking him it didnt work out so well perhaps if you tried without a gun on your belt so merrick had spoken to him recently otherwise how could eldritch have known of my confrontation with him and the gun you know i said i dont think i want to meet merrick unless i have a gun close at hand that is of course your decision now if theres nothing else he stood walked to the door and opened it clearly our meeting was at an end once more he extended his hand for me to shake its been a pleasure he said gravely in an odd way he seemed to mean it im delighted that weve had a chance to meet at last ive heard so much about you would that be from your client as well i asked and for an instant the smile almost slipped fragile as a crystal glass teetering on the edge of a table he rescued it but it was enough he seemed about to reply but i answered for him let me guess i said you couldnt possibly say precisely he replied but if its any consolation i expect that youll meet him again in time again but the door had already closed sealing me off from thomas eldritch and his knowledge just as surely as if a tomb door had closed upon him leaving him with only his paper and his dust and his secrets for company chapter ix my visit to thomas eldritch hadnt contributed significantly to my sense of inner wellbeing although it had at least given me merrick s first name eldritch had also carefully avoided any denial that merrick might have done time which meant that somewhere in the system there was probably a closetful of bones just waiting to be rattled but eldritchs hint that i knew his client made me uneasy i had enough ghosts in my past to know that i didnt relish the prospect of any of them being raised i stopped for coffee and a sandwich at the bel aire diner on route i gave route this much at least it had no shortage of spots where a man could eat the bel aire had survived in its current spot for more than half a century a big old diner sign outside advertising its presence from the top of a fortyfoot pole the name written beneath in the original fifties cursive the last i heard a guy called harry kallas was running the bel aire and harry had taken over the place from his father inside it were burgundy vinyl booths and matching stools at the counter and a grayandwhitetiled floor that boasted the kind of wear and tear associated with generations of business there were rumors that it was due to close for redecoration which i supposed was necessary if kind of sad a tv was built into the wall at one end but nobody was watching it the kitchen was noisy the waitresses were noisy and the construction workers and locals ordering blue plate specials were noisy too i was finishing my second cup of coffee when the call came through it was merrick i recognized his voice the moment i heard it but no number was displayed on my cell phone youre a smart sonofabitch he said is that meant to be a compliment if it is you need to work on your technique all that time in the can must have made you rusty youre fishing the lawyer didnt give you shit i wasnt surprised that eldritch had made some calls i just wondered who had touched base with merrick the lawyer or his client are you telling me that if i go searching for you in the system i wont find a record search away i aint gonna make it easy for you though i waited a heartbeat before asking my next question it was a hunch and nothing more whats the name of the girl in the picture frank there was no reply shes the reason why youre here isnt she was she one of the children seen by daniel clay is she your daughter tell me her name frank tell me her name and maybe i can help you when merrick spoke again his voice had changed it was filled with quiet yet lethal menace and i knew with certainty that this was a man who not only was capable of killing but who had killed already and that a line had been crossed at the mention of the girl listen to me he said i told you once already my business is my own i gave you time to convince that little missy to come clean not to go nosing around in matters that dont concern you youd better get back up to where you came from and talk her around or what ill bet that whoever called you about my visit to eldritch told you to take it down a couple of notches you keep harassing rebecca clay and your friends are going to cut you loose youll end up back in the can frank and what good will you be to anyone then youre wasting time he said you seem to think i was funnin with you about that deadline im getting close i lied ill have something for you by tomorrow twentyfour hours he said thats all the time you have left and im being generous with you let me tell you something else you and missy better start worrying if n i am cut loose right now thats the only thing holding me in check apart from my general good nature he hung up i paid the check and left my coffee to grow cold suddenly it didnt seem like i had the time to linger over it after all my next visit was to jerry legere rebecca clays exhusband i contacted asecure and was told that legere was out on a job in westbrook with raymon lang and after only a little cajoling the receptionist let me know the location i found the company van parked in an industrial wasteland of mud and seemingly deserted premises with a rutted track leading between them it wasnt clear if the site was half finished or in terminal decline building work had ceased some time before on a couple of incomplete structures leaving sections of the steel supports jutting from the concrete like bones from the stumps of severed limbs puddles of filthy water stank of gas and waste and a small yellow cement mixer was lying on its side in a patch of weeds slowly decaying into rust only one warehouse was open and inside i found two men on the first floor of the empty twostory interior a blueprint spread out on the ground in front of them as they knelt over it this building at least had been finished and there was fresh wire screening to protect its windows from any stones that might have been thrown i knocked on the steel door and the men both looked up help you said one he was about five years older than i was big and stronglooking but balding badly on top although he kept his hair cut short enough to disguise the worst of it it was petty and childish i knew but i always felt a brief surge of warmth inside when i met someone close to my own age who had less hair than i did you could be king of the world and own a dozen companies but every morning when you stared in the mirror your first thought would be damn i wish i still had my hair im looking for jerry legere it was the other man who answered he was silverhaired and ruddycheeked rebecca was six or seven years younger than i was i guessed and this man had a good ten or fifteen years on me he was carrying some weight and his jowls were sagging he had a big square head that looked a little too heavy for his body and the kind of mouth that was always poised to find something to scowl about women kids modern music the weather he was wearing a checked lumberjack shirt tucked into old blue jeans and muddy work boots with mismatched laces rebecca was an attractive woman true we couldnt always choose those with whom we fell in love and i knew looks werent everything but the union however temporary of the houses of clay and legere suggested that sometimes looks might actually be a real disadvantage my names charlie parker i said im a private investigator id like to talk to you if you can spare a few minutes did she hire you from the tone of his voice she didnt sound like anyone for whom he retained a high degree of affection im working for your exwife if thats what you mean i replied his face cleared but only slightly at least it took a little weight off his scowl it looked like legere was having troubles with someone other than rebecca the effect didnt last long though if there was one thing that could be said for jerry legere it was that he wasnt a man capable of keeping his thoughts hidden behind a poker face he went from concern to relief then descended into worry that bordered on a kind of panic each transition was clearly readable in his features he was like a cartoon character his face engaged in a constant game of catchup with his emotions what does my exwife need with a detective he asked thats why id like to talk to you maybe we could step outside legere glanced at the younger man who nodded and returned to checking the blueprint the sky was clear blue and the sun shone down upon us giving light but no warmth so he said your wife hired me because a man has been bothering her i waited for legeres face to conjure up a surprised expression but i was disappointed instead he settled for a leer that could have come straight from a villain in a victorian melodrama one of her boyfriends he asked does she have boyfriends legere shrugged shes a slut i dont know what sluts call them fucks maybe why would you call her a slut because thats what she is she cheated on me when we were married then lied about it she lies about everything this guy youre talking about hes probably some jerk who was promised a good time then got upset when it didnt arrive i was a fool to marry a woman who was soiled goods but i took pity on her i wont make that mistake again now ill screw em but i wont marry em he leered once more i waited for him to nudge me in the ribs or give me an arent we men of the world wink like in that monty python sketch your wife eh shes a liar and a slut right they all are put like that it wasnt quite so funny i recalled legeres earlier questiondid she hire youand the relief on his face when i told him that i was working for his wife what did you do jerry who else did you annoy so much that she might require the services of a private detective i dont think this man is a rejected suitor i said legere appeared to be about to ask what a suitor was but then took the trouble to work it out for himself hes been asking about rebeccas father i continued hes under the impression that daniel clay might still be alive something flickered in legeres eyes it was like watching a djinn momentarily try to break free from the bottle only to have the cork forcefully rammed home upon it thats bullshit said legere her fathers dead everyone knows that everyone legere looked away you know what i mean hes missing not dead she had him declared too late for me though theres money in the bank but i wont see any of it i could have done with some of it right about now times hard times are always hard for the workingman you ought to put that to music i reckon its been done before its old news he turned on his heel and looked back at the warehouse clearly anxious to be done with me and get back to work i couldnt blame him so what makes you so sure that daniel clay is dead i asked i dont think i like your tone he replied his fists clenched involuntarily he became conscious of the reflex and allowed them to relax then wiped the palms dry on the seams of his jeans theres nothing in it i just meant that you seem pretty certain that hes not coming back well hes been gone a long time right nobody has seen him in six years and from what i hear he left with the clothes on his back and nothing else didnt even pack an overnight bag did your exwife tell you that if she didnt i read it in the newspapers its no secret were you seeing her when her father went missing no we hooked up later but it didnt last more than six months i found out she was seeing other men behind my back and i let the bitch go he didnt seem embarrassed to be telling me this usually when men discussed the infidelities of their wives or girlfriends it came with a greater degree of shame than legere was showing the memories of the relationship underscored by an abiding sense of betrayal they were also careful to whom they told their secrets because what they feared most of all was that they would somehow be held accountable that it would be adjudged that their failings had forced their women to seek their pleasures elsewhere that they had been lacking in the ability to satisfy them men tended to see these matters distorted through the prism of sex id known women to wander out of desire but id known more who had cheated because with it came the affection and attention that they werent getting at home men by and large sought sex women traded it i guess i wasnt no innocent either he said but thats the way of men she had everything she needed she had no call to do what she did she threw me out of the house when i objected to how she was behaving i told you shes a whore they hit a certain age and thats it they become sluts but instead of admitting it she turned it on me she said i was the one who done wrong not her bitch i wasnt sure that this was any of my business but rebecca clays version of her marital difficulties was very different from her exhusbands now legere was claiming that he was the injured party and while rebeccas story had more of the ring of truth about it perhaps that was simply because jerry legere made my skin crawl but i could see no reason for him to lie the story didnt reflect well on him and there was no mistaking his bitterness there was a little truth somewhere in his story however distorted it might have become in the telling have you ever heard of a man named frank merrick mr legere i asked no i cant say that i have he replied merrick no it doesnt ring a bell is he the guy whos been bothering her thats right legere looked away again i couldnt see his face but his posture had changed as though he had just tensed to avoid a blow no he repeated i dont know who youre talking about strange i said what is he seems to know you i had his full attention now he didnt even bother to hide his alarm what do you mean he was the one who told me to talk to you he said you might know why he was looking for daniel clay thats not true i told you clays dead men like him dont just drop off the face of the earth only to pop up again later someplace else under a different name hes dead even if he wasnt theres no way hed be in contact with me i never even met the guy this man merrick was of the opinion that your wife might have told you things that she kept from the authorities hes mistaken he said quickly she didnt tell me nothing she didnt even speak about him much did you think that was odd no what was she gonna say she just wanted to forget him nothing good would come from talking about him could she have been in contact with him without you knowing assuming that he was still alive you know said legere i dont think shes that smart you see this man again you tell him that the way he was talking about you it sounded like you might get the chance to tell him yourself the prospect didnt appear to give him much pleasure he spit on the ground then rubbed the spittle into the dust with his shoe just to give himself something to do one more thing mr legere what was the project if it was possible to freeze a man with a word then jerry legere froze where did you hear that the words were spoken almost before he realized it and i could see instantly that he wished he could retract them there was no anger left now it had disappeared entirely overwhelmed by what might almost have been wonder he was shaking his head as if in disbelief it doesnt matter where id just like to know what it is or was you got it from that guy right merrick some of his belligerence was already returning you come here making accusations talking about men ive never met listening to lies from strangers from that bitch i married you got some nerve his right hand shoved me hard in the chest i took a step back and he started to advance i could see him preparing to land another blow this one harder and higher than the first i raised my hands in a placatory gesture and positioned my feet my right foot slightly forward of the left ill teach you some i came off my left foot and hit him in the stomach with a doorbreaker kick following through with the full weight of my body the force of the impact drove the air from his body and sent him sprawling backward in the dirt he lay there gasping clutching his hands to his belly his face was contorted in pain you bastard he said ill kill you for that i stood over him the project mr legere what was it fuck you i got no idea what youre talking about he forced the words out through gritted teeth i took one of my cards from my wallet and dropped it on him the other man appeared at the entrance to the warehouse he had a crowbar in his hand i raised a finger of warning to him and he paused well talk again you might want to think some on merrick and what he said youre going to end up discussing this again with one of us whether you like it or not i started to walk back to my car i heard him get to his feet he called after me i turned around lang was standing at the entrance to the warehouse asking legere if he was okay but legere ignored him the expression on his face had changed again it was still red and he was having trouble breathing but a look of low cunning had taken shape upon it you think youre clever he said you think youre hard maybe you ought to make some inquiries see what happened to the last guy who started asking about daniel clay he was a private dick too just like you he put a lot of emphasis on the word dick and you know where he is legere continued hes in the same fucking place as daniel clay is where he is somewhere theres a hole in the fucking ground with daniel clay in it and right next to it is another hole with a fucking snoop rotting to hell inside so you go right ahead you keep asking questions about daniel clay and projects theres always room for one more it dont take much effort to dig a hole and it takes less to fill it up again once theres a body in it i walked toward him i was pleased to see him take a step back there you go again i said you do seem certain that daniel clay is dead i got nothing more to say to you who was the detective i asked who hired him fuck you he said but then he reconsidered a broad bitter grin creased his face you want to know who hired him that bitch hired him just like she hired you she was fucking him too i could tell i could smell him on her i bet thats how she pays you too but dont think youre the first and he asked all the same questions that you did about clay and projects and what she said or didnt say to me and youre gonna go the way he did because thats what happens to people who go asking after daniel clay he snapped his fingers they disappear he wiped the dirt from his jeans some of his false courage began to dissipate as his adrenaline failed him and for a moment he looked like a man who had glimpsed his own future and what he saw frightened him they disappear chapter x i touched base with jackie garner when i got home he told me that all was quiet he sounded vaguely disappointed rebecca clay said the same when i called her there had been no sign of merrick he seemed to be keeping his word and his distance the phone call to me apart rebecca was working in her office so i drove over to speak to her acknowledging jackies presence outside with a small wave when i arrived we ordered coffee at the little market beside the realtors and sat at the single table outside to drink it passing motorists looked at us curiously it was too cold to be dining al fresco but i wanted to talk to her while my conversation with her exhusband was still fresh in my mind it was time to clear the air he said all that rebecca clay looked genuinely shocked when i told her of what had passed between jerry and me but theyre all lies i was never unfaithful to him never that wasnt why we broke up im not saying he was telling the truth but there was real bitterness behind his words he wanted money he didnt get it is that why you think he married you for money well it wasnt for love and what about you what was your reason she shifted in her seat her discomfort at discussing the subject manifesting itself physically she looked even more tired and drawn than when i had first met her i didnt think she would be able to take the strain of what was happening for much longer without breaking in some way i told you part of it she said after my father disappeared i just felt completely alone i was like a pariah because of the rumors about him i met jerry through raymon who installed the alarm system in my fathers house they come back once a year to check that everything is working okay and jerry was the one who arrived to do the maintenance a few months after my father went away i guess i was lonely and one thing led to another he was okay at the start i mean he was never exactly a charmer but he was good with jenna and he wasnt a deadbeat he was surprising too in some ways he read a lot and knew about music and movies he taught me stuff she laughed humorlessly looking back i guess i replaced one father figure with another and then we got married kind of fast and he moved into my fathers house with me things were fine for a couple of months jerry was hung up on money though it was always a big thing with him he felt that hed never been given an even break he had all kinds of big plans and no way to make them happen until he met me he smelled cash but there was none or none that he could get his hands on he started to harp on it a lot and that caused arguments then i came home one night and he was bathing jenna she was six or seven at the time hed never done that before its not like i had made it clear to him that he shouldnt or anything but i just kind of assumed that he wouldnt she was naked in the bath and he was kneeling beside her outside the tub his feet were bare that was what freaked me out his bare feet makes no sense huh anyway i screamed at him and jenna started crying and jerry stormed out and didnt come back until late i tried talking to him about what had happened but hed run up a head of steam by that point fueled by a lot of booze and he slapped me it wasnt hard or anything but i wasnt going to take a slap from any man i told him to get out and he did he came back a day or two later and he apologized and i guess we made up he was real careful around me and jenna after that but i couldnt shake off that image of him with my daughter naked beside him he had a computer that he used for work sometimes and i knew his password id seen him enter it once when he was showing jenna something on the internet i went into his files and well there was a lot of pornography i know men look at that kind of stuff i suppose some women do too but there was so much of it on jerrys computer just so much adults or children i asked adults she replied all adults i tried to stay quiet about it but i couldnt i told him what id done and what id seen i asked him if he had a problem at first he was ashamed then he got real angry real real angry he screamed and shouted he threw stuff he started calling me all these names like the ones he used when he was talking to you he told me i was soiled that i was lucky anyone would want to touch me he said other things too things about jenna he said that shed end up like me that the apple never fell far from the tree that was it as far as i was concerned he left that night and things came to an end he had a lawyer for a time and he was trying to get an order made against my assets but i didnt really have any assets after a while it all dried up and i didnt hear from him or the lawyer again he didnt contest the divorce he just seemed happy to be rid of me i finished my coffee a wind blew sending dead leaves scurrying like children fleeing the approach of rain i knew she hadnt told me everything that aspects of what had occurred would remain private but some of what she had said explained jerry legeres animosity toward his exwife especially if he felt that he was not entirely to blame for what had occurred there were truth and lies bound up together in what each of them was saying though and rebecca clay had not been entirely honest with me from the start i pressed on i mentioned the project that merrick had spoken about to your exhusband i said it looked like he had heard it referred to before it could have been something private that my father was engaged inhe was always doing research and reading journals trying to keep up with changes in his professionbut it wouldnt make sense for jerry to know anything about it i mean they didnt know each other and i dont even remember jerry coming to check out the security system before my father died they never met but mention of the project led me to the final question and the one that was troubling me the most jerry told me something else i said he claimed that you hired a private investigator once before to look into the your fathers disappearance jerry said that the man you hired disappeared in turn is that true rebecca clay bit some dry skin from her bottom lip you think i lied to you dont you by omission im not blaming you but id like to know why elwin stark suggested that i hire someone it was about eighteen months after my father had vanished and the police seemed to have decided that there wasnt anything more that they could do i spoke to elwin because i was worried about jerrys lawyer and i didnt know what could be done to protect my fathers estate there was no will so it was going to be messy anyway but elwin said that a first step if my father didnt reappear would be to have him declared legally dead after five years elwins view was that it would be helpful to hire someone to make further inquiries as a judge might take that into account when it came to making the declaration i didnt have a whole lot of money though i was just starting out as a junior realtor i guess that determined the kind of person i could afford to hire who was he i asked his name was jim poole he was just starting out too he had done some work for a friend of mineit was my friend april you met her at the housewho suspected that her husband was cheating on her it turned out that he wasnt he was gambling instead although i dont know if that was better or worse for her but she seemed happy with jims work so i hired him and asked him to see if he could look into things even see if he could discover anything new he spoke to some of the same people that you did but he didnt find out anything more than we already knew jim might have mentioned something about a project at one point but i probably didnt pay a whole lot of attention my father really did always seem to have some kind of article or essay on the back burner he was never short of ideas for things to write about and research then after a couple of weeks jim called to tell me that he was heading out of town for a few days and that he might have some news for me when he got back well i waited for jim to call again and he never did about a week later the police came to see me jims girlfriend had reported him missing and they were talking to his friends and his clients although he didnt have very many of either they found my name among the files in his apartment but i couldnt help them jim hadnt told me where he was going they werent happy about that but what more could i do jims car was found down in boston shortly after parked in one of the longterm lots near logan they found some drugs in the cara bag of coke i thinkenough to suggest that he might have been dealing on the side i think they figured that hed gotten into some kind of trouble over the drugs maybe with a supplier and that hed either fled because of it or been killed his girlfriend told the police that he wasnt that kind of guy and he would have found a way to get in touch with her even if he was running from something but he never did and what do you think she shook her head i stopped looking for my father after that was all she said is that enough of an answer for you and you didnt tell me about poole because you thought it might dissuade me from helping you yes was your relationship with jim poole purely professional she stood up quickly almost knocking her cup from the table it splashed cold coffee between us that dripped through the holes in the table and stained the ground below what kind of question is that i bet that came from jerry too right it did but now isnt the time to get selfrighteous i liked jim she said as if that answered the question he was having problems with his girlfriend we talked had a drink together once or twice jerry saw us in a barhe used to call me sometimes when hed been drinking asking for another chanceand decided that jim was getting in the way but jim was younger and stronger than him there was some shouting and a bottle was broken but nobody got hurt i guess jerrys still sore about it even after all this time she straightened the skirt of her business suit look im grateful for what youve done but i cant let this go on for much longer she gestured toward jackie as if he symbolized all that was wrong in her life i want my daughter back home and i want merrick off my back now that you know about jim poole im not sure that i want you to keep asking questions about my father either i dont need to feel guilty about any more people and every day seems to cost me like two days pay id appreciate it if we could get this whole thing wrapped up as soon as possible even if it means going to a judge i told her that i understood and id talk to some people about her options and call her to go through them with her as soon as i could she headed back to her office to collect her things i chatted with jackie garner and told him about the call from merrick what happens when our time runs out asked jackie we just gonna wait for him to make a move i told him it wouldnt come to that i also told him that i didnt think rebecca clay would keep paying for much longer and that i was going to bring in some extra help in the hope of making more progress the kind of help that comes from new york asked jackie maybe i said if the woman aint paying you then how come you want to keep working because merrick isnt going away whether he gets what he wants from rebecca or not plus im going to shake his tree a whole lot over the next day or two and hes not going to like it jackie looked amused well you need a hand you let me know its the boring stuff you have to pay me for the interesting stuff i do for free walter was still wet with salt water from his walk with bob johnson when i got home and seemed content to sleep in his basket away from the cold i had a couple of hours to kill before i was to meet june fitzpatrick for dinner so i went onto the pressherald s web site and browsed its archive for anything i could find on daniel clays disappearance according to the reports allegations of abuse had been received from a number of children who had been patients of dr clay at no point was there any implication that he was involved but questions were clearly being asked about how he could have failed to notice that children whom he was assisting each of whom had been abused before were being abused again clay had declined to comment other than to say that he was very distressed by the allegations that he would make a full statement in due course and that his main priority was assisting the police and social services with their own investigations with a view to finding the culprits a couple of experts had come somewhat reluctantly to clays defense pointing out that sometimes it could take months or years to get an abuse victim to reveal the depth of what he or she had endured even the police were careful not to apportion blame on clay but reading between the lines of the story it seemed clear that clay was taking some of that blame on himself anyway there was such a scandal brewing that it was hard to see how clay could have continued to practice no matter what the outcome of any investigation was one piece described him variously as ashenfaced holloweyed gaunt and close to tears there was a picture of clay beside the piece taken outside his house he looked thin and stooped like a wounded stork the detective quoted in one of the newspaper articles was bobby orourke he was still a detective as far as i knew although he worked out of internal affairs i got him at his desk just before he left for the day and he agreed to meet me for a beer over in gearys within the hour i parked on commercial and found him seated in a corner flipping through some photocopies and eating a hamburger we had met a couple of times in the past and id helped him to fill in the blanks in a case involving a portland pd cop named barron who had died under what could euphemistically be termed mysterious circumstances a few years before i didnt envy orourke his job the fact that he was with ia meant that he was good at his work unfortunately it was work at which some of his fellow cops didnt want him to be good he wiped his hands on a napkin and we shook you eating he asked nope going to dinner in an hour or two anyplace flash joel harmons house im impressed were going to be reading about you in the society columns we spoke a little about the annual ia report that was about to be published it was the usual stuff mainly useofforce allegations and complaints about the operation of police vehicles the patterns remained pretty consistent the complainants were typically young males and the useofforce incidents mostly related to breaking up fights the cops had used only their hands to subdue the combatants and the guys involved were mostly white and under thirty so it wasnt like senior citizens or the harlem globetrotters were being rousted nobody had been suspended for longer than two days as a result of complaints all told it wasnt a bad year for ia meanwhile the portland pd had a new chief the old chief had stepped down earlier in the year and the city council had been considering two candidates one who was white and local and one who was black and from the south had the council gone for the black candidate it would have increased by percent the number of black cops in portland but instead it had opted for local experience it wasnt a bad decision but some minority leaders were still sore the old chief meanwhile was rumored to be considering a run for governor orourke finished his burger and took a sip of his ipa he was a slim fit guy who didnt look like burgers and beer usually accounted for too many of his calories so daniel clay he said you remember him i remember the case and what i didnt recall i checked before i came over here i only met clay twice before he went missing so theres a limit to what i can tell you what did you think of him he seemed genuinely upset by what had happened he looked to be in shock he kept referring to them as his kids we started investigating along with the state police the sheriffs the local cops social services the rest you probably know already some points of correspondence came up in other cases over a period of time and a number of those cases could be traced back to clay you think it was a coincidence that clay had worked with the kids theres nothing to indicate that it wasnt some of the children were particularly vulnerable theyd been abused before and most of them were in the very early stages of therapy and intervention they hadnt even got around to talking about the first series of abuses before the next began to happen ever come close to an arrest no a girl thirteen years old was found wandering in fields outside of skowhegan at three in the morning barefoot clothes torn bleeding no underwear she was hysterical babbling about men and birds she was disoriented and didnt seem to know where shed been held or what direction shed walked from but she was clear on the details three men all masked taking turns with her in what seemed to be an unfurnished room in a house we got some dna samples from her but most of them were pretty messed up only a couple were clean and they didnt match anything on the databases about a year ago we tried again as part of a cold case review but still zip its bad we should have done better on it but i dont see how what about the kids i havent kept track of all of them some have come back on the radar they were screwedup kids and they became screwedup adults i always felt sorry for them when i saw their names come up what the hell kind of chance did they have after what was done to them and clay he literally vanished his daughter called us said she was worried about him that he hadnt been home in two days they found his car outside jackman up by the canadian border we thought he might have fled the jurisdiction but there was no reason for him to do that apart from shame maybe hes never been seen again i leaned back in my chair i wasnt much wiser than before id sat down orourke recognized my dissatisfaction sorry he said bet you were hoping for a revelation yeah a blinding flash of light so how did this come up clays daughter hired me someone has been asking questions about her father it has her rattled you ever hear of a man named frank merrick bingo orourkes face lit up like the fourth of july frank merrick he said oh yeah i know all about frank fatal frank they used to call him hes the guy the one whos shaking up clays daughter i nodded makes sense in a way said orourke i asked him why because merrick s daughter was also a patient of daniel clays except she went the same way he did lucy merrick that was her name she disappeared reported missing two days after clay but it looks like she was gone for longer than that her foster parents were animals told the social workers she was always running away and theyd just gotten tired of chasing her ass down from what they could recall theyd last seen her four or five days earlier she was fourteen i dont doubt she was a handful but you know she was still a kid there was talk of pressing charges against the foster parents but nothing ever happened and where was merrick when all this was going on in jail let me tell you frank merrick is an interesting guy he loosened his tie order me another beer he said better get something for yourself too its that kind of story frank merrick was a killer that word had become so devalued through overuse that every mean little kid with a knife who overstepped the line and gutted a drinking buddy in a bar fight over some girl in a tootight dress every jobless nohoper who ever held up a liquor store then shot the guy earning seven bucks an hour behind the counter whether through panic or boredom or just because he had a gun in his hand and it seemed a shame not to see what it could do every one of them received the title of killer it was used in the newspapers to drive up sales in the courtrooms to drive up sentences on cell blocks to make reputations and buy some breathing space from assaults and challenges but it didnt mean anything not really killing someone didnt make you a killer not in the world through which frank merrick walked it wasnt something you did once either by accident or design it wasnt even a lifestyle choice like vegetarianism or nihilism it was something that lay in your cells waiting for a moment of awakening of revelation in that way it was possible to be a killer even before you took your first life it was part of your nature and it would show itself in time all that it took was a catalyst frank merrick had lived what seemed to be a regular guys life for the first twentyfive years or so hed grown up in a rough part of charlotte north carolina and hed run with a tough crowd but he straightened himself out he trained as a mechanic and no clouds followed him through life and no shadows trailed in his wake although it was said that he stayed in touch with elements from his past and that he was a man who could be relied upon to supply or dispose of a car at short notice it was only later when his true self his secret self began to emerge that people remembered men who had crossed frank merrick and fallen between the cracks in the sidewalk never to be seen or heard from again there were stories of calls made of trips to florida and the carolinas of guns used once then disassembled and thrown into canals and levees but they were just stories and people will talk he married an ordinary girl and he might have stayed married to her had it not been for the accident that changed frank merrick beyond all recognition or perhaps it merely allowed him to shed the veneer of a quiet introverted man who was good with his hands and knew his way around a car and to become something altogether odder and more frightening frank merrick was struck by a motorcycle one night as he crossed a street in the suburb of charlotte where he lived he was carrying a carton of ice cream that he had bought for his wife he should have waited for the signal but he was worried that the ice cream would melt before he could get it home the motorcyclist who was not wearing a helmet had been drinking but he was not drunk he had also been smoking a little dope but he was not high peter cash had told himself both of those things before he climbed on his bike after leaving his buddies watching porn on the betamax to cash it seemed as if frank merrick had materialized out of thin air suddenly assuming form on the empty street assembling himself out of atoms of night the bike hit merrick full on breaking bones and rending flesh the impact catapulting the motorcyclist onto the hood of a parked car cash was lucky to escape with a busted pelvis and had he hit the windshield of the car with his unprotected head instead of his ass he would most assuredly have died there and then instead he remained conscious for long enough to see merrick s mangled body jerking like a stranded fish on the road merrick was released from hospital after two months when his broken bones had healed sufficiently and his internal organs were no longer deemed to be in imminent danger of failure or collapse he scarcely spoke to his wife and spoke even less to his friends until those friends finally ceased to trouble him with their presence he slept little and rarely ventured into the marital bed but when he did he fell upon his wife with such ferocity that she grew to fear his advances and the pain that came with them eventually she fled the house and after a year or two filed for divorce merrick signed everything without comment or complaint seemingly content to shed every aspect of his old life something within him cocooning itself while it transformed his wife later changed her name and remarried in california and never told her new husband the truth about the man who had once shared her life and merrick well it was believed that cash was the first victim of the transformed man although no evidence was ever produced linking him to the crime the motorcyclist was stabbed to death in his bed but merrick had an alibi supplied by some men out of philly who it was said obtained services from merrick in return in the years that followed he picked up a little work with various crews mainly on the east coast and gradually became the goto guy when someone needed to be taught a last fateful lesson and when the necessity of deniability meant that the job had to be farmed out the tally of bodies that had fallen at his hands began to mount he had embraced at last his natural aptitude for killing and it served him well in the meantime he had other appetites he liked women and one of them a waitress in pittsfield maine found herself pregnant after a night in his company she was in her late thirties and had despaired of ever finding a man or of having a child of her own she never even considered an abortion but had no way of contacting the man who had impregnated her and eventually she gave birth to a seemingly ordinary child when frank merrick returned to maine and looked the waitress up she feared how he might respond to the news that he was a father but he had held the child in his arms and asked her name lucy after my mom he was told and he had smiled and told her that lucy was a fine name and he had left money in the childs cradle thereafter on a regular basis cash would arrive sometimes delivered in person by merrick at other times arriving in the form of a money order the childs mother recognized that there was something dangerous about this man something that should remain unexplored and it always surprised her to see the devotion he showed toward the little girl although he never stayed long with her his daughter grew into child who sometimes had bad dreams and nothing worse than that but the little girls dreams began to filter into her waking life she became difficult even disturbed she hurt herself and she tried to hurt others when her mother dieda massive pulmonary embolism took her as she swam in the sea so that her body was taken out by the tide and found days later bloated and halfeaten by scavengers by a pair of fishermenlucy merrick was put into care in time the child was sent to daniel clay in an effort to curb her aggression and tendency toward selfharm and he seemed to be making some progress with her until both he and the girl disappeared by then her father had been in jail for four years his luck ran out when he picked up five years for reckless conduct with a dangerous weapon five years for criminal threatening with the use of a dangerous weapon and ten years for aggravated assault all to be served concurrently after one of his prospective victims managed to shoot his way out of his home as merrick was closing in on him with a knife only for the vic to be hit by a patrol car as he was fleeing merrick only avoided a further fortytolife after the state failed to prove premeditationinfact and because he had no previous convictions for crimes using deadly force against the person it was during this period that his daughter disappeared the sentence wasnt all served in the general population either a chunk of it according to orourke was spent in supermax and that was real hard time right there after his release he was sent for trial in virginia for the killing of an accountant named barton riddick who was shot once in the head with a in merrick was charged on the basis of bullet lead analysis by the fbi of rounds found in his car following his arrest in maine there was nothing to indicate that he had been at the scene of the killing in virginia or to link him physically to riddick in any other way but the chemical composition of the bullet that had passed through the victim taking a chunk of skull and brain with it as it exited matched bullets from the box of ammunition discovered in merricks trunk merrick was facing the possibility of spending the rest of his life in prison maybe even a death sentence but his case was one of a number taken up by some law firms that believed the bureaus examiners had overstated the bullet lead analysis test results in a number of instances the case against merrick had been further weakened when the gun used in the killing was subsequently used in the murder of a lawyer in baton rouge reluctantly the prosecutor in virginia decided not to follow through on the charges against merrick and the fbi had since announced that it was abandoning bullet lead analysis he had been released in october and was now to all intents and purposes a free man as he had served his sentence in full in the state of maine and no conditions had been applied to his release on the assumption that the riddick charges would ensure he would never taste the air as a free man again and now hes back here concluded orourke asking after the doctor who was treating his daughter i said sounds like a man with a grudge what are you going to do i took out my wallet and laid some bills on the table to cover our tab im going to have him picked up will the clay woman press charges ill talk to her about it even if she doesnt the threat of imprisonment might be enough to keep merrick off her back he wont want to go back to jail who knows the cops may even turn up something in his car has he threatened her at all only verbally and just in the vaguest of ways he broke her window though so hes capable of more any sign of a weapon none franks the kind of guy who might feel a little naked without a gun when i met him he told me he wasnt armed you believed him i think hes too smart to carry a gun with him as a convicted felon he cant be found in possession and hes already attracting a lot of attention to himself he cant find out what happened to his daughter if hes locked up again well it sounds plausible but i wouldnt want to bet my life on it the clay woman still live in the city south portland i can make some calls if you want me to every little bit helps it would be good if we could have a temporary order in place by the time merrick is picked up orourke said that he didnt think it would be a problem i had almost forgotten about jim poole i asked orourke about him i remember something about it he was an amateur a correspondencecollege private eye liked using a little weed i think cops down in boston figured there might have been a drug connection to his death and i guess people up here were happy enough to go along with that he was working for rebecca clay when he disappeared i said i didnt know that it wasnt my case sounds like she might be unlucky to be around she vanishes more people than the magic circle i dont imagine lucky people attract the interest of men like frank merrick if they do they dont stay lucky for long id like to be there when they bring him in ive heard a lot about him but ive never met him facetoface his beer glass had left a circle of moisture on the table he traced patterns in it with his index finger what are you thinking i asked im thinking its a shame you have a client who believes shes at risk why i dont like clusters some of clays patients were being abused merrick s daughter was one of his patients hence merrick s daughter was being abused its possible but it doesnt necessarily follow then clay disappears and so does she and the abusers are never found he shrugged im just saying having a man like merrick asking questions about old crimes might make some people worried like the people who committed those old crimes exactly could be useful you never know who might decide to take offense and make themselves known along the way the problem is that merrick isnt like a dog on a leash he cant be controlled ive got three men looking out for my client as things stand my priority is to keep her safe orourke stood well talk to her explain what you intend to do then lets get him picked up and see what happens we shook hands again and i thanked him for his help dont get carried away he said im in this because of the kids and hey forgive me for being blunt but if this thing goes up in smoke and i find you lit the fuse ill arrest you myself it was time for me to drive out to joel harmons house along the way i called rebecca and shared with her most of what orourke had told me of merrick and what i was hoping to do the next day she seemed to have calmed down a little since we last talked although she was still intent on wrapping up our business with each other as soon as possible well arrange a meeting then have him picked up by the cops i said the states protectionfromharassment law says that if youve been intimidated or confronted three or more times by the same person then the cops have to act i figure that incident with the window may also fall under terrorizing and i spotted him watching you that day at longfellow square so we have him for stalking as well either one of those would be enough to bring us under the cover of the law does that mean ill have to go to court she asked make the harassment report first thing tomorrow the report has to be made before a court complaint can be filed anyway then we can go to the district court and get it to issue a temporary order for emergency protection after youve filed the complaint ive already talked to someone about this and everything should be in place for you by tomorrow evening i gave her orourkes name and number a date and time will be set for a hearing and the summons and complaint will have to be served on merrick i can do that or if you prefer we can get the sheriff s department to do it instead if he approaches you again once the order has been served then thats a class d crime with a penalty of up to one year in jail and a maximum fine of a thousand dollars three convictions and hes looking at five years it still doesnt sound like enough she said cant they just put him away immediately its a delicate balance i said hes overstepped the line but not enough to justify serving time the thing is i believe that doing more time is the last thing he wants to risk hes a dangerous man but hes also had years to think about his daughter he failed her but he wants someone else to blame i think hes decided to start with your father because he heard the rumors about him and wonders if something similar might have happened to his own child while she was in his care and because my fathers not around hes moved on to me she sighed okay will i have to be there when they arrest him no the police may want to talk to you later though jackie will stay close to you just in case just in case it doesnt go the way youve planned just in case i repeated not committing to anything i felt that id let her down but i couldnt see what more i could have done true i could have banded together with jackie garner and the fulcis to beat merrick to a pulp but that would have been to descend to his level and now after my conversation with orourke there was one more thing stopping me from using force against frank merrick in a strange way i felt sorry for him chapter xi there were calls made that night perhaps that was what merrick wanted all along that was why he had made his presence at rebecca clays house so obvious that was why he had left his blood on her window and that was why he had set me on jerry legere there were other incidents too that i did not yet know about four dead crows had been strung together and hung outside the offices occupied by rebeccas former lawyer elwin stark the previous night sometime that same night the midlake center had been burglarized nothing was taken but someone must have spent hours going through whatever files were at hand and it would be a long time before it became clear what if anything had been removed from them clays former physician dr caussure had been approached on his way to a bridge tournament by a man fitting merrick s description the man had boxed in caussures car then had rolled down the window of his red ford and asked caussure if he liked birds and if he was aware that his late patient and friend dr daniel clay had consorted with pedophiles and deviants it didnt matter to merrick if these individuals were involved or not he wanted to create a climate of fear and doubt he wanted to slip in and out of lives sowing rumors and halftruths knowing that in a small city like portland word would spread and the men he was hunting would soon be buzzing like bees in the presence of an imminent threat to the hive merrick thought that he had everything under control or that he could deal with whatever arose but he was wrong he was being manipulated just as i was but nobody was really in control not even eldritchs mysterious client and soon people would start to die joel harmon lived in a big house off bayshore drive in falmouth with its own private jetty and a white yacht berthed close by portland used to be called falmouth back from the late seventeenth century when the basque st castin led the natives in a series of attacks against the english settlements that resulted eventually in the burning of the town until the end of the eighteenth century when the city came into its own now the area that bore the old name was one of the portland s most affluent suburbs and the center of its boating activity the portland yacht club one of the oldest in the country was located on falmouth foreside sheltered by the long narrow clapboard island which was itself home to two private estates throwbacks to the late nineteenth century when the railroad magnate henry houston built a tenthousandsquarefoot summer cottage on the island his own small contribution to rendering the word cottage meaningless in this part of the world harmons house stood on a raised promontory from which a green lawn sloped down to the waters edge there were walls on either side for privacy and a lot of rosebushes in carefully regimented and sheltered beds june had told me that harmon was a fanatical rosegrower fascinated by hybridization and that the soil in his garden was constantly monitored and adjusted to facilitate his obsession there were said to be roses in his beds that simply did not exist elsewhere and unlike his peers harmon saw no reason to share his discoveries with others the roses were for his pleasure and his alone it was an unusually mild night a trick of the season to lull the unwary into a false sense of security and as june and i stood in his garden with the other guests sipping predinner drinks i took in harmons house his yacht his roses and his wife who had greeted us as we arrived her husband being occupied elsewhere in the party she was in her early sixties which made her about the same age as her husband her gray hair interwoven with carefully dyed blond strands up close her skin looked like molded plastic she seemed to have trouble stretching it into any semblance of an expression although her surgeon had clearly anticipated this problem and had carved her mouth into a permanent half smile so that someone could have been telling her about the systematic drowning of puppies and kittens and she would merely have looked slightly amused at the whole affair there was a relic of the beauty that she might once have had still visible in her face but it had been debased by her grim determination to hold on to it her eyes were dull and glassy and her conversational skills would have made a passing child seem like oscar wilde her husband by contrast was the model of a perfect host dressed casually but expensively in a blue wool blazer and gray trousers with a red cravat to add a touch of carefully cultivated eccentricity to the whole look he was shadowed as he shook hands and exchanged gossip by a beautiful asianamerican girl young and slim with the kind of figure that caused male jaws spontaneously to unhinge according to june she was harmons latest squeeze although officially she was his personal assistant he had a habit of picking up young women dazzling them with his wealth then dropping them as soon as a new prospect appeared on the horizon doesnt look like his wife objects to her presence too much i said then again it doesnt look like shes aware of anything beyond the promise of her next fix of prescription medication mrs harmons empty gaze swept across the guests at regular intervals never resting on any of them but merely bathing them in the dull light of her regard like the beam of a lighthouse picking out the ships in its ambit even when she had greeted us at the door her hand like the cold desiccated remains of a longdead bird in my palm she had barely made eye contact i feel sorry for her said june lawrie was always one of those women who was destined to marry a powerful man and provide him with children but she had no inner life or none that anyone could detect now her children are all grownup and she fills her days as best she can she was beautiful once but beauty was all she had now she sits motionless on the boards of various charities and spends her husbands money and he doesnt object as long as she doesnt interfere with the way he lives his life i felt that i had harmon down to a t a selfindulgent man with money enough to enable him to pursue his appetites and to sate them even as his needs grew greater with each bite that he took he came from a politically wellconnected family and his father had been an adviser to the democrats although the failure of a number of his businesses had left enough of a whiff of scandal on him that he never managed to get close enough to the bowl to feed with the big dogs harmon himself had been very politically active once working on ed muskies campaign as a young man in even traveling with him on his visit to moscow thanks to his fathers efforts until it became clear that not only was muskie not going to win the nomination but it was probably a good thing that mcgovern was going to clean his clock in the primaries muskie couldnt keep his temper he railed at journalists and staffers and he did it in public had he won the nomination it wouldnt have been long before that side of him was revealed to the voters so joel harmon and his family had quickly and quietly ditched muskie and any political idealism that he might have had was left by the wayside as he moved on to the pressing business of accumulating wealth and making up for his fathers business failings but according to june harmon was much more complex than he appeared he gave generously to charity not only publicly but privately his views on welfare and social security made him almost a socialist by most american standards and he remained a powerful if discreet voice in that regard enjoying the ear of successive governors and state representatives he was passionate about the city and state in which he lived and it was said that his children were mildly disturbed by the ease with which he was dissipating what they considered to be their inheritance their social conscience being considerably less well developed than their fathers i wanted to keep my head clear so i sipped orange juice while the other guests drank champagne i recognized one or two of those whom harmon had invited there was a writer named jon lee jacobs who penned novels about lobstermen and the call of the sea he had a big red beard and dressed like the men in his books except he came originally from a family of accountants in cambridge massachusetts and was rumored to get seasick when he stepped in a puddle the other familiar face was dr byron russell a young shrink who made occasional appearances on maine public radio and on local tv channels whenever a serious talking head was needed on matters relating to mental health to russells credit he tended to be the voice of reason whenever he participated often at the expense of some treaclevoiced woman with a bum degree in psychology from a college that operated out of a trailer and who believed in the kind of touchyfeely platitudes that made depression and suicide seem like attractive alternatives to actually listening to her also present interestingly was elwin stark the lawyer who had been so reluctant to speak to me earlier that week i felt like telling him about eldritch who had talked to me for a lot longer albeit without actually telling me a great deal more than id learned from a fraction of the time spent speaking with stark but initially stark didnt seem any happier to meet me in person than he had been to talk with me on the phone nevertheless he eventually managed to be civil for a couple of minutes he even apologized in a way for his earlier brusqueness i could smell whiskey on his breath even though he had champagne in his glass clearly he had started earlier than the rest of the guests i was having a hell of a day when you called he said the timing wasnt great my timing is often bad i said and timing is everything you got it you still nosing around in the clay business i told him that i was he made a face as though someone had just offered him a piece of bad fish it was then that he told me about the dead crows freaked my secretary the hell out he said she thought it was the work of satanists and what about you well it was different ill give it that worst that ever happened to me before was a golf club being put through the windshield of my lexus any idea who was responsible i can guess who you think was responsible the same guy whos been giving rebecca clay a hard time i knew you were bad luck the minute i heard your voice he tried to laugh it off but it was clear that he meant it why would he target you because hes desperate and my name was all over the documentation relating to her father i passed on dealing with the probate though someone else is looking after that are you concerned no im not ive done my share of swimming with sharks and ive lived ive got people i can call on if i have to rebecca on the other hand only has people for as long as she can afford to pay them you ought to let the whole business go parker youre just making things worse by stirring up the dirt at the bottom of the pond youre not interested in the truth im a lawyer he replied what has the truth got to do with anything my concern is the protection of my clients interests sometimes the truth just gets in the way thats a very um pragmatic approach im a realist i dont do criminal work but if i had to defend you on a charge of murder and you decided to plead not guilty what would you expect me to do tell the judge that all things considered i thought that youd done it because that was the truth be serious the law doesnt require truth only the appearance of it most cases simply rest on a version of it thats acceptable to both sides you want to know what the only truth is everybody lies thats it thats truth you can take that to the preacher and get it baptized so do you have a client whose interests youre protecting in the matter of daniel clay he wagged his finger at me i didnt like the gesture just like i didnt care much for him calling me by my last name youre a piece of work he said daniel was my client so too briefly was his daughter now daniel is dead its done and dusted let him rest wherever he is he left us to go over and speak with the writer jacobs june imitated starks finger wag he is right she said you really are a piece of work do you have any conversations that end happily only with you i replied thats because i dont listen to you there is that i conceded as a waiter rang a bell summoning us to dinner it seemed like there were to be twelve of us all told including harmon and his wife the additional numbers being made up by a female collage artist of whom even june had never heard and three banker friends of harmons from way back harmon spoke to us properly for the first time as we were walking to the dining room apologizing for taking so long to get to us well june he said i had despaired of ever seeing you again at one of my little evenings i was worried that i might have offended you somehow june waved him away with a smile i know you far too well ever to be offended by anything but your occasional lapses in taste she said she stepped aside so that harmon and i could shake hands he had it down to a fine art he could have given lessons in the proper duration the force of the grip the width of the smile that accompanied it mr parker ive heard a great deal about you you lead an interesting life its not as productive as yours you have a beautiful house and a fascinating collection the walls were decorated with an incredible variety of art the positioning of each clearly the subject of considerable thought so that paintings and drawings appeared both to complement and echo one another even occasionally clashing where their juxtaposition would have a particular impact on the beholder on the wall to the right of where we stood a beautiful if slightly sinister nude of a young woman on a bed hung across from a much older painting of an aged man on the point of expiring on a very similar bed his final moments witnessed by a physician and a gathering of relatives and friends some bereft some pitying and some merely avaricious among them was a young woman whose face startlingly resembled the features of the nude opposite similar beds similar women seemingly separated by centuries but now part of the same narrative due to the proximity of the two images harmon beamed appreciatively if you would enjoy it ill happily show you around after dinner one of the benefits of having somewhat eclectic taste whatever junes opinion of the direction it may sometimes take is that there is usually something to satisfy everyone within its limits i should be most interested to see what catches your eye mr parker most interested indeed now come dinner is about to be served we took our seats at the dinner table i was between harmons girlfriend whose name was nyoko and the collage artist the artist had green streaks through her blond hair and was attractive in a willowy vaguely disturbing way she looked like the kind of girl who had wristslashing potential and not just her own wrists either she told me her name was summer summer i said really she scowled i had barely sat down and already someone was unhappy its my true name she said my given name was an imposition discarding it in favor of my real identity freed me to pursue my art uhhuh i said flake nyoko was a little more in touch with objective reality she was an art history graduate and had only recently returned to maine after two years spent working in australia when i asked her how long she had known harmon she had the selfawareness to blush slightly we met at a gallery opening a few months back and i know what youre thinking do you well i know what id be thinking if our positions were reversed you mean if i was seeing mr harmon hes not really my type she giggled you know what i mean hes older than i am hes married sort of hes wealthy and i drive a car that probably cost less than the brandy joel will have decanted after dinner but i like him hes funny hes got good taste and hes lived a little i let people think what they want even his wife youre pretty blunt arent you well im sitting beside you if his wife starts throwing knives around after her second glass of wine id like to be sure that theyre aimed at you not me she doesnt care what joel does im not even sure that she notices as if on cue lawrie harmon glanced in our direction and managed to eke an extra quarter of an inch out of her smile her husband who was sitting at the head of the table patted her left hand reflexively the way he might have petted a dog but for a moment i thought some of the dullness disappeared from her eyes and something lanced through the fog like a camera lens fixing on the perfect moment of clarity before an exposure for the first time that night her gaze lingered but only on nyoko then the smile leveled out slightly and her attention moved on nyoko hadnt noticed distracted as she was by something summer had said to her although i wondered if she would even have registered the change had she been watching harmon nodded to one of the waiters who stood like white compass points in a circle around us and dishes began to appear before us with quiet efficiency there were still two empty chairs at the end of the table are we missing someone joel asked jacobs he had a reputation as someone who given half a chance would declaim endlessly about his own status as a visionary someone who was in touch with nature and the grandeur of the ordinary man clearly hed sized up the rest of us and figured that we were going to be no competition but he didnt want some unknown quantity arriving and upstaging him his beard twitched as though something living within it had briefly shifted position then he was distracted by the arrival of his duck terrine and commenced eating instead of wondering harmon looked at the chairs as if noticing them for the first time our children he said we had hoped that they might join us but you know how kids are theres a party down at the yacht club no offense meant to anyone here but i think they decided that it provided more opportunities for mischief than a dinner with the folks and their guests now please eat it came a little late for jacobs who was already halfway through to his credit he paused awkwardly then did a little shrug and continued working on the terrine the food was good although terrine of anything tended to leave me unimpressed the main course of venison was fine though served as a navarin with juniper berries there was a mousse of chocolate and lime for dessert and coffee with petits fours to finish the wine was a duhardmilon which harmon described as costaud or powerfully built from one of the lesser lafitte properties jacobs nodded sagely like he understood what harmon was talking about i sipped at my glass to be polite it tasted a little rich for my blood in every sense the conversation moved from local politics to art and inevitably to literature the latter largely a result of jacobss intervention at which point he began to preen as he waited for someone to inquire about his latest magnum opus nobody seemed very keen to open the floodgates but in the end harmon asked apparently more out of a sense of duty than any real interest judging from the summary that followed jacobs had not yet tired of mythologizing the common man even if he had yet to get around to either understanding him or liking him that man june whispered as the plates were cleared and the guests began to move through a pair of double doors into a room furnished with comfortable chairs and couches is the most insufferable bore someone gave me one of his books once i replied did you read it started it then figured id want the time back on my deathbed and i wouldnt get it i managed to lose the book instead i think i dropped it in the sea a wise decision harmon appeared at my elbow how about that tour mr parker june will you accompany us june demurred well only start fighting joel ill let your new guest enjoy your collection without being bothered by my prejudices he bowed to her then turned back to me can i offer you another drink mr parker i lifted my halffinished wine im good thank you well lets proceed then we moved from room to room harmon pointing out pieces of which he was particularly proud i didnt recognize many of the names but that was probably due more to my ignorance than anything else i couldnt say that much of harmons collection was to my taste though and i could almost hear junes expressions of dismay at some of the more outlandish additions i hear you have a number of pieces by daniel clay i said as we gazed at something that might have been a sunset or a suture harmon grinned june told me that you might ask after them he said i have two in a back office some of the others are in storage i have a revolving collection you might say too many pieces and too little space even in a house this size did you know him well we were at college together and we kept in touch after graduation he was a guest here on many occasions i liked him a lot he was a sensitive man what happened was just terrible both for him and for the children involved he led me to a room at the back of the house with high recessed windows looking out over the sea it was a combination of office and small library with floortoceiling oak shelves and an enormous matching desk harmon told me that nyoko used it on the days when she was working in the house there were only two paintings on the walls one perhaps two feet by five feet the other much smaller the latter depicted a church steeple set against a backdrop of receding pines it was hazy the edges dulled as though the whole scene was being filtered through a vaselinesmeared lens the larger painting showed the bodies of men and women writhing together so that the canvas was a mass of twisting shadowy flesh it was startlingly unpleasant more so because of the degree of artistry that had gone into its creation i think i prefer the landscape i said most people do the landscape is a later work perhaps created two decades after the other both are untitled but the larger canvas is typical of daniels earlier work i turned my attention back to the landscape there was something almost familiar about the shape of the steeple is this a real place i asked its gilead said harmon as in the children of gilead harmon nodded another of the dark spots on our states history thats why i keep it back here i suppose i hold on to it more out of tribute to daniels memory and the fact that he gave it to me than anything else but its not something id want displayed in the more public areas of the house the community of gilead named after one of the biblical cities of refuge had been founded in the fifties by a minor timber baron named bennett lumley lumley was a godfearing man and he worried about the spiritual wellbeing of the men who worked in the forests below the canadian border he thought that if he could establish a town in which they and their families could live a town without the distraction of booze and whores then he could keep them on the straight and narrow he instituted a building program the most conspicuous element of which was a massive stone church designed to act as the centerpiece of the settlement a symbol of its citizens devotion to the lord gradually the houses lumley had built began to fill with timber workers and their families some of whom were probably genuinely committed to a community based on christian principles unfortunately not all of them felt the same way rumors began to emerge about gilead and about some of the things that went on there in the dark of night but those were different times and there was little that the police could do especially as lumley hampered any investigations anxious to preserve the façade of his ideal community then in a hunter tracking deer through the woods near gilead came across a shallow grave that had been partially disturbed by animals the corpse of a newborn child was revealed a boy barely a day old when he died he had been stabbed repeatedly with it was later surmised a knitting needle two other similar graves were later found nearby each holding a small corpse one male and one female this time the police arrived in force questions were asked gentle and notsogentle interrogations took place but a number of the adults who had been living at the settlement had already fled by that stage three girls one aged fourteen and two aged fifteen were examined by doctors and found to have given birth to children in the previous twelve months lumley was forced to act meetings were convened and influential men spoke to one another in the corners of clubs quietly and without fuss gilead was abandoned and the buildings were either destroyed or began to fall into decay all but the great unfinished church which was gradually colonized by the forest its steeple turning to a pillar of green beneath layers of twisting ivy only one person was jailed in connection with what had occurred a man named mason dubus who was regarded as the senior figure in the community he served time for child abduction and sex with a minor after one of the girls who had given birth told police she had been a virtual prisoner of dubus and his wife for seven years having been taken from near her family home in west virgina while out picking berries dubuss wife escaped jail by claiming that she had been coerced into all that had occurred by her husband and it was her evidence that helped to secure his conviction she declined or was unable to tell the police anything more of what had taken place at gilead but it was clear from the testimony of some of the children both male and female that they had been subjected to continuous and sustained abuse both before and during the establishment of the gilead settlement it was as harmon had said a dark chapter in the states history did clay create many paintings like this one i asked clay didnt create many paintings period replied harmon but of those that ive seen a number certainly contain images of gilead gilead had been situated just outside jackman and jackman was where clays car had been found abandoned i reminded harmon of that fact i think gilead was certainly an interest of daniels he said cautiously an interest or more than that do you mean was daniel obsessed by gilead i dont think so but given the nature of his own work its hardly surprising that he was curious about its history he interviewed dubus you know he told me about it daniel had an idea for a project concerning gilead i think a project yes a book about gilead was that the term he used project harmon thought for a moment i couldnt say for sure but it might have been he finished the last of his brandy and set the glass down on his desk im afraid im neglecting my other guests we should return to the fray he opened the door allowed me to pass then closed and locked it behind us what do you think happened to daniel clay i asked him the buzz of conversation from the other guests growing louder as we drew nearer to the room in which they were gathered harmon stopped at the door i dont know he said i can tell you this though daniel wasnt the kind of man to commit suicide he might have blamed himself for what happened to those children but he wouldnt have killed himself over it yet if he was still alive i believe he would have made contact with someone in the years since his disappearance either with me or his daughter or one of his colleagues he hasnt though not once then you think hes dead i believe he was killed harmon corrected me i just have no idea why chapter xii the party if that was the right word for it broke up shortly after ten i spent most of the time in the company of june summer and nyoko trying to sound like i knew a little about art and failing and considerably less time with jacobs and two of the bankers trying to sound like i knew a little about finance and failing there too jacobs the peoples writer was very knowledgeable about highrisk bonds and currency speculation for someone who claimed to have the common touch his hypocrisy was so blatant as to be almost admirable in a way slowly the guests began to drift toward their cars harmon stood on his porch despite the fact that it had grown suddenly colder and thanked each of us for coming his wife had disappeared after wishing us a polite good night nyoko was excluded from her farewells and once again i was aware that despite appearances lawrie harmon was not quite as disengaged from the real world as the young asianamerican believed when it came to my turn to leave harmon placed his left hand upon my upper arm as his right hand gripped mine you tell rebecca that if theres anything i can do for her she just has to let me know he said there are a lot of people who would like to find out what happened to daniel his face darkened and his voice dropped in volume and not just his friends he added i waited for him to continue he had a taste for the enigmatic at the end before he disappeared daniel changed harmon went on it wasnt just his troubles the muller case the revelations of abuse there was something else he was certainly preoccupied the last time i saw him perhaps it was research but what sort of research could have left him shaken in that way when did you last see him a week or so before he went missing and he gave you no indication of what was bothering him his known difficulties apart none it was just an impression that i got why didnt you tell me this back in your office harmon shot me a look that told me he wasnt used to his decisions being questioned im a careful man mr parker i play chess and im pretty good at it its probably why i was a good businessman too ive learned that it pays to take a little time to think before making a move back in the office part of me wanted nothing more to do with daniel clay he was my friend but after what happened after the rumors and the whispered allegations i felt that it was best to distance myself from him but now youve changed your mind no i havent part of me suspects that no good can come of your nosing around in this but if it uncovers the truth about daniel and lays the suspicions to rest and gives his daughter some peace of mind along the way then it could be that youll prove me wrong he released his grip upon my hand and my arm it seemed that we were done harmon was watching the writers car pull out of its parking slot on the driveway it was an old dodge truckit was said that he drove a mercedes back in massachusetts where he kept an apartment near harvardand jacobs maneuvered it like it was a panzer tank harmon shook his head in baffled amusement you mentioned some others who might be interested in what happened to clay people apart from his friends or acquaintances harmon didnt look at me yes its not hard to figure out there are people who believe that daniel colluded in the abuse of children i have two children i know what i would do to anyone who harmed them or anyone who allowed others to do so and what would that be mr harmon he tore himself away from jacobss increasingly frantic attempts to make a turn unaided by power steering id kill him he said and there was something in the way he said it something so matteroffact that i didnt doubt him not for one moment i knew then that for all of his bonhomie all of his fine wines and his pretty pictures joel harmon was a man who would not hesitate to crush those who crossed him and i wondered for a moment if daniel clay might not have been such a person and if joel harmons interest in him was not entirely benign before i had a chance to follow that train of thought any further nyoko came over and whispered something in harmons ear are you sure harmon said she nodded harmon immediately called to those who had reached their cars to stop russell the shrink patted the hood of jacobss truck indicating that he should cut the engine jacobs looked almost relieved to do so it seems that there is an intruder in the grounds he said it might be best if you all stepped into the house for a moment just to be safe everyone did as harmon asked albeit with some grumbling from jacobs who clearly felt a poem coming on and was anxious to commit it to paper before it was lost to posterity that or he was trying to hide his embarrassment at screwing up a simple turn we all shuffled back into the library jacobs and summer went to one of the windows and looked out on the expanse of neatly mown lawn at the back of the house i cant see anyone said jacobs maybe we should stay away from the windows said summer hes an intruder not a sniper said russell summer didnt seem convinced jacobs placed a reassuring arm around her shoulders and let it linger there she didnt object what was it with poets i wondered it seemed that there was a certain type of woman who just buckled at the suggestion of an internal rhyme harmons driver housekeeper and maid all lived in quarters adjoining the main house the waiters who were huddled together like startled doves had been hired for the evening and the cook lived in portland and commuted to the house each day the driver whose name was todd joined us in the hallway he was dressed casually in jeans and a shirt he wore a leather jacket over the shirt and was carrying a gun it was a smith ampwesson ninemillimeter in a glitzy finish but he held it in a way that suggested he knew how to use it mind if i tag along i asked harmon i dont mind at all he said its probably nothing but best to be sure we walked through to the kitchen where the cook and the maid were standing by a sink staring out at the grounds through the little window above it what is all this about asked harmon maria saw someone said the cook she was an attractive older woman her dark hair tied back and covered with a white cap her body lean and athletic the maid was mexican and also slim and goodlooking joel harmon clearly allowed aesthetics to influence his hiring procedures maria pointed over by the trees at the east wall she said a man i think she looked even more frightened than summer her hands were shaking did you see anyone harmon asked the cook no i was working maria called me over to the window he could have taken off before i got there if there was someone out there then hed have set off the motion sensors harmon said he turned back to maria did the lights come on she shook her head lot of shadow back there said todd you sure you werent mistaken no mistake she said i see him todd gave harmon a look that was more resigned than concerned were not going to find out anything in here i said bring up all of the lights harmon told todd todd went to a box of switches on the kitchen wall and flicked a line of them instantly the grounds were illuminated todd led the way out i followed picking up a flashlight from a rack on the wall along the way harmon hung back after all he didnt have a gun regrettably i didnt have a gun either it seemed rude to bring one to a strangers dinner party the lights took out most of the shadows in the garden but there were still patches of dark under the trees by the walls i used the flashlight to probe them but there was nothing there the ground was soft but there was no sign of footprints the surrounding wall was eight or nine feet high and covered in ivy anyone climbing the wall would have damaged the ivy but it appeared to be intact we made a cursory search of the rest of the grounds but it was obvious that todd believed maria had been mistaken shes kinda jittery at the best of times he said as we walked back to where harmon waited for us everything is jesus and madre de dios shes a looker though ill give her that but you got a better chance of getting laid by a busload of nuns harmon raised his hands in a whats happening gesture nada said todd not a sign a lot of fuss over nothing said harmon he headed back into the kitchen shot maria a disapproving glance then went to release his guests todd followed i stayed behind maria was putting plates into a big dishwasher her chin was trembling slightly can you tell me what you saw i said she shrugged maybe mr harmon is right maybe i no see she said although i could tell from the expression on her face that she didnt believe her own words try me i said she stopped what she was doing a tear caught in her eyelash and she brushed it away it was a man he dress in clothes brown i think muy sucio his face white pálido sí pale sí pale also now she looked frightened again she touched her hands to her face and mouth here and here nada nothing empty hueco hueco i dont understand maria glanced over my shoulder i turned to find the cook watching us della said maria ayúdame a explicarle lo que quiere decir hueco you speak spanish i asked her some she said so any idea what hueco might mean uh im not sure i can try to find out della exchanged some words with maria who made gestures and signs to help her along eventually she picked up a decorated ostrich egg that was used to hold pens and tapped her fingers lightly on the shell hueco said maria and the cooks face briefly brightened before she too looked troubled as though she had somehow misunderstood what was being said hueco means hollow she said maria says he was a hollow man back in the hallway june was waiting for me harmon hovered nearby seemingly anxious to be rid of us all todd was on the phone in the hall i heard him thank someone before he hung up he clearly wanted to tell harmon something but wasnt sure if he should wait until we were gone i decided to nudge him anything wrong he glanced at harmon for permission to speak in the company of others well said his boss what did they say i called the falmouth pd said todd directing the explanation to me as well as his employer just seemed like it was worth checking to see if theyd spotted anything out of the ordinary they usually keep a close eye on the houses along here by that i presumed that he meant they kept a close eye on joel harmons house he could have bought and sold most of his neighbors ten times over someone reported a car cruising the area maybe even parked for a while over by the eastern wall of the property and got suspicious by the time the cops came the car was gone but could be that it was connected to what maria saw they get a make a number i asked him todd shook his head just a mediumsized red car he said harmon must have seen something in my face does that ring a bell with you he asked maybe i said frank merrick the man who was bothering rebecca clay drives a red car if i found the connection between you and clay then so could he friendship harmon corrected me not connection daniel clay was my friend and if this man merrick wants to talk to me about him then ill tell him just what i told you i walked to the door and looked out at the pebbled driveway illuminated by the lights of the house and the lamps that stood along the verge it was merrick it had to be but merrick s description did not match that given by maria of the man whom she had glimpsed in the garden merrick had come here but he had not been alone hollow id be careful for the next few days mr harmon i said if you go out keep todd with you id have your security system checked too all because of this one man asked harmon he sounded slightly incredulous hes dangerous and he may not be just one man as you said yourself better to be safe with that june and i left i drove the electronic gates opening silently before us as we left the harmon house behind my said june you do lead an interesting life i looked at her you think that was my doing you told joel that the man in the car might have made the same connection that you didor rather that i made for youbut there is another possibility there was only the slightest hint of a rebuke in her voice i didnt need her to tell me why i had figured it out for myself even though i was reluctant to say it aloud in front of harmon and had instead forced it back like bile in my throat just as i had tracked merrick so too perhaps merrick was tracking me and i had led him straight to joel harmon but i was also troubled by the appearance of the man in harmons garden it appeared that merrick s inquiries about daniel clay had drawn something else a manno men i corrected myself remembering a feeling like foul breezes separating before me and letters scrawled in dust by a childlike handshadowing his movements was he aware of them or was their presence something to do with eldritchs client yet it was hard to see halfglimpsed men climbing the rickety stairs to an ancient lawyers office or dealing with the harridan who guarded the gateway to the upper levels of eldritchs business what had seemed at first like a simple case of stalking had become infinitely stranger and more complex and i was glad that angel and louis would soon be with me merricks deadline was about to expire and while i had set in motion a plan for dealing with him i was aware that he was in a sense the least of my worries merrick i could deal with he was dangerous but he was a known quantity the hollow men were not chapter xiii early the next morning i was standing by the portland public markets parking lot the temperature had plummeted overnight and the weathermen were saying that it was likely to stay that way for the foreseeable future which in maine terms meant that it might begin to improve sometime around april it was a damp cold the kind that left clothing moist to the touch and the windows of coffee shops diners even passing cars were steamed up as the heat caused the moisture to evaporate lending an uncomfortably claustrophobic atmosphere to anywhere but the least crowded of places while most people had the option of seeking shelter indoors there were some who were not so fortunate already a queue had formed outside the preble street resource center where the citys poorest gathered each day to be served breakfast by volunteers some would be hoping to take a shower or do their laundry while they were there or to pick up some fresh clothing and use a telephone the working poor who couldnt make it back for midday would be served a bag lunch so they wouldnt go hungry later in this way the center and its partners the wayside and saint lukes soup kitchens served over three hundred thousand meals every year to those who might otherwise have starved or have been forced to redirect money from rent or essential medicines just to keep body and soul together i watched them from where i stood the line made up mostly of men a few of them obviously veterans of the street their layers of clothing filthy their hair unkempt while others were still a couple of steps away from homelessness some of the women scattered among them were hardfaced and large their features distorted by alcohol and difficult lives their bodies swollen by cheap fatty foods and cheaper booze it was also possible to pick out the new arrivals the ones who had yet to grow accustomed to supporting themselves and their families with handouts they did not talk or mix with the rest and kept their heads down or faced the wall fearful of making eye contact with those around them like new prisoners on a cell block perhaps too they were afraid to look up and lock eyes with a friend or neighbor maybe even an employer who might decide that it wasnt good for business to give work to someone who had to beg for breakfast nearly all of those in the line were in their thirties or older it gave a false impression of the nature of the poor in a city where one in five of those under the age of eighteen lived below the poverty line nearby were the salvation armys adult rehabilitation center the midtown community policing center and the citys department of probation and parole this area was a narrow channel through which most of those with a history of legal problems inevitably flowed so i stood drinking a coffee from the market to keep me warm and waited to see if a familiar face might appear nobody paid me much attention after all it was too cold to worry about anyone but oneself after twenty minutes i saw the man i was looking for his name was abraham shockley but on the street he was known only as mr inbetween or tween for short he was by any definition a career criminal the fact that he wasnt very good at his chosen career hardly mattered to the courts he had been charged in his time with possession of class a drugs with intent to supply theft by deception larceny operating under the influence and night hunting among other offenses tween had been fortunate that violence had never played a part in his crimes so that he had on more than one occasion benefited from the fact that the offense in question fell into the category of wobblers or crimes that were not statutorily defined as either felonies or misdemeanors so that some offenses prosecuted as felonies were later reduced to misdemeanors by the trial court the local cops had also put in a good word for tween when required because tween was everybodys friend he knew people he listened he remembered tween wasnt a snitch he had his own standards of behavior his own principles and he adhered to them as best he could tween wouldnt rat anyone out but he was the man to ask if you wanted a message passed on to someone who was keeping a low profile or if you wanted to find an individual of ill repute for purposes other than putting him behind bars in his turn tween acted as a gobetween for those who were in trouble and wanted to cut a deal with a cop or a parole officer he was a small but useful cog in the machinery of the unofficial justice system the shadow courts in which deals were struck and blind eyes turned so that valuable time could be spent on more pressing matters he saw me as he took his place in the queue i nodded to him then walked slowly down portland street after a few minutes i heard footsteps approaching from behind and tween fell into step beside me he was in his late forties and dressed cleanly if shabbily in yellow sneakers jeans two sweaters and an overcoat with a vent that had split halfway up his back his reddish brown hair was unevenly cut people in tweens position didnt waste their money on barbers he lived rentfree in a oneroom basement off forest avenue thanks to an absentee landlord who relied on tween to keep an eye on his more unruly tenants and to feed the buildings resident cat breakfast i said only if its bintliff s he replied i hear they do a wicked good lobster eggs benedict you do have a taste for the finer things in life i said i was born with a silver spoon in my mouth yeah but you stole it from the kid in the next cradle to their credit nobody in bintliff s gave us a second glance we were seated in a booth upstairs and tween ordered enough food to fill him up for a day at least fruit and oj to begin followed by toast the lobster eggs benedict of which hed heard so much extra home fries then some muffins to finish three of which were squirreled away in the pockets of his overcoat for my buddies as he explained while we ate we spoke about books and local news and just about anything else that came to mind except the reason why i had brought tween here it was the gentlemanly way to conduct business and tween was always a gentleman even when he was trying to steal the sole from somebodys shoe so he said as he finished a fifth coffee you just bring me here to enjoy the pleasure of my company the coffee didnt appear to have made him jittery or at least no more jittery than he had been to begin with if you handed tween a bowl of cream to hold it would turn to butter in the time it took to wind your wristwatch he had so much nervous energy that it was tiring to be in his immediate vicinity for too long not just that i replied id like you to ask around see if you can find anyone who might have known a guy called frank merrick either in thomaston or in supermax he did ten years the final two or three in the max then got released and sent for trial in virginia he anything special hes not the kind of guy youre going to forget easily he had a reputation as a button man rumor or solid im inclined to believe what ive heard where is he now hes here renewing old acquaintances could be if he is id like to know the names ill ask around shouldnt take me too long you got some quarters so i can call you i gave him my business card the change from my pocket and fifty dollars in tens fives and ones so he could buy beer and sandwiches to oil the wheels i knew how tween worked hed helped me in the past when he found someone who could cast some light on merrick as i was sure he would he would hand me back my change and a handful of receipts and only then would he look for payment that was the way tween worked in his official capacity operating by one simple rule you didnt rip off anyone who looked like they might be on your side merrick called me at midday id been checking for signs of him all morning but i didnt see him or his red car if he was smart hed have changed the car but that assumed that eldritch and his client were still prepared to bankroll him id taken all of the precautions i could in case merrick or someone else was keeping an eye on my movements i was satisfied that no one was not that day in addition jackie garner confirmed that all was still quiet where rebecca clay was concerned but merrick was on the phone threatening to shatter that silence times up he said you ever consider that you might get further with honey than vinegar feed a man honey and you get his love feed him vinegar and you get his attention helps if you grab him by the balls too and squeeze him some thats very profound you learn that in jail hope you didnt waste all that time finding out about me else were going to have us a problem i didnt come up with much not on you and not on daniel clay either his daughter doesnt know any more than you do but then she told you that already you just didnt want to listen merrick forced air through his nose in an imitation of amusement well thats unfortunate you tell missy im disappointed in her better yet ill tell her myself wait i didnt say that id found nothing i needed leverage something to draw him in i have a copy of the police file on daniel clay i lied so it mentions your daughter now merrick was silent theres some material in it that i dont understand i dont think the cops did either what is it his voice sounded husky as though something had suddenly caught in his throat i should have felt bad about lying i was playing on merrick s feelings for his missing child there would be consequences when he found out the truth uhuh i said not over the phone so what do you suggest he asked we meet i give you a look at the file ill tell you what ive learned then you go and do what you have to do as long as it doesnt involve rebecca clay i dont trust you i seen those cavemen you got guarding the woman whats to stop you from trying to turn them loose on me i got no problem killing them if it comes down to it but it would kind of hinder my investigations you might say i dont want their blood on my hands either we meet in a public place you read the file and we go our separate ways im warning you though im giving you a break because of your daughter you show up again around rebecca clay and this is all going to step up a notch i guarantee that you wont like what happens then merrick gave a theatrical sigh now that you got the pissing competition out of the way maybe youd like to name a place i told him to meet me at the big bowling center on route i even gave him directions then i started making my calls tween got back to me at three oclock that afternoon ive found someone for you he comes at a price which is a ticket to tonights hockey game and fifty bucks hell meet you there done just leave his ticket for collection with my name on the envelope ill take care of the rest how much do i owe you hundred dollars sound fair it sounds fine i got some change for you too ill give it to you when you pay me has he got a name this guy he has but you can call him bill is he the nervous type he wasnt until i mentioned frank merrick ill see you around candlepin bowling is a new england tradition the balls are smaller and lighter than in tenpin and the pins are thinner three inches in the middle and one and a half at the top and bottom getting a strike is more a matter of luck than skill and its said that nobody has ever bowled a perfect tenstrike candlepin game the best score recorded in maine is out of a possible id never bowled over the big in scarborough had been in existence since when mike anton an albanian by birth founded it as maine s largest and most modern bowling house and it didnt seem to have changed much since then i sat on a pink plastic chair sipped a soda and waited it was fourthirty on a friday afternoon and every lane was already in use the ages of the players ranging from teenagers to seniors there was laughter and the smell of beer and fried food and the distinctive sound of the balls rolling along the wooden alleys i watched two old guys who barely spoke ten words to each other close in on each and when they failed to break the double century one of them expressed his disappointment in a single ayuh i sat in silence the only lone male among groups of men and women knowing that i was about to cross a line with merrick my cell phone rang shortly before five and a voice said we got him outside there were two scarborough police cruisers and a trio of unmarked cars one each from the portland pd the south portland pd and the scarborough cops a handful of people had gathered to watch the show merrick was facedown in the parking lot his hands cuffed behind his back he looked up at me as i approached he didnt appear angry he just seemed disappointed i saw orourke nearby leaning against a car i nodded to him and made a call rebecca clay answered she was at the courthouse and the judge was about to issue the temporary protection order against merrick i told her that we had him and that id be at scarborough pd headquarters if she needed to contact me when she was done any problems i asked orourke he shook his head he walked right into it didnt even open his mouth to ask what was going on as we watched merrick was hauled to his feet and put in the back of one of the unmarked cars he stared straight ahead as it pulled out he looks old said orourke hes got something though i wouldnt like to cross him and i hate to tell you this but i think you just have it didnt seem like i had a whole lot of choice well at least we can hold him for a while and see what we get out of him the length of time for which merrick could be held would depend on the charges brought against him if any stalking defined as engaging in conduct that would cause a person to suffer intimidation annoyance or alarm or to fear bodily injury either to that person or a member of that persons immediate family was defined as a class d crime similarly terrorizing was a class d and harassment was a class e there was always the possibility of adding trespassing and criminal damage to the list but taken altogether it meant that merrick could be held only until the following tuesday evening assuming he didnt get lawyered up since d and e offenses allowed a suspect to be held for only fortyeight hours without charge excluding weekends and holidays you think your client will want to take this all the way asked orourke do you want her to hes a dangerous man seems kind of rude to lock him up for just sixty days which is what hell get if the judge buys all the arguments in favor of putting him away might even be counterproductive although if anyone asks i didnt say that you never struck me as the gambling type you know that its not a gamble its a calculated risk based on what based on frankies reluctance to be jailed and your ability to protect your client so whats the compromise we warn him off make sure the order is ready to be served and set him free its a small city hes not going to disappear well arrange for someone to stick close to him for a while and see what happens it didnt sound like the perfect plan nevertheless it looked like i had just been given an extra ninetysix hours at most without merrick to worry about it was better than nothing lets hear what hes got to say for himself first i said you cleared it for me to watch didnt take much doing seems like you still have friends in scarborough you spot anything in what he says then you let me know you think hell call a lawyer i thought about it if he did decide to lawyer himself up it would have to be through eldritch assuming the old man was licensed to practice in maine or had someone in the state who was prepared to do a little quid pro quo work when necessary but i had a feeling that eldritchs support for merrick had always been conditional and merrick s recent actions might have forced the lawyer to reconsider his position i dont think hes going to talk much anyway orourke shrugged we could hit him with a telephone book you could but id have to report you to ia yeah theres that id have to lose the paperwork on myself still its scarborough s turf we can stand back and see how they handle it he got in his car the scarborough cruisers were pulling away the portland cops close behind you coming he asked ill follow he left the crowd dispersed and suddenly i was the only person in the parking lot the cars rolled by on route and the neon big sign illuminated the lot but behind me was the darkness of the marshes i turned gazing into it and i couldnt shake the feeling that from its deepest reaches something stared back at me i walked to my car started the engine and tried to leave that sensation behind merrick was seated in a small square room furnished with a white table bolted to the floor there were three blue chairs around it and merrick sat in the one facing the door the two empty chairs across from him a wipeclean board was attached to one wall its surface covered with childrens doodles there was a phone beside the door and high in one corner a video camera the room was also wired for sound recording merrick s hands had been cuffed and the cuffs had in turn been chained through a dring on the table he had been given a soda to drink from the machine beside the evidence technicians office but he hadnt touched it while the room didnt have a twoway mirror we were able to watch him on the computer monitor in a partitioned office close by the interview room we werent alone although the alcove was big enough for four people at best almost three times that number were crowded around the screen trying to catch a glimpse of their new guest detective sergeant wallace macarthur was one of them i knew him from way back through rachel id introduced him to his wife mary in a way i had nearly been responsible for her death too but wallace had never held that against me which was pretty christian of him all things considered not often we get a living legend in here he said even the feds have joined us he jerked a thumb in the direction of the door where pender the new sac of the small portland field office was talking with a man whom i didnt recognize but whom i took to be another agent i had been introduced to pender once at some policemans benefit in portland as far as the feds went he seemed okay pender nodded to me i nodded back at least he hadnt tried to have me thrown out which was reason to be thankful macarthur shook his head in something like admiration merrick s old school he said they dont make em like him anymore orourke grinned emptily yeah what have we come to when we can look at someone like him and think hell hes not so bad he just popped them neatly and cleanly no torture no women no kids just men that somebody figured had it coming merrick kept his head down he did not look up at the camera even though he must have known that we were watching him two scarborough detectives entered the room a beefy guy named conlough and a woman named frederickson who had made the formal arrest at the big as soon as they began to question him merrick contrary to expectations looked up and answered them in soft civil tones it was almost as though he felt the need to justify and defend himself perhaps he was right he had lost his daughter he had the right to ask where she might be conlough whats your interest in rebecca clay merrick none beyond who her daddy is c whats her father to you m he treated my little girl now shes gone i want to find out where she is c you think you can do that by threatening a woman real big guy huh stalking a defenseless woman m i didnt threaten anyone i didnt stalk anyone i just wanted to ask her some questions c so you do that by trying to bust into her house breaking

of his heart what is he st vincent de pauls lawyer m maybe you should ask him c dont worry we will well talk to the lawyer said orourke you wont get much from him i said youve met him oh yeah hes oldschool too how old so old they built the school out of wattle and daub what did he tell you pretty much what merrick just said you believe him that hes a good guy who gives away cars to deserving causes no still he said that merrick had been one of his clients and theres no law against loaning a car to your client i didnt tell orourke that eldritch had another client one who seemed to be covering merrick s tab i figured he could find that out for himself a call came through from the evidence technician merrick s car was clean there were no weapons no incriminating papers nothing frederickson emerged from the interview room to consult with orourke and the fbi man pender the man who had been talking with pender listened in but said nothing his eyes flicked to me regarded me for a moment then returned to frederickson i didnt like what passed between us with that look orourke asked me if there was anything that i thought we should put to merrick i suggested asking him if he was working alone or if he had brought other men with him orourke seemed puzzled but agreed to suggest the question to frederickson f ms clay has taken out a court order against you do you understand what that means m i understand it means i cant go near her no more else you put my ass back in jail f thats right you going to abide by that order you dont plan to and you can save us all some time

listen you may have been a big shot once upon a time but that doesnt count for anything up here m you got no more cause to hold me i told you id abide by that order f we think you need some time to reflect on what youve been doing to uh meditate on your sins m im done talking to you i want to call me a lawyer that was it the interrogation was over merrick was given access to a phone he called eldritch who it emerged had taken the maine bar exam along with its equivalents in new hampshire and vermont he told merrick not to answer any more questions and arrangements were made to transfer merrick to the cumberland county jail since scarborough no longer had holding cells of its own the lawyer wont be able to get him out until monday morning at the earliest said orourke the judges do like to keep their weekends clear even if merrick was charged it was likely that eldritch would arrange bail for him if it was still in the interests of eldritchs other client that merrick should be free just as it seemed to be in orourkes interests the only person whose interests might not be well served by merricks freedom was rebecca clay i have some people keeping watch over ms clay i told orourke she wants to cut them loose but i think she may need to reconsider just until we get a sense of how merrick reacts to all this who are you using i shifted awkwardly in my seat the fulcis and jackie garner orourke laughed attracting surprised glances from the men around him no way thats like using a pair of undercover elephants and their ringmaster well i kind of wanted him to see them the object of the exercise was to keep him away hell theyd keep me away probably kept the birds away too you really do pick entertaining friends yeah i thought but he didnt know the half of it the really entertaining ones had just arrived chapter xiv the streets were thick with buses by the time i made it back from scarborough to the cumberland county civic center yellow school buses peter pan trailways in fact just about anything that had wheels and could accommodate more than six people the pirates were on a roll under coach kevin dineen they were at the top of the atlantic division of the ahls eastern conference earlier in the week they had beaten their nearest rivals the hartford wolf pack now it was the turn of the springfield falcons and it looked like about five thousand fans had made their way to the civic center for the game inside the arena crackers the parrot was entertaining the crowd to be more accurate he was entertaining most of the crowd there were some people just didnt want to be entertained this has got to be the dumbest game ever said louis he was dressed in a gray cashmere coat over a black jacket and trousers his hands thrust deep into the pockets of the coat his chin buried in the folds of his red scarf he acted like hed just been forced out of a train somewhere in the middle of siberia his mildly satanic beard had been dispensed with and his hair was even more ruthlessly cut back than usual its gray touches now barely visible he and angel had arrived earlier that day i had bought a couple of extra tickets in case they wanted to come along to the game but angel had somehow managed to pick up a cold in napa and was back at my place feeling sorry for himself that left louis as my reluctant escort for the evening things between us had changed over the last year in a way i had always been closer to angel i knew more about his past and when i was however briefly a cop i had done what i could to help and protect him i had seen something in himeven now i found it hard to explain precisely what it was but perhaps it was a kind of decency an empathy with those who had suffered albeit one filtered murkily through his criminalityand had responded to it i had seen something in his partner too but it was very different long before i had fired a gun in anger louis had killed at first he had done so out of a rage of his own but he had quickly discovered he had a talent for it and there were those who had been willing to pay him to utilize that ability on their behalf he was once i thought not so different from frank merrick although his moral compass had become surer than merrick s had ever been yet louis was also i knew not so different from me he represented a side of me that i had long been reluctant to acknowledgethe urge to strike out the impulse toward violenceand his presence in my life had forced me to come to terms with it and through that accommodation to control it in turn i thought that i had given him an outlet for his own anger a way of engaging with and altering the world that was worthy of him as a man we had seen things in this last year that had changed both of us confirming suspicions that we had both held about the nature of the honeycomb world but had rarely shared we had found a common ground however hollow it might have sounded beneath our feet you know why you dont see no black men playing this game he continued a because its slow b because its dumb and c because its cold i mean look at these guys he flicked through the pages of the official program most of them aint even american theyre canadian like you dont have enough slowass white men of your own you got to import them from canada we like giving jobs to canadians i said it gives them the chance to earn some real dollars yeah i bet they send it back to their families like in the third world he watched with obvious disdain as the mascot frolicked on the ice parrot is more of an athlete than they are we were seated in block e right in the center overlooking the circle there was no sign of bill the man tween was putting our way although it was clear from what tween had said that he was likely to be the cautious type where merrick was concerned if he was smart he would be watching us even now he would be reassured to learn that merrick was behind bars for a few days it had bought us all a little more time for which i was grateful at least until i was forced to explain the subtle nuances of hockey to a man who thought sport started and finished on a basketball court or an athletics track come on i said thats not fair wait until they get on the ice some of these guys are pretty fast get the fuck out of here said louis carl lewis was fast jesse owens was fast even ben johnson was fast on his chemical ass the popsicles on the other hand they not fast they like snowmen on flat tin cans an announcement was made advising spectators that obscene or abusive language would not be tolerated you cant swear said louis incredulously the fuck kind of sport is this its just for appearances i said as a man with kids on either side of him glanced up at louis disapprovingly from below considered saying something then thought better of it and contented himself with pulling his kids hats down over their ears queens we will rock you was played followed by republicas ready to go why is so much sports music shit asked louis this is white peoples music i explained its supposed to suck that way black people cant show them up by dancing to it the teams hit the ice there was more music as usual prizes were given out all through the first period free burgers and mall discounts the occasional tshirt or cap give me a break said louis they got to give shit away just to keep folks in their seats by the end of the first period the pirates were up from zenon konopka and geoff peters there was still no sign of tweens guy maybe hes asleep somewhere suggested louis like here just as the teams emerged for the second period a small hardlooking man in an ancient pirates jacket moved into the row from the right he had a goatee and wore silverrimmed glasses his head was covered by a black pirates hat and his hands were hidden in the pockets of his jacket he looked like any one of hundreds of other people in the crowd parker right he said thats right youre bill he nodded but didnt take his hands out of his pockets how long have you been watching us i asked since before the first period he replied youre being pretty careful i figure it doesnt hurt frank merricks in custody i said yeah well i didnt know that did i what did they get him for stalking theyre going to charge frank merrick with stalking he snorted in disbelief give me a break why dont they add jaywalking or not having a license for his dog we wanted him held for a while i said the why didnt matter bill looked past me to where louis was sitting no offense meant but a black guy kind of stands out at a hockey game this is maine a black guy stands out just about anywhere i suppose but you could have made him blend in some does he look like the kind of guy whos gonna wear a pirates hat and wave a plastic cutlass bill looked away from louis i guess not a real cutlass maybe he sat back and didnt say anything more for a time with to go in the second period shane hynes hit a rocket from the right point a minute and a half later jordan smith made it it was all over bill stood lets go get a beer he said thats four consecutive wins nine wins in ten games best start since the ninetyfourtoninetyfive inaugural and i had to watch that in jail that count as cruel and unusual punishment asked louis bill gave him the eye hes not a fan i said no shit we walked outside and picked up three microbrews in plastic glasses there was a steady stream of people already leaving the arena now that it looked like the pirates had sewn everything up i appreciated the ticket by the way he said i dont always have the funds to come here no more no problem i said he waited expectantly his eyes fixed on the bulge in my jacket where my wallet was visible i took it out and paid him the fifty he folded the bills carefully and placed them in a pocket of his jeans i was about to ask him about merrick when from inside the arena came the unmistakable response to a falcons goal goddammit said bill we jinxed em by leaving so it was back to our seats to wait for the start of the third period but at least bill was content to talk for a while about his time in supermax while we did so the supermax system was designed to take out of the general population prisoners who were deemed to be especially violent or escape risks or a threat to others often it was used as a form of punishment for those who broke the rules or who were found with contraband the maine supermax was opened in in warren it had one hundred maximumsecurity solitaryconfinement cells with the closure of the old thomaston state prison at the start of the century the new elevenhundredinmate prison was eventually built around the supermax like fortress walls around a citadel we were both in the max at the same time merrick and me he said i was doing twenty for burglary well burglaries you believe that twenty years goddamn killers get out in less anyway the cops busted me for possession of a screwdriver and some wire i only had the stuff to repair my goddamn radio told me i was an escape risk and sent me to the max after that things got crazy i hit a cop i was pissed at him i paid for it though i stayed in the max for the duration fuckin cops i hate them inmates routinely referred to the prison guards as cops after all they were part of the same law enforcement edifice as the police the prosecutors and the judges bet youve never seen the inside of the smu said bill nope i said the supermax was offlimits to just about everyone who wasnt a prisoner or a guard but id heard enough about it to know that it wasnt a place i ever wanted to be its bad said bill and from the way he said it i knew that i wasnt going to hear some exaggerated hardluck excons story he wasnt trying to sell me anything he just wanted someone to listen it stinks shit blood puke stuff is on the floor on the walls snow comes under the doors in winter the vents make this noise all the time and theres something about it you cant block it out i used to stuff toilet paper in my ears to try to stop myself from hearing it i thought it was going to drive me nuts its twentythreehour lockdown with one hour a day five days a week in the kennel thats what we call the exercise yard thing is six feet wide thirty feet long i should know i measured it myself for five years lights are on twentyfourseven theres no tv no radio just noise and white light they dont even allow a man a toothbrush they give you this useless fucking piece of plastic for your finger but its not worth a damn bill opened his mouth and pointed with his finger at the gaps in his yellow teeth i lost five teeth in there he said they just fell out when you get down to it the max is a form of psychological torture you know why youre in there but not what you can do to get out again and thats not the worst of it you fuck up badly enough and they send you to the chair that i knew about the chair was a restraining device used on those who managed to push the guards too far four or five guards wearing full body armor and carrying shields and mace would storm a prisoners cell to perform the extraction he would be maced pushed to the floor or onto his bed then handcuffed the cuffs would then be connected to leg irons and his clothes cut from his body and then the prisoner would be carried naked and screaming to an observation room and there bound to a chair with straps where he would be left for hours in the cold incredibly the prison authorities argued that the chair wasnt used for punishment but only as a means of controlling inmates who were a threat to themselves or others the portland phoenix had obtained a tape of an extraction as all such operations were recorded by the prison ostensibly to prove that the prisoners were not being mistreated according to those who had seen it it was hard to imagine how extractions and the chair qualified as anything other than statesanctioned violence bordering on torture they did it to me once said bill after i coldcocked the cop never again i kept my head down after that that was no way to treat a man they did it to merrick too more than once but they couldnt break frank it was always the same reason though it never varied what do you mean merrick was always being punished for the same thing there was a kid in there name of kellog andy kellog he was crazy but it wasnt his fault everybody knew it hed been fucked with as a child and he never recovered spoke about birds all the time men like birds i interrupted bill wait a minute this kid kellog had been abused thats right sexually abused uhhuh i guess the men who did it wore masks or something i recalled kellog from his time in thomaston some of the others in the max did too but nobody ever seemed to know for sure what had happened to him all we knew was that hed been taken by the men like birds and not once either a couple of times and that was after others had been at him already what was left when they were done with him wasnt worth a nickel curse kid was medicated to hell and back only man who seemed to get through to him was merrick and i got to tell you that was a surprise to me merrick wasnt no social worker he was hard but this kid man merrick tried to look out for him it wasnt no faggot thing either first man who said that to merrick was also the last merrick near took his head off tried to force it through the bars of his cell nearly succeeded too until the cops came and broke it up then kellog got transferred to the max for throwing shit at guards and merrick he found a way to go there too merrick deliberately got himself transferred to the supermax yep thats what they say until kellog went merrick had minded his own business kept his head down apart from those occasions when someone stepped out of line and threatened the kid or if he was really dumb tried to move up the order by knocking heads with merrick but after kellog was transferred merrick did everything he could to rile the cops until they had no choice but to send him to warren wasnt much that he could do for the kid there but he didnt give up he talked to the cops tried to get them to send a mental health worker to check up on kellog even managed to talk the kid down once or twice when it seemed like he was going to get himself sent to the chair again guards took him out of his cell on occasion just so he could reason with the kid but it didnt always work i tell you kellog lived in that chair maybe he still does for all i know kellog is still in there i dont think hes ever gonna get out not alive i think the kid wants to die its a miracle he isnt dead already what about merrick did you talk to him did he tell you anything about himself nah he was a loner only man he had time for was kellog i got to talk to him some when our paths crossed on the way to the infirmary or to and from the kennel but over the years we talked about as much as you and i have done tonight i knew about his daughter though i think that was why he was looking out for kellog the final period started i could see bills attention immediately begin to transfer itself to the ice i dont understand i said what did merrick s daughter have to do with kellog reluctantly bill turned away from the action for the last time well his daughter had gone missing he said he didnt have much to remember her by a couple of photographs a drawing or two that the girl sent to him in jail before she disappeared it was the drawings that attracted him to kellog because kellog and merrick s daughter theyd drawn the same thing theyd both drawn men with the heads of birds three i myself am hell nobodys here robert lowell skunk hour chapter xv it didnt take long to find out the name of the lawyer who had represented andy kellog during his most recent brushes with the law her name was aimee price and she had an office in south freeport about three miles away from the touristtrap bustle of freeport itself the contrast between the towns of freeport and south freeport was striking while freeport had largely given up the ghost to the joys of outlet shopping its side streets now converted to extended parking lots south freeport which extended from porter landing to winslow park had preserved most of its old nineteenthcentury homes built when the shipyards on the harraseeket were booming price worked out of a small complex that had been created from a pair of carefully restored ship captains houses on park street part of an area two blocks square that constituted the town center situated just above the freeport town landing she shared the space with an accountant a debtrestructuring service and an acupuncturist although it was saturday price had told me that she would be working on case files until about one i picked up some fresh muffins at the carharts village store and strolled over to her office shortly before noon i entered the reception area and the young woman behind the desk pointed me in the direction of a hallway to my left after calling ahead to inform prices secretary that i had arrived her secretary was male and in his early twenties he wore suspenders and a red bow tie in someone else his age it might have come across as trying too hard to appear eccentric but there was something about the crumpled cotton of his shirt and the ink stains on his tan pants that suggested his eccentricity was pretty genuine price herself was in her forties with red curly hair cut short in a style that might have suited a woman twenty years older she wore a navy suit the jacket of which was slung across her chair and had the tired look of someone who was fighting too many losing battles with the system her office was decorated with pictures of horses and while there were various files on the floor the windowsill and on her desk it was still a lot more welcoming than the offices of eldritch and associates mainly because the people here seemed to have figured out how to use computers and dispose of some of their old paper instead of sitting at her desk price cleared some space on a couch and invited me to sit there while she took an upright chair alongside it there was a small table between us and the secretary whose name was ernest set down some cups and a coffeepot and took one of the muffins for his trouble the seating arrangement left me sitting slightly lower and slightly less comfortably than price it was i knew quite deliberate it seemed like aimee price had learned the hard way always to assume the worst and to take every advantage available in anticipation of the battles to come she wore a large diamond engagement ring it sparkled in the winter sunlight as if there were bright living things moving within the stones nice rock i said she smiled are you an appraiser as well as a detective im multitalented in case the whole detecting thing doesnt work out ill have something to fall back on you seem to be doing okay at it she said you make the papers a lot she reconsidered what she had just said no i guess thats not true its just that when you do make the papers it kind of stands out i bet you have all your press framed too ive built a shrine to myself well good luck attracting fellow worshipers you wanted to talk to me about andy kellog it was straight down to business id like to see him i said hes in the max its offlimits to everyone except you im his lawyer and even i have to jump through hoops to get near him in there whats your interest in andy daniel clay prices face grew stony what about him his daughter hired me shes been having some trouble with an individual whos anxious to trace her father it seems this individual was an acquaintance of andy kellogs in jail merrick said price its frank merrick isnt it you know about him i couldnt help but be aware of him he and andy were close i waited price leaned back in her chair where to begin she said i took on andy kellog pro bono i dont know how much of his circumstances youre familiar with but ill give you a short summary abandoned as a baby taken in by his mothers sister brutalized by her and her husband then passed around to some of the husbands buddies for the purposes of sexual abuse he started running away at the age of eight and was practically wild by twelve medicated from the age of nine severe learning difficulties never made it past third grade eventually he ended up in a halfway house for severely disturbed children run on a wing and a prayer with minimal state funding and thats when he was referred to daniel clay it was part of a pilot program dr clay specialized in traumatized children particularly those who had been victims of physical or sexual abuse a number of children were selected for the program and andy was one of them who decided which kids were admitted a panel of mental health workers social workers and clay himself apparently there was some improvement in andys condition right from the start the sessions with dr clay seemed to be working for him he grew more communicative less aggressive it was decided that he might benefit from interaction with a family outside of the environment of the state home so he began to spend a couple of days each week with a family in bingham they ran a lodge for outdoor pursuits you know hunting hiking rafting that kind of thing eventually andy was allowed to live with them with the mental health workers and child protection people keeping in regular touch on him well that was the idea but they were always overstretched so as long as he wasnt getting into any trouble they left well enough alone and moved on to other cases he was allowed a certain degree of freedom but mostly he preferred to stay close to the family and the lodge this was during the summer season then things got busier there wasnt always time to watch andy twentyfourseven and she stopped do you have children mr parker yes i dont i thought i might have wanted them once but i dont think its going to happen now maybe its for the best when you see the things that people are capable of doing to them she wet her lips as though her system was trying to silence her by drying out her mouth andy was abducted from near the lodge he went missing for a couple of hours one afternoon and when he returned he was very quiet nobody paid too much heed you know andy still wasnt like the other kids he had his moods and the folks who were looking after him had learned to let them blow over they figured that it didnt hurt to allow him explore the woods by himself they were good people i think they just let their guard down where andy was concerned anyhow it wasnt until the third or fourth time it happened that notice was taken someone i think it was the mother went to see how andy was and he just attacked her he went wild clawing at her hair her face eventually they had to sit on him and pin him down until the police came he wouldnt go back to clay and the childcare workers could only get him to talk about fragments of what had occurred he was returned to the institution and he stayed there until he was seventeen after that he hit the streets and was lost he couldnt afford the medication that he needed so he fell into dealing robbery violence hes doing fifteen years but he doesnt belong in the max ive been trying to get him admitted to riverview psychiatric thats where he should really be ive had no luck so far the state has decided that hes a criminal and the state is never wrong why didnt he tell anyone about the abuse price nibbled at her muffin i noticed that her hands moved when she was thinking her fingers always beating out some pattern on the edge of her chair testing her fingernails or as in this case pulling apart the muffin before her it seemed to be part of her thought processes its complicated she said in part it was probably a product of the earlier abuse where the adults responsible for him were not only aware of what was happening but actively colluded in it andy had little or no trust in authority figures and the foster couple in bingham had only just begun to break down his barriers when the new abuse occurred but from what he told me later the men who abused him threatened to hurt the couples eightyearold daughter if he said anything about what was happening to him her name was michelle and andy had grown very fond of her he was protective of her in his way that was why he went back went back the men told andy where he should wait for them each tuesday sometimes they came sometimes they didnt but andy was always there in case they did he didnt want anything to happen to michelle there was a clearing about half a mile from the house with a creek nearby and a trail led down to it from the road wide enough to take a single vehicle andy would sit there and one of them would come for him he was told always to sit facing the creek and never to turn around when he heard someone arriving he would be blindfolded walked to the car and driven away i felt something in my throat and my eyes stung i looked away from price i had an image in my head of a boy sitting on a log the sound of water rushing nearby sunlight spearing through the trees and birds singing then footsteps approaching and darkness i hear hes been taken to the chair a couple of times she glanced at me perhaps surprised at how much i knew more than a couple its a vicious circle andys medicated but the medication needs to be monitored and the dosages adjusted it isnt monitored though so the meds stop working as well as they should andy gets distressed he lashes out the guards punish him he ends up more disturbed and the meds have even less effect on him than before its not andys fault but try explaining that to a prison guard whos just had andys urine thrown all over him and andys not untypical theres an escalating cycle occurring at the supermax everyone can see it but nobody knows what to do about it or nobody even wants to do something about it depending upon how depressed im feeling you take a mentally unstable prisoner who commits some infraction of the rules while part of the general population you confine him in a brightly lit cell without distractions surrounded by other prisoners who are even more disturbed than he is under the strain he violates more rules hes punished by being placed in the chair which makes him even wilder than before he commits more serious breaches of the rules or assaults a guard and his sentence is increased the end result in the case of someone like andy is that hes driven insane even suicidal and what does a threat of suicide get you more time in the chair winston churchill once said that you can judge a society by the way it treats its prisoners you know there was all of this stuff about abu ghraib and what we were doing to muslims in iraq and in guantánamo and in afghanistan and wherever else weve decided to lock up those whom we perceive to be a threat people seemed surprised by it but all they had to do was look around them we do it to our own people we try children as adults we lock up even execute the mentally ill and we tie people naked to chairs in icecold rooms because their medication isnt working if we can do that here then how the hell can anybody be surprised when we dont treat our enemies any better her voice had grown louder as she became more angry ernest knocked on the door and poked his head in everything okay aimee he asked looking at me as if i was to blame for the disturbance which i suppose in a way i was its fine ernest you want more coffee she shook her head im wired as it is mr parker no im good she waited until the door had closed before continuing sorry about that said aimee for what for giving you the rant i guess you probably dont agree with me why would you say that because of what ive read about you youve killed people you seem like a harsh judge i wasnt sure how to respond part of me was surprised by her words maybe even annoyed by them but there was no edge to them she was simply calling it as she saw it i didnt think that i had a choice i replied not then maybe now knowing what i know i might have acted differently in some cases but not all you did what you thought was right ive started to believe that most people do what they think is right the problems arise when what they do is right for themselves but not whats right for others selfishness perhaps selfinterest selfpreservation a whole lot of concepts with self in them did you make mistakes when you did what you did i realized that i was being tested in some way that prices questions were a way of gauging whether or not i should be allowed to see andy kellog i tried to answer them as honestly as i could no not at the end so you dont make mistakes not like that you never shot anyone who didnt have a gun in his hand is that what youre saying no because thats not true either there was a silence then until aimee price put her hands to her forehead and gave a growl of frustration some of that is none of my business she said im sorry again im asking you questions i dont see why you cant ask some back you frowned when i mentioned daniel clays name though why because i know what people say about him ive heard the stories and you believe them somebody betrayed andy kellog to those men it wasnt a coincidence merrick doesnt think so either frank merrick is obsessed something inside him broke when his daughter disappeared i dont know if it makes him more dangerous or less dangerous than he was what can you tell me about him not much you probably know all that you need to about his conviction the stuff in virginia the killing of barton riddick and the bullet match that linked merrick to the shooting it doesnt interest me a great deal to be honest my main concern was and remains andy kellog when merrick first began forming some kind of bond with andy i thought what most people would you know a vulnerable younger man an older harder prisoner but it wasnt like that merrick really seemed to be looking out for andy as best he could she had begun to doodle on the legal pad on her lap as she spoke i dont think she was even fully aware of what she was doing she didnt look down at the pad as the pencil moved across it and she didnt look at me preferring instead to gaze out at the cold winter light beyond her window she was drawing the heads of birds i heard that merrick got transferred to the supermax just so he could stay close to kellog i said im curious to know the source of your information but its certainly right on the money merrick got transferred and made it clear that anyone who messed with andy would answer to him even in a place like the max there are ways and means except the only person from whom merrick couldnt protect andy was andy himself in the meantime the ags office in virginia began setting in motion indictment on the riddick killing it rattled on and on and as the date of merrick s release from the max approached the papers were served and he was notified of his extradition then something peculiar happened another lawyer intervened on merrick s behalf eldritch i said thats right the intervention was troublesome in a number of ways it didnt seem like eldritch had ever had any previous contact with merrick and andy told me that the lawyer had initiated the contact this old man just turned up and offered to take on merrick s case but from what i found out later eldritch didnt seem to specialize in any kind of criminal work he did corporate stuff real estate all strictly whitecollar so he was an unusual candidate for a crusading attorney nevertheless he tied merricks case in with a challenge to bullet matching being assembled by a group of liberal lawyers and turned up evidence of a shooting involving the same weapon used to kill riddick but committed while merrick was behind bars the feds began to backtrack on bullet matching and virginia came to the realization there wasnt enough evidence to get a conviction on the riddick shooting and if theres one thing a prosecutor hates to do its to pursue a case that looks like its doomed from the start merrick spent a few months in a cell in virginia then was released hed served his full sentence in maine so he was free and clear do you think he regretted leaving andy kellog in the max sure but by then he seemed to have decided that there were things he needed to do outside like find out what had happened to his daughter yes i closed my notebook there would be other questions but for now i was done id still like to talk to andy i said ill make some inquiries i thanked her and gave her my card about frank merrick she said as i was about to leave i think he did kill riddick and a whole lot of others too i know his reputation i said do you believe eldritch was wrong to intervene i dont know why eldritch intervened but it wasnt out of a concern for justice he did some good though even inadvertently bullet matching was flawed the case against merrick was equally flawed if you let even one of those slip by then the whole system falls apart or crumbles a little more than its crumbling already if eldritch hadnt taken the case maybe i would have sought a pro hac vice order and taken it myself she smiled i stress maybe you wouldnt want frank merrick as a client even hearing that hes back in maine makes me nervous he hasnt tried to contact you about andy no you have any idea where hes staying while hes up here it was a good question and it set off a train of thought if eldritch had provided merrick with a car and perhaps funds too he might also have supplied a place for him to stay if that was the case there might be a way to find it and perhaps discover more about both merrick and eldritchs client i stood to leave at the door of her office aimee price said so daniel clays daughter is paying you to do all this no not this i said shes paying me to keep her safe from merrick so why are you here for the same reason that you might have taken on merricks case theres something wrong here it bothers me id like to find out what it is she nodded ill be in touch about andy she said rebecca clay called me and i updated her on the situation with merrick eldritch had informed his client that he would be unable to do anything for him until monday when he would petition a judge if merrick continued to remain in custody without charge orourke wasnt confident that any judge would allow the scarborough cops to continue to hold him if he had already spent fortyeight hours behind bars even allowing for the fact that the letter of the law entitled them to keep him for a further fortyeight what then asked rebecca im pretty certain that hes not going to bother you again i saw what happened when they told him he was going to be locked up for the weekend hes not afraid of jail but he is afraid of losing his freedom to search for his daughter that freedom is now tied up with your continued wellbeing ill serve him with the court order upon his release but if youre agreeable well keep an eye on you for a day or two after hes released just in case i want to bring jenna home she said i wouldnt advise that just yet im worried about her this whole business i think its affecting her why i found pictures in her room drawings drawings of what of men men with pale faces and no eyes she said that shed seen them or dreamed them or something i want her close to me i didnt tell rebecca that others had seen those men too myself included it seemed better to let her believe for now that they were a product of her daughters troubled imagination and nothing more soon i said just give me a few more days reluctantly she agreed that evening angel louis and i had dinner at fore street louis had gone to the bar to examine the vodka options leaving angel and me to talk youve lost weight said angel sniffing and snowing fragments of tissue on the table i had no idea what he had been doing in napa to contract a cold but i was pretty certain that i didnt want him to tell me you look good even your clothes look good its the new me i eat well still go to the gym walk the dog uhhuh nice clothes eating well going to the gym owning a dog he thought for a moment you sure youre not gay i cant be gay i said im very busy as it is maybe thats why i like you he said youre a gay nongay angel had arrived wearing one of my castoff brown leather bomber jackets the material so worn in places that it had faded entirely to white his aged wranglers had an embroidered wave pattern on the back pockets and he was wearing a hall and oates tshirt which meant that the time in angel land was approximately a quarter after can you be a gay homophobe i asked sure its like being a selfhating jew except the food is better louis returned ive been telling him how gay he is said angel as he buttered a piece of bread a fragment of butter fell on his tshirt he carefully used a finger to remove it and licked the digit clean louiss face remained impassive only the slightest narrowing of his eyes indicating the depth of the emotions he was feeling uhhuh he said i dont think youre the right guy to front the recruitment drive while we ate we talked about merrick and what i had learned from aimee price earlier that day i had put in a call to matt mayberry a realtor i knew down in massachusetts whose company did business all over new england asking him if there was a way he could find out about any properties in the greater portland area with which eldritch and associates had been involved in recent years it was a long shot i had spent most of the afternoon making calls to hotels and motels but i had drawn a blank every time i asked for frank merricks room still it would be useful to know where merrick was likely to bolt once he was released you seen rachel lately asked angel a few weeks back how are things between you not so good thats a shame yeah you got to keep trying you know that thanks for the advice maybe you should go see her while merrick is safe behind bars i thought about it as the check arrived i knew then that i wanted to see them both i wanted to hold sam and talk to rachel i was tired of hearing about men who tormented children and the troubled lives they had left in their wake louis began counting out bills maybe i will go to see them i said well walk your dog said angel if hes secretly gay like you he wont object chapter xvi it was a long ride to the property rachel and sam now shared with rachels parents in vermont and i spent most of it driving in silence going over all that i had learned about daniel clay and frank merrick and trying to figure out where eldritchs client fitted into the whole affair eldritch had told me that his client had no interest in daniel clay yet they were both facilitating merrick who was obsessed with clay and then there were the hollow men whatever they were i had seen them or perhaps it would be more true to say that they had entered my zone of perception the maid at joel harmons house had seen them too and as i had learned from the brief conversation with rebecca clay the night before her daughter jenna had drawn pictures of them before she left the city the connection appeared to be merrick but when he was asked during his interrogation if he was working alone or if he had brought others with him he had seemed genuinely surprised and had responded in the negative the questions remained who were they and what was their purpose rachels parents had gone away for the weekend and werent due back until monday so rachels sister had come to stay in order to help with sam sam had grown so much even in the few weeks since i had last seen her or perhaps that was just the view of a father conscious of the fact that he was separated from his daughter and that the stages of her development would from now on be revealed to him in leaps rather than steps was i simply being pessimistic i didnt know rachel and i still spoke regularly on the phone i missed her and i thought that she missed me but on the recent occasions when we had met her parents were present or sam was acting up or there was something else that seemed to get in the way of talking about ourselves and how things had become so bad between us i couldnt figure out if we were allowing these intrusions to become obstacles in order to avoid some kind of final confrontation or if they truly were what they seemed to be a period apart to allow us both to figure out how we wanted to live this life had become something longer and more complicated and it appeared more final rachel and sam had moved back to scarborough for a time in may but rachel and i had fought and there was a distance between us that had not existed before she had been uncomfortable in the house that we had once shared more easily and sam had trouble sleeping in her room had we simply grown used to being without each another even though i knew that i still craved her and she me we existed in a kind of strained limbo where things were left unsaid for fear that to speak them aloud would cause the whole fragile edifice to collapse around us rachels parents had converted some old stables on their property into a large guesthouse and that was where rachel lived with sam she was working again employed on a contract basis with the psychology department of the university of vermont in burlington taking tutorials and lecturing on criminal psychology she told me a little about it as i sat at her kitchen table but in the casual passing way that one might describe ones pursuits to a stranger at dinner in the past i would have been privy to every little detail but not anymore sam was squatting on the floor between us playing with big plastic farm animals she gripped two sheep in her chubby hands and pounded their heads together then looked up and offered one to each of us they were slick with baby drool you think its a metaphor for us i asked rachel she looked tired but still beautiful she caught me staring and brushed a strand of hair back over her ear blushing slightly im not sure that knocking our heads together would solve anything she said although admittedly id get a sense of satisfaction from knocking your head against something nice she reached out and touched the back of my hand with her finger i didnt mean it to sound quite as harsh as it did its okay if its any consolation i often feel like beating my head against a wall too what about beating mine youre too goodlooking and id be afraid of ruining your hair i turned my hand palm up and held her finger lets go for a walk she said my sister will look after sam we rose and she called her sisters name pam entered the kitchen before i had a chance to release rachels finger and she gave us both a knowing look it wasnt disapproving though which was something had rachels father seen us like this he might well have reached for his rifle i didnt get on with him and i knew that he hoped the relationship between his daughter and me was over for good why dont i take sam for a ride said pam i have to go to the store anyway and you know how she likes peoplewatching she knelt in front of sam you wanna go for a ride with aunt pammie huh ill take you to the health section and show you all the stuff youre gonna need when youre a teenager and boys come calling maybe we can go look at guns too huh sam let her aunt pick her up without complaint rachel followed them and helped her sister to get sam ready and to fit her into the child seat sam cried a little when the door closed and she realized that her mom wasnt joining them but we knew that it wouldnt last long she was fascinated by the car and seemed to spend most of her time in it either watching the sky go by or just sleeping lulled by the movement of the vehicle we watched them drive off then i followed rachel across the garden and into the fields that bordered her parents house she kept her arms folded across her chest as though uneasy about the fact that she had held my hand earlier how have you been she asked busy anything interesting i told her about rebecca clay and her father and the arrival of frank merrick what kind of man is he asked rachel it was a strange question a dangerous one and hard to read i replied he thinks clay is still alive and that he knows what happened to his daughter nobody else seems to be able to say different but the general wisdom is that clay is dead that or his daughter is the best actress ive ever met merrick tends toward the latter view he used to be a freelance button man a hired killer hes been in jail for a long time but he doesnt strike me as being rehabilitated theres more to him than that though he looked out for one of clays patients while he was in the can even getting himself sent to the max so he could be close to him i thought at first that it might be a jail thingolder guyyounger guybut it doesnt look like it was that way merrick s own daughter was one of clays patients at the time that she disappeared that may be why there was a bond between him and this kid kellog maybe merrick also hoped to learn something from kellog that might lead him to his daughter said rachel probably but he shadowed this kid for years and he protected him it wouldnt have taken him long to find out what kellog knew but he didnt cut him loose he stood by him he took care of him as best he could he couldnt protect his own daughter so he protected kellog instead hes a complex man you sound almost as though you respect him i shook my head i pity him i think i even understand him some but i dont respect him not in the way that you mean theres another way i didnt want to utter it after all it would lead us back to one of the reasons why rachel and i had parted well she pressed and i knew that she had already guessed what i was going to say she wanted to hear it spoken as though to confirm something sad but necessary he has a lot of blood on his hands i said he doesnt forgive i could have been talking about myself and once again i was aware of how much like merrick i once was and might still be it was as though i had been given an opportunity to witness a version of myself decades down the line older and more solitary trying to right a wrong through force and the infliction of harm upon others and now youve crossed him you brought in the police you got in the way of his efforts to find out the truth about his daughters disappearance you respect him the way youd respect an animal because to do otherwise would be to underestimate him you think youre going to have to face him again dont you yes her brow wrinkled and there was pain in her eyes it never changes does it i didnt reply what could i say rachel didnt pursue an answer instead she said is kellog still in jail yes are you going to talk to him im going to try ive spoken to his lawyer from what i hear hes not doing so good then again he was never doing good but if he stays in the supermax for much longer hes going to be beyond rescuing he was troubled before he got there it sounds like hes bordering on insane now is it true what they say about that place yes its true she didnt speak again for a time we walked through dead leaves sometimes they made a sound like a parent hushing a child soothing it consoling it at other times the noise was empty and dry crackling with the promise of the passing of all things what about the psychiatrist clay you say there were suspicions that he might have been providing information on the children to the abusers was there anything to implicate him directly in the abuse itself nothing or nothing that ive been able to find his daughters view is that he couldnt live with the guilt of failing to prevent it he believed that he should have spotted what was happening the kids were damaged before he even began treating them just like kellog he was having trouble getting through to them but his daughter remembers that he was making progress or thought he was kellogs lawyer confirmed as much about him whatever clay did it was working i spoke to one of his peers too a doctor named christian who runs a clinic for abused children his main criticism of clay seems to have been that he was too anxious to spot abuse he had an agenda and he got into some trouble over it that prevented him from making any further evaluations on cases for the state rachel stopped and knelt down she picked a piece of rabbitfoot clover still with one of its fuzzy grayish pink flowers in place this is supposed to stop blooming in september or october she said yet here it is still in flower the world is changing she handed it to me for luck she said i held it in my palm then carefully slipped it into the plastic pocket of my wallet the question still remains if the same people were involved in the abuse of different children then how did they target them she asked from what youve told me they picked the most vulnerable how did they know somebody told them i said somebody fed children to them if not clay then who was it there was a committee formed to select the children who would be sent to clay it had mental health workers on it and social workers if i had to pick id say it was one of them but im sure the cops looked at that angle they must have christians people did too they came up with nothing but clay disappeared why because of what happened to the children or because he was involved because he felt responsible or because he was responsible thats a big leap it just feels wrong clay disappearing like that there are always exceptions but i cant think of a doctor in that situation who would respond in a similar way hes a psychiatrist a specialist not some ordinary joe hes not going to buckle not in the space of a few days so either he ran away to avoid being implicated which doesnt sound right either if he was involved he would have been smart enough to cover his tracks or someone disappeared him maybe one or more of those involved in the abuse covering their tracks but why would he do it blackmail or he may have had those tendencies himself you still think he might have been a participant in the abuse it would be risky too risky she agreed it doesnt rule him out as a pedophile though neither does it rule out blackmail were still assuming hes guilty were speculating thats all it was interesting but it still didnt fit right i just couldnt figure out what was wrong with the picture we headed back toward the house the moon already rising above us in the lateafternoon sky i was facing the long ride home and suddenly i felt unbearably lonely i didnt want to drive away from this woman and the child we had made together i didnt want to leave things this way i couldnt rach i said i stopped walking she paused and looked back to where i stood what happened to us weve talked about this before have we you know we have she said i thought i could handle you and what you did but perhaps i was wrong something in me responded to it the part of me that was angry and hurt but in you its so great that it frightens me and i waited when i returned to the house that time in may when wei dont want to say when we got back together because it didnt last long enough for thatlived together again i realized how much i hated being there i didnt notice it until i went away and came back but theres something wrong with that place i find it hard to explain i dont think ive ever tried not aloud but i know there are things that you havent told me ive heard you sometimes crying out names in your dreams ive seen you walking through the house halfasleep carrying on conversations with people that i cant see but i know who they are ive watched you when you think youre alone responding to something in the shadows she laughed mirthlessly hell i even saw the dog do it you have him freaked out too i dont believe in ghosts maybe thats why i dont see them i think they come from within not beyond people create them all that stuff about spirits with unfinished business individuals taken before their time haunting places i dont believe any of it its the living who have unfinished business who cant let the past go your houseand it is your houseis haunted its ghosts are your ghosts you brought them into being and you can get rid of them too until you do nobody else can be part of your life because the demons in your head and the spirits in your heart will force them away do you understand i know what youve been going through all of these years i waited for you to tell me but you couldnt sometimes i think its because you were afraid that by telling me youd have to let them go and you dont want to let them go they fuel that rage within you thats why you look at this man merrick and feel pity for him and more than that you feel empathy her face changed the tone of her voice transforming with it and her cheeks flushed red with anger well be sure that you look closely at him because thats what youll become if all of this doesnt stop an empty vessel motivated by hatred and revenge and frustrated love in the end were not apart just because im afraid for sam and myself or scared for you and for what might happen to all of us as a consequence of your work im frightened of you of the fact that part of you is drawn to evil and pain and wretchedness that the anger and hurt that you feel will always need to be fed it will never end you talk of merrick as a man unable to forgive well you cant forgive either you cant forgive yourself for not being there to protect your wife and child and you cant forgive them for dying on you and maybe i thought that that might change that having us in your life would enable you to heal a little to find some peace with us but there will be no peace you want it but you cant bring yourself to embrace it you just she was starting to cry now i moved to her but she stepped away no she said softly please dont she walked away and i let her go chapter xvii eldritch arrived in maine early on monday morning accompanied by a younger man who had the distracted yet slightly desperate air of an alcoholic who has forgotten where the bottle is hidden eldritch allowed his companion to make all of the running in petitioning the judge contributing only a few words on behalf of his client at the end of the submission his soft reasonable tones conveying the impression that his client was a peaceloving man whose actions born out of a concern for the wellbeing of his lost child had been cruelly misinterpreted by an uncaring world nevertheless he gave a promise on merricks behalf for merrick did not speak to adhere to all conditions of the court order about to be served and requested with all due deference that his client be released forthwith the judge whose name was nola hight was no fool in her fifteen years at the bench she had heard just about every excuse known to man and she wasnt about to take eldritch at face value your client spent ten years in jail for attempted murder mr eldritch she said aggravated assault your honor eldritchs young assistant corrected judge hight glared at him so hard his hair started to singe with respect your honor im not sure that is relevant to the matter before the court said eldritch attempting to smooth the judges ruffled feathers through tone alone my client served his time for that offense he is a changed man chastened by his experiences judge hight gave eldritch a look that would have reduced a lesser man to charred flesh eldritch merely wavered where he stood as though his brittle form had been briefly buffeted by a gentle breeze he will be chastened for the maximum term allowable under law if he comes before this court again in connection with the matter in hand she said am i making myself clear counsel indisputably said eldritch your honor is as reasonable as she is wise judge hight debated finding him in contempt of court for sarcasm then gave up get the hell out of my courtroom she said it was still early barely after ten merrick was due for release at eleven once his paperwork had been processed when they let him out of the cumberland county lockup i was waiting and i served him with the court order forbidding further contact with rebecca clay on pain of imprisonment andor a fine he took it read it carefully then slipped it into the pocket of his jacket he looked crumpled and tired the way most people did after a couple of nights in a cell that was low what you did he said you mean setting the cops on you you were terrorizing a young woman that also seems kind of low you need to reconsider your standards theyre all screwed up he might have heard me but he wasnt really listening he wasnt even looking at me he was staring at a spot somewhere over my right shoulder letting me know that i wasnt even worthy of eye contact men ought to deal with each other like men he continued red rising into his face as though he were being boiled from below you set the hounds on me when all i wanted to do was talk you and missy both you got no honor let me buy you breakfast i said maybe we can work something out merrick waved a hand in dismissal keep your breakfast and your talk the time for talking with you is done you may not believe this but i have some sympathy for you i said you want to find out what happened to your daughter i know what that feels like if i can help you then i will but scaring rebecca clay isnt the way to go about it if you approach her again youll be picked up and put back behind bars the cumberland county lockup if youre lucky but warren if youre not that could be another year out of your life another year spent not getting any closer to finding out the truth about your daughters disappearance merrick looked at me for the first time since wed begun talking im done with the clay woman he said but i aint done with you ill give you some advice though in return for what you just gave me stay out of this and maybe ill be merciful the next time our paths cross with that he pushed past me and began walking toward the bus station he looked smaller than before his shoulders slightly hunched his jeans stained from his time behind bars once again i felt pity for him despite all that i knew about him and all that he was suspected of doing he was still a father seeking his lost child perhaps it was all he had left but i knew the damage that could be caused by that kind of singleminded intensity i knew because i had once wrought it myself rebecca clay might be safe from him at least for the present but merrick was not going to stop he would keep looking until he found out the truth or until someone forced him to desist either way it could only end with a death i called rebecca and told her that i didnt believe merrick would trouble her for the time being but there were no guarantees i understand she said i dont want men outside my house any longer though i cant live that way will you thank them for me and bill me one last thing ms clay i said if the choice was given to you would you want your father found she thought about the question wherever he is he made the choice that brought him there she said softly i told you before i think sometimes about jim poole he went away and he never came back i like to pretend that i dont know if it was because of me if he vanished because i asked him to look for my father or if something else happened to him something equally bad but when i cant sleep when im lying alone in my room in the darkness i know it was my fault in the daylight i can convince myself that it wasnt but i know the truth i dont know you mr parker i asked you to help me and you did and ill pay you for your time and your efforts but we dont know each other if something were to happen to you because you asked questions about my father then wed be bound by it and i dont want to be bound to you not like that do you understand im trying to let it go i want you to do the same she hung up maybe she was right maybe daniel clay should be left wherever he was either above or below ground but it wasnt up to her or me not any longer merrick was out there and so was the person who had instructed eldritch to bankroll him rebecca clays part in this might have been over but mine wasnt when the maine state prison was based in thomaston it was hard to miss it stood slap bang on the main road into town a massive edifice on route that had survived two fires and even after being rebuilt renovated extended and occasionally updated still resembled the earlynineteenthcentury penitentiary that it had once been it felt like the town itself had developed around the prison although in truth there had been a trading post at thomaston since the seventeenth century nevertheless the prison dominated the landscape of the community both physically and perhaps psychologically if one mentioned thomaston to anyone in maine the first thing that came to mind was the penitentiary i wondered sometimes what it was like to live in a place whose principal claim to fame was the incarceration of human beings it might have been that after a while you just forgot about it or failed to notice the effect it had on the people and the town perhaps it was only those who visited thomaston who immediately felt that an oppressive miasma hung over the place as though the misery of those locked behind the prisons walls had seeped into the atmosphere coloring it with gray weighing it down like particles of lead in the air then again it certainly kept the crime rate low thomaston was the kind of place where there was a violent crime once every two or three years and its crime index was about onethird of the national average it might have been that the presence of a huge prison on the doorstep made those tempted by a life of crime reconsider their career options warren was different though the town was a little larger than thomaston and its identity was not so bound up with the penitentiary the new state prison had grown gradually beginning with the opening of the supermax then the mental health stabilization unit and finally the transfer of the general population from thomaston to the new facility compared to the old prison it was a little harder to find squirreled away on route or at least as squirreled away as a place with a thousand prisoners and four hundred employees can be i drove along cushing road past the bolduc correctional facility on the left until i came to the brick and stone sign to the right of the road announcing the maine state prison with the years and beneath the first commemorating the founding of the original prison and the second the opening of the new facility warren looked more like a modern industrial plant than a prison an impression reinforced by the big maintenance area to the right that appeared to house the prisons power plant bird feeders made from buoys hung on the lawn outside the main entrance and everything looked new and freshly painted it was the silence that gave away the true nature of the place though that and the name white on green above the door and the razor wire on top of the double fencing and the presence of the blueuniformed guards with their striped trousers and the beatendown look of those waiting in the lobby to visit their loved ones all told you didnt have to look too hard to figure out that whatever cosmetic adjustments had been made to the façade this was still as much a prison as thomaston ever was aimee price had clearly pulled some strings to get me access to andy kellog visitor clearances could sometimes take up to six weeks then again price was entitled to see her client whenever she chose and i wasnt exactly unknown to the prison authorities i had visited the preacher faulkner when he was incarcerated at thomaston an encounter that had been memorable for all the wrong reasons but this was my first time at the new facility it wasnt a complete surprise therefore to see a familiar figure standing beside price when i eventually cleared security and entered the body of the prison joe long the colonel of the guards he hadnt changed much since last wed met he was still big still taciturn and still radiated the kind of authority that kept a thousand criminals on the right side of respectful his uniform was starched and pressed and everything that was supposed to gleam did so spectacularly there was a little more gray in his mustache than before but i decided not to point that out beneath his gruff exterior i sensed there was a sensitive child just waiting to be hugged i didnt want to hurt his feeling singular back again he said in a tone that suggested i was forever bothering him by knocking on the door at all hours of the day and night demanding that i be let in to play with the other kids cant stay away from men in jails i said yeah we get a lot of that here he replied that joe long what a kidder if he was any drier hed have been arizona i like the new place i said its institutional but homey i can see your hand at work in the decor the institutional grays the stone the wire it all just screams you he allowed his gaze to linger on me for just a moment or two longer than was strictly necessary then turned smartly on his heel and told us to follow him aimee price fell into step beside me and a second guard named woodbury brought up the rear you just have friends everywhere dont you she said if i ever end up in here as a guest im hoping hell look out for me yeah good luck with that you ever find yourself in that much trouble make a shank our footsteps echoed along the corridor now there was noise unseen men talking and shouting steel doors opening and closing the distant sound of radios and tvs that was the thing about prisons inside they were never quiet not even at night it was never possible to be anything but acutely aware of the men incarcerated around you it was worse in the dark after lights out when the nature of the sound changed it was then that the loneliness and desperation of their situation would hit prisoners and the snores and wheezes would be interspersed with the cries of men enduring nightmares and the weeping of those who had not yet learned to accommodate themselves to the prospect of years in such a place or who would never reach that accommodation tween had once told me that during his longest stretch insidetwo years of a threeyear b ampe sentencehe did not get a single undisturbed nights sleep it was that he said that wore him down the irony was that when he was released he was unable to sleep either unaccustomed as he was to the comparative silence of the city theyre transferring andy from the supermax to a noncontact room for our meeting said aimee its not ideal and you wont get any sense of the max for yourself but its the best that i could do andy is still considered a risk to himself and others price excused herself to use the bathroom before we sat down with kellog that left just me and joe long woodbury kept his distance content to stare at the floor and the walls been a while since weve seen you said long what is it two three years you sound almost regretful yeah almost long straightened his tie carefully brushing away some flecks of lint that had had the temerity to affix themselves to him you ever hear tell what happened to that preacher faulkner he asked they say he just plain disappeared thats the rumor long finished with his tie examined me from behind his glasses and stroked his mustache thoughtfully strange that he never showed up again he continued hard for a man like that just to vanish what with so many people looking for him kind of makes you wonder if theyre looking in the wrong direction up so to speak instead of down above ground instead of below i guess well never know i said guess not probably for the best the preacher would be no loss but the laws the law man could find himself behind bars for something like that and that wouldnt be a good place for him to be if long was expecting me to break down and confess something he was disappointed yeah i hear it hasnt been good for andy kellog i said he seems to be having problems adjusting andy kellog has a lot of problems some of them he makes for himself cant help macing him in the middle of the night and tying him naked to a chair i think someone in this place missed his vocation there we are spending taxpayers money flying bad guys to egypt and saudi arabia to be softened up when we could just put them on a trailways bus and send them here for the first time there was a flicker of emotion on longs face its used for restraint he said not torture he said it very softly almost as if he didnt believe what he was saying enough to enunciate it loudly its torture if it drives a man crazy i replied long opened his mouth to say something else but before he could speak aimee price reappeared okay she said lets see him the door across from us was opened by woodbury and we entered a room divided in two by a thick pane of plexiglas a series of booths each with its own speaker system allowed a degree of privacy to those visiting although it wasnt required that morning only one prisoner stood on the opposite side of the glass two guards hovering stonyfaced behind him he wore an orange jumpsuit and a collarandtie arrangement of chains that kept his hands cuffed and his legs manacled he was shorter than i was and unlike a lot of men in prison he didnt seem to have put on any excess weight because of the diet and the lack of exercise instead the jumpsuit seemed too big for him the sleeves hanging down almost to the second line of knuckles on each hand he had pale skin and fine black hair cut unevenly so that the fringe sloped downward from left to right across his forehead his eyes were set deep in his skull overshadowed by a narrow but swollen brow his nose had been broken more than once and had set crookedly his mouth was small the lips very thin his lower jaw trembled as though he were on the verge of tears when he saw aimee he smiled widely one of his front teeth was missing the others were gray with plaque he sat when we sat and leaned into the speaker before him how you doing miss price he said good andy and you he nodded repeatedly but said nothing as though she were still speaking and he were still listening up close i could see bruising beneath his eye and over his left cheekbone his right ear was scarred and dried blood was mixed with wax in the entrance to the canal im doing okay he replied eventually you been in any trouble uhuh i been taking my meds like you asked me to and i tell the guards if im not feeling good do they listen he swallowed and seemed about to look over his shoulder at the men behind him aimee caught the movement and addressed the two guards could you give us some space please she asked they looked to long for confirmation that it was permissible he assented and they retreated out of our line of sight some of em the good ones continued kellog he pointed respectfully at long colonel sir he listens when i get to see him others though they got it in for me i try to keep out of their way but sometimes they just rile me you know they make me angry then i have problems he glanced at me it was the third or fourth time that hed done it never staring long enough to catch my eye but nodding to me each time in acknowledgment of my presence the niceties over with aimee introduced me andy this is mr parker hes a private detective hed like to talk to you about some things if you dont mind i dont mind at all said kellog nice to meet you sir now that the introductions had been made he was happy to look me in the eye there was something childlike about him i didnt doubt that he could be difficult even dangerous under the wrong circumstances but it was hard to understand how anyone could have met andy kellog could have read his history and examined the reports of experts and not have concluded that here was a young man with severe problems that were not of his own making an individual who would never truly belong anywhere but still did not deserve to end up in a cell or worse tied naked to a chair in an icecold room because nobody had bothered to check that his meds were in order i leaned closer to the glass i wanted to ask kellog about daniel clay and about what had happened to him in the woods near bingham but i knew it would be difficult for him and there was always the possibility that he might clam up entirely or lose his temper in which case i wouldnt get the chance to ask him anything else i decided to start with merrick instead and work my way back to the abuse i met someone who knows you i said his name is frank merrick you remember him kellog nodded eagerly he smiled exposing his gray teeth again he wouldnt have them for much longer his gums were purple and infected i liked frank he looked out for me will he come visit me i dont know andy im not sure hell want to come back here you understand kellogs face fell i guess youre right when i get out of here i aint never coming back here neither not ever he picked at his hands opening a sore that immediately began to bleed how did frank look out for you andy he was scary i wasnt afraid of himwell maybe i was at first not laterbut the others were they used to pick on me but then frank came along and they stopped he knew how to get at them even in the max he smiled widely once more he hurt some of them real bad did he ever tell you why he looked out for you kellog looked confused why because he was my friend thats why he liked me he didnt want anything bad to happen to me then as i watched the blood began to pump into his face and i was reminded uncomfortably of merrick as though something of him had transferred itself into the younger man while they were imprisoned together i saw his hands form fists a peculiar clicking sound came from his mouth and i realized he was sucking at one of his loose teeth the socket filling with spittle then emptying again creating a rhythmic ticking like a time bomb waiting to go off he werent queer said kellog his voice rising slightly if thats what youre saying im telling you now that its not true he werent a fag me neither cause if thats what youre trying to say from the corner of my eye i saw long make a gesture with his right hand and the guards quickly swam into view behind kellog its all right andy said aimee nobodys suggesting anything of the kind kellog was shaking slightly as he tried to keep his anger in check well he werent thats all he never touched me he was my friend i understand andy i said im sorry i didnt mean to suggest anything different what i meant to ask you was if he ever gave you any sign that you might have something in common did he ever mention his daughter to you kellog began to calm down but there was a gleam of hostility and suspicion in his eyes i knew it would take a lot to make it go away yeah some this was after he began to look out for you right thats right she was a patient of dr clays wasnt she just like you were yeah she disappeared while frank was in jail did frank ever tell you what he thought might have happened to her kellog shook his head he didnt like talking about her it made him sad did he ask about what happened to you up north kellog swallowed hard and looked away the clicking noise came again but this time there was no anger with it yes he said softly not yeah but yes it made him sound younger as though by raising the subject of the abuse i was propelling him physically back into his childhood his face grew slack and his pupils shrank he seemed to grow even smaller his shoulders hunching his hands opening out in an unconscious gesture of supplication the tormented adult faded away leaving behind the ghost of a child i didnt need to ask what had been done to him it played out on his features in a series of trembles and winces and flinches a dumb play of remembered pain and humiliation he wanted to know what i saw what i remembered he said it was almost a whisper and what did you tell him i told him what they done to me he said simply he asked me if id seen their faces or heard a name spoke but they wore masks and they never spoke no names he looked straight at me they looked like birds he said all different there was an eagle and a crow a pigeon a rooster he shivered all different he repeated they always wore them and they never took them off did you remember anything about where it happened it was dark they used to put me in the trunk of a car tie my arms and my legs put a sack over my head theyd drive for a time then carry me out when the bag came off id be in a room there were windows but they were all covered up there was a propane heater and storm lamps id try to keep my eyes closed i knew what was going to happen i knew cause it had happened before it was like it was always going to happen to me and it wasnt never going to stop he blinked a couple of times then closed his eyes as he relived it over again andy i whispered he kept his eyes closed but he nodded to let me know that hed heard how many times did this happen i stopped counting after three why didnt you tell anyone about it they said theyd kill me and then theyd take michelle and do it to her instead one of them said they didnt care if they did it to a boy or a girl he said it was just different for each that was all i liked michelle i didnt want nothing bad to happen to her it had been done to me before so i knew what to expect i learned to block some of it out id think of other things while it was happening id imagine that i was somewhere else that i wasnt in me sometimes id be flying over the forest and id look down and see all of the people and id find michelle and id go to her and wed play by the river together i could do that but michelle she wouldnt have been able to do that shed have been there with them all the time i leaned back he had sacrificed himself for another child aimee had told me as much but to hear it from kellog himself was another matter there was no boastfulness about his tale of selfsacrifice he had done it out of love for a younger child and it had come naturally to him once again i was aware that here was a boy trapped in a mans body a child whose development had ceased almost entirely arrested by what had been done to him beside me aimee was silent her lips clasped so tightly shut that the blood had drained from them she must have heard this before i thought but it would never get any easier to listen to but they found out in the end i said people discovered what was happening to you i got angry i couldnt help it they brought me to the doctor he examined me i tried to stop him i didnt want them to come for michelle then the doctor asked me questions i tried to lie for michelle but he kept tripping me up i couldnt keep all the answers straight in my head they brought me back to dr clay but i didnt want to talk to him no more i didnt want to talk to anyone so i kept quiet they put me away again but then i got too old and they had to let me go i fell in with some people did some bad things and they put me in the castle the castle was the name given to the old maine youth center in south portland a correctional facility for troubled youths built in the middle of the nineteenth century it had since closed but it was no great loss before the building of the new youth facilities in south portland and charleston the recidivism rate for young inmates had been percent it was down to or percent largely because the institutions now focused less on incarceration and punishment than helping the kids some as young as eleven or twelve to overcome their problems the changes had come too late for andy kellog though he was a walking talking testament to everything that could go wrong in the states dealings with a troubled child now aimee spoke can i show mr parker your pictures andy he opened his eyes there were no tears i dont think he had any left to shed sure aimee opened her document case and removed a cardboard wallet she handed it to me inside were eight or nine pictures most done in crayon a couple in watercolor paint the first four or five were very dark painted in shades of gray and black and red and populated by crude naked figures with the heads of birds these were the pictures that bill had told me about the rest of the artwork depicted variations on the same landscape trees barren ground decaying buildings they were crude with no great talent behind them yet at the same time a great amount of care had been lavished on some of them while others were angry smears of black and green still recognizably a version of the same locale but created in a burst of anger and grief each picture was dominated by the shape of a great stone steeple i knew the place because i had seen it depicted before it was gilead why did you draw this place andy i asked thats where it happened said kellog thats where they took me how do you know the second time the bag slipped while they were carrying me in i was kicking at them and it nearly came off my head thats what i saw before they pulled it back down again i saw the church i painted it so i could show it to frank then they moved me to the max and they wouldnt let me paint no more i couldnt even take them with me i asked miss price to take care of them for me so frank saw these pictures uhhuh and you could remember nothing of the men who took you there not their faces i told you they wore masks what about other marks tattoos maybe or scars no he frowned wait one of them had a bird here he pointed to his left forearm it was a white eagles head with a yellow beak i think that was why he wore the eagle mask he was the one who told the others what to do did you tell the police this yeah i never heard nothing more though i guess it didnt help and frank did you tell him about the tattoo he screwed up his face i think so i dont remember his face relaxed can i ask a question he said aimee looked surprised sure you can andy he turned to me you going to try to find these men sir he asked there was something in his voice that i didnt like the boy was gone now and what had taken its place was neither child nor adult but some perverse imp straddling both his tone was almost mocking yes i said youd best hurry then he said why is that now the smile was back but so was that hostile light because frank promised to kill them he promised to kill every one of them once he got out and then andy kellog stood and threw himself facefirst at the pleixglas barrier his nose broke immediately leaving a smear of blood on the surface he rammed it again opening a wound on his forehead just below his scalp and then he was shouting and screaming as the guards descended on him and aimee price was calling his name and begging them not to hurt him as an alarm sounded and more men appeared and andy was submerged beneath a mass of bodies still kicking and shouting inviting new pain to drown the memory of the old chapter xviii the colonel of the guards was fuming quietly as we walked back to the reception lobby there he left us for a time aimee took a seat and we waited in silence for long to come back to us with news of andy kellogs condition there were too many people around to enable us to talk about what had occurred i looked at them all caught up in their own pain and the misery of those whom they were visiting few spoke there were older men who might have been fathers brothers friends some women had brought children along for the visit but even the kids were quiet and subdued they knew what this place was and it frightened them if they ran around even if they spoke too loudly they might end up in here like their daddies they wouldnt be allowed to go home and a man would take them and lock them up in the dark because that was what happened to bad children they got locked up and their teeth rotted and they beat their faces against plexiglas screens to numb themselves into unconsciousness long appeared at the lobby desk and gestured for us to join him he told us that andys nose was badly broken he had lost another tooth and he had sustained some bruising during the attempt to subdue him but otherwise he was as well as could be expected the injury to his forehead had required five stitches and he was now in the infirmary they hadnt even maced him perhaps because his lawyer was present on the other side of the glass there were no signs of concussion but he would be kept under observation overnight just in case he had been restrained though to ensure that he didnt injure himself again or try to hurt anyone else aimee retreated to use her cell phone in private leaving me alone with long who was still angry at himself and the men under his command for what had happened to andy kellog hes done that kind of thing before he said i told them to keep a close eye on him he risked a glance at aimee an indication that he blamed her in part for making his men keep their distance he doesnt belong in here i replied judge made that decision not me well it was the wrong one i know you heard what was said in there i dont think he had much hope from the start but what those men did to him took away what little there was the max is just making him crazier and crazier and the judge didnt sentence him to gradual insanity you cant keep a man locked up in a place like that with no possibility of release and expect him to stay balanced and andy kellog was barely holding on to start with long had the decency to look embarrassed we do what we can for him its not enough i was railing at him but i knew that it wasnt his fault kellog had been sentenced and imprisoned and it wasnt longs duty to question that decision maybe you think he was better off with his pal merrick close by said long at least he kept the wolves at bay he wasnt much better than an animal himself you dont really believe that he raised an eyebrow at me you developing a soft spot for frank merrick you better be careful or youre likely to find a knife in it long was both right and wrong about merrick i didnt doubt that he would hurt or kill without compunction but there was an intelligence at work there the problem was that merrick was also a weapon to be wielded and someone had found a way of using him to that end but longs words had struck home just as rachels had i did feel some sympathy for merrick how could i not i was a father too i had lost a child and i had stopped at nothing to hunt down the man responsible for her death i knew too that i would do anything to protect sam and her mother how then could i judge merrick for wanting to find out the truth behind his daughters disappearance still such doubts aside i now knew more than i had an hour before unfortunately merrick shared some of the same knowledge i wondered if he had already begun scouting around jackman and the ruins of gilead for traces of the men who he believed were responsible for his daughters disappearance or if he had a lead on the man with the eagle tattoo i would have to go to gilead eventually each step that i took seemed to take me closer to it aimee returned ive made some calls she said i think we can find a sympathetic judge wholl order a transfer to riverview she turned her attention to long ill be getting an independent psychiatric evaluation done on andy kellog over the next few days id appreciate it if you could make the whole business as easy as possible its got to go through the usual channels but once i get the okay from the governor ill hold the shrinks coat for him if it helps aimee seemed reasonably satisfied and indicated that we should leave as i moved to follow her long gently took my arm two things he said first of all i meant what i said about frank merrick i saw what he was capable of doing he near killed a guy who tried to take andy kellogs dessert once left him in a coma over a plastic bowl of cheap ice cream youre right i heard what andy kellog had to say in there hell ive heard it before its not news to me you want to know what i think i think frank merrick used kellog he stayed close to him so he could find out what he knew he was always pumping him for information trying to get him to remember all that he could about what those men did to him in a way he was responsible for winding kellog up he got him all upset all riled up and we had to deal with the consequences that wasnt what i had been told at the hockey game but i knew there was a tendency among excons to sentimentalize some of those they had met also in a place where kindnesses were at a premium even small acts of human decency assumed monumental proportions the truth as in all things probably lay in the gray area between what bill and long had said i had seen how andy kellog had reacted to questioning about his abuse perhaps merrick had managed to talk him down sometimes but i didnt doubt that there were other occasions on which he had failed to do so and andy had suffered as a result second about that tattoo your boy mentioned you might be looking for a military man that sounds like someone who could have been in the service once any idea where i might start im not the detective said long but if i was i might be looking south fort campbell maybe airborne then he left us his bulk receding into the body of the prison what was that about asked aimee but i didnt answer fort campbell situated right on the borders of kentucky and tennessee home of the st airborne division the screaming eagles we separated in the parking lot i thanked aimee for her help and asked her to let me know if there was anything i could do for andy kellog you know the answer to that she said you find those men and you let me know when you do ill recommend the worst lawyer i know i tried to smile it died somewhere between my mouth and my eyes aimee knew what i was thinking frank merrick she said yeah merrick i think youd better find them before he does i could just leave them to him you could except its not just about him or even andy in this case justice has to be seen to be done someone has to answer publicly other children will have been involved we need to find a way to help them too or to help the adults theyve become we cant do that if these men are hunted down and killed by frank merrick you still have my card i checked my wallet it was there she tapped it with her finger you get in trouble and you call me what makes you think im going to get in trouble youre a repeat offender mr parker she said as she climbed into her car trouble is your thing chapter xix dr robert christian looked distracted and ill at ease when i called unexpectedly at his office on my way back from warren but he still agreed to give me a few minutes of his time there was a patrol car parked outside when i arrived a man seated in the back his head resting against the wire dividing the interior of the car the position of his hands indicating that he had been restrained a policeman was talking to a woman in her thirties whose head kept moving from one point of a triangle to the next from the cop to two children seated in a big nissan x to her right then on to the man in the back of the patrol car cop kids man cop kids man she had clearly been crying her kids still were its been a long day christian said as he closed the door of his office and collapsed into the chair behind his desk and i havent even eaten lunch yet the guy outside i cant really comment said christian only to relent a little there is no easy aspect to what we do but among the hardest and the one that needs some of the most delicate handling involves the moment when someone is forced to confront the accusations made against him there was a police interview a couple of days back and today the mother and children arrived here for a session with us only to find the father waiting for them outside people react in different ways to allegations of abuse disbelief denial rage we dont often have to call the police though that wasa particularly difficult moment for all involved he began collecting papers from his desk assembling them into piles and inserting them into folders so mr parker what can i do for you i dont have much time im afraid i have a meeting up in augusta in two hours with senator harkness to discuss the mandatorysentencing issue and i havent prepared for it as well as i might have wished state senator james harkness was a rightwing hawk with a sledgehammer attitude to just about every issue that came his way recently he had been among those whose voices were raised loudest in favor of mandatory twentyyear sentences for those found guilty of gross sexual assault of a minor even for those who copped a plea are you for or against in common with most prosecutors im against it but to gentlemen like the good senator thats a little like arguing against christmas can i ask why its pretty simple its a sop to voters that will do more harm than good look of every hundred allegations that get reported about half will end up with law enforcement of that fifty forty will get charged of that forty thirtyfive will plea bargain five will go to trial and from that five there will be two convictions and three acquittals so out of that initial hundred we have maybe thirty to forty sex offenders that we can register and of whom we can keep track in the case of mandatory sentencing there will be no incentive for alleged offenders to cop a plea they might as well take their chances in court and in general prosecutors prefer not to go to trial on abuse allegations unless they have a solid case the problem for us as i told you when we last met is that it can be very difficult to provide the kind of evidence necessary to secure a conviction in criminal court so if you introduce mandatory sentencing theres a strong possibility that more offenders will slip through the net we dont get them on the register and they go back to doing whatever it was they were doing until someone catches them at it again mandatory sentencing allows politicians to appear tough on crime but its essentially counterproductive frankly though id have a better chance of making a chimp understand that than i will of convincing harkness chimps arent concerned with reelection i said id vote for a chimp over harkness anyday at least the chimp might evolve further at some stage so mr parker have you made any progress a little what do you know about gilead i assume youre not testing my knowledge of biblical trivia he replied so i take it youre referring to the gilead community and the children of gilead he gave me a potted history similar to what i already knew although he believed that the scale of the abuse was greater than had previously been suspected ive met some of the victims so i know what im talking about i think most of the people in gilead knew what was happening to those children and more of the men participated than was acknowledged at first then the families scattered after the bodies were found and some of them were never heard from again others though cropped up in relation to other cases one of the victims the girl whose evidence led to the conviction of mason dubus the man believed to be the ringleader of the abusers did her best to keep track of them a couple are in jail in other states and the rest are dead dubus is the only one left alive or the only one that we know of even if others of whom were not aware have survived theyre old old men and women by now what happened to the children some were taken away by their parents or guardians when the community disintegrated we dont know where they went the ones that were rescued were put in foster homes a couple were taken in by good will hinckley good will hinckley was an institution close to i that provided a home and school environment for kids aged twelve to twentyone who had suffered molestation were homeless or had been affected by substance or alcohol abuse whether directly or as the result of the addictions of a family member it had been in existence since the late nineteenth century and graduated nine or ten seniors every year who might otherwise have found themselves in jail or in the ground it was not surprising that some of the children of gilead had ended up there it was probably the best thing that could have occurred under the circumstances how could it have happened i asked i mean the scale of it seems well almost incredible it was an isolated secretive community in a state filled with isolated secretive communities said christian from what we now know it seems to have been the case that the principal families involved had known each other prior to their arrival at gilead and had worked together or maintained contact for a period of some years in other words there was already a structure in place that would have facilitated the kind of abuse that went on there there was certainly a clear division between the four or five core families and those who arrived later the women didnt mix with one another the children didnt play with one another and the men kept their distance as much as possible apart from those occasions when work forced them together the abusers knew exactly what they were doing and were possibly even attuned to those who might share their tastes so there was always new prey for them it was a nightmare situation but there was something about gilead bad luck bad timing bad location or hell lets call it a touch of evil and have done with itthat exacerbated it you also have to take into account the fact that people werent as aware of child abuse issues then as we are now it wasnt until that a doctor named henry kempe wrote a paper called the battered child syndrome and started a revolution on child abuse but that paper concentrated principally on physical abuse and even in the early seventies when i started my training sexual abuse was hardly mentioned then came feminism and people began talking to women and children about abuse in kempe published sexual abuse another hidden pediatric problem and the realization that there was a real issue to be confronted probably stems from about then unfortunately it could be said that the pendulum swung too far the other way it created a climate of constant suspicion because science hadnt caught up with the desire to deal with the problem there was enthusiasm but not enough skepticism it led to a backlash and decreased reporting in the nineties but now we seem to be approaching some kind of equilibrium even if we still sometimes concentrate on sexual abuse at the expense of other kinds of abuse its reckoned that twenty percent of children have been sexually abused by the time they reach adulthood but the consequences of longterm neglect and physical abuse are actually much more severe for example a child who has been physically abused and neglected is much more likely to grow up to engage in criminal behavior than a child who has been sexually abused meanwhile from data we know that sexual abusers of children are more likely to have been abused themselves but most pedophiles have not been sexually abused there he concluded you got the lecture now why the curiosity about gilead daniel clay was interested in gilead too he created paintings of it someone told me that he even interviewed mason dubus and he may have intended to write a book about what happened there then theres the fact that his car was found abandoned in jackman and gilead isnt far from jackman it also appears that one of clays former patients was abused at or near gilead by men wearing bird masks all of that strikes me as more than a series of coincidences well its probably not surprising that clay was curious about gilead said christian most people in our field who work in maine have at some point examined the available material and a number of them would have interviewed dubus myself included he thought for a moment i dont recall any descriptions of gilead in the case reports relating to clay although there were mentions of rural settings some of the children caught sight of trees grass dirt there were similarities too in their descriptions of the place in which they were abusedbare walls a mattress on the floor that sort of thingalthough most of the victims were blindfolded for much of the abuse so were talking about snatched glimpses and nothing more could these men have been drawn to gilead because of what happened there in the past i asked its possible said christian i have a friend who works in the area of suicide prevention he talks of clusters of location places that become sites of choice for suicide largely because others have successfully committed suicide in those locations one suicide facilitates another or provides a stimulus for it equally it might be that a place synonymous with the abuse of children could prove attractive to other abusers but it would be quite a risk to take could the risk have been part of the attraction perhaps ive been thinking a lot about this since you came to me its an unusual case it sounds like stranger abuse on a significant scale which is itself out of the ordinary children unlike adults are rarely victimized by strangers intrafamilial abuse accounts for fifty percent of the acts perpetrated against girls and ten to twenty percent of those against boys generally too nonincestuous abusers fall into one of six categories based on their degree of fixation from those who have frequent nonsexual contact with children to sadistic offenders who rarely have nonsexual contact with them theyre the kind who will typically view children unknown to them as victims but the degree of violence inflicted on the children who mentioned the bird masks was minimal in fact only one child recalled being seriously physically injured and she said the man who did ithe began choking her to the point where she almost blacked outwas instantly rebuked by one of the others that indicates a significant degree of control these men werent ordinary abusers not by any means there was planning cooperation and for want of a better word restraint those elements make what happened particularly disturbing are you sure that there have been no similar reports since clay disappeared you mean reports of abuse that tally with those descriptions well im as certain as i can be given the information to hand it was one of the reasons why suspicion fell on clay i suppose could these men just have stopped abusing i dont think so its possible that some of them were jailed for other offenses which would explain the cessation but otherwise no i dont believe that they have stopped abusing these men are predatory pedophiles their pattern of abuse might have altered but their urges will not have gone away why would they have altered their pattern something could have happened something that frightened them or caused them to realize that they risked drawing more attention to themselves if they continued to abuse in this way merrick s daughter drew pictures of men with the heads of birds i said and merrick s daughter is still missing said christian finishing my thought for me the date of clays disappearance coincided roughly with the period when lucy merrick was last seen i said and youve just told me that there were no more reports of children being abused by men in bird masks after that time none that i know of said christian i told you before though theres no easy way to track down those who might have been victims it could be that such abuse did continue but we didnt hear about it but the more i considered it the more it made sense there was a connection between clays disappearance and that of lucy merrick and perhaps a connection in turn between her disappearance and the fact that no other children had reported abuse by men masked as birds after that time the death of a child would that have been enough to frighten them enough to make them stop what they were doing i asked if it was accidental then yes possibly said christian and if it wasnt then we would be looking at something else not child abusers but child killers we were both silent then christian made some notes on a pad i watched the day begin to fade the angle of the light through the blinds on the window changing as the sun began to set the shadows looked like prison bars and i was reminded again of andy kellog does dubus still live in the state i asked he has a place near caratunk its pretty isolated hes virtually a prisoner in his own home he wears a satellite tracking device on his ankle is medicated in an effort to subdue his sex drive and is denied access to the internet and cable television even his mail is monitored and his telephone records are subject to examination as one of the conditions of his probation even though hes old hes still a potential risk to children you probably know that he served time for what happened at gilead he was subsequently incarcerated on three separate occasions for off the top of my head two counts of sexual assault three counts of risk of injury to a minor possession of child pornography and a string of other offenses that all amounted to the same thing he got twenty years the last time suspended after ten with probation for life to ensure that he would be strictly monitored to the grave occasionally graduate students or medical professionals will interview him he makes a useful subject hes intelligent and clearheaded for a man in his eighties and he doesnt mind talking he doesnt have a whole lot of other ways to pass the time i suppose interesting that he should have stayed so close to gilead caratunkwas only about thirty miles south of gilead i dont think he ever left the state again once he got here said christian when i interviewed him he described gilead as a kind of eden he had all the usual arguments at his fingertips that children had a greater sexual awareness than we gave them credit for that other societies and cultures looked more favorably on the union of children and adults that the relationships at gilead were loving reciprocal ones i hear variations on those themes all the time with dubus though i got the sense that he knew they were all a smoke screen he understands what he is and he enjoys it there was never any hope that he might be rehabilitated now we just try to keep him under control and use him to discover more about the nature of men like him in that sense hes been useful to us and the dead babies he blamed the women for that although he wouldnt name any names did you believe him not for a moment he was the dominant male figure in the community if he didnt himself wield the weapon that killed those children then he gave the order for their killing but as ive said those were different times and you dont have to go very far back to find similar tales of the children of adulterous or incestuous relationships who conveniently die nevertheless dubus was still lucky to escape with his life when the people down in jackman discovered what had been going on there they might have had their suspicions but when the bodies of the children were found well that changed everything a lot of the buildings in the settlement were put to ruin only a couple were left standing along with the shell of a halfcompleted church even those might be gone by now i couldnt say i havent been up there in a long time not since i was a student there was a knock on his office door the receptionist entered with a sheaf of messages and a cup of coffee for christian how would i get to talk to mason dubus i asked christian took a huge draft of his coffee as he stood his mind already moving on to other more pressing matters like bullish senators who valued votes over results i can make a call to his probation officer he said as he showed me out there shouldnt be any problem with arranging a visit when i got outside the police car was gone so too was the nissan but i saw it minutes later as i drove back to scarborough it was parked outside a doughnut shop and through the window i thought i could see the children eating pinkandyellow pastries from a box the womans back was to me her shoulders were hunched and i thought she might have been crying i had one more house call to make that day i had been thinking about the tattoo that andy kellog had mentioned and of joe longs view that it might indicate someone who had served in the military perhaps in an airborne division i knew from experience that it was hard to track down that kind of information the bulk of files pertaining to service records were kept at the national personnel records center in st louis missouri but even if i did have a way to gain access to its database which would be difficult to begin with the access would be useless without some clue as to the possible identity of the man in question if i had some suspicions then it was possible that i could find someone to pull the file but it would mean calling in favors from outside and i wasnt ready to do that yet the veterans administration was also tight with information and there werent many people willing to risk a federal job with a pension by slipping files under the table to an investigator ronald straydeer was a penobscot indian from oldtown who had served with the k corps during the vietnam war he lived out by scarborough downs beside a bulletshaped trailer that had once been home to a man named billy purdue but now served as a halfway house for the assorted drifters neerdowells and former comrades in arms who found their way to ronalds door he had been invalided out of the service injured in the chest and left arm by an exploding tire on the day he left nam i was never sure what had hurt him more the injuries he received or the fact that he had been forced to leave his german shepherd elsa behind as surplus equipment he was convinced that the vietnamese had eaten elsa i think he hated that about them more than the fact that they kept shooting at him when he was in uniform i knew that ronald had a contact a national service officer named tom hyland who worked with the disabled american veterans and who had helped ronald to file his claim for benefits through the veterans administration hyland had handled power of attorney for ronald when he was trying to maneuver his way through the system and ronald always spoke highly of him i had met him once when he and ronald were catching up over chowder at the lobster shack by two lights state park ronald had introduced him to me as an honorable man the highest praise that i had ever heard him accord to another human being in his capacity as nso hyland would have access to the records of any veteran who had ever filed for benefits through the va including those who might have served with an airborne unit and who had enlisted from an address in the state of maine or who were claiming benefits here in turn the dav worked with other service groups like the vietnam veterans of america the american legion and the veterans of foreign wars if i could convince ronald to tap hyland and hyland in turn was willing to do me a good turn then i might be able to come up with a potential short list it was almost dark when i got to ronalds place and the front door was open ronald was sitting in his living room in front of the tv surrounded by cans of beer some full but most empty there was a dvd of hendrix in concert playing on the tv the sound turned down very low on the couch across from him sat a man who looked younger than ronald but infinitely more worn for his age ronald straydeer was in good condition with only a hint of gray to his short dark hair and a frame that had held off the onset of latemiddleage spread through hard physical labor he was a big man but his friend was bigger still his hair hanging down in curls of yellow and brown his face grizzled with a threeday growth he was also fried to the gills and the smell of pot in the air made my head swim ronald seemed to be a little more together but it was only a matter of time before he succumbed to the fumes man said his buddy lucky you werent the cops helps if you lock the door i said or even just close it makes it harder for them to enter ronalds friend nodded sagely that is so right he said soooo right this is my friend stewart said ronald i served with his father stewart here fought in the gulf first time around we were talking about old times fuckin a said stewart he raised his beer heres to old times ronald offered me a beer but i declined he popped the tab on another silver bullet and almost drained it before letting it part from his lips what can i do for you he asked im looking for someone i said he might have been in the service hes got a tattoo of an eagle on his left arm and a taste for children i thought that if it didnt ring any bells for you you might be able to ask around or put in a word with your nso friend hyland this guy is bad news ronald i wouldnt be asking otherwise ronald considered the question stewarts eyes narrowed as he tried to concentrate on what was being said a man who likes children wouldnt go around advertising it said ronald i dont recall hearing about anyone who might have those tendencies the eagle tattoo could narrow it down some how do you know about it one of the children saw it on his arm the man was masked its the only clue i have to his identity did the kid get a look at the years years years of service if he served even if he just cleaned out latrines hed have added his years i didnt recall andy kellog mentioning any numbers tattooed beneath the eagle i made a note to ask aimee price to check it with him and if there are no years then he probably didnt serve said ronald simply the tattoos just for show will you ask around anyway ill do that tom might know something hes pretty straight but you know if there are kids involved by now stewart had stood and was browsing ronalds shelves bopping gently to the barely heard sound of hendrix a fresh joint clasped between his lips he found a photograph and turned to address ronald it was a picture of ronald in uniform squatting beside elsa hey ron man was this your dog asked stewart ronald didnt even have to turn around to know what stewart had found yes he said thats elsa nice dog its a damn shame what happened to her he waved the photograph at me you know they ate his dog man they ate his dog i heard i said i mean he continued what kind of fucking people eat a mans dog a tear appeared in his eye and rolled down his cheek its all just one big damned shame and it was chapter xx merrick had told the police that he was mostly sleeping in his car but they didnt believe him and i didnt either that was why angel had been detailed to follow him when he was released from jail according to angel merrick had picked up a cab at the rank beside the bus station then had checked into a motel out by the maine mall before closing his drapes and apparently going to sleep there was no sign of his red car at the motel though and when after six hours merrick had still not made an appearance angel had taken it upon himself to find out what was going on he had bought a takeout pizza carried it into the motel and knocked on the door of merrick s room when there was no reply he broke into the room only to find merrick gone there was a police cruiser at the motel too probably dispatched for the same reason angel had been but the cop had enjoyed no more luck than angel he knew that someone might put a tail on him angel said as he and louis sat in my kitchen walter now returned once more from the care of the johnsons sniffing at angels feet and chewing on the ends of his laces there must have been three or four different ways out of the place that was probably why he chose it i wasnt too surprised wherever merrick had been holed up prior to his arrest it wasnt at a shoppers motel i called matt mayberry to see if he had turned up anything useful ive been kind of busy otherwise id have called you myself matt said when i eventually got through to him he told me that he had concentrated his initial search on tax assessors offices in the city of portland and its immediate vicinity before expanding it to a sixtymile radius ive found two so far one is in saco but its still tied up in litigation after nearly four years apparently the city published a pending sale notice for its tax liens on some middleaged mans property while he was receiving treatment for cancer then without notice allegedly prematurely conducted a sealedbid sale get this though when he refused to leave the property upon his release from the hospital they sent in a swat team to remove him forcibly the guy didnt even have hair the hell is up with you people in maine the whole business is making its way through superior court at the moment but its moving at the pace of an arthritic tortoise ive got copies of pretrial memoranda if you want to see them how is eldritch involved in it hes the owner of record as trustee i ran a couple of additional searches on him though and ive found his name attached to various property sales as far west as california but theyre all old references and when i followed them up title had passed on again the maine sales are the most recent by a long shot and well they dont follow the pattern of the others in what way well i couldnt swear to this but it looks like at least part of eldritchs business lies or lay in sourcing properties for individuals or companies who didnt want their names attached as owners but like i told you most of the references i can find are prehistoric which leads me to guess that eldritch has since moved on to other things or hes just not doing it as much or hes simply learned to hide his tracks better some of these properties have a paper trail after them like you wouldnt believe which could be a way of disguising the fact that despite a blizzard of additional sales and transfers de facto ownership of the premises in question remained the same thats just a suspicion though and it would take a whole team of experts with a lot of time on their hands to prove it the saco sale looks like an error of judgment maybe eldritch was instructed to find a property for a client this one looked like a steal then it all went to hell in a handcart because the city mishandled the whole business it was probably just crossed wires but the result was that eldritch got caught up in the kind of legal quagmire that he seems to have spent so much time and effort trying to avoid which brings us to the second property purchased within weeks of black flags rising over the saco sale its near someplace called welchville you ever hear of it vaguely i think its somewhere between mechanic falls and oxford whatever i couldnt even find it on a regular map its not the kind of place that people put on regular maps theres not a whole lot there hell theres not a whole lot in mechanic falls and welchville makes it look like a metropolis well remind me to search someplace else for my retirement home anyhow i found it eventually the property is on sevenoaks road close by willow brook doesnt look like theres much else nearby which fits with what you just told me so it shouldnt be hard to find number eleveneighty dont know what happened to numbers one to elevenseventynine but i guess theyre out there somewhere those two properties are it for maine so far if you want me to widen the search its going to take more time than i have so ill have to pass it on to someone else and he may not work for free like i do i told matt id let him know but the welchville property sounded like a good place to start welchvillle was close enough to portland to make the city and its surrounds easily accessible and far enough away to offer privacy even a bolthole if necessary people in places like welchville and mechanic falls didnt go sticking their noses into other folks business not unless someone gave them a reason to do it the daylight was gone but that suited us it seemed wiser to approach the welchville house under cover of night if merrick was there then there was some chance that he might not see us coming but i was also interested in the timing of eldritchs purchase of the house merrick had been in jail when the house was bought and was a long way from his eventual release which meant either that eldritch was planning very far ahead or the house was purchased for another purpose entirely according to matt eldritch was still the owner of record but i couldnt see him spending much time in welchville which begged the question who had been using the house for the last four years we took the mustang heading away from the coast skirting auburn and lewiston until we left the bigger towns behind and entered rural maine even though it was within easy reach of the states largest city portland might have begun to sprawl swallowing up smaller communities and threatening the identity of others but out here the city could have been hundreds of miles away it was another world of narrow roads and scattered houses of small towns with empty streets the quiet disturbed only by the rumble of passing trucks and the occasional car and even they grew less and less frequent as we traveled farther west occasionally a line of streetlights would appear illuminating a stretch of road that was seemingly identical to all the rest yet somehow merited an individual touch courtesy of the county why asked angel why what i said why would anyone live out here we had barely left and already he was feeling anxious for city lights he was sitting in the backseat his arms folded like a sulky child not everyone wants to live in a city i do equally not everyone wants to live close to people like you route wound its lazy way through minot and hackett mills then mechanic falls itself before intersecting with there was less than a mile to go beside me louis removed a glock from the folds of his coat from behind i heard the telltale sound of a round being chambered if there was someone living on sevenoaks road whether merrick or an unknown other we didnt expect him to be pleased to see us the house lay some way back from the road so that it remained invisible until we had almost passed it i caught sight of it in the rearview a simple singlestory dwelling with a central door and two windows at either side of it it was neither excessively rundown nor unusually well kept it was simplythere we drove on for a time following the upward slope of the road until i was certain that the sound of the engine would have faded from the hearing of anyone in the house we stopped and waited no other cars passed us on the road finally i made a uturn and allowed the car to coast back down the hill then braked while the house was still out of sight i pulled in to the side of the road and we covered the rest of the distance on foot there were no lights burning in the house while louis and i waited angel scouted the perimeter to look for nightlights that might be activated by movement he found none he circled the house before signaling louis and me to join him using his maglite his fist wrapped tightly around it so that it was visible only to us theres no alarm he said not that i could see it made sense whoever was using this place whether it was merrick or the person who was funding him wouldnt want to give the cops an excuse to drop by while the place was unoccupied anyway you could probably have counted the number of burglaries around here on the thumbs of one hand we drew closer to the house i could see that slates on the roof had been repaired at some point over the last year or two but the exterior paintwork was cracked and damaged in places weeds had colonized most of the yard but the driveway had been sown with fresh gravel and there was a weedfree space for one or two cars the garage to one side of the house had a new lock on its door the building itself had not been repainted but neither did it seem in urgent need of any repair in other words all that was necessary to keep the property ready for use had been done but no more there was nothing to draw attention to it nothing to attract a second glance it was nondescript in the way that only the most purposeful selfeffacement could be we checked the house one more time avoiding the gravel and sticking to the grass in order to muffle our footsteps but there was no sign of anyone inside it took angel a few minutes work with a rake and a pick to open the back door allowing us to enter a small kitchen with empty shelves and closets and a refrigerator that appeared to serve no purpose other than to add a comforting hum to the otherwise silent house a trash can revealed the carcass of a roasted chicken and an empty plastic water bottle the smell suggested that the chicken had been there for some time there was also a crumpled pack of american spirit cigarettes merrick s brand of choice we moved into the main hallway before us was the front door to the left was a small bedroom furnished only with a worn sofa bed and a small table the edge of an offwhite sheet protruded from the innards of the sofa the only splash of brightness visible in the gloom next to the bedroom was the main living area but it had no furniture at all sets of fitted bookshelves occupied the alcoves at either side of the cold fireplace but the only book that gave them purpose was a battered leatherbound bible i picked it up and leafed through it but there were no markings or notes that i could see and no name on the frontispiece to indicate the identity of its owner angel and louis had moved on to the rooms to the right a bathroom what might once have been a second bedroom now also empty apart from the husks of insects trapped in the remains of last summers webs like christmas tree decorations left up past their time and a dining room that bore traces of its past in the form of the marks of a table and chairs in the dust as though the furniture had been spirited away without the intervention of any human agency vanishing into the air like smoke here said angel he was in the hallway pointing his mag at a square door in the floor close by the side wall of the house the door was padlocked but not for long angel disposed of the lock then raised the door using a brass ring set into the wood a set of stairs was revealed disappearing into the darkness below angel looked up at me as if i was to blame why is everything always underground he whispered why are you whispering i replied shit said angel loudly i hate it when i do that louis and i knelt beside him you smell that asked louis i sniffed the air below smelled a little like the chicken carcass in the kitchen trash but the stink was very faint as though something had once rotted down there and had since been removed leaving only the memory of its decay trapped in the stillness i went down first angel behind me louis remained above in case anyone approached the house at first sight the cellar appeared to be even emptier than the rest of the rooms there were no tools on the walls no benches at which to work no boxes stored no discarded relics of old lives resting forgotten beneath the main house instead there was only a broom standing upright against a wall and a hole in the dirt floor before us perhaps five feet in diameter and six feet deep its sides were lined with brick and its base was littered with shards of broken slate looks like an old well said angel who builds a house on a well he sniffed the air smells coming from down there could be something buried beneath the stones i got the broom and handed it to him he leaned in and poked at the slates below but it was clear that they were only inches deep beneath them was solid concrete huh he said thats weird but i was no longer listening for i had noticed that the cellar was not as empty as it had first appeared in a corner behind the stairs almost invisible in the shadows was a huge oak closet the wood so dark and old that it looked almost black i shined my flashlight on it and saw that it had been ornately carved filigreed with leaves and creeping vines less a piece of furniture carved by man than a part of nature itself that had become frozen in its present form the doorknobs were made from cut glass and a small brass key gleamed in the keyhole i shined the light around the basement trying to figure out how someone had managed to get the closet down here to begin with the door and stairs were too narrow at some point in the past there might have been outer doors to the cellar from the yard but i couldnt see where they must have been situated it created the unsettling impression that the cellar had somehow been constructed around this old piece of dark oak for the sole purpose of giving it a quiet place in which to rest i reached out and took hold of the key it seemed to vibrate slightly between my fingers i touched my hand to the wood it too was trembling the sensation appeared to come both from the closet itself and the ground beneath my feet as though deep below the house some great machinery was grinding and throbbing to an unknown end do you feel that i said but now angel was both at once nearby and also a speck in the distance as though space and time had momentarily warped i could see him examining the hole in the cellar floor still testing the slates for some clue as to the source of the smell but when i spoke he didnt seem to hear and my voice sounded faint even to myself i turned the key it clicked loudly in the lock too loudly for such a small mechanism i took a handle in each hand and pulled the doors opening silently and easily to reveal what lay within there was movement inside i lurched backward in shock almost tripping over my own feet i raised my gun the flashlight held high and away from the weapon and was blinded momentarily by the reflection of the beam i was staring at my own image distorted and shaded with black a small gilded mirror hung against the back of the closet beneath it were spaces for shoes and underwear all built into the body of the closet and all empty the two sections divided by a horizontal plane of wood that was almost entirely obscured by a seemingly random assemblage of objects a pair of silver earrings inset with red stones a gold wedding ring a date engraved upon the interior may a battered toy car probably dating back to the fifties its red paint almost entirely worn away a faded photograph of a woman set in a cheap locket a small bowling trophy unmarked by a date or its winners name a clothbound book of childs verses opened to its title page upon which the words for emily with love from mom and dad christmas had been written in a crude halting script a tie pin an old carl perkins signed by the man himself across the label a gold necklace the chain broken as though it had been yanked from the wearers neck and a wallet empty apart from a photograph of a young woman wearing the cap and gown of the newly graduated but these items were merely distractions although everything about them suggested that they had been treasured at some time by their owners instead my attention was drawn to the mirror its reflective surface had been severely damaged seemingly by fire or some other great heat so that the wooden backing was visible at the heart the glass had warped the edges stained with brown and black and yet it had not cracked and the wood behind was not charred the heat that had been applied to cause such damage was so intense that the mirror had simply melted beneath it yet the backboard had been left unmarked i reached out to touch it then stopped i had seen this mirror before and suddenly i knew who it was that was manipulating frank merrick something twisted in my stomach and i felt a surge of nausea i might even have spoken but the words would have made no sense images flashed through my mind memories of a house this is not a house this is a home symbols on a wall in a dwelling long abandoned revealed only when the paper began to come away and loll in the hallway like a series of great tongues a man in a threadbare coat with stains on his trousers and the sole coming away from the base of one of his shoes demanding payment of a debt owed by another long believed dead this is an old and wicked world and a small gilded mirror held in this mans nicotinestained fingers an image reflected in it of a howling figure that might have been myself or might have been another he was damned and his soul is forfeit angel appeared beside me looking blankly at the items in the closet what is it he asked its a collection i said he moved closer and seemed on the verge of picking up the toy car i raised my hand dont touch it dont touch any of it we need to get out of here now and then he saw the mirror what happened to its from the grady house i said he backed away in disgust then looked over his shoulder in expectation of seeing the man who had brought the mirror to this place suddenly emerge from his hiding place like one of the hibernating spiders in the rooms above alerted by the coming of springs first insects aw you got to be fucking kidding said angel why is nothing ever normal i closed the closet doors the key still vibrating in the lock as i turned it sealing away the collection once again we climbed up from the cellar slid the bolt across and restored the padlock then we departed from that place we left no signs of our trespass and as angel locked the back door behind us the house seemed just as it did when we had arrived but i felt it was to no avail he would know we had been there the collector would know and he would come chapter xxi the journey back to scarborough was conducted in near silence both angel and louis had been in the grady house they knew what had taken place there and they knew how it had ended john grady was a child killer in maine and his house had been unoccupied for many years after his death thinking about it now perhaps unoccupied was the wrong word dormant might have been more appropriate for something had remained in the grady house some trace of the man who had given to it his name at least that is how it seemed to me although it might just as easily have been shadows and fumes the miasma of its history and the remembrance of the lives lost there mingling to create phantasms in my brain but i was not the only one who suspected that something had secured itself in the grady house the collector had appeared a raggedy man with yellow nails asking only that he be given permission to take a souvenir from the house a mirror and nothing more he did not seem willing or able to enter the house himself and i believed that at least one man a minor thug named chris tierney had died at the collectors hands after he had dared to get in this strange sinister mans way but the permission that the collector sought had not been mine to grant and when he saw that he would not be given what he wanted he had taken it anyway leaving me bleeding on the ground and the last thing that i saw as i lay there my skull blazing with pain from the force of the collectors blow was the image of john grady trapped behind the glass of the mirror that the collector had taken screaming impotently as justice came for him at last now that same mirror charred and warped lay beneath a deserted house reflecting an assemblage of unrelated objects tokens of other lives of justice meted out by that emaciated figure in the past he had signed his name at least once as kushiel a black joke the name stolen from hells jailer but nevertheless a hint as to his nature or what he believed to be his nature i felt certain that each of the items in that old closet represented a life taken a debt paid in some way i recalled the stink that hung over the pit in the cellar i should make the call i thought i should bring the cops down on him but what could i say that i smelled blood yet there was no blood to be seen that there was a closet of trinkets in the cellar but with only a first name here a date there to connect them to their original owners and what were you doing down in the cellar sir you do know that breaking and entering is a crime dont you and there was another matter to be considered i had encountered individuals in the past who were as dangerous as the collector their natures only some of which i could begin to explain or understand had been corrupted and they were capable of great evil but the collector was different he was motivated by something other than a desire to inflict pain he appeared to occupy a space beyond conventional morality engaged in work that had no time for concepts of due process of law or mercy in his mind those he sought had already been judged he was merely executing the sentence he was like a surgeon removing cancerous growths from the body excising them with precision and casting the diseased parts into the fire now he was manipulating merrick using him to draw unknown individuals from the shadows so that they might reveal themselves to him merrick had been in the house if only for a time the discarded pack and the rotting chicken told me as much the collector also smoked but his tastes were a little more exotic than american spirit through eldritch he had provided merrick with a car probably funds too and also a place in which to stay a base from which to operate but almost certainly with an injunction attached stipulating that he was not to enter any locked part of the house and even if merrick had disobeyed and made his way down to the cellar would those items in the closet have meant anything to him they would merely have appeared to be a random jumble an eccentric amalgam of disparate items held in an old closet that vibrated to the touch tucked into a corner of a cellar that reeked faintly of old rotting things it was clear now that the collector was looking for someone connected to daniel clay although if eldritch was to be believed not clay himself there could be only one answer he wanted those who had preyed on clays patients the men who if i was right were responsible for whatever had happened to lucy merrick so eldritch had been engaged to ensure that frank merrick was freed and pointed in the right direction but merrick was not the kind of man to report his every move back to an ancient lawyer in a paperfilled office he wanted revenge and the collector must have known that at some point merrick would move entirely beyond his control he would have to be shadowed his movements revealed so that any information he gleaned would automatically be shared with the one who had freed him to conduct his search and when the men he sought at last made their move then the collector would be waiting for there was a debt to be paid but who was shadowing merrick again there seemed to be only one possible answer hollow men angel seemed to be following some of my thoughts we know where he is he said if hes tied in with this then we can find him if we need to i shook my head its a storehouse nothing more merrick was probably allowed to use it for a while but ill bet he never made it down to the cellar and ill lay you another ten he never met anyone connected with the house apart from the lawyer the lock on the back door was new said angel i could smell it it had been changed recently probably in the last day or two merrick s key privileges might have been taken away i dont think merrick will care it didnt look like hed been there in a while and hes the suspicious kind anyway my guess is that he cut himself loose as soon as he could he wouldnt want the lawyer to be able to keep tabs on him but he had no idea who was bankrolling his search if he did hed never have gone anywhere near that house but were still ahead of this guy right we left that place just like we found it we know hes involved but he doesnt know that we know the fuck are you said louis nancy drew let him come hes a freak we had our share of freaks before one more aint goin to capsize our boat this ones not like the rest i said why because he doesnt take sides he doesnt care he just wants what he wants which is to add to his collection you think he wants daniel clay asked angel i think he wants the men who abused clays patients either way clay is the key the collector is using merrick to try to smoke them out louis shifted in his seat what are the options on clay same as on everyone else hes either alive or hes dead if hes dead then either he killed himself like his daughter suspects in which case the question is why did he do it or someone helped him along to the same end if he was murdered then its possible that he had some idea of the identities of the men who were abusing those children and they killed him to keep him quiet but if hes alive then hes concealed himself well hes been disciplined he hasnt contacted his daughter or she says that he hasnt which isnt the same thing at all you takin her word for it though said louis im inclined to believe her theres also the poole thing she hired poole to see if he could find her father and poole didnt come back according to orourke in the portland pd poole was an amateur and he may have made some bad friends his disappearance might not be linked to clays but if it is then either his questions brought him into contact with the men who killed clay and poole died for his trouble or he found clay and clay killed him in the end there are only two possibilities clay is dead and nobody wants questions asked or hes alive and doesnt want to be found but if he wants to stay hidden badly enough to kill someone in order to protect himself then what is he protecting himself from it comes back to the children said louis dead or alive he knew more than he was telling about what happened to them we were at the scarborough exit i took it and followed route then headed for the coast through moonlit marshes toward the dark waiting sea beyond i drove past my own house and rachels words came back to me perhaps she was right perhaps i was haunting myself it wasnt a very consoling thought but neither was the alternative that as at the grady house something had found a way to fill those spaces that remained angel saw the way i looked at my home you want us to come in for a while no youve paid for your fancy room at the inn youd better enjoy it while you can they dont do fancy up in jackman wheres jackman asked angel northwest next stop canada and whats in jackman we are as of tomorrow or the next day jackmans the closest piece of civilization to gilead and gilead or somewhere near enough to it was where andy kellog was abused and where clays car was found kellog wasnt abused outdoors either which means that someone had access to a property in the area either merrick was up there already and he didnt have any luck so he was forced to keep yanking rebecca clays chain back down in portland or he hasnt made the connection yet if he hasnt then he soon will but we can still be one step ahead of him the bulk of the black point inn loomed up before us lights twinkling in the windows they asked me if i wanted to join them for dinner but i wasnt hungry what i had seen in the cellar of that house had deprived me of my appetite i watched them ascend the steps into the main lobby and vanish into the bar then reversed the car and headed for home according to a note from bob walter was over with the johnsons i decided to leave him there they liked to go to bed early even if shirley bobs wife never slept straight through due to the pain of her arthritis and could often be seen reading at her window a little nightlight attached to her book so that she wouldnt wake her husband or simply watching the darkness slowly turn into daylight still i didnt want to risk waking them just so i could have the dubious pleasure of giving my dog a bonus walk on a winters night instead i locked the doors and put on some music part of a bach collection that rachel had bought me in an effort to broaden my musical parameters i made a pot of coffee and sat at my living room window staring out at the woods and the waters conscious of the movement of every tree the swaying of every branch the shifting of every shadow and wondered at the ways of the honeycomb world that could have led my path and the path of the collector to cross again the mathematical precision of the music contrasted with the uneasy quiet of my home and as i sat in the darkness i realized that the collector frightened me he was a hunter yet there was something almost bestial about his focus and his ruthlessness i had thought of him as a man unconcerned with morality but that was not true instead it was more correct to say that he was motivated by some strange morality of his own but it was rendered debased and unsavory by the assemblage of souvenirs that he had accumulated i wondered if he liked to touch them in the darkness remembering the lives that they represented the existences ended there was a sensuousness to their appeal for him i thought a manifestation of an urge that was almost sexual in nature he took pleasure in what he did and yet simply to call him a killer was incorrect he was more complex than that these people had done something to bring him upon them if they were like john grady then they had committed some sin that was intolerable but intolerable to whom to the collector yes but i sensed that he believed himself to be merely an agent of another power he might have been deluded in that belief but nevertheless it was what gave him his authority and his strength perceived or otherwise it was clear that eldritch was a key for it was eldritch who sourced properties for him bases from which he could move out into the world and do the work for which he believed he had been appointed the property at welchville had been acquired long before the possibility of merrick s release became apparent true in the interim he had intervened in the grady case and retrieved the mirror that now sat in the cellar closet reflecting a distorted view of the world that might well have matched the collectors own and the other items in his trove suggested that he had been busy elsewhere too yet none of this explained why the collector made me so uneasy or why he caused me to fear for my own safety eventually i left my chair and went to bed and it was only when sleep threatened to take me that i understood my fear of the collector he was always looking always searching how he came by his awareness of the sins of others i did not know but my fear was that i might be judged as others had been judged i would be found wanting and he would visit my punishment upon me that night i dreamed the old dream i was standing by a lake and its waters were burning but otherwise the landscape was flat and empty the earth hard and blackened a man stood before me corpulent and grinning his neck swollen by a great purple goiter but his skin otherwise pale as though no blood flowed through the veins beneath for what need have the dead of blood yet this foul thing was not quite dead for he had never truly been alive and when he spoke the voice i heard did not match the movements of his lips the words spilling forth in a torrent of old languages long lost from the knowledge of men other figures stood behind him and i knew their names i knew them all the words poured out of him in those harsh tongues and somehow i understood them i looked behind me and saw myself reflected in the burning waters of the lake for i was one with them and they called me brother in a quiet township some miles away a figure ascended a gravel drive approaching the modest house from the road beyond even though there had been no sound of a cars engine to signal his arrival his hair was greasy and slicked back from his head he wore a threadbare dark overcoat and dark trousers and in one hand there glowed the ember of a burning cigarette when he was steps from his house he paused he knelt and ran his fingers across the gravel tracing some halfseen indentation then rose and followed the wall of the house to the garden at the rear the fingers of his left hand gently brushing the woodwork the cigarette now discarded among the weeds he reached the back door and examined the lock then took a set of keys from his pocket and used one of them to open it he moved through the house his fingers always searching touching exploring his head slightly raised as he sniffed the air he opened the empty refrigerator fanned the pages of the old bible stared silently at the marks in the dust of what was once a dining room until he came at last to the cellar door this too he unlocked descending into the last place his place yet giving no sign of anger at the trespass that had occurred he brushed his fingertips against the handle of the broom stopping when he found the point at which strange hands had gripped it again he leaned down smelling the traces of sweat picking out the mans scent so that he might know it again it was unfamiliar to him as was the second that he had encountered at the cellar door one of them had waited there one waited while two descended but one of those who had descended at last he moved toward the great closet in the corner he turned the key in the lock and opened the doors his eyes took in his collection ensuring that nothing was missing that no item had been displaced the collection was safe he would have to move it now of course but it would not be the first time that part of his trove had been uncovered in such a way it was a minor inconvenience and nothing more the face of the ruined mirror found him and he stared at his partial reflection for a moment only his hair and the edges of his temples visible in what remained of the glass his own features replaced by bare wood and fused glass his fingers lingered on the key caressing it feeling the vibrations that coursed through it from deep deep below he drew in a final breath as at last he recognized the third scent and the collector smiled chapter xxii i awoke it was dark and the house was silent but it was not an empty darkness and it was not an easy silence something had touched my right hand i tried to move it but my wrist shifted only an inch or two before it was brought up short i opened my eyes my right hand was cuffed to the frame of the bed frank merrick was sitting on a straightbacked chair that he had placed by my bedside his body leaning slightly forward his gloved hands between his knees he was wearing a blue polyester shirt that was too tight for him causing the buttons to strain like the fastenings on an overstuffed couch a small leather satchel lay between his feet its straps untied i had left my drapes open and the descending moonlight shone upon his eyes turning them to mirrors in the gloom immediately i looked for the gun on my nightstand but it was gone i got your piece he said he reached behind his back and removed the smith from his belt weighing it in his hand as he watched me its quite a piece of weaponry a mans got to be serious about killing to carry a gun like this this aint no ladys gun uhuh he shifted it in his hand folding his fingers around the grip and raising it so that the muzzle was pointing straight at me are you a killer is that what you are because if you think so then i got bad news for you your killing days are almost done he stood quickly and pressed the muzzle hard against my forehead his finger lightly tapped the trigger instinctively i closed my eyes dont do this i said i tried to keep my voice calm i did not want to sound as if i was pleading for my life there were men in merrick s line of work who lived for that moment the catch in their victims voice the acknowledgment that dying was no longer an abstract future concept that mortality had been given form and purpose in that instant the pressure of the finger on the trigger would increase and the hammer would fall the blade would begin its linear work the rope would tighten around the neck and all things would cease to be so i tried to keep the fear at bay even as the words scraped like sandpaper in my throat and my tongue caught against my teeth one part of me trying desperately to find a way out of a situation that was now far beyond its control while another focused only on the pressure against my forehead knowing that it presaged a greater pressure to come as the bullet tore through skin and bone and gray matter and then all pain would be gone in the blink of an eye and i would be transformed the pressure against my forehead eased as merrick removed the muzzle from my skin when i opened my eyes again sweat dripped into them somehow i found enough moisture in my mouth to enable me to speak once more how did you get in here i asked through the front door same as any normal person the house is alarmed is it he sounded surprised guess you might need to get that looked at his left hand reached into the bag by his feet he took out another set of cuffs and threw them at me they landed on my chest slip one of them bracelets around your left wrist then raise your left hand against the far bedpost do it slowly now i didnt have time to test the pull on this beauty not with you waking up so suddenly and all and i dont rightly know how much of a tap it might take to set her off bullet from a gun like this would make a real mess even if i aimed it right and it killed you straight off but if you was to panic me well theres no telling where it might end up i knew a man once who got caught by a slug from a in the brainpan right here he tapped the frontal lobe above his right eye i got to admit i dont know what it did in there i figure it must have rattled around some them little sonsofbitches will do that didnt kill him though left him speechless paralyzed hell he couldnt even blink they had to pay someone to put drops in his eyes so they wouldnt dry up he stared at me for a moment or two as though i had already become such a man eventually he continued i went back and i finished the job i took pity on him because it wasnt right to leave him that way i looked into them unblinking eyes and i swear that something of what he was had stayed alive in there it was trapped by what id made him but i released it i set it free i guess that would count as a mercy right i cant promise that id do the same for you so you be real careful putting them cuffs on i did as he had told me leaning awkwardly across the bed so that my trapped right hand could close the cuff around my left wrist then i placed my left hand against the far bedpost merrick walked around the bed the gun never wavering from me his finger poised over the trigger the sheet beneath my back was now drenched with perspiration carefully using only his left hand he secured the cuff leaving me lying in a cruciform position he moved in closer you look scared mister he whispered into my ear his left hand brushed the hair from my brow youre sweating like meat on a grill i jerked my head away gun or no gun i didnt want him touching me like that he grinned then stepped back from me you can breathe easy for now you answer me right and you may live to see another sunrise i dont hurt anything man or beast that i dont have to hurt i dont believe that his body tensed as though somewhere an unseen puppeteer had suddenly given his strings a gentle tweak then he pulled the sheets away from my body leaving me naked before him i think you ought to watch what you say he said it doesnt seem to me like its smart for a man with his dick hanging out to start running off at the mouth in front of someone who could do him harm if he chose it seemed absurd but without that thin covering of cotton i felt more vulnerable than before vulnerable and humiliated what do you want to talk you could have done that in daylight you didnt have to break into my house to do it youre an excitable man i was worried that you might overreact then theres the small fact that last time we were due to meet you screwed me over and i ended up with a cops knee in my back you could say that i owe you one for that he moved the gun swiftly to his left hand then knelt on my legs and punched me hard in the kidney with my body held rigid there was no way that i could move to absorb the pain it ran riot through my system forcing bubbles of nausea into my mouth the weight came off my legs merrick picked up a glass of water from the bedside table drank from it then splashed the remainder on my face thats a lesson i shouldnt ought to have been forced to teach you but you been schooled again in it anyways you cross a man you can expect him to come back at you uhhuh yes you can he returned to his chair and sat down then in a gesture that was almost tender he carefully pulled the sheet back over my body all i wanted was to talk to the woman he said then she called you in and you started interfering in matters that were no concern of yours i found my voice it came out slowly like a startled animal emerging from its burrow to test the air for threats she was frightened it looks like she had good cause to be i dont hurt women i told you that before i let that go i didnt want to anger him again she didnt know what you were talking about she believes her father is dead so she says you think shes lying she knows more than shes telling is what i think i have unfinished business with mr daniel clay uhhuh i wont let it lie still until i see him before me alive or dead i want recompense im entitled to it yes sir he nodded once deeply as though he had just shared something very profound with me even the way he spoke and acted had changed somewhat the little uhhuhs and yes sirs becoming more frequent and pronounced they were ticks and i knew then that merrick was drifting out of the control not only of eldritch and the collector but of himself youre being used i said your grief and anger are being exploited by others i been used before its a matter of understanding that and of receiving proper payment for it and whats your payment here money information he let the barrel of the gun drop until it was pointed at the floor a wave of tiredness seemed to wash over him breaking against his face so that his features were altered confused memories twisting and coiling in the aftermath he dug his fingers deep into the corners of his eyes then drew them across his face for a moment he looked old and frail information about your daughter i said what did the lawyer give you names maybe nobody else offered me help nobody else gave a damn about her you know what it was like for me being trapped in that jail knowing that something had happened to my little girl knowing that there was nothing i could do to find her to help her social worker came to the jail told me shed gone missing bad as it was before when i figured out what had been done to her this was worse she was gone and i knew she was in trouble have you any idea what that will do to a man i tell you it near broke me but i wouldnt let that happen id be no use to her that way no sir so i bided my time and waited for my opportunity i kept it together for her and i didnt break but he was broken something had fractured deep within him and the flaw was progressing through his system he was no longer as he once had been but as aimee price had said there was no way of knowing if he had been rendered more lethal and more dangerous as a result they were two different things though and had i been pressed at that moment as i lay incapacitated on my own bed under my own gun i would have said that he was more dangerous but less lethal his edge had been taken from him but what had replaced it had rendered him unpredictable he was now a prisoner of his own anger and sadness and that had made him vulnerable in ways he could not even suspect my little girl didnt just disappear into thin air he said she was taken from me and ill find whoever was responsible for it she may still be out there now somewhere waiting for me to come get her and take her home you know thats not true shes gone you shut your mouth you dont know that i didnt care now i was sick of merrick sick of them all she was a young girl i said they took her something went wrong shes dead frank thats what i believe shes dead like daniel clay you dont know that how do you know that about my little girl because they stopped i said after her they stopped they got scared he shook his head forcefully no i wont believe it until i see her until they show me her body then shes alive to me you say otherwise again and ill kill you where you lie i swear it you mark me yes sir you mark me well he was standing above me now the gun poised in his hand ready to fire it shook slightly the rage at the heart of his being transferring its energy to the weapon in his hand i met andy kellog i said the gun stopped shaking but it did not move from me you saw andy well i guess you was going to figure out where id been sooner or later how is he not good he shouldnt ought to be in there those men tore something in him when they took him they broke his heart theyre not his fault the things he does he looked down at the floor again once more unable to keep the memories at bay your daughter drew pictures like andys didnt she i asked him pictures of men with the heads of birds merrick nodded thats right just like andy did that was after she started seeing clay she sent the pictures to me at the jail she was trying to tell me something about what was happening to her but i didnt understand not until i met andy they were the same men its not just about my little girl that boy was like a son to me theyll pay for what they did to him as well the lawyer eldritch understood that it wasnt about just one child hes a good man he wants those people found just like i do i heard someone laugh and realized it was me you think hes doing this out of the goodness of his heart you ever wonder who is paying eldritch who employed him to secure your release to feed you information did you take a look around that house in welchville did you venture down into the cellar merricks mouth opened slightly and his features became clouded with doubt perhaps the thought had never struck him that there was someone other than eldritch involved what are you talking about eldritch has a client the client is manipulating you through him he owns that house you crashed in hes shadowing you waiting to see who responds to your actions when they emerge hell take them not you he doesnt care whether you find your daughter or not all he wants is i paused i understood that to say what he wanted made no sense to add to his collection to dispense another form of justice in the face of the laws inability to act against these men those were elements of what he desired but they were not enough to explain his existence you dont know what he wants if he even exists and it dont matter anyway said merrick when the time comes no man will take justice out of my hands i want recompense i told you that i want the men who took my little girl to pay for what they did to pay at my hand recompense i tried to hide the disgust in my voice but i could not youre talking about your daughter not someused car that gave out on you a mile from the lot this isnt about her its about you you want to lash out at someone shes just your excuse the anger flared again and once more i was reminded of the similarities between frank merrick and andy kellog of the rage always bubbling away beneath their exteriors merrick was right he and kellog were like father and son in some strange way you shut the fuck up said merrick you got no idea what youre saying the gun shifted hands again and his right fist was suddenly poised above me the knuckles ready to smash down upon me and then he seemed to become aware of something for he paused and looked over his shoulder and as he did so i sensed it too the room had grown colder and there was a noise from the hallway outside my door it was soft like the footsteps of a child you alone here said merrick yes i replied and i couldnt tell if i was lying he turned around and walked slowly to the open door then stepped swiftly into the hallway the gun held close to him in case someone tried to knock it from his grasp he disappeared from view and i could hear doors opening and closets being searched his shape passed by the doorway again then he was downstairs checking that all of the rooms were quiet and unoccupied when he returned he looked troubled and the bedroom was colder still he shivered the hell is wrong with this place but i was no longer listening to him because i smelled her now blood and perfume she was close i thought merrick might have smelled her too because his nose wrinkled slightly he spoke but he sounded distant almost distracted there was an edge of madness to his voice and i thought then that he was going to kill me for sure i tried to move my lips to pray but i could remember no words and no prayers would come i dont want you meddling in my affairs no more you understand he said his spittle landed on my face i thought you was a man i could reason with but i was wrong youve caused me enough trouble already and i need to make sure you dont trouble me again he returned to the satchel on the floor and withdrew a roll of duct tape he laid the gun down then used the tape to cover my mouth before binding my legs tightly together above the ankles he took a burlap sack and draped it over my head securing it with more tape wrapped around my neck using a blade he ripped a hole in the sacking just beneath my nostrils so that i could breathe more easily you listen to me now he said i got to put some harm your way just to be sure that you got your days filled without worrying about me after that you mind your business and ill see that justice is done then he left me and with him some of the chill departed from the room as though something was following him through the house marking his progress to ensure that he went but another remained a smaller presence less angry than the first yet more afraid and i closed my eyes as i felt her hand brush against the sackcloth daddy go away daddy im here a moment later there was another in the room i felt her approach i couldnt breathe properly more sweat fell into my eyes i tried to blink it away i was panicking suffocating yet i could almost see her through the perforations in the sack darkness against darkness and smell her as she came daddy its all right im here but it wasnt all right because she was approaching the other the first wife or something like her hush no get away from me please please leave me alone hush no and then my daughter went silent and the voice of the other spoke hush for we are here chapter xxiii ricky demarcian was from all outward appearances a loser he lived in a doublewide trailer that for the early years of his occupancy had left him freezing in winter and gently roasted him alive in summer basting him in his own juices and filling every space with the stench of mold and filth and unwashed clothes the trailer had been green once but the elements had combined with rickys inept painting skills to take their toll upon it fading it so that it was now a filthy washedout blue like some dying creature at the bottom of a polluted sea the trailer stood at the northern perimeter of a park called tranquility pines which was false advertising right there because there wasnt a pine in sightno mean feat in the grand old state of maineand the place was about as tranquil as a nest of ants drowning in caffeine it lay in a hollow surrounded by scrubcovered slopes as though the park itself were slowly sinking into the earth borne down by the weight of disappointment frustration and envy that was the burden carried by its residents tranquility pines was filled with screwups many of whom curiously were women vicious foulmouthed harridans who still looked and dressed the same way they did in the eighties all stonewashed denim and bubble perms simultaneously hunters and hunted trawling the bars of south portland and old orchard and scarborough for ratlike men with money to spend or musclebound freaks in wifebeater shirts whose hatred of women gave their temporary partners a respite of sorts from their own selfloathing some had kids and the males among them were well on their way to becoming like the men who shared their mothers beds and whom they themselves despised without understanding how close they were to following in their footsteps the girls meanwhile tried to escape their family circumstances by creating families of their own thereby dooming themselves to become the very women they least desired to emulate there were male residents at the pines too but they were mostly like ricky had once been wasted men regretting wasted lives some on welfare and some with jobs although what work they had seemed mostly to involve gutting or cutting and the smell of rotting fish and chicken skins acted as a kind of universal identifier for the parks residents ricky used to have one of those jobs his left arm was shriveled and useless the fingers unable to grip or move the result of some mishap in the womb but ricky had learned how to cope with the damaged limb mainly by hiding it and forgetting about it for a time until that moment in each day that life threw a curveball at him and reminded him of how much easier things would be if he had two hands to make the catch it didnt help rickys employment prospects much either although even if he had boasted two functioning arms his lack of in no particular order education ambition energy resourcefulness sociability honesty reliability and general humanity would probably have ruled him out of any labor that didnt involve well gutting or cutting so ricky started on the bottom rung at a chickenprocessing plant that supplied meat for fastfood joints using a hose to spray blood feathers and chicken crap from the floors his days filled with the sound of panicked clucking with the casual cruelty of the men operating the line who took pleasure in tormenting the birds adding extra agony to their final moments by breaking wings and legs with the fizz of the current as the chickens dangling upside down on a conveyor belt were briefly immersed in electrified water the action sometimes successfully stunning them but often failing since the birds were so busy squawking and squirming that their heads frequently missed the water entirely and they were still conscious when the multibladed slaughtering machines slit their throats their bodies jerking as superheated water defeathered them leaving their steaming carcasses ready to be chopped into bitesized pieces of flesh that raw or cooked tasted of next to nothing the funny thing was ricky still ate chicken even chicken from the plant in which he had once worked the whole affair hadnt bothered him unduly not the cruelty not the casual attitude to safety not even the foul stink as truth be told rickys own personal hygiene was unlikely to win him any prizes and it was only a matter of getting used to a whole new array of odors still ricky recognized that being a chicken mopper was somewhat less than the mark of a successful fulfilled life and so he went looking for a less ignominious way to make a living he discovered it in computers for ricky had a natural aptitude for the machines a talent that had it been recognized and cultivated at an earlier age might well have made him a very wealthy man indeed or so he liked to tell himself disregarding the many personal failings that had led to his current modest status amid the pinefree and untranquil surroundings of his trailer park it began with rickys acquisition of an old macintosh then progressed through night school and computer books stolen from chain stores until eventually he was downloading technical manuals and devouring them in single sittings the disorder surrounding him in his daily life standing in stark contrast to the clean lines and ordered diagrams taking form in his mind unbeknownst to most of his neighbors ricky demarcian was probably the wealthiest resident in the park to the extent that he could easily have afforded to move to a more pleasant home rickys relative wealth was due in no small part to his facility with promoting the kinds of services that the internet seemed readymade to handle namely those involving the exchange of various sexual services and as tranquility pines had inadvertently given him his start in the business gratitude had imbued in him an attachment to the place that prevented him from leaving there was a woman lila mae who entertained men for money in her trailer she advertised in one of the local pick n throws but despite her cunning efforts to throw the vice cops off the scent by not using her own name and not giving out her location until the john had made his way to her general vicinity she got busted and fined repeatedly her name ended up in the newspapers and it was all kind of embarrassing for her because in places like tranquility pines perhaps more so than in considerably more exalted surroundings everyone needed someone else on whom to look down and a whore in a trailer happily filled the bill for most of lila maes neighbors she was a goodlooking woman at least by the standards of the park and she had no desire to give up her reasonably lucrative profession to join ricky demarcian in hosing down a chicken slaughterhouse so ricky who was familiar with lila maes situation and who enjoyed surfing the net for sexual material of various stripes and who had in addition an enviable grasp of the mysteries of web sites and their design suggested to her over a beer one night that maybe she might like to look at an alternative means of advertising her services they went back to rickys trailer where ricky showed her precisely what he meant once lila mae had opened all of the windows and soaked a handkerchief in perfume so that she could hold it discreetly under her nose she was so impressed with what she saw that she instantly agreed to allow ricky to design something similar for her and promised vaguely that should he ever decide to take a proper bath she might see fit to service him at a discount on his next birthday so lila mae was the first but pretty soon other women began contacting ricky through her and he placed them all on one web site with details of services offered cost and even portfolios of the women in question in the case of those who were agreeable and more important who were presentable enough not to frighten away the customers if the mysteries of their female forms were revealed unfortunately ricky became so successful at this that his endeavors attracted the attention of a number of very unhappy men who discovered that their status as minor pimps was being undermined by ricky since women who might otherwise have availed themselves of the protection offered by such individuals were instead operating as free agents for a time it looked like ricky might begin losing the use of other limbs but then some gentlemen of eastern european origin with connections in boston contacted him and suggested a compromise these gentlemen were mildly curious about the entrepreneurial nature of ricky and the women whose interests he looked after two of them traveled to maine to talk to him and an agreement was quickly reached that led to a change in rickys business practices in exchange for leaving him with the continued use of his single unwithered arm and guaranteed protection from those who might otherwise have taken issue with him in a physical way subsequently the gentlemen returned this time with a request that ricky design a similar site for the women in their charge as well as some more um specialized options that they were in a position to offer suddenly ricky found himself very busy indeed and he was dealing with material upon which the law enforcement community was unlikely to look kindly since some of it clearly involved children finally ricky became a gobetween and crossed the line from dealing with pictures of women and in some cases children to facilitating those who were interested in a more active engagement with the objects of their fascination ricky never saw the women or children involved he was merely the first point of contact what happened after that was none of his business a lesser man might have been worried might even have suffered qualms of conscience but ricky demarcian only had to think of dying chickens in order to banish any such doubts from his mind and so while ricky might have seemed a loser living in a misnamed trailer park whose denizens were frequently on nodding terms with poverty he was in fact quite comfortable in his squalor he spent his money on constantly upgrading his hardware and software on dvds and computer games on scifi novels and comic books and on the occasional hooker whose details caught his fancy he kept his trailer the way it was in order not to attract unwanted attention from the owners of the park the irs or the law he even showered more often after one of the gentlemen from boston complained that his new suit had smelled all the way back down i after a visit to ricky and if that situation arose again then ricky would have to learn to peck at his keyboard using a chopstick attached to his forehead because the gentleman from boston would make good on his original threat to break rickys other arm and stick it up his ass and so it was that ricky demarcian the not suchalosernow could be found in his trailer that night tapping away at his keyboard the long fingers of his right hand extended across the keys as he entered the information that would take a user with the right password and the right combination of pointandclicks straight to some very dubious material the system involved the use of certain trigger words familiar to those whose tastes extended to children the most common being lolly which most pedophiles recognized as an indication that their interest was being piqued typically ricky would give the name lolly to an ordinary unremarkable prostitute who in fact did not exist her details and even her appearance a fiction cobbled together from the histories and bodies of other women once a potential customer had expressed an interest in lolly a further questionnaire would appear onscreen asking for preferred ages with options ranging from sixty plus to barely legal if the latter category was ticked an apparently innocuous email would be sent back to the customer this time with another trigger wordricky favored hobby at this point another term familiar to pedophilesand so on until eventually a customers credit card details would be requested and the flow of images and information would begin in earnest ricky enjoyed working late at night tranquility pines was almost well tranquil at that time since even the bickering couples and shouty drunks had usually quieted down some by three in the morning seated in the darkness of his home lit only by the glow of his screen and with the stars sometimes visible in the night sky through the skylight above his head he might almost have been floating in space and that was rickys great dream to glide through the heavens in a huge ship weightless and unencumbered drifting through beauty and total silence ricky didnt know how old the kids on the screen before him werehe judged twelve or thirteen at most he was always bad with ages except when it came to the really little ones and even ricky tried not to spend too much time looking at those pictures because there were some things that didnt bear thinking about for too longbut it wasnt for him to police another mans tastes tap tap tap and image after image found its rightful place in rickys great scheme slotting into position in the virtual universe of sex and desire he had created he was so lost in the sound and rhythm of what he was doing that the knocking at his trailer door was simply absorbed into the general cacophony and it was only when the visitor increased the force of the impacts that ricky started to discern the new noise he paused in his labors whos there he said there was no reply he went to the window and pulled the drapes aside at one corner it was raining slightly and the glass was streaked but still he could see that there was no one at the door ricky didnt own a gun he didnt like guns much he wasnt a violent person in fact rickys views tended toward the cautious where guns were concerned in his opinion there were a lot of people out there who had no right to be carrying even a sharpened pencil never mind a loaded weapon through a process of flawed logic ricky had formed an equation whereby guns equaled criminals and criminals equaled guns ricky did not see himself as a criminal and therefore he did not possess a gun alternatively he did not possess a gun and therefore he could not possibly be a criminal ricky stepped away from the window and looked at the locked door he could open it he supposed but there now appeared to be no reason for doing so whoever had been at the door was gone he tugged at his lip then went back to his computer he had just commenced checking some of the code when the tapping came again this time at the window he had recently left ricky swore and looked out once again into the night there was now a shape at his door it was a man squat and powerfullooking with a quiff of black hair that glistened with oil what do you want said ricky the man indicated with a nod of his head that ricky should come to the door hell said ricky the man didnt look like any cop ricky had ever seen in fact he looked more like one of the gentlemen from boston who had a habit of turning up unexpectedly at odd times still you couldnt be too careful where such things were concerned ricky went back to his computer and entered a series of instructions instantly windows began to close firewalls were erected images were encrypted and a baffling series of false trails was put in place so that anyone attempting to access the material on his computer would quickly find himself in a maze of useless code and buffer files if they persisted the computer would go into virtual meltdown ricky knew too much about computers to believe that the material his machine contained would be inaccessible forever but he reckoned it would take a team of experts many months before they even started retrieving anything worth further investigation he stepped away from his desk and walked to the door he was not frightened he was protected by boston the word had gone out on that a long time ago he had nothing to fear the man on the step wore dark blue jeans a blue polyester shirt that strained against his body and a worn black leather jacket his head was a little too large for his frame although it also gave the disturbing impression that it had been compressed at one point as if it had been placed in a vise from chin to crown ricky thought he looked like a thug which strangely made him even more inclined to lower his guard the only thugs with whom he dealt came from boston if the man on his step looked like a thug then he must be from boston i like your place said the man rickys face furrowed in confusion youve got to be kidding he said the man leveled a huge gun at ricky he wore gloves ricky wasnt to know it but the gun was a smith designed for use by the fbi it was an unusual gun for a private individual to own while ricky did not know that the man holding the gun did in fact that was why he had chosen to borrow it earlier that night who are you asked ricky im the finger on the scales said the man back up ricky did as he was told you dont want to do anything youll regret said ricky as the man entered the trailer and pulled the door closed behind him there are men in boston who wont like it boston huh said the man thats right well you think these men in boston can get to you faster than a bullet ricky thought about the question i guess not well then said the man i reckon they aint much use to you right now no sir he took in the computer and the array of hardware that surrounded it very impressive he said you know about computers asked ricky not much said the man that kind of thing passed me by you got pictures on there ricky swallowed i dont know what youre talking about oh i think you do you dont want to be lying to me now you do that and well im likely to lose my temper with you yes sir and seeing as how i have a gun and you dont i dont think that would be in your best interests so ill ask you again you got pictures on there ricky realizing that a man who asked a question like that already knew the answer decided to be honest maybe depends what kind of pictures you want oh you know the kind girlie pictures like in the magazines ricky tried to breathe a sigh of relief without actually appearing to do so sure i got girlie pictures you want me to show you the man nodded and ricky was relieved to see him tuck the gun into the waistband of his trousers he sat down at his keyboard and brought the equipment back to life just before the screen began to glow he saw the man approach him from behind his figure reflected in the dark then images began to appear women in various stages of undress in various positions performing various acts i got all kinds said ricky stating the obvious you got ones of children said the man no ricky lied i dont do kids the man let out a warm breath of disappointment it smelled of cinnamon gum but it couldnt hide the mixed scents that the man exuded cheap cologne and a stink that was uncomfortably reminiscent of parts of the chicken factory whats wrong with your arm he asked came out of my mother this way it dont work you still got feeling in it oh yeah it just aint no good for ricky didnt get to finish the sentence there was a searing redhot pain in his upper arm he opened his mouth to scream but the mans right hand clamped tightly across his face smothering the sound while his left worked a long thin blade into rickys flesh twisting as he went ricky bucked in the chair his screams filling his own head but emerging into the night air as only the faintest of moans dont play me for a fool said the man i warned you once i wont warn you again and then the blade was plucked from rickys arm and the hand released its grip upon his face ricky arched back in his chair his right hand moving instinctively to the wound then immediately distancing itself from it again as the pain intensified at the touch he was crying and he felt ashamed for doing so ill ask you one more time you got pictures of children on there yes said ricky yes ill show you just tell me what you want boys girls younger older ill show you anything but please dont hurt me again the man produced a photograph from a black leather wallet you recognize her the girl was pretty with dark hair she was wearing a pink dress and had a matching ribbon in her hair she was smiling there was a tooth missing from her upper jaw no said ricky the blade moved toward his arm again and ricky almost screamed his denial this time no im telling you i dont know her shes not on there id remember i swear to god id remember i got a good memory for these things where do you get these pictures from from boston mostly they send them to me sometimes i have to scan them in but usually theyre already on disk there are films too they come on computer disks or dvds i just put them on the sites ive never hurt a child in my life i dont even like that stuff all i do is what im told to do you said mostly huh you said mostly you get them from boston where else ricky tried to find a way to lie but his brain wasnt working right the pain in his arm was dulling slightly but so was his mind he felt sick and wondered if he was going to faint sometimes other people used to bring me stuff he said not so much anymore who men a man i mean there was a guy he brought me some good material videos that was a long time ago years ricky was lying by omission strangely the pain in his arm was helping him to keep his head clear by forcing him to recognize the possibility that more pain might be to come if he did not play this the right way true the man had brought him material clearly homefilmed but of unusually high quality even if it was a little static in its camera movements but it was as a goodwill gesture he was one of the first who had approached ricky directly in the hope of renting a child for a few hours referred to him by a mutual acquaintance in that part of the state a man well known to those with such proclivities the gentlemen in boston had told him that it would happen and they had been right what was his name he never told me his name and i didnt ask i just paid him it was good stuff more halftruths more lies but ricky was confident in his abilities he was far from stupid and he knew it you werent afraid that he was a cop he wasnt no cop you only had to take one look at him to know that snot dribbled from his nose mingling with his tears where did he come from i dont know up north somewhere the man was watching ricky carefully and caught the way his eyes shifted again as he lied dave the guesser glovsky might almost have been proud of him at that moment you ever hear tell of a place called gilead there was the tell again the body betraying the difficulty the brain felt in disguising the lie no i never did unless it was at sunday school when i was a kid the man was silent for a time ricky wondered if that had been a lie too far you got a list of people who pay for all this ricky shook his head its done through credit cards the men in boston take care of it all i have is email addresses and who are these men in boston theyre eastern europeans russians i only know first names i have some numbers to call if theres trouble ricky swore he thought he had made a mistake by telling his assailant once again that there would be repercussions for hurting him that of course he would have someone to call if the operation was threatened ricky didnt want the man to be reminded that it might be better not to leave him alive the man seemed to understand rickys concerns dont worry he said i know youll be expected to call them about this i figured theyd hear about it one way or the other uhhuh it dont bother me none let em come you can get rid of that stuff on your screen now as he spoke he picked up a cushion ricky swallowed he closed his eyes briefly in gratitude he turned back to his computer and began clearing it of the images his lips parted thank the bullet blew a big hole in the back of rickys head and tore a bigger one in his face as it exited it shattered the screen and something in the monitor exploded with a dull pop and began to burn acridly blood hissed and bubbled in the exposed workings the ejected shell casing had bounced off a filing cabinet and lay close to rickys chair its position was almost too good so the visitor tapped it with the side of his foot sending it sliding over toward the trash basket there were prints on the linoleum from his boots so he found a rag in a closet placed it on the floor and used his right foot to erase the marks when he was satisfied that all was clean he opened the door slightly and listened the sound of the gunshot had been loud despite the cushion but the trailers on either side of ricky demarcians were both still dark and elsewhere he could see the glow of tvs could even hear what they were showing he left the trailer closing the door behind him then disappeared into the night pausing only at a gas station along the way to report a shot fired at tranquility pines and a glimpse of what looked like an old mustang speeding away from the scene frank merrick didnt like people getting in his way but he had a certain amount of respect for the private detective in addition killing him would create more problems than it would solve but killing someone else with the detectives gun would create just enough problems to keep him occupied and only a few for merrick because merrick knew that he was now entirely alone he didnt care he had tired of the old lawyer and his careful questions sometime before and eldritch had made it clear when he came up to portland after merricks arrest that their professional relationship was now at an end the private detectives comments about eldritchs motives and more to the point about whoever had instructed the lawyer to aid merrick had only exacerbated his own doubts it was time to finish this thing there was still some business to be concluded down here but then he would go northwest he should have gone there long before now but he had felt certain that some of the answers that he sought were in this small coastal city but he was no longer so sure and gilead beckoned merrick took the duct tape and stuck the detectives gun to the underside of the drivers seat he had liked the feel of it in his hands it had been a long time since he had fired a gun longer still since he had done so in anger now he had the taste for it again he had been careful not to carry a weapon just in case the cops came for him he did not want to be incarcerated again but the time had come to act and the detectives gun would be more than suitable for the work he had to do its all right honey merrick whispered as he left the light of the gas station and headed east once more wont be long now daddys coming chapter xxiv i lost track of time hours became minutes and minutes became hours my skin itched constantly from the touch of the sacking and the sense of impending suffocation was never far away occasional whispers emerged from the shadows sometimes close by and sometimes farther away once or twice i began to doze but the tape across my mouth hindered my breathing and almost as soon as i fell asleep i would wake again breathing heavily through my nose like a thoroughbred after a long race my heart rate increasing my head straining away from the pillow as i struggled to draw in more oxygen twice i thought that something touched my neck before i awoke and the contact was so cold that my skin burned when that happened i tried to work the burlap off but merrick had secured it well by the time i heard the front door open and close followed by the heavy deliberate tread of footsteps upon the stairs i was completely disoriented but even with my senses confused i was aware of presences receding moving away from me as the stranger approached someone entered the bedroom i felt body heat close to me and smelled merrick his fingers worked at the tape around my neck and then the sack was removed and at last i was able to see again small white suns exploded in my field of vision so that for a moment merrick s features were indistinguishable to me his face was a blank visage upon which i could paste whatever demon i chose constructing an image of all that i feared then the spots before my eyes began to fade and he was once again clear to see he looked troubled and uncomfortable no longer as assured as he had appeared when i had first awoken to find him by my bed and his gaze drifted to the darker corners of the room i noticed that he no longer stood with his back to the door instead he seemed to be trying to keep it in sight as though he were afraid to leave himself vulnerable to an approach from behind merrick stared down at me but he did not speak he tugged at his lower lip with his left hand while he thought there was no sign of my gun finally he said i done something tonight that maybe i ought not to have done its what it is though for good or ill i got tired of waiting time has come to draw them out its going to cause you some trouble mark me but youll get out of it youll tell them what happened here and theyll believe you in the end in the meantime word will spread and theyll come then merrick did something strange he walked slowly to one of the bedroom closets my gun now visible where it was tucked into his belt and rested his left hand against its slatted door his right drawing the smith he seemed almost to be peering through the slats as though convinced that someone was hidden inside when at last he opened it he did so warily slowly easing it open with his left hand and using the barrel of the gun to explore the spaces between the jackets shirts and coats hanging within you sure you live here alone he asked i nodded it dont feel like youre alone he said there was no hint of a threat no sense that he felt i had lied to him only a deeper unease at something he did not understand he closed the closet door softly and walked back to the bed i got nothing against you personally he said were even now i believe you do what you think is right but you got in my way and i couldnt have that worse i think youre a man who lets his conscience bother him and conscience is just a fly buzzing in your head its a nuisance a distraction i got no time for it never did he slowly raised the gun the muzzle regarded me blackly like an empty unblinking eye i could kill you now you know that wouldnt cost me much more than a drop of sorrow but im going to let you live i breathed out hard unable to suppress a feeling that bordered on gratitude i was not going to die not at this mans hands not today merrick knew the sound for what it was thats right youll live but you remember this and dont you forget it now i had you in a mortal grip and i set you free i know the kind of man you are conscience or no conscience youll be all fired up about how i came into your house how i hurt you humiliated you in your own bed youll want to strike back but im warning you that the next time i have you under the gun i wont waste a breath before i pull the trigger all of this will be over soon enough and then ill be gone ive left you with enough to be thinking about you save your anger youll have cause enough to use it again he put away the gun and reached once more for his little satchel he removed a small glass bottle and a yellow rag then unscrewed the cap from the bottle and doused the rag with its contents i knew the smell it wasnt bad and i could almost taste the sweetness of the liquid i shook my head my eyes growing wider as merrick leaned over me the rag in his right hand the stink of the chloroform already making my head swim i tried to buck my body to lash out at him with my legs but it was no use he gripped my hair holding my head still and pressed the rag against my nose and the last words i heard were its a mercy mr parker i opened my eyes light streamed through the drapes there were needles piercing my skull i attempted to sit up but my head felt too heavy my hands were free and the tape was gone from my mouth i could taste blood upon my lips where its removal had torn the skin i leaned over and reached for the water glass on the night table my vision was blurred and i almost knocked it to the floor i waited for the room to stop spinning and for the twin images before me to come together before i tried again my hand closed on it and i raised it to my lips it was full merrick must have refilled it then left it within easy reach i drank deeply spilling water on the pillow then lay there for a time i closed my eyes and tried to quell the sickness that was rising eventually i felt strong enough to roll across the bed until i fell on the floor the boards were cool against my face i crawled to the bathroom and rested my head on the toilet bowl after a minute or two i vomited then fell once more into a poisoned sleep on the tiles the sound of the doorbell woke me the texture of the light had changed it must have been past noon i stood supporting myself against the bathroom wall until i was sure that my legs would not buckle beneath me then staggered to the chair where i had left my clothes the night before i pulled on jeans and a tshirt threw a hooded top on to ward off the cold then tentatively walked barefoot down the stairs to the door through the glass i could see three figures standing outside and there were two unfamiliar cars in my drive one was a scarborough pd cruiser i could tell by the colors i opened the door conlough and frederickson the two detectives from scarborough who had interviewed merrick were on my doorstep along with a third man whose name i did not know but whose face i remembered from merricks interrogation it was the man who had been talking to the fbi man pender behind them ben ronson one of the scarborough cops leaned against his cruiser usually ben and i would exchange a few words if we passed each other on the road but now his face was still and without expression mr parker said conlough mind if we come in you remember detective frederickson we have a few questions wed like to ask you he indicated the third man this here is detective hansen from the state police over in gray i guess you could say hes in charge hansen was a fitlooking man with very black hair and a dark shadow across his cheeks and chin that spoke of too many years of using an electric razor his eyes were more green than blue and his posture relaxed yet poised suggested a wildcat about to spring on easy prey he was wearing a nicely cut dark blue jacket his shirt was very white and his dark blue tie was striped with gold i stepped back and allowed them to enter i noticed that none of them turned their backs on me outside ronsons hand had drifted casually toward his gun kitchen okay i said sure said conlough after you they followed me to the kitchen i sat down at the breakfast table ordinarily i would have remained standing so as not to give them any advantage but i still felt weak and uncertain on my legs you dont look so good said frederickson i had a bad night want to tell us about it you want to tell me why youre here first but i knew merrick conlough took a seat across from me while the others stayed standing look he said we can clear all of this up here and now if youll just be straight with us otherwisehe glanced meaningfully in hansens directionit could get awkward i should have asked for a lawyer but a lawyer would have meant a trip there and then to the scarborough pd or maybe to gray or even augusta a lawyer would have meant hours in a cell or an interrogation room and i wasnt sure that i was well enough to face that yet i was going to need a lawyer eventually but for now i was in my own home at my own kitchen table and i wasnt about to leave unless i absolutely had to frank merrick broke into my home last night i said he cuffed me to my bedi showed them the marks on my wriststhen he gagged me blindfolded me and took my gun i dont know how long he left me like that when he came back he told me that hed done something that he shouldnt have then chloroformed me when i came to the cuffs and tape were gone so was merrick i think he still has my gun hansen leaned back against the kitchen counter his arms were folded across his body thats quite a story he said what gun did he take asked conlough smith ampwesson ten millimeter what load corbon oneeighty grams kinda tame for a ten said hansen you worried about the frame cracking i shook my head in disbelief youre kidding right the hell does that matter now hansen shrugged just asking its a myth you happy he didnt reply you got the ammo box for the corbons asked conlough i knew where this was headed i suppose i knew from the moment i saw the three detectives on my doorstep and had i not felt so sick i might almost have admired the circularity of what i suspected merrick had done he had used the gun on someone but he had kept the weapon if the bullet could be retrieved then it could be compared with the box of rounds in my possession it mirrored exactly the manner in which he had been linked to the killing of barton riddick in virginia bullet matching might have been discredited but as he had promised he had still managed to do enough to land me in a lot of trouble it was merrick s little joke at my expense i did not know how they had traced it back to me so quickly but i suspected that had been merrick s doing as well im going to have to call a lawyer i said im not answering any more questions you got something to hide asked hansen he tried to smile but it was an unpleasant thing like a crack in old marble why you getting all lawyered up now relax were just talking here really is that what were doing if its all the same to you i dont care much for your conversation i looked at conlough he shrugged lawyer it is then he said am i under arrest i asked not yet said hansen but we can take that road if you want to so arrest or conversation he gave me a cop stare filled with false amusement and the certainty that he was in control i dont think weve met before i said im sure i would have remembered just to make sure that i didnt have the pleasure again conlough coughed into his hand and turned his face to the wall hansens expression didnt change im a new arrival said hansen ive been around some though done my time in the big citiesjust like you i guess so your reputation doesnt mean shit to me maybe up here with your war stories and the blood on your hands you seem like a big shot but i dont care much for men who take the law into their own hands they represent a failure in the system a flaw in the works in your case i intend to repair that flaw this is the first step its not polite to disrespect a man in his own home i said thats why were all going to leave now so that i can continue disrespecting you someplace else he waved his fingers indicating that i should stand everything about his attitude toward me spoke of utter contempt and there was nothing that i could do but take it for the present if i reacted further i would lose my temper and i didnt want to give hansen the satisfaction of putting the cuffs on me i shook my head and stood then put on an old pair of sneakers that i always kept by the kitchen door lets go then i said you want to lean against the wall there first said hansen youve got to be kidding i replied yeah im a regular joker said hansen you and me both you know what to do i stood with my legs spread and my hands flat against the wall while hansen patted me down when he was happy that i wasnt concealing assorted weaponry he stepped back and i followed him from the house conlough and frederickson behind me outside ben ronson already had the back door of the cruiser open for me i heard a dog barking walter was racing across the field dividing my property from the johnsons bob johnson was some ways behind walter but i could see the expression of concern on his face as the dog drew nearer i felt the cops tense around me ronsons hand went to his gun again its okay i said hes friendly walter sensed that the men in the yard had no love for him he paused at a gap in the trees overlooking the front yard and barked uncertainly then slowly walked toward me his tail wagging gently but his ears flat against his head i looked at conlough and he nodded his okay i went to walter and rubbed his head you have to stay with bob and shirley for a while puppy i said he pressed his head against my chest and closed his eyes bob was now standing where walter had been minutes before he knew better than to ask if everything was okay i grabbed walter by the collar and took him over to bob hansen watching me all the way will you take care of him for a few hours i asked its no trouble he replied he was a small spry man his eyes alert behind his spectacles i looked down at the dog and while i patted him one more time i quietly asked bob to call the black point inn i gave him the number of the room in which angel and louis were staying and told him to inform them that a man named merrick had paid me a visit sure anything else i can do for you i looked around at the four cops you know bob i really dont think so with that i got in the back of the blackandwhite and ronson drove me to the scarborough pd chapter xxv they kept me in the interrogation room at scarborough pd headquarters while we waited for aimee price to arrive and once again i felt myself following in merricks footsteps hansen had wanted to take me to gray but wallace macarthur who had come in when he heard that i was being questioned lobbied on my behalf i could hear him through the door vouching for me urging hansen to hold off the big dogs for a while i was inexpressibly grateful to him not so much for saving me an unpleasant trip to gray with hansen but for being willing to step up to the plate when he must have had his own doubts nothing had changed in the room since merrick had occupied this seat even the childish doodles on the whiteboard were the same i wasnt cuffed and conlough had given me a cup of coffee and a stale doughnut my head still hurt but i was gradually waking up to the fact that i had probably said too much back in the house i still didnt know what merrick had done but i was pretty certain that someone was dead because of it in the meantime i realized that i had effectively admitted my gun had been used in the commission of a crime if hansen decided to play hardball and charge me i could find myself behind bars with little hope of making bail at the very least he could hold me for days leaving merrick to wreak havoc with the smith after an hour alone with my thoughts the door of the interrogation room opened and aimee price was admitted she was wearing a black skirt and jacket and a white blouse her briefcase was shiny and made of expensive leather she looked all business i by contrast looked terrible and she told me so do you have any idea whats happening i asked all i know is that theyre investigating a shooting one fatality male clearly they think you may be able to help them with some details like how i shot him bet youre glad you held on to my card now she said i think it brought me bad luck you want to tell me how much i went through everything with her from merrick s arrival at the house to ronson putting me in the back of the cruiser i left nothing out apart from the voices aimee didnt need to hear about that how dumb are you she said when i was done children know better than to answer a cops questions without a lawyer being present i was tired my head was hurting i realized how pathetic i sounded dummy dont say another word not unless you get the nod from me she went back to the door and knocked to indicate that the cops could enter conlough came in followed by hansen they took seats across from us i wondered how many people were crowded around the computer monitor outside listening to the questions and answers being relayed from the room watching four figures dance around one another without moving aimee held up a hand you need to tell us what this is about first she said conlough looked to hansen a man named ricky demarcian died last night he was shot in the head over at a trailer park named tranquility pines we have a witness who says that a mustang matching the one owned by your client was seen driving away from the scene he even gave us the tag number i could imagine what was happening at tranquility pines as we spoke the state cids crime scene unit would be there along with the white truck of scarborough s own evidence technician its rear doors personalized with blowups of his thumbprints he was regarded as one of the best evidence techs in the state a painfully meticulous man and it was unlikely that the state guys would discourage him from working alongside their own people the redandwhite mobile command center used in conjunction with the fire department would also be present there would be bystanders rubberneckers potential witnesses being interviewed trucks from the various local network affiliates a whole circus converging on one little trailer in one sorry trailer park they would take casts at the scene hoping to match the treads to the tires on my mustang they wouldnt find any matches but it wouldnt matter they could argue that the car might have been parked on the road away from the dirt absence of a link to my car wouldnt prove my innocence meanwhile hansen had probably set in motion the processes necessary to secure a warrant to search my home including my garage if he didnt already have one he would want the car and the gun in the absence of the latter he would settle for the box of corbon ammunition a witness said aimee really she gave the word just enough spin to suggest that she found this possibility about as believable as a rumor that the tooth fairy had been nabbed with a bag of teeth whos the witness hansen didnt move but conlough shifted almost imperceptibly in his chair no witness the tipoff was anonymous in which case it came from merrick it didnt help my situation though i knew from their questions about the ammunition that merrick had used my gun to kill demarcian and had probably left evidence at the scene was it just a bullet or a shell casing or had he left the gun as well if he had then my prints not his would be all over it i got to put some harm your way just to be sure that you got your days filled without worrying about me we cant say right now said hansen and i hate to sound like a bad movie but were supposed to be asking the questions aimee shrugged ask away first of all though id like you to get a doctor in here i want the bruises on my clients side photographed youll see that they contain marks that look like the impact of a fist a doctor will be able to say how recent they are he has also recently lost skin from his lips due to the removal of the tape from his mouth well want those injuries photographed too id also like to get blood and urine samples taken to confirm the presence of aboveaverage levels of trichloromethane in my clients bloodstream she fired these demands out like bullets conlough seemed to take the full force of them trichlowhat he asked looking to hansen for help chloroform explained hansen he didnt appear ruffled you could just have said chloroform he added to aimee i could but it wouldnt have sounded half as impressive well wait for the doctor to arrive then you can start asking your questions the two detectives left without saying anything further after an hour had passed during which aimee and i sat in silence a doctor arrived from the maine medical center in scarborough he escorted me to the mens room and there i gave a urine sample and he took some blood from my arm when he was done he examined the bruising on my side aimee entered with a digital camera and took photographs of the bruises and the cuts to my lips when she was done we were escorted back to the interrogation room where conlough and hansen were already waiting for us we went through most of the earlier questions again each time i waited for aimee to indicate that it was safe to answer before i opened my mouth when it got to the subject of the ammunition though she raised her pen my client has already told you that mr merrick stole his weapon we want to be certain that the ammunition matches said hansen really asked aimee and there it was again that sweetened skepticism like a lemon coated in castor sugar why hansen didnt answer neither did conlough you dont have the gun do you detectives said aimee you dont have a witness either all you have at a guess are a discarded shell casing and probably the bullet itself am i right hansen tried to stare her down but eventually gave up conlough was staring at his fingernails am i right aimee said again hansen nodded he looked like a chastened schoolchild as i had guessed it was a nice touch merrick had left the same kind of evidence at the scene that at one point might have been used to convict him no court would now convict on that basis alone but merrick had still succeeded in muddying the waters we can get a warrant said hansen do that said aimee no aimee glared at me hansen and conlough both looked up you wont need a warrant what are you began aimee but i stopped her by placing my hand on her arm ill hand over the ammunition match away he took my gun and used it to kill demarcian then left the casing and made the call so youd come knocking on my door its his idea of a joke merrick was facing a murder trial in virginia on the basis of a bullet match and nothing more but the case fell apart when the fbi started making panicked noises about the reliability of the tests even without that the case probably wouldnt have held up merrick did it to cause me trouble and thats all and why would be do that asked conlough you know the answer you interviewed him in this room his daughter disappeared while he was in jail he wants to find out what happened to her he felt i was getting in his way why didnt he just kill you asked hansen he sounded like he could have forgiven merrick the impulse it wouldnt have been right not in his eyes he has a code of sorts not enough of a code to stop him from putting a bullet through ricky demarcians head assuming youre telling the truth said hansen why would i want to kill demarcian i asked i never even heard of him until this morning again conlough and hansen exchanged glances after a few seconds hansen let out a deep breath and made a go ahead gesture with his right hand he already seemed on the verge of giving up his earlier confidence was dissipating the bruising the tests to confirm the traces of chloroform all had rattled him secretly too i think he knew i was telling the truth he just didnt want to believe it it would have given him some pleasure to lock me up i offended his sense of order still however much he disliked me he was enough of a bythebook cop not to want to rig the evidence only to have the case explode in his face the first time it went before a judge demarcians trailer was packed to the gills with computer equipment said conlough we think he had ties to organized crime in boston seems like he took care of some escort web sites for the italians conlough shook his head russians not good people nope we heard talk that it wasnt just older escorts either kids conlough looked to hansen again but hansen had retreated into a studied silence like i said it was talk but there was no evidence without evidence we couldnt get a warrant we were working on it trying to find a way onto demarcians list but it was slow looks like your problem is solved i said you sure you never heard of demarcian asked hansen he sounds like the kind of guy youd have no problem shooting in the head what do you mean by that i asked wouldnt be the first time that gun of yours made a hole in someone you might just have felt that demarcian was a deserving cause i felt aimees hand touch my leg gently under the table warning me not to be drawn out by hansen you want to charge me with something go ahead i said otherwise youre just using up good air i turned my attention back to conlough was the gunshot the only injury to demarcian conlough didnt answer he couldnt i supposed without giving away what little evidence they still had against me i kept going if merrick tortured him first then it could be that demarcian told him something he could use before he died what would demarcian know asked conlough the tone of the interview had altered perhaps conlough hadnt been convinced of my involvement right from the start but now we had moved from an interrogation situation to two men thinking aloud unfortunately hansen didnt care much for the new direction he muttered something that sounded like bullshit even though hansen was ostensibly in charge conlough glanced at him in warning but the remains of the fire that had been lit in hansen still glowed and he wasnt about to extinguish it unless he had no other choice he gave it one last try its bullshit he repeated its your gun its your car the witness saw leaving the scene its your finger hey conlough interrupted him he stood and walked to the door indicating that hansen should follow him hansen threw back his chair and went the door closed behind them not a fan of yours said aimee ive never met him properly before today the state cops dont care much for me as a rule but he has a terminal beef i may have to juice up my rates nobody seems to like you occupational hazard how are we doing okay i think apart from your inability to keep your mouth shut lets assume merrick used your gun to kill demarcian lets assume also that he made the call about your car all they have is ballistic evidence and no direct connection to you apart from the box of shells its not enough to charge you with anything not until they get a ballistics match or a print from the casing even then i cant see the ags office going ahead unless the cops come up with more evidence linking you to the scene they wont have trouble getting a warrant to search your home for the box of ammunition so you may be right just to hand it over if things turn bad it might help us with a judge if youve cooperated from the start if they have the gun though then we could find ourselves with real difficulties why would i leave my gun at the scene you know they wont think that way if its enough to hold you then theyll use it well wait and see if they have the gun theyll spring it on us soon enough my guess though from watching you and detective conlough bond over the table is that the gun went with merrick she tapped her pen on the table conlough doesnt seem to like hansen much either conloughs okay but i dont think hed put it past me to kill someone like demarcian either he just figures id do a better job of covering my tracks if i did kill him and youd have waited until he had a gun in his hand added aimee jesus its like the wild west the minutes ticked by fifteen twenty thirty aimee checked her watch what the hell are they doing out there she was about to get up and find out what was going on when i heard a peculiar yet familiar sound it was a dog barking it sounded a lot like walter i think thats my dog i said they brought your dog in as what a witness the door of the interrogation room opened and conlough entered he looked almost relieved youre off the hook he said well need you to sign a statement but otherwise youre free to go aimee tried to hide her surprise but failed we followed conlough outside bob and shirley johnson were in the reception area bob standing and holding walter on the end of a leash shirley sitting on a hard plastic chair her wheeled walker beside her seems the old lady doesnt sleep so good said conlough she likes to sit at her window when her joints hurt she saw your guy leave the house at three am then return at five she swore a statement to say your car never left its garage and you didnt leave the house the threefive window matches demarcians time of death he smiled grimly hansens pretty pissed he liked you for the shooting then the smile faded you dont need me to remind you but i will anyway merrick has your gun he used it to kill demarcian i was you id be looking to get it back before he uses it again in the meantime you ought to learn to take better care of your property he turned on his heel i went over to the johnsons to thank them predictably walter went nuts another hour later my statement duly signed i was allowed to leave aimee price drove me home the johnsons had gone ahead with walter mainly because aimee refused to have him in her car any word on andy kellogs transfer i asked im trying to get a hearing over the next day or two you ask him about that tattoo he said there were no dates no numbers it was just an eagles head i swore silently it meant that ronald straydeers contact would be of no help another line of inquiry had ended in nothing how is andy recovering his nose is still a mess and mentally hes been talking about you and about merrick anything interesting he thinks merrick is going to kill you well he wasnt far off the mark but merrick had his chance he didnt take it it doesnt mean he wont try again i dont understand why he wants you out of the way so badly hes a revenger he doesnt want anyone to deprive him of his chance of retribution he thinks his daughters dead yes he doesnt want to admit it but he knows its the truth do you think shes dead yes so what are you going to do now i have another lawyer to visit then im going to head up to jackman two lawyers in one day you must be mellowing ive had my shots i should be okay she snorted but didnt reply thanks for coming out here i said i appreciate it im billing you it wasnt charity we pulled up in front of my house i got out of the car and thanked aimee again just remember she said im a lawyer not a doctor you tangle with merrick again and my services wont be much use to you i tangle with merrick again and one of us wont need a doctor or a lawyer hell be beyond the help of either she shook her head there you go with the wild west stuff again you take care of yourself i cant see anyone else willing to do it she drove away i walked over to the johnsons and had a cup of coffee with them walter would have to stay with them for a few more days they didnt mind i dont think walter minded either they fed him better than i did they even fed him better than i fed myself then i went home showered to remove the smell and feel of the interrogation room and put on a jacket and shirt conlough was right i had to find merrick before he used the smith again i knew where to start too there was a lawyer down in the commonwealth with some questions to answer i had avoided confronting him again until now but i no longer had a choice as i dressed i thought about why i had delayed talking to eldritch again it was partly because i believed that he wouldnt be of much help unless the stakes were raised and merrick s killing of demarcian had certainly done that but i also knew that there was another reason for my reluctance his client against my better judgment and against all of my strongest instincts i was being drawn inexorably into the world of the collector four into the dark night resignedly i go i am not so afraid of the dark night as the friends i do not know i do not fear the night above as i fear the friends below stevie smith dirge chapter xxvi i made the call while i was slipping a speed loader for the into my jacket pocket louis answered on the second ring he and angel had hit the collectors safe house within an hour of bob johnsons call to the inn and had left a message on my cell informing me that they were to use angels words in country so i figure you got busted from the joint said louis yeah it was spectacular explosions gunfire the whole deal you ought to have been there anywhere be better than here he sounded tetchy spending long periods of time with his partner in an enclosed space tended to do that to him i figured their home life must be something to see you say that now before this is over ill bet youll be looking back fondly on your time spent in that car you find anything we got nothing cause theres nothing to get house is empty we checked before we start freezing our asses off out here nothings changed since then we still freezing our asses off place still looked the same except for one small difference the closet in the basement was empty looks like the freak moved his collection the collector knew that someone had been in his house he had discovered the trespass in his own way leave it i said if merrick hasnt returned there by now hes not going to it had been a long shot to begin with merrick knew that the house would be the first place we would look for him he had gone underground instead i told louis to have angel drop him in augusta then pick up a rental car and head back to scarborough angel would drive north to jackman to see what he could find out there as well as keeping watch for merrick because i was certain that merrick would head for jackman and gilead eventually how come he get to go to jackman and i got to stay down there with you asked louis you know when you drop a lump of coal in snow i said yeah well thats why youre not going to jackman you a closet racist man you know sometimes i almost forget youre black yeah well i never forget youre white i seen you dance with that he hung up my next call was to rebecca clay to inform her that merrick was well and truly off the leash she didnt take the news well but agreed to let jackie garner shadow her again with the fulcis in tow even if she hadnt agreed i would have browbeaten her into it eventually moments after i finished talking to rebecca i received a call from an unexpected source joel harmon was on the end of the line not his secretary not todd the driver who knew how to hold a gun but the man himself someone broke into my house early this morning he said i was up in bangor last night so i wasnt there when it happened todd discovered the damage to the window this morning why are you telling me this mr harmon i wasnt on joel harmons dime and my head still ached from the chloroform my office was ransacked im trying to figure out if anything was taken but i thought you might be interested to know that one of daniel clays paintings was vandalized nothing else was damaged in the same way and none of the other paintings were touched but the gilead landscape was torn apart dont you have an alarm system its hooked up to the telephone the line was cut and there was nobody in the house only my wife there was a pause she slept through it all thats quite a deep sleep mr harmon dont be a smartass youve met her you dont need me to tell you that shes doped up to the eyeballs she could sleep through the apocalypse any indication of who might have been responsible you talk like a fucking lawyer you know that i could almost hear the spittle landing on the phone of course i have a fucking idea he cut the phone lines but one of the security cameras on the grounds picked him up the scarborough cops came out here and identified him as frank merrick this is the same guy whos been terrorizing rebecca clay right now i hear he may have blown some pedophiles head off in a trailer park on the same night he busted into the house where my wife was sleeping the hell does he want from me you were a friend of daniel clays he wants to find him maybe he figured youd know where he was if i knew where he was id have told someone long before now my question is how did he know to come looking for me i found out about you and clay easily enough so could merrick yeah well how come that the night you came to see me the car merrick was driving at the time was seen outside my property you know what i think you fucking asshole i think he followed you you brought him to my door you put my family at risk all for a man whos long dead you prick i hung up harmon was probably right but i didnt want to hear about it i had enough baggage to carry already and too much on my mind to worry about his painting or his anger at me at least the damage confirmed my suspicion that gilead was merrick s ultimate destination i felt as if i had spent a week wading through mud and i regretted the day that rebecca clay had called me i wasnt even sure what i was looking for anymore rebecca had hired me to get rid of merrick and instead he was roaming wild ricky demarcian was dead and the use of my gun made me culpable in his killing according to the police demarcian had been involved in child pornography and possibly even the supply of women and children to clients someone had handed him on a plate to merrick who might simply have killed him out of rage finding in demarcians shooting a convenient outlet for some of his own anger at whoever was responsible for what had happened to his daughter or he might have learned something from demarcian before his death if he did then demarcian was also a piece of the puzzle linked to clay and gilead and abusers with the faces of birds but the man with the eagle tattoo the only solid means of identifying those responsible for abusing andy kellog and it seemed lucy merrick remained elusive i couldnt talk to any more of the victims because they were protected by bonds of confidentiality or by the simple fact that nobody was aware of who they were and i was still no closer to discovering the truth about daniel clays disappearance or the extent of his involvement in the abuse of his patients but nobody had asked me to do that anyway i had never felt more frustrated more at a loss as to how to proceed so i decided to place my head in the lions mouth i made a call and told the woman on the other end of the phone that i was on my way to see her boss she didnt reply but it didnt matter the collector would find out soon enough the office of eldritch and associates was still knee deep in old paper and short on associates when i arrived it was also short of eldritches he aint here said the secretary her hair was still big and still black but this time her blouse was dark blue with a white frilled collar an overlarge silver crucifix hung from a chain around her neck she looked like a minister who specialized in cheap lesbian weddings you hadnt hung up so soon id have told you you were wasting your time coming down here when are you expecting him back when he comes back im his secretary not his keeper she fed a sheet of paper into an old electric typewriter and began tapping out a letter her cigarette never moved from the corner of her mouth she had perfected the art of puffing on it without touching it with her hand until it became necessary to do so in order to prevent the dangling column of ash from sending her to meet her maker in an inferno of burning paper assuming her maker was prepared to own up and claim her maybe you could call him and let him know that im here i said after a couple of minutes had passed in noncompanionable silence he doesnt use a cell phone he doesnt like em says they give you cancer she squinted at me you use a cell phone yes good she returned to her typing i took in the nicotineencrusted walls and ceiling a safe workplace is a happy workplace i said i can wait for him not here you cant were closing for lunch kind of early for lunch its a busy day i been run off my feet she finished typing then carefully removed the letter from the typewriter the letter was then added to a pile of similar documents in a wire tray none of which looked like they were ever likely to be sent some of those at the bottom had already yellowed do you ever get rid of any of this stuff i asked indicating the stacks of paper and dusty files sometimes people die she said then we move their files to a storage facility they could die here and just be buried under paper she stood and retrieved a drab olive overcoat from a battered coatrack you have to go now she said youre just too much fun for me ill come back after lunch you do that any idea when that might be nope could be a long one ill be waiting when you return uhhuh be still my heart she opened the office door and waited for me to leave before locking it with a brass key that she kept in her purse then she followed me down the stairs and doublelocked the main door before climbing into a rusted brown caddy parked in tulleys lot my own car was down the block there didnt seem to be much more that i could do other than to get a bite to eat and wait around in the hope that eldritch might materialize unless i just gave up and drove home even if eldritch made an appearance he wasnt my principal reason for being there it was the man who paid his bills i couldnt force eldritch to tell me more about him well i could but i found it hard to imagine myself grappling with the old lawyer in an effort to make him confess what he knew at worst i saw him disintegrate into fragments of dust in my hands staining my jacket with his remains and then a pungent hint of nicotine stung my nostrils blown toward me by the wind the smell was peculiarly acrid heavy with poisons and i could almost feel cells in my body threatening to metastasize in protest i turned around the dive bar at the opposite end of the block from tulleys was open for business or at least as open as it could be when its windows were covered with wire mesh its windowless door scuffed and scarred and the lower half blackened where an attempt had been made to set it on fire a sign at eye level advised that anyone who looked under the age of twentyone would be asked for identification someone had altered the two to make it look like a one a man stood outside his dark hair slicked back the ends congregating in a mass of untidy greasy curls just below his collar his oncewhite shirt had faded to yellow the collar unbuttoned to reveal dark stains along the inside that no amount of washing could ever remove his old black coat was frayed at the ends the stray threads moving slowly in the breeze like the legs of dying insects his trousers were too long the ends touching the ground and almost entirely obscuring the thicksoled shoes that he wore the fingers that clutched the cigarette were burned a deep yellow at the tips the nails were long and furrowed with dirt impacted beneath them the collector took a final drag on the cigarette then flicked it neatly into the gutter he held in the smoke as though draining it of every last iota of nicotine then released it in wisps from his nostrils and the corners of his mouth so that he appeared to be burning inside he regarded me silently through the fumes then opened the door to the bar and with a last glance in my direction disappeared from within after only a moments pause i followed chapter xxvii the interior of the bar wasnt nearly as bad as its façade might have led a casual observer to expect on the other hand the façade suggested that the interior would be occupied by intoxicated twelveyearolds and frustrated firebugs so it didnt have to do much to exceed those expectations it was dark lit only by a series of flickering lamps on the walls as the windows facing the street were masked by thick red drapes on the inside a bartender in a startlingly white shirt prowled the long bar to the right three or four of its stools occupied by the usual assortment of daytime rummies blinking indignantly at the unwelcome shaft of sunlight from the open door the bar was strangely ornate and behind it reflecting the rows of liquor bottles were tarnished mirrors bearing the names of whiskeys and beers that had long since ceased to exist the floor was made of exposed boards scuffed by decades of traffic and burned here and there by the discarded butts of dead smokers but clean and it seemed freshly varnished the brass work on the stools the footrests at the bar the coat hooks gleamed and every table had been dusted and bore fresh beer coasters it was as though the exterior had been deliberately designed to discourage casual custom while retaining a degree of sophistication within that spoke of a once noble past a series of booths took up the wall to the left with a scattering of round tables and old chairs between the booths and the bar three of the booths were occupied by office workers eating what looked like good salads and club sandwiches there seemed to be an unspoken divide between the bar crew and the others with the circular tables and chairs in between representing a kind of nomansland that might as well have been littered with barbed wire and tank traps ahead of me the collector was picking his way carefully toward a booth at the back of the bar a waitress emerged from the kitchens nearby a huge tray of food balanced on her left shoulder she didnt look at the collector but she gave him a wide berth moving left in the direction of the bar as he came and effectively traversing two sides of a triangle to reach the booth nearest the door in fact at no point did anyone in the room even glance at him as he made his way down its entire length and although it made no sense to me had i been asked i would have said that their decision to ignore him was an unconscious one some part of them was aware of his presence after all he had a drink before him in the booth and someone must have served it to him his cash would end up in the register a faint smell of nicotine would hang around the booth for a time even after he was gone yet i suspected that one minute after he left if asked about him every person in that bar would have had difficulty remembering him that part of their brains that had been aware of his presence would also have registered even the memory of him as a threatno not a threat but a kind of pollutant of the souland would quickly and efficiently have set about erasing all traces of him from itself he was sitting in the booth waiting for me to draw near and i had to fight my urge to turn away to retreat from him into the sunlight foul the word forced itself up like bile i could almost feel it forming on my lips foul thing and as i reached the booth the collector spoke that word to me foul he said he seemed to be testing it tasting it like an unfamiliar food uncertain as to whether he found it to his liking or not in the end he touched his stained tongue with those yellowed fingers and picked a piece of tobacco from it as though he had given form to the word and chosen to expel it there was a mirror behind him and i could see the bald patch at the back of his head it was slightly flattened suggesting that at some point in the distant past he had received a blow heavy enough to impact upon the skull and fracture it i wondered how long ago it might have occurred in childhood perhaps while the skull was still soft then i tried to imagine this creature as a child and found that i could not he gestured to the seat across from him indicating that i should sit then raised his left hand and allowed his fingers to pluck gently at the air like a fisherman testing the lure at the end of his line it summoned the waitress and she approached the booth slowly and reluctantly her face already trying to form a smile that the muscles seemed unwilling to support she did not look at the collector instead she tried to keep her eyes fixed firmly on me even turning her back on him slightly so as to exclude him from her peripheral vision what can i get ya she asked her nostrils twitched the tips of her fingers were white where they gripped the pen as she waited for me to answer her eyes and head shifted slightly to the right the smile already struggling to survive entered its death throes the collector stared at the back of her head he grinned a frown creased the waitresss forehead she flicked at her hair distractedly the collectors mouth moved soundlessly ejecting a word i read it on his lips whore the waitresss lips moved too forming the same word whore now she shook her head trying to dislodge the insult like an insect that had crawled into her ear no she said thats coffee i said a little too loudly just coffee will be fine it brought her back for a moment she seemed about to continue to protest at what she had heard or thought she had heard instead she swallowed the words the effort made her eyes water coffee she repeated she wrote it on her pad her hand trembling as the pen moved she looked to be on the verge of tears sure ill be right back with it but i knew she would not be back i saw her go to the bar and whisper something to the bartender she began untying her apron and headed for the kitchen there was probably a staff bathroom in back she would stay there i figured until the crying and the shaking stopped until she felt that it was safe to come out she might try to light a cigarette but the smell of it would remind her of the man in the booth the one who was both there and not there present and absent a raggedy man trying just too hard to be unremarkable and as she reached the kitchen door she found it within herself to look straight at the man in the booth and her eyes were bright with fear and anger and shame before she vanished from sight what did you do to her i asked do he sounded genuinely surprised his voice was surprisingly soft i did nothing she is what she is her morals are lax i merely reminded her of it and how do you know that ways and means shed done you no harm the collector pursed his lips in disapproval im disappointed in you perhaps your morals are as lax as hers whether she had done me harm or not is irrelevant the fact remains that she is a whore and she will be judged as such by you i dont think youre fit to judge anyone i dont pretend to be unlike you he added with just a hint of malice i am not the judge but the application of judgment i do not sentence but i carry out the punishment and keep souvenirs of your victims the collector spread his hands before me what victims show them to me display for me the bones now although we had spoken before i noticed for the first time the careful way in which he expressed himself and the occasional strange locutions that emerged when he did display for me the bones there was a trace of something foreign to his accent but it was impossible to place it seemed to come from anywhere and nowhere just like him his hands closed into fists he allowed only his right index finger to remain extended but youi smelled you in my house i marked the places where you had lingered you and the others who came with you we were looking for merrick it sounded like i was trying to justify the trespass perhaps i was but you did not find him from what i hear he found you you are fortunate to be alive after crossing such a man did you set him on me like you set him on daniel clay and on his daughter like you set him on ricky demarcian did i set him on daniel clay the collector touched an index finger to his lower lip a simulation of thoughtfulness his lips parted slightly and i glimpsed his crooked teeth blackening at the roots perhaps i have no interest in daniel clay or his daughter as for demarcian well the loss of a life is always regrettable but in some cases it is less regrettable than in others i suspect few will mourn his absence from the world his employers will find another to take his place and the deviants will congregate around him like flies on a wound but we were talking about your intrusion upon my privacy at first i must confess that i was aggrieved you forced me to move part of my collection but when i considered the situation i was grateful i knew that we were destined to meet again you could say that we move in the same circles i owe you for the last time we met in one of those circles you would not give me what i wantedno what i needed you left me no choice nevertheless i apologize for any hurt i inflicted it appears to have caused no lasting damage it was strange i should have taken him there and then i should have rained blows upon him in retribution i wanted to break his nose and his teeth i wanted to force him to the floor and shatter his skull with the heel of my boot i wanted to see him burn his ashes scattering to the four winds i wanted his blood on my hands and my face i wanted to lick it from my lips with the tip of my tongue i i stopped the voice in my head was mine yet it was echoed by another silken tones goaded me you see said the collector even though his lips did not move you see how easy it could be do you want to try do you want to punish me come do it i am alone but that was a lie it was not only the collector that those in the bar had chosen to ignore if they were aware of the others at all there was now movement in the shadows dark on light faces formed at the edges of perception then were gone their black eyes unblinking their ruined mouths gaping the lines on their skin speaking of decay and absence within in the mirror i saw some of the businessmen push their food away halffinished one of the afternoon drunks at the bar brushed at a presence beside his ear swatting it away like the whine of a mosquito i saw his lips move repeating something that only he could hear his hand trembled as he reached for the shot glass before him his fingers failing to grasp it so that it slipped away from him falling on its side and spilling amber liquid across the wood they were here the hollow men were here and even if he were alone which he was not even if there was no sense that halfglimpsed presences trailed behind him like fragments of himself only a fool would try to tackle the collector he exuded menace he was a killer of that i was certain a killer just like merrick except merrick took lives for money and now for revenge never deluding himself into thinking that what he did was right or justified while the collector ended lives because he thought he had been given permission to do so all that the two men had in common was a shared belief in the utter inconsequentiality of those whom they dispatched i took a deep breath i found that i had moved forward in my seat i sat back and tried to release some of the tension from my shoulders and arms the collector seemed almost disappointed you think that you are a good man he said how can one tell the good from the bad when their methods are just the same i didnt answer what do you want i asked instead i want what you want to find the abusers of andrew kellog and the others did they kill lucy merrick yes you know that for certain yes how the living leave one mark on the world the dead another it is a matter of learning to read the signs like he searched for the right comparison and clicked his fingers as he found it like writing on glass like fingerprints in dust he waited for me to react but he was disappointed and around us the shadows moved and you thought youd use frank merrick to flush out the men responsible i said as if he had not spoken those words as if he did not seem to know things of which he could not possibly be aware i thought he might be useful mr eldritch needless to say was not convinced but like a good attorney he does as his client wishes looks like eldritch was right merrick is out of control the collector conceded the point with a click of his tongue it would appear so still he may yet lead me to them for the present though we are no longer aiding him in his searches eldritch has already had some awkward questions from the police that bothers him he has been forced to open a new file and despite his love of paper he has files enough as matters stand eldritch likesold things he rolled the words around in his mouth savoring them are you looking for daniel clay the collector grinned slyly why would i be looking for daniel clay because children in his care were abused because the information that led to that abuse could have come from him and you believe that if i am looking for him then he must be guilty is that not right despite your distaste for me it seems that perhaps you trust my judgment he was right the realization troubled me but there was no denying the truth of what he had said for some reason i believed that if clay was guilty then the collector would be seeking him out the question remains are you looking for him no said the collector i am not because he wasnt involved or because you already know where he is that would be telling would you have me do all your work for you so what now i want you to leave eldritch be he knows nothing that would be useful to you and would not tell you even if he did i wanted to express my regret at what passed between merrick and you it was not my doing finally i wanted to tell you that in this instance we are working toward the same end i want those men identified i want to know who they are why so they can be dealt with the courts will take care of them i answer to a higher court i wont hand them over to you he shrugged i am patient i can wait their souls are forfeit that is all that matters what did you say he traced patterns upon the table they looked like letters but of some alphabet that was unknown to me some sins are so terrible that there can be no forgiveness for them the soul is lost it returns to the one who created it to be disposed of as he sees fit all that is left behind is an empty shell consciousness without grace hollow i said and i thought that something in the darkness responded to the word like a dog hearing its name called by a stranger yes said the collector that is an apt word he looked around seeming to take in the bar and its denizens yet he focused not on people and objects but on the spaces between them finding movement where there should have been only stillness shapes without true form when he spoke again his tone was altered he sounded thoughtful almost regretful and who would see such things if they existed he said sensitive children perhaps abandoned by their fathers and fearful for their mothers holy fools who are attuned to such things but you are neither his eyes flicked toward me regarding me slyly why do you see what others do not were i in your shoes i might be troubled by such matters he licked at his lips but his tongue was dry and gave them no moisture they were cracked deeply in places the partly healed cuts a darker red against the pink hollow he repeated the word drawing out the final syllable are you a hollow man mr parker after all misery loves company a place might be found in the ranks for a suitable candidate he smiled and one of the cracks on his lower lip opened a red pearl of blood rose briefly before flowing back into his mouth but no you lackspirit and it may be that there are others more adaptable to the role by their actions shall they be known he stood to leave depositing twenty dollars on the table to cover his drink it smelled like jim beam although it had remained untouched throughout a generous tip for our waitress he said after all you seem to feel that she has earned it are these men the only ones youre looking for i asked him suddenly i wanted to know if there were others and if perhaps i was among them he crooked his head like a magpie distracted by an object shining in the sunlight i am always searching he said there are so many to be dealt with so many he began to drift away perhaps well meet again for better or worse it is almost time to be moving on and i find the thought that you might choose to snap at my heels slightly troubling it will be for the best if we find a way to coexist in this world im sure that an accommodation can be reached a bargain struck he walked toward the door and shadows followed him along the walls i saw them in the mirror smears of white on black just as i had seen the face of john grady in a mirror once howling against his own damnation it was only when the door opened and sunlight briefly invaded once again that i saw the envelope that the collector had left on the seat across from me i reached for it it was thin and unsealed i opened the tab and looked inside it contained a blackandwhite photograph i took it out and laid it on the table as the door closed behind me so that there was only the flickering lamplight to illuminate the picture of my house the clouds gathering above it and the men standing beside the car in my drive one tall black and severe the other smaller smiling in his dishevelment i stared at the picture for a time then put it back in the envelope and tucked it into my jacket pocket from the kitchen door the waitress emerged her eyes were red she glanced at me and i felt the sting of her blame i left the bar left eldritch and his secretary and his office filled with old paper and the names of the dead i left them all and i did not return as i drove north merrick was engaged in his own work he approached rebecca clays home later when everything ended in blood and gunfire a neighbor would recall his presence but for now he went unnoticed it was a gift that he had the ability to blend in when necessary to avoid attracting attention he saw the two big men in their enormous truck and the car owned by the third man parked at the rear of the house the car was empty which meant that the man was probably inside merrick was sure that he could take him but there would be noise and it would draw the others to him he might be able to kill them as well but the risk was too great instead he retreated he had acquired a new car boosted from the garage of a summer home at higgins beach and drove it to a warehouse on a decrepit industrial park near westbrook and there he found jerry legere working alone he put my gun in legeres mouth and informed him that when it was removed legere would tell him all that his wife had shared with him about her father and all that he knew or suspected about the events leading up to daniel clays disappearance or he would blow the back of his head off legere was certain that he was going to die he told merrick about his wife the whore he peddled fantasies to him lies and half lies untruths halfbelieved and truths that were worth less than the lies but merrick learned nothing useful from him and he did not kill rebecca clays exhusband because legere gave him no cause to do so merrick drove away leaving legere lying in the dirt crying with shame and relief and the man who was watching from the woods took in everything and began making his calls chapter xxvii i was heading north on i when the call came through it was louis when he had returned to scarborough there was an unknown car waiting in my driveway a couple of phone conversations later and it was not unknown any longer you got company up here he said anyone we know not unless you planning on invading russia how many two where sitting slap bang in your yard apparently there aint no russian word for subtle keep an eye on them ill let you know when im coming off route i i guessed theyd be around asking questions eventually they couldnt let demarcians death pass without mention or investigation i had just hoped that id already be gone when they arrived i didnt know much about the russians except for the little id learned from louis in the past and what id read in the papers i knew that they were big in california and new york and that the main groups in each of those places maintained contact with their peers in massachusetts chicago miami new jersey and a dozen or more other states as well as their peers back in russia to form what was in effect a huge criminal syndicate like the individual mobs themselves it appeared to be loosely structured with little apparent organization but it was believed that this was a ruse to throw investigators off the scent and make it difficult for them to infiltrate the syndicate the soldiers were separated from the bosses by layers of buffers so that those involved in drugs and prostitution at street level had little idea where the money they earned ultimately went demarcian had probably not been able to tell merrick very much about the men with whom he dealt beyond first names and those were unlikely to have been real anyway the russians also seemed content to leave largescale narcotics dealing to others although they were said to have formed links with the colombians mostly they preferred insurance scams identity theft money laundering and fuel tax fraud the kind of complex ripoff operations that were hard for the authorities to track and prosecute i wondered how many of the clients for demarcians porn sites realized the kind of individuals to whom they were revealing their credit card details i figured they were here only to ask questions if theyd come for something more serious they wouldnt have been dumb enough to park in my driveway and wait for me to arrive then again that presupposed they gave a damn about their car being noticed or even about potential witnesses the russians were bad news it was said that when the soviet union collapsed the italians sent a few guys over to moscow to assess the potential for muscling in on the emerging market they took one look at what was happening on the streets and went straight back home unfortunately the russians followed them back joining the odessa mafia that had been operating in brighton beach since the midseventies and now the italians sometimes seemed almost quaint by comparison with the new arrivals it was kind of ironic i thought that what ultimately brought the russians to our door was not communism but capitalism joe mccarthy must have been turning in his grave i reached scarborough forty minutes later and i called louis when i was at oak hill he asked me to give him five minutes then head down at a steady thirty i saw the car as soon as i rounded the bend it was a big black chevy x the kind of vehicle usually driven by people who would cry if they got real dirt on it as if to confirm the stereotype the chevy was scrupulously clean i did a uturn as i passed my house and pulled up behind the chevy with the passenger door closest to it effectively blocking it from leaving the drive it was bigger than the mustang and if they got enough power behind it they might manage to knock my car out of their way but in the process theyd probably wipe out the back of their vehicle apparently nobody had yet thought of putting bull bars on the rear of xs although i was sure that it could only be a matter of time both front doors of the chevy opened and two men emerged they were dressed in standard hood chic black leather jackets black jeans and black sweaters one of them a bald man built like a piece of eastern bloc architecture was reaching inside his jacket for his gun when a voice behind him said only a single word dont the russians hand froze louis stood in the shadows of my house his glock in his gloved hand they were trapped between us i stayed where i was my now drawn and trained on them take your hand out of your jacket i told the bald russian slowly when i see it fingernails had better be the only thing on the end of it the russian did as he was told his partner had already raised his hands i came out from behind the car and advanced on them flat on the ground said louis they did as they were told louis then frisked them both while i kept the gun on them they were each armed with matching colt ninemillimeter semiautomatics louis ejected the clips from the guns then checked for any in the chute when he was sure that they were empty he tossed the clips into the undergrowth and retreated five feet from the two men up and kneel i told them keep your hands behind your heads they struggled to a kneeling position then glared at me who are you i said they didnt reply shestyorki said louis aint that what you are messenger boys niet said the bald one boyeviki boyeviki my ass said louis he says theyre soldiers guess its hard to get good staff these days this one cant even answer a question in english what happened you fall off the boat and get left behind i speak english said the russian i speak english good no shit said louis what you want a medal a gold star why are you here i asked although i already knew razborka he said we want uh he searched for the english word clarification he finished well let me give you clarification i said i dont like armed men on my property if i shot you now you think that would be clarification enough for your bosses the redheaded one glanced at his partner then spoke you kill us and this gets worse we are here to talk about demarcian his english was better than his partners he spoke it with only the faintest hint of an accent it was clear that he was the one in charge although he had been content to hide the fact until it became obvious that his bald friend was out of his depth in the current negotiations i dont know anything about him apart from the fact that hes dead the police questioned you the rumor is that your gun was used to kill him the gun was taken from me i said i dont know for certain that it was used to kill demarcian my guess is that it probably was but i dont go loaning it out for killings the man who took it wanted it real bad it was careless of you to lose your gun said the russian as you can see i have another if i lose that i can always borrow one from my friend behind you he has lots of guns anyway i didnt have anything to do with demarcians death the weapon apart so you say said the russian yeah but we have guns and you dont so our word wins the russian shrugged as though the whole matter was immaterial to him anyway i believe you then we would still like to know about the man who killed demarcian this merrick tell us about merrick do your own homework you want him you find him but we think you too are looking for him you want your gun back perhaps we find him and we get it back for you his bald companion snickered and said something under his breath it sounded like frayeri louis responded by striking him across the back of the head with the barrel of the glock it wasnt enough to knock him out but it laid him flat on his face his scalp began to bleed he called us suckers explained louis thats not nice the redheaded man didnt move he just shook his head in apparent disappointment at his colleagues stupidity i think your friend does not like russians very much he said my friend doesnt like anybody very much but he does appear to have a particular problem with you two i admitted perhaps he is a racist is that what you are he turned his head slightly trying to see louis i had to give him credit he wasnt easily intimidated i cant be no racist man said louis im black it didnt quite answer the russians question but he seemed content with what he heard we want frank merrick he continued we could make it worth your while if you tell us what you know money sure money his face brightened this was the kind of negotiation that he liked i dont need money i said i got too much as it is what i need is for you to take your friend and get out of here hes bleeding on my driveway the russian looked genuinely regretful that is a shame its okay itll wash off i meant about the money i know get up he stood behind him louis was checking the interior of the chevy he found a little h ampk p in the glove compartment and a benelli m tactical shotgun with a pistol grip stock and clickadjustable military ghost wing sights in a flip compartment under the rear seat again he emptied both then opened the back of the chevy wiped his prints from them and stuck them under the gray lining in the trunk go back to boston i said were all done here and what do i tell my bosses said the russian someone must answer for what happened to demarcian it has caused many problems for us im sure youll think of something he sighed deeply can i put my hands down now he asked slowly i said he let his hands drop then bent down to help his companion to his feet the back of the bald mans head was wet with blood the redhead took in louis for the first time they exchanged nods of professional respect louis removed a pristine white handkerchief from the pocket of his jacket and handed it to the russian for your friends head he said thank you you know what blat means said louis sure said the russian well my friend here has major blat you be sure to tell your bosses that the russian nodded again the bald man climbed gingerly into the passenger seat and rested his left cheek against the cool leather his eyes closed his colleague turned back to me goodbye volk he said until we meet again he climbed into the chevy then began to reverse it down the drive louis keeping pace with him all the way the glock never wavering i went back to my mustang and moved it out of the way then watched the chevy head toward route louis beside me ukrainians he said maybe georgians not chechens is that good he shrugged it seemed to be contagious they all bad he said chechens just real bad the redhead didnt seem like a foot soldier underboss means they real pissed about demarcian he doesnt seem worth that kind of effort they lose business cops start tracing their clients ask questions about pictures of children cant let it slide but he seemed to be holding something back what else i dont know feels off ill ask around see what i hear will they be back uhhuh might help if we found merrick first buy us a little influence im not going to give them merrick might not have a choice he started to walk back to the house what does blat mean i asked connections he replied and not the legal kind and volk its slang word for a cop or an investigator kind of a compliment he put his gun back in its shoulder holster it means wolf chapter xxix we drove north to jackman late that afternoon through shawmut and hinckley and skowhegan through solon and bingham moscow and caratunk past places without names and names without places the road following the bends and curves of the kennebec the banks lined with bare trees the forest floor brilliant with their lost foliage gradually the nature of the forest began to change as the evergreens raised their spires dark against the dying light as winter winds whispered of the promise of snow and as the cold began to bite the woods would grow ever quieter as animals retreated into hibernation and even birds grew torpid to preserve their energy we were following the route that arnold took on his expedition up the kennebec to quebec his force of twelve hundred men marched from cambridge to newburyport then took to the river on transports navigating the crooked channel of the kennebec as far as gardinerstown from there they transferred to light bateaux more than two hundred of them each capable of holding six or seven men along with their provisions and baggage perhaps four hundred pounds of weight in all they were built hastily and from green lumber by reuben colburn at gardinerstown and they quickly began to leak and fall to pieces ruining the troops supplies of powder bread and flour three companies were sent ahead under daniel morgan to the great carrying place between the kennebec and dead rivers the others following slowly behind using ox teams borrowed from settlers to move the bateaux around the impassable falls above fort western hoisting them up the steep icy banks at skowhegan falls most of the men reduced to walking in order to ease the burden on the boats until they came at last to the twelve low marshy miles of the great carrying place the soldiers sank into deep green moss that looked firm from a distance but proved treacherous underfoot a kind of calenture on land so that the madness suffered by sailors too long at sea who hallucinated dry earth where there was no earth and drowned beneath the waves when they jumped found its echo in ground that was soft and yielding as water they stumbled on logs and fell in creeks and in time they cleared a road in order to travel so that for many years the path they took could be traced by the difference in the color of the foliage on either side of the route i was struck by a sense of landscape layered upon landscape past upon present these rivers and forests were inseparable from their history the distinction between what was now and what had gone before was fragile here it was a place where the ghosts of dead soldiers passed through forests and over streams that had changed little in the intervening years a place where family names had remained unaltered where people still owned the land that their greatgrandfathers had bought with gold and silver coin a place where old sins persisted for great change had not come to wash away the memory of them so this was the land traversed by arnold s army the soldiers equipped with rifles axes and long knives now other bands of armed men moved through this landscape adding their clamor to the creeping silence of winter holding it at bay with the roar of their guns and the growl of the trucks and quads that carried them into the wilderness the woods were alive with orangeclad fools businessmen from massachusetts and new york taking a break from the golf course to blast at moose and bear and buck guided by locals who were grateful for the money the outsiders spent yet remained resentful of the fact that they needed it to survive we made but one stop along the way at a house that was little more than a shack three or four rooms in all its windows unwashed and the interior hidden by cheap drapes the yard was overgrown a garage door gaped open revealing rusted tools and stacks of firewood there was no car because one of the conditions of mason dubuss parole was that he was not permitted to drive a vehicle louis waited outside i think perhaps that he would have found dubuss company intolerable for dubus was a man like those who had abused louiss beloved angel and it was louiss greatest regret that he had never been given the opportunity to punish those who had scarred his lovers soul so he leaned against the car and watched silently as the door was opened slightly a chain securing it and a mans face appeared his skin was yellow and his eyes were rheumy his one visible hand shook with uncontrollable tremors yes he said and his voice was surprisingly firm mr dubus my names charlie parker i think someone called to let you know i might want to speak with you the eyes narrowed maybe you got some whatchacallit id a license or something i showed him my pis license he took it from me and held it close to his face examining each and every word upon it then handed it back to me he looked beyond me to where louis was standing whos the other fella hes a friend hes gonna catch cold out there hes welcome to come in if he chooses i think hed prefer to wait where he is well its his call dont say i didnt offer the door closed for a moment and i could hear the rattling as the security chain was removed when it opened again i got my first proper look at dubus he was hunched by age and illness and by his years in prison but there was still a vestige of the big strong man that he had once been his clothes were clean and carefully ironed he wore dark trousers a bluestriped shirt and a tightly knotted pink tie he was wearing an oldfashioned eau de cologne that bore hints of sandalwood and incense the interior of the house gave the lie to any first impressions evoked by the exterior the floorboards shone and it smelled of furniture polish and air freshener there were paperback books on a small shelf in the hallway on top of which stood an oldfashioned rotary dial telephone nailed to the wall above it was a copy of the desiderata a kind of twelvestep program for those afflicted by the trials of modern life the rest of the walls were decorated with prints of paintings in cheap framessome modern some much older and most unfamiliar to mealthough the images had clearly been carefully chosen i followed dubus into his living room again everything was clean even though the furniture had come from thrift stores and was scuffed and worn a small tv sat on a pine table tuned to a comedy show there were more prints on the walls here as well as a couple of originals each depicting a landscape one of them seemed familiar i walked over to take a closer look at it from a distance it appeared to be a painting of a forest a line of green trees against a red sunset but then i saw that one of the trees stood taller than the rest and had a cross at its highest point daniel clays signature was visible in the bottom righthand corner it was gilead he gave it to me said dubus he was standing at the opposite side of the room keeping a distance between us it was probably a result of his time in jail when you learned to give every man his space even in such a confined area or you faced the consequences why for talking to him about gilead you mind if we sit down i get tired i have to take this medication he gestured at some bottles of pills on the mantel above the fireplace where three logs were hissing and sparking it makes me drowsy i sat down on the couch across from him if you want coffee i can make some he said im fine thank you okay he tapped his fingers on the arm of the chair his eyes flicking toward the tv it appeared that i had disturbed his evenings viewing then apparently resigning himself to the fact that he wasnt going to be left to watch it in peace he hit a button on the remote and the picture died so what do you want to know he asked i get people through here now and again students doctors you cant ask me anything i aint already been asked a hundred times before id like to know what you discussed with daniel clay i talked about gilead he said thats all i ever talk about they used to test me show me pictures and stuff but they dont do that no more i guess they think they know all that they need to know about me and do they his adams apple bobbed i could hear the sound that it made deep in his throat he regarded me for a time then seemed to come to some decision no they dont he said they got as much as theyre going to get dont think youre going to get anything more than they did what was clays interest in gilead i asked i didnt want to alienate dubus he might have been drowsy and medicated but he was still sharp he wanted to know about what happened i told him i didnt leave nothing out i dont have nothing to hide im not ashamed of what we did together it was allhe screwed up his face in distastemisunderstood misinterpreted they made it out to be something it wasnt what we did together as though it was a mutual decision reached between the adults and the children as natural as fishing or picking berries in summer children died mr dubus he nodded that was bad that shouldnt have happened they was babies though and times were hard up there might almost have been a blessing what happened to them as i understand it one was stabbed to death with a knitting needle thats a peculiar definition of a blessing you judging me sir he squinted at me the trembling of his hands giving the impression that he was struggling yet failing to control great anger its not for me to do thats right that was why i got on with dr clay he didnt judge me did daniel clay ever talk about the children in his care no something unpleasant animated his features for an instant i tried though he didnt bite dubus snickered how many times did he come here two or three far as i can remember he visited me in jail too but that was just once and it was all very businesslike he interviewed you and you talked thats right and yet he gave you one of his paintings i hear he was very careful about those to whom he gave his paintings very selective dubus shifted in his chair that adams apple began bobbing again and i was reminded of andy kellog worrying at his loose tooth both were indicators of stress maybe i was helpful to him maybe he didnt view me as no monster i could see it in your friends face out there and i could see it in yours when i opened the door you tried to hide it with politeness and good manners but i knew what you were thinking and then you came in here and you saw the pictures on my wall and how clean and neat everything was i wasnt wallowing in my own filth i wasnt stinking or dressed in filthy tattered clothes you think i want the outside of my place to look the way it does you dont think i want to paint it to fix it up some well i cant i do what i can around here but there aint nobody going to help a man like me to keep his house in order i paid for what they said i done paid with years of my life and theyre going to make me keep paying until i die but i wont give them the satisfaction of being ground down you want monsters you look elsewhere was daniel clay a monster the question seemed to shock him into silence then for a second time i saw the intelligence at work behind the withered façade that creeping nasty corrupted thing that had allowed him to do what he had done and to justify it to himself i thought it might even have been what the children of gilead had glimpsed as he moved upon them his hand clasped across their mouths to stifle their cries you got your suspicions of him like the rest said dubus you want me to tell you if theyre true because if we shared something like that if we both had the same tastes then maybe id have known or hed have opened himself up to me well if you think that youre a fool mr parker youre a fool and someday youll die for your foolishness i got no time to talk to foolish men why dont you head off now drive on up the road there because i know where youre going could be youll find the answer in gilead thats where daniel clay found the answer to his questions oh yes he found what he was looking for up there but he didnt come back from that place you best step carefully or else you wont come back neither it gets inside your soul old gilead he was smiling broadly now the keeper of the truth of gilead did you ever meet a man called jim poole mr dubus he pantomimed deep thought you know i think i did he was a fool just like you he disappeared he got lost gilead took him is that what you think i know it doesnt matter where he is or if hes alive or dead hes a prisoner of gilead you set foot in gilead and youre lost his gaze turned inward his eyes stopped blinking they said that we brought evil to that place but it was there already he said and there was a touch of wonder to his voice i felt it as soon as i set foot there old lumley picked a bad spot for his city of refuge the ground was poisoned and we were poisoned too when we left the forest or something under it took it back he gave a small sick laugh too much time to myself he said too much time to dwell on things what was the project mr dubus he laugh faded away the project the hobby the game they all mean the same thing the abuse of children he shook his head you may call it that but thats because you dont understand its a beautiful thing thats what i try to explain to those who come here but they dont listen they dont want to know did daniel clay listen he was different he understood understood how but dubus did not reply do you know where daniel clay is i asked dubus leaned forward who knows where dead men go he said you head north and maybe youll find out its time for my show he hit the remote again adjusting the volume as he did so and the tv blared into life he turned in his chair no longer facing toward me i let myself out and as we drove away i saw the drapes move at dubuss window a hand was raised in farewell and i felt sure that in his clean neat house the old man was laughing at me in the days that followed the police would attempt to piece together the chain of events to connect body to body contacts to killings during the final hours of his life dubus made two telephone calls both to the same number after his death the cell phone would be found beside his body he had hidden it under a loose plank beneath his bed and to discourage any of those entrusted with monitoring him from discovering it he kept a halffilled chamber pot above it its stink enough to ensure that no fastidious parole officer would dare to venture there although it might have struck a careful searcher that in his otherwise pristine house it was the only place where dubuss orderliness appeared to have lapsed the phone was prepaid and had been bought for cash at a bigbox store one month previously it was not the police guessed the first time that dubus had circumvented the restrictions on his telephone use in this way dubus made the secondtolast call of his life minutes after louis and i had departed then presumably returned the phone to its hiding place and went back to watching his tv shows tickticktick went the seconds counting down to the moment when mason dubus would at last depart this earth and face the greater justice that waits for every man but that was all to come for now the daylight was gone there was no moon we drove on speaking rarely the music was low the national on the car stereo singing of doves in the brain and hawks in the heart and i thought of men with the heads of birds and in time we came to jackman and old gilead got into our souls five revenge proves its own excutioner john ford the broken heart chapter xxx it is often said that there are two maines there is the maine of the summer tourists the maine of lobster rolls and ice cream of yachts and boat clubs a maine that occupies a neat strip of coastline about as far north as bar harbor with high hopes and property prices to match apart from those towns without the good looks or good fortune to attract the tourist dollar or those that have seen their industries fade and die marooning them in a lake of prosperity the rest of maine derisively refers to the inhabitants of this region as flatlanders or in even darker moments dismisses them entirely as residents of northern massachusetts the other maine is very different it is a maine primarily of forests not ocean dominated by the county or aroostook which has always seemed a separate entity due to its sheer size if nothing else it is northern and inland rural and conservative and its heart is the great north woods but those woods had begun to change the big paper companies once the backbone of the economy were slowly relinquishing their hold on the land recognizing that there was more money in property than raising and cutting trees plum creek the nations largest paper company which owned nearly five hundred thousand acres around moosehead lake had earmarked thousands of those acres for a massive commercial development of rv parks houses rental cabins and an industrial park for those in the south it represented the despoiling of the states greatest area of natural beauty but for those in the other maine it meant jobs and money and an influx of new blood into dying communities the reality was that the forest canopy hid the fastestgrowing poverty rate in the nation towns were shrinking schools were getting smaller and the bright young hopes of the future were leaving for york and cumberland for boston and new york when the mills shut down highpaying jobs were replaced by minimumwage labor tax revenues fell crime domestic violence and substance abuse increased long pond once bigger than jackman had virtually died with the closure of its mill up in washington county almost within sight of the summer playground of bar harbor one in five people lived in poverty in somerset where jackman lay it was one in six and a steady stream of people made their way to youth and family services in skowhegan seeking food and clothing in some areas there was a waiting list of years for a section voucher at a time when rural rental assistance and funding for section was steadily falling yet jackman oddly had prospered in recent years in part because of the events of its population had fallen rapidly during the s and half of its housing units had been vacant the town still had its lumber mill but the changing nature of tourism meant that those who now headed north came in camper vans or rented cabins and cooked for themselves leaving little money in the town then the planes hit and suddenly jackman found itself on the front line of the fight to secure the nations borders us customs and border protection doubled its manpower house prices shot up and all things considered jackman was now in a better position than it had been for a long time but even by maine standards jackman remained remote the nearest courthouse was in skowhegan sixty miles to the south and the cops had to come up to jackman from bingham almost forty miles away it was in its strange way a lawless place just as we came out of solon the kennebec appeared before us there was a sign by the side of the road it read welcome to moose river valley if you dont stop smile on the way through i looked at louis youre not smiling i said thats cause were stopping i guessed that statement could be taken a number of ways we didnt head into jackman that night instead we pulled off the road a little way outside town there was an inn on a small hill with motelstyle rooms a tiny bar beside the reception area and a restaurant with long benches designed to feed the hunters who gave it a reason to exist in winter angel had already checked in although he was nowhere to be seen i went to my room which was simply furnished and had a small kitchen area in one corner there was underfloor heating it was stiflingly hot i turned off the heating ignoring the warning that it would take twelve hours for the system to warm the room to its maximum again then went back to the main building angel was at the bar a beer before him he was sitting on a stool reading a newspaper he didnt acknowledge me although he saw me enter there were two men to his left one of them looked at angel and whispered to his friend they laughed unpleasantly and something told me that this exchange had been going on for a time i drifted closer the one who had spoken was muscular and wanted people to know it he wore a tight green tshirt crisscrossed by the suspenders attached to his orange hunters oilskins his head was closely shaved but the ghost of his widows peak stood out like an arrow upon his forehead his friend was smaller and heavier his tshirt worn bigger and looser to hide his gut his beard looked like an unsuccessful attempt to disguise the weakness of his chin everything about him spoke of concealment of his awareness of his failings although he was grinning his eyes flicked uneasily from angel to his colleague as though the pleasure he was taking in the casual tormenting of another was tinged by relief that he was not the victim this time a relief qualified by the knowledge that the muscular man could turn just as easily on him and if he did so it would probably not be for the first time the big man tapped a fingertip on angels newspaper you okay buddy he said yeah im good said angel ill bet the man made an obscene gesture with his hand and tongue im sure youre real good he laughed loudly his friend joined in a puppy barking with the big dog angel kept his eyes on his newspaper hey i dont mean nothing by it said the man were just having a little fun thats all i can see that said angel i can tell that youre a fun guy the mans smile died as the sarcasm started to burn whats that supposed to mean he asked you got a problem angel sipped his beer closed his paper and sighed his main aggressor moved in closer his friend muscling in alongside him angel spread his hands wide and patted both men gently on the chest the barman was doing his best to stay out of the affair but i could see him watching what was taking place in the mirror above the register he was young but he had still seen all of this before guns beer and the smell of blood was a combination guaranteed to bring out the worst in ignorant men get your fucking hands off me said the first man i asked you a question you got a problem because it seems to me like you have a problem so do you angel seemed to consider the question well he said my back aches im stuck in the boonies with a bunch of crackers with guns and im not always sure that im with the right man there was momentary confusion what said the big man angel mirrored his expression then his face cleared oh he said you mean do i have a problem with you he made a dismissive gesture with his right hand i dont have a problem with you at all he said but my friend behind you on the other hand i think he may have a big problem with you the larger man turned around his buddy had already backed away giving louis space at the bar how you doin said louis who had entered the bar shortly after me and had spotted what was happening just as quickly as i had done i was now standing alongside him but it was clear that he was the main attraction the two men took in louis and weighed up their options none of them looked good at least one of them involved a world of hurt the alpha male made his choice opting for the loss of a little dignity over something that might ultimately prove terminal im doin good he said then we all happy said louis i guess so looks like they about to serve up dinner yeah looks like it i guess you better be getting along wouldnt want to miss your vittles uhhuh he tried to slip past louis but came up short against his fat friend who hadnt moved and was forced to elbow him out of the way his face was growing purple with humiliation the friend risked one more look at louis then trotted along after the bald man looks like you picked a good place to stay i said to angel a little heavy on the testosterone maybe and you could have some trouble filling your dance card but its cute you took your fucking time getting up here said angel you know theres not a whole lot to do once night falls and it gets dark like someone just threw a switch there isnt even a tv in the room we ordered hamburgers and fries opting not to join the parties of hunters in the next room and moved to a table beside the bar you find out anything i asked angel i found out that nobody wants to talk about gilead is what i found out best i could get was from some old ladies tending the cemetery according to them whats left of gilead is now on private land a guy named caswell bought it about fifteen years ago along with another fifty acres of woodland around it he lives close by always has doesnt entertain much not a rotarian i took a trip up there there was a sign and a locked gate apparently he doesnt like hunters trespassers or salesmen has merrick been here if he has then nobody saw him maybe caswell did only one way to find out yeah i watched the hunters eating and picked out the two men who had targeted angel they were seated in a corner ignoring the others around them the bigger mans face was still red there were a lot of guns around the place and a lot of machismo to go with them it wasnt a good situation your friends from the bar i said angel nodded phil and steve from hoboken i think it might be a good idea to send them on their way itll be a pleasure said angel by the way howd you know their names angel slipped his hands into his jacket pockets they emerged holding two wallets old habits the lodge was constructed around a hollow with the bar and reception building on the higher ground by the road and the rooms and cabins at the bottom of the slope beyond it it wasnt difficult to find out where the resident homophobes were staying as each guest was forced to carry his key on a fob cut from the trunk of a small tree the key had been lying in front of the two guys as they taunted angel they were in cabin number fourteen they left the table about fifteen minutes after their meal was over by that time angel and louis were gone the two men didnt look at me as they departed but i could feel their anger simmering they had drunk seven pints of beer between them during and after their meal and it was only a matter of time before they decided to seek some form of retribution for being bested at the bar the temperature had dropped suddenly with nightfall in the shaded places that mornings frost had not yet melted the two men walked quickly back to their cabin the bigger man leading the small bearded man behind they entered to find that their hunting rifles had been disassembled and now lay in pieces on the floor their bags were beside the guns packed and locked to their immediate left stood louis angel was seated at the table beside the stove phil and steve from hoboken took in the two men phil the larger and more aggressive of the two seemed about to say something when he saw the guns in the hands of the two visitors he closed his mouth again you know there isnt a cabin number thirteen said angel what said phil i said you know that there isnt a cabin number thirteen in this place the numbers jump from twelve to fourteen on account of how nobody wants to be in number thirteen but this is still the thirteenth cabin so youre really in number thirteen after all which is how come youre so unlucky why are we unlucky phils natural animosity was returning beefed up with some of the dutch courage from the bar all i see is two shitheads wandered into the wrong cabin and started to fuck with the wrong guys youre the unlucky ones you have no idea who youre screwing with here beside him steve shifted uneasily on his feet appearances to the contrary he was smart enough or sober enough to realize that it wasnt a good idea to rile two men with guns when you had no guns at all at least none that could be reassembled in time to make them useful angel took the wallets from his pocket and waved them at the two men but we do he said we know just who you are we know where you live where you work we know what your wife looks like steve and we know that phil seems to be separated from the mother of his children sad phil pictures of the kids but no sign of mommy still you are kind of a prick so its hard to blame her for giving you the bullet you on the other hand know nothing about us other than the fact that were here now and we got good reason to be aggrieved with you on account of your big mouths so this is what we propose you put your shit in your car and you start heading south your buddy there can do the driving phil cause i can tell youve had a few more than he has when youve driven oh maybe a hundred miles you stop and find yourselves a room get a good nights sleep tomorrow you head back to hoboken and youll never see us again well youll probably never see us again you never know we might feel the urge to visit someday maybe theres a sinatra tour we can take gives us an excuse to drop by and say hi to you and steve unless of course youd like to give us a more pressing reason to follow you down there phil made one last play his pigheadedness was almost admirable we got friends in jersey he said meaningfully angel looked genuinely puzzled his reply when it came could have come only from a new yorker why would somebody boast about something like that he asked who the fuck wants to visit jersey anyway man means said louis that he got friends in jersey oh said angel oh i get it hey we watch the sopranos too the bad news for you phil is even if that were true which i know its not we are the kind of people that the friends in jersey call if you catch my drift its easy to tell if you look hard enough you see we have pistols you have hunting rifles you came here to hunt deer we didnt come here to hunt deer you dont hunt deer with a glock you hunt other things with a glock but not deer phils shoulders slumped it was time to admit defeat lets go he said to steve angel tossed him the wallets he and louis watched as the two men loaded up their bags and the pieces of the rifles minus the firing pins which angel had thrown into the forest when they were done steve took the drivers seat and phil stood at the passenger door angel and louis leaned casually on the rail of the cabin only the guns suggesting that this wasnt merely a quartet of acquaintances exchanging final farewells all of this because we were having a little fun with you at the bar said phil no said angel all of this because youre assholes phil got in the car and they drove away louis waited until their lights had faded then tapped angel gently on the back of the hand hey he said we never get calls from jersey i know said angel why would we want to talk to anyone in jersey and their work done they retired to bed chapter xxxi the next morning we headed north into jackman we got stuck waiting for a truck to reverse at the jackman trading post even in november its display of tshirts hanging outside like laundry drying to one side of it was an old blackandwhite with a mannequin in the drivers seat which was as close as anyone was going to get to a sighting of a cop this far north they ever have cops up here asked louis i think there used to be a policeman in the sixties or seventies what happened to him he die of boredom i guess it is kinda quiet theres a constable now far as i know bet the long winter nights just fly by for him hey they had a killing once once he didnt sound impressed it was a pretty famous story at the time a guy named nelson bartley used to own the moose river house got shot in the head they found his body jammed under an uprooted tree yeah and when was this nineteen nineteen there was rumrunning involved somehow i seem to recall you telling me theres been nothing since then most people in this part of the world take their time about dying if they can i said you may find that startling i guess i move in different circles i guess so you dont like rural life much do you i had my fill of rural life when i was a boy i didnt care much for it then dont figure its improved much since there were also twin outhouses beside the trading post one on top of the other on the door of the upper outhouse was written the word conservative on the door of the lower one was the word liberal your people i said to louis not my people im a liberal republican ive never really understood what that means means i believe people can do whatever they want as long as they dont do it anywhere near me i thought it would be more complex than that nope thats about it you think i should go in and tell them im gay if i was you i wouldnt even tell them youre black said angel from the backseat dont judge this place by that outhouse back there i said thats just to give the tourists something to laugh at a small town like this doesnt survive even prosper some if the people who live here are bigots and idiots dont make that mistake about them incredibly this silenced both of them beyond the trading post and to the left the impressive twin steeples of st anthonys church built from local granite in loomed against the pale gray sky the church wouldnt have looked out of place in a big city but it seemed incongruous here in a town of a thousand souls still it had given bennett lumley something to aim for in the creation of gilead and he had determined that the spire of his church would exceed even that of st anthonys jackman or holden as it was originally known was founded by the english and the irish and the french came down to join them later back where the trading post lay used to be part of an area called little canada and from there to the bridge was the catholic part of town which was why st anthonys was on the eastern side of the river once you crossed the bridge that was protestant territory there was the congregational church and the episcopalians too who were the protestants it was okay to like if you were a catholic or so my grandfather used to say i didnt know how much the place had changed since then but i was pretty certain that the old divide still remained give or take a couple of houses the red jackman station house stood by the railway line that cut through the town but it was now privately owned the main bridge in town was being repaired so a detour took us over a temporary structure and into the township of moose river on the right was the modest moose river congregational church which bore the same relationship to st anthonys as the local little league team bore to the red sox eventually we came to the sign for holden cemetery across from the windfall outdoor center its blue school buses now empty lined up sleepily outside a dirtandstone road led down to the cemetery but it looked steep and slick with ice so we left the car at the top of the road and walked the rest of the way the road led past a frozen pond on one side and a patch of beaver bog on the other before the gravestones of the cemetery appeared on a hill to the left it was small and bordered by a wire fence with an unlocked gate wide enough for one person to pass through at a time the graves dated as far back as the nineteenth century probably to the days when this was still just a settlement i looked at the five stones nearest the gate three large stones two small the first read hattie e wife of john f childs and gave the dates of her birth and death april and november beside her stood the two smaller stones clara m and vinal f according to the stone clara m was born on august and died just over a month later on september vinal fs time on this earth was even briefer born on september he was dead by september the fourth stone was that of lillian l johns second wife and presumably the mother of clara and vinal she was born on july and died less than a year after her son on may the last stone was that of john f childs himself born september and died having outlived two wives and two children march there were no other stones nearby i wondered if john f had been the last of his line here in this tiny cemetery the story of his life was laid bare in the space of five carved pieces of rock but the stone we were looking for stood in the farthest southern corner of the cemetery there were no names upon it and no dates of birth or death it read only the children of gilead followed by the same word carved three times infant infant infant and a plea to god to have mercy on their souls as unbaptized children they would originally have been laid to rest outside the cemetery but it was clear that at some point in the past the position of the cemetery fence had been discreetly altered in this corner and the children of gilead now lay within its boundaries it said a lot about the people of the town that quietly and without fuss they had embraced these lost infants and allowed them to rest within the precincts of the graveyard what happened to the men who did this asked angel i looked at him and saw the grief etched on his face men and women i corrected him the women must have known and colluded in what happened for whatever reason two of those children died of unknown causes but one was stabbed with a knitting needle shortly after birth you ever hear of a man stabbing a child with a knitting needle no the women covered it up whether out of fear or shame or something else i dont think dubus was lying about that much nobody was ever charged the authorities examined three girls and confirmed that theyd given birth at some point in the recent past but there was no evidence to connect those births with the bodies that they found the community got together and claimed that the children were given up for private adoption there was no paperwork for the births which was a crime in itself but one that nobody felt the urge to prosecute dubus told the investigators that the kids were sent to somewhere in utah a car came along he said collected them then disappeared into the night that was the story and it was only years later that he recanted and claimed that the mothers of the girls who had given birth had killed the infants anyway a week or so after the bodies were found the community had already broken up and people were going their separate ways free to abuse somewhere else said angel i didnt reply what was there to say particularly to angel who had been a victim of such abuse himself farmed out by his father to men who took their pleasures from the body of a child that was why he was here now in this cold cemetery in a remote northern town that was why they were both here these hunters among hunters it was no longer a question of money for them or their own convenience that might once have been true but it was true no longer they were here now for the same reason that i was because to ignore what had happened to children in the recent and distant pasts to turn away and look elsewhere because it was easier to do so was to be an accomplice to the crimes that were committed to refuse to delve deeper would be to collude with the offenders somebodys tended to this grave said angel he was right there were no weeds and the grass had been cut back so that it would not obscure the marker even the words on the stone had been enhanced with black paint so that they would stand out who takes care of a fiftyyearold grave he asked maybe the man who now owns gilead i replied lets go ask him about five miles along the beyond moose river and past the sandy bay town line a sign pointed north to the bald mountain hiking trail and i knew that we were nearing gilead without angels prior knowledge the site itself would have been difficult to find the road we took had no name it was marked only by a sign reading private property and as angel had said an additional warning listing those who were particularly unwelcome about a half mile up the road was a gate it was locked and a fence disappeared into the forest on either side gilead s in there said angel pointing north into the woods maybe another half mile or more and the house same distance but straight up the road you can see it from farther up that track he pointed to a rutted dirt trail that followed the fence southeast i pulled the car to the side of the road we climbed over the gate and immediately cut into the forest we had walked for fifteen or twenty minutes when we came to the clearing most of the buildings still remained in a place where wood was the main building material lumley had chosen to use stone for a number of the houses so confident was he that his ideal community would last the dwellings varied in size from tworoom cottages to larger structures comfortably capable of housing families of six or more most had fallen into ruin and some had clearly been burned but one appeared to have been restored to some degree it had a roof and its four windows were barred the front door a solid piece of roughhewn oak was locked all told the community could not have numbered more than a dozen families at its peak there were many such places in maine forgotten villages towns that had withered away and died settlements founded on misplaced faith in a charismatic leader i thought of the ruins of sanctuary out on casco bay and of faulkner and his slaughtered flock in aroostook gilead was another in a long and ignominious line of failed ventures doomed by unscrupulous men and base instincts and above it all loomed the great steeple of the saviors church lumleys rival to st anthonys the walls had been built the steeple raised but the roof had never been placed upon it and no one had ever worshiped within its walls it was less a tribute to god than a monument to one mans vanity now the forest had claimed it for its own it was smothered in ivy so that it appeared as though nature itself had built it creating a temple from leaves and tendrils with grass and weeds for its floor and a tree for a tabernacle for a shagbark hickory had grown where the altar might have stood spreading its bare arms like the skeletal remains of a deranged preacher stripped of his flesh by the cold wind as he railed against the world his bones browned by the actions of the sun and the rain everything about gilead spoke of loss and decay and corruption had i not been aware of the crimes that were committed here the children who had suffered and the infants who had died it would still have left me feeling uneasy and soiled true there was a kind of grandeur to the halfbuilt church but it was without beauty and even nature itself seemed to have been corrupted by its contact with this place dubus was right lumley had chosen badly for the site of his community as angel moved to examine the church more closely i stopped him with my hand whats the matter he said dont touch any of the plants i said why not theyre all poisonous and it was true it was as though every foul weed every noxious flower had found a home here some of which i had never seen before this far north or clustered together in this way there was mountain laurel with its shredded rusty bark its pinkandwhite flowers dotted with red like the blood of insects and with stamens that responded to the touch like insects or animals now absent i saw white snakeroot some of its flowers still in their final bloom that could render cows milk fatal to drink if the animal fed upon the plant near a patch of marsh iced over at its banks water hemlock all toothed leaves and streaked stems beckoned each part of it potentially lethal there was jimson weed which belonged more properly in fields and celandine and stinging nettles even the ivy was poison no birds would ever come here i thought not even in summer it would always be a silent desolate place we stared up at the massive steeple its peak higher even than the trees around it sections of the alcove windows glared darkly over the forest through layers of ivy and the empty alcove intended to house the bell was now almost entirely covered by the plant there were no doors merely rectangular gaps at the base of the steeple and at one side of the church itself and no glass filled the windows even to attempt to enter would be to invite cuts and stings from the weeds and nettles that blocked the way although when i looked closer it did appear that someone had at some point cut a way through for the weeds were taller and thicker at the sides to the west of the church i saw the remains of a trail that had been cut through the forest its path clear from the absence of tall trees that was how they had transported the building materials into the forest but half a century later all that was left was a divide conquered by shrubs we walked over to the intact house i nodded to angel and he began working on the lock hasnt been opened in a while he said he took a small can of wd from his jacket pocket sprayed the lock then went at it again after several minutes we heard a click he applied pressure to the door with his shoulder and it creaked open there were two rooms inside both empty the floor was concrete and was clearly not part of the original structure the sun which had struggled for so long to shine through the filthy glass now took the opportunity afforded by the open door to bathe the interior with light but there was nothing to see and nothing to illuminate louis tapped one of the windows lightly with his knuckle its plexiglas he said he traced his finger around the edge of the frame it looked like someone had once tried to chip away at the cement holding it in place they hadnt gotten far but the evidence of the failed attempt still remained he leaned in closer to the glass then knelt trying to get a clearer look at something that his sharp eyes had picked out look here he said there were tiny marks scratched upon it in the bottom righthand corner i moved my head in an effort to see what they might be but it was angel who deciphered them first l m he said lucy merrick i said it had to be there were no other markings on the walls or the windows had the letters been carved by a kid seeking a thrill there would have been other initials too other names but gilead was not a place to come to alone not willingly and i knew then that this was where they had taken andy kellog and later merrick s daughter andy kellog had come back damaged traumatized but still alive lucy merrick though had never returned instantly the air in the house smelled stale and dead to me infected by what i knew in my heart had occurred in its rooms why here said louis softly why did they bring them here because of what happened before said angel he touched his finger to the marks made by lucy on the glass tracing each one carefully and tenderly in an act of remembrance i thought of my own actions in the attic of my house reading a message written in dust it added to the pleasure knowing they were repeating something that had been done in the past like they were continuing a tradition his words echoed christians talk of clusters was that what lay behind clays fascination with gilead did he want to recreate the events of half a century before or did he help others to do so then again perhaps his interest was not prurient or lascivious maybe he wasnt to blame in any way for what had happened and only his professional curiosity drew him to this site deep in the woods haunting his memory and finding form in the pictures that merrick had torn apart on joel harmons wall and that mason dubus proudly displayed on his but i was starting to believe that less and less if men had sought to recreate the original crimes here then perhaps they would have sought out their instigator mason dubus i was aware that we were following a path trodden by clay tracing the marks that he had left as he moved north he had given one of his precious artworks to dubus it did not seem like a mere act of thanks it was closer to a gesture of respect almost of affection i walked through the two rooms looking for any further trace of lucy merricks presence in that house but there was none there had probably been mattresses once blankets even some books or magazines there were light switches on the walls but the sockets were bare of bulbs i saw marks in the upper corner of the second room where a metal plate of some kind had been held in place a neat hole drilled below them a larger hole in the wall since filled in but its shape still visible indicated the spot where a stove had once stood and the fireplace had long ago been bricked up lucy merrick had disappeared in september it must already have been cold up here how did she stay warm if this was where they had kept her i could find no answer everything had been removed and it was clear too that these rooms had not been used for many years they killed her here didnt they asked angel he was still by the window his fingers maintaining contact with the carved letters on the glass as though by doing so he could somehow touch lucy merrick herself and comfort her so that wherever she was she might know that someone had found the marks she had left and was grieving for her the letters were small barely there she did not want the men who had abducted her to see them perhaps she believed they would provide proof of her story when she was released or did she fear even then that she might never be freed and she hoped these letters might provide some sign in case anyone cared enough about her to try to discover her fate they didnt kill any of the others i said thats why they wore masks so they could let them go without worrying about being identified they might have taken it a step further or something could just have gone wrong somehow she died and they cleared away any sign that anyone had ever been here then locked it up and never came back again angel let his fingers drop caswell the guy who owns the land he must have known what was happening yes i said softly he must have known i turned to leave louis was ahead of me he stood framed in the doorway dark against the morning sunlight he opened his mouth to speak then stopped the sound had carried clearly to each of us it was a shotgun shell being jacked a voice spoke it said boy you better not move an inch or ill blow your damn head off chapter xxxii angel and i stood silently in the house unwilling to move or speak louis remained frozen in the doorway his hands outstretched from his sides to show the man beyond that they were empty you come out slowly now said the voice you can put your hands on your head them fellas inside can do the same you wont see me but i can see you i tell you now just one of you moves and slick here in his fancy coat will have a hole where his face used to be youre trespassing on private property might be that you have guns too not a judge in the state will convict if you make me kill you while youre armed louis slowly stepped out of the doorway and stood with his hands on the back of his head facing out into the woods with no choice angel and i followed i tried to find the source of the voice but there was only silence as we stepped from the shelter of the house then a man emerged from a grove of fetterbush and hoptree he was dressed in green camouflage pants and a matching jacket and armed with a browning gauge he was in his early fifties big but not muscular his face was pale and his hair was too long squatting untidily on his head like a filthy mop he didnt look as if he had slept properly in a long time his eyes were almost falling out of his head as though the pressure on his skull was too much for them to bear and the sockets were so rimmed with red that the skin seemed to be slowly peeling away from the flesh beneath there were fresh sores on his cheeks chin and neck flecked with red where he had cut them as he tried to shave who are you he said he held the gun steady but his voice trembled as though he could project confidence only physically or vocally but not both at once hunters i replied yeah he sneered at us and what do you hunt without a rifle men said louis simply another crack opened in the mans veneer i had a vision of the skin beneath his clothing crisscrossed with tiny fractures like a china doll on the verge of shattering into a thousand pieces are you caswell i asked whos asking my name is charlie parker im a private investigator these are my colleagues my names caswell all right and this is my land you got no business being here in a way our business is exactly why were here you got business you take it to a store we wanted to ask you some questions caswell raised the muzzle of the gun slightly and fired off a round it went some distance over our heads but i still flinched he jacked another load and the eye of the gun maintained its unblinking vigil on us once again i dont think you heard me youre in no position to ask questions talk to us or talk to the police its your choice caswells hands worked on the grip and stock of the rifle the hell are you talking about i got no problems with the police did you fix up this house i indicated the building behind us what if i did its my land seems like a curious thing to do fixing up a ruin in a deserted village theres no law against it no i guess not might be a law against what was done in it though i was taking a chance caswell might try to shoot us just for goading him but i didnt think so he didnt look the type despite the shotgun and the camo clothing there was something soft about him as though someone had just armed the pillsbury doughboy i dont know what youre talking about he said but he retreated a step from us i mean what was done in gilead i lied and those children who were killed a peculiar range of emotions played themselves out in dumb show upon caswells face there was shock first of all then fear followed by a slowdawning realization that i was talking about the distant not the recent past i watched with satisfaction as he tried unsuccessfully to disguise his relief he knew he knew what had happened to lucy merrick yeah he said i reckon so thats why i try to keep folks away from here never know what kind of people it might attract sure i said and what kind of people might they be caswell didnt manage to answer the question he had talked himself into a corner and now he planned to bluster his way out people thats all he said why did you buy this place mr caswell it seems like an odd thing to have done given all that happened here theres no law against a man buying property ive lived up here all my life the land came cheap on account of its history and its history didnt trouble you no it didnt trouble me one bit now i didnt let him finish im just wondering because something is clearly troubling you you dont look well you look kind of stressed to tell the truth in fact you seem downright frightened id hit the bullseye the truth of what i had said manifested itself in caswells reaction the little cracks opened wider and deeper and the gun tilted slightly toward the ground i could sense louis considering his options his body tensing as he prepared to draw on caswell no i whispered and louis relaxed without question caswell became aware of the impression he was creating he drew himself up straight and raised the stock of the gun to his shoulder sighting down the barrel the slatted rib along the top of the browning like the raised spine of an animal i heard louis give a low hiss but i was no longer worried about caswell he was all front im not scared of you he said dont make that mistake then who are you scared of caswell shook his head to free some drops of moisture that clung to the ends of his hair i think youd better be getting back to your car you and your colleagues keep your hands on your head too while you do it and dont come around here again you got your first and last warning he waited for us to begin walking then started to retreat into the woods you ever hear of a lucy merrick mr caswell i called to him i paused and looked back over my shoulder still keeping my hands on my head no he said there was a pause before he spoke again as though he were trying to convince himself that the name had not been spoken aloud i never heard that name before how about daniel clay he shook his head just walk on out of here im done talking to you well be back mr caswell i think you know that caswell didnt answer he kept retreating moving deeper and deeper into the forest no longer caring if we were moving or not just trying to put as much distance between himself and us as he could i wondered who caswell would call once he was back in the safety of his own house it didnt matter anymore we were close for whatever reason caswell was falling apart and i had every intention of speeding up the process that afternoon i got talking to the young guy behind the bar at the lodge the one who had witnessed the altercation between angel and the men from jersey his name was skip although i didnt hold that against him and he was twentyfour and taking his masters degree in community planning and development at usm skips father was partowner of the place and he told me that he worked there during the summer and whenever he could spare time in hunting season he planned on finding a job in somerset county once he had finished his degree unlike some of his peers he didnt want to leave instead he hoped to find a way to make it a better place in which to live although he was smart enough to realize that the odds were currently stacked against the region skip told me that caswells family had lived in these parts for three or four generations but theyd always been dirt poor caswell sometimes worked as a guide during the season and the rest of the year he picked up jobs as a general handyman but as the years had gone by he had let the guide work slip although he was still in demand when repairs needed to be done to local houses when he had bought the gilead tract hed paid for it without taking out a bank loan the land hadnt exactly been cheap despite what caswell had told us even if its history hadnt made it the most attractive of propositions and it was more money than anyone expected otis caswell to come up with but he hadnt bitched about the price or even attempted to bargain with the realtor who was selling it on behalf of the descendants of the late bennett lumley since then he had posted his no trespassing notices and kept himself pretty much to himself nobody bothered him up there nobody had cause to there were two possibilities neither of which reflected well on caswell the first was that someone had given him the money to make the purchase in order to keep their interest in the land secret after which caswell turned a blind eye to the uses to which the restored house was being put the other possibility was that he was an active participant in what occurred there either way he knew enough to make him worth pursuing i found his number in the local directory and called him from my room he picked up on the second ring expecting a call mr caswell i asked who is this we met earlier my name is parker he hung up i dialed again this time three or four rings went by before he picked up the phone what do you want he said i told you i got nothing to say to you i think you know what i want mr caswell i want you to tell me about what went on in that empty house with the plexiglas windows and the strong door i want you to tell me about andy kellog and lucy merrick if you do that then maybe i can save you save me save me from what what are you talking about from frank merrick there was silence on the other end of the line dont call here again said caswell i dont know a frank merrick or any of them other names you said hes coming otis youd better believe that he wants to know what happened to his daughter and hes not going to be reasonable like my friends and me i think your buddies are going to cut you loose otis and leave you to him or maybe theyll decide that youre the weak link and do to you what they did to daniel clay we didnt began caswell then caught himself didnt what otis didnt do anything to daniel clay didnt kill him why dont you tell me about it fuck you said caswell fuck you to hell and back he hung up when i called a third time nobody picked up the phone just rang and rang at the other end and i pictured otis caswell in his whitetrash house his hands over his ears to block out the sound until at last the ringing changed to a busy signal as he removed the connection from the wall night descended our encounter with caswell marked the beginning of the end men were heading northwest merrick among them but the sands of his life were slowly trickling away not through the neck of some old hourglass but from the palm of his own hand his fingers clasped tightly against his skin as the dry grains slipped through the gap below his little finger by asking questions about daniel clay he had shortened the span of his existence he had held open his hands and accepted the sands knowing that he would be unable to hold them for long that now they would peter away twice as fast he had merely hoped that he could stay alive long enough to discover his daughters final resting place and so as darkness fell merrick found himself in the old moose lodge its name sounded quaint evoking images of wooden floors comfortable chairs friendly maine hosts to greet the guests a roaring log fire in the lobby rooms that managed to be clean and modern while never losing touch with their rustic roots and breakfasts of maple syrup bacon and pancakes served by smiling young women at tables overlooking placid lakes and mile upon mile of evergreen forest in fact nobody had ever stayed in the old moose lodge at least not in a bed in the past men might have slept off their drunks in a back room but they had done so on the floor so stupefied by alcohol that comfort mattered less than a place in which to lie flat and allow the blankness they had been seeking to overwhelm them now even that small concession had been taken away for fear that the lodges liquor license annual speculation about the renewal of which provided regular fodder for the local newspaper and most of the populace might finally be removed if it was found to be operating as a crash pad for drunks still the impression created by its name was not entirely inapt it did have wooden floors merrick sat at a deuce near the back of the bar facing away from the door but with a mirror on the wall in front of him that allowed him to see all those who entered without anyone immediately being able to spot him although the bar was warm causing him to sweat profusely he did not take off his heavy tan suede coat in part it enabled him to keep the gun in its pocket within easy reach it also meant that the wound in his side which had begun to bleed again would not be visible if it soaked through the bandages and into his shirt he had killed the russians just beyond bingham where stream road branched off the and followed the path of the austin stream toward mayfield township he had known that they would come the killing of demarcian alone might have been enough to draw them to him but there were also grudges outstanding against him relating to a pair of jobs at the beginning of the nineties one in little odessa the other in boston he was surprised that they had not made a move on him in prison but the supermax had protected him by isolating him and his reputation had done the rest after the killing of demarcian word would have spread calls would have been made favors requested debts wiped out perhaps he should not have killed demarcian but the little man with the withered arm had repelled him and he was a link in the chain of events that had taken merrick s daughter from him if nothing else the lawyer eldritch had been right about that much if the price to be paid for demarcians death was more killing then merrick was willing to oblige they would not stop him from reaching gilead there he felt certain he would find the answers that he sought he wondered how the russians had found him so quickly after all he had changed his car yet here they were those two men in their black x merrick reflected that perhaps he should not have left rebecca clays exhusband alive but merrick was not a man who killed without some cause and as far he could tell legere knew nothing even his exwife had not trusted him enough to share anything about her father with him but merrick was also certain that almost since his quest had begun his progress was being shadowed and his every move watched he thought of the old lawyer in his paperfilled office and his unseen benefactor the mysterious other who had instructed eldritch to help him who had provided funds a place to hide and information the lawyer had never provided a satisfactory explanation for his willingness to aid merrick and merricks distrust of him had quickly grown leading him to distance himself from the old man as soon as was feasible the period of his recent brief incarceration apart yet even after that when he was taking care to cover his tracks there were times when he had felt himself being watched sometimes when he was in a crowd trying to lose himself in a mall or a bar and other times when he was alone he thought that he had caught a glimpse of a man once a ragged figure in an old black coat who was examining merrick thoughtfully through a cloud of cigarette smoke but when he tried to follow him the man had vanished and merrick had not seen him again then there were the nightmares they had begun in the safe house shortly after merrick had been given the car and the money by eldritch visions of pale wasted creatures their eye sockets black their mouths lipless and wrinkled all dressed in soiled tan coats old mackintoshes with buttons missing and reddish brown stains on the collars and the sleeves merrick would awaken in the darkness and in that moment between sleeping and consciousness he thought that he could almost see them receding from him as though they had been leaning over him while he slept no breath emerging from their mouths only a stale smell of something old and noxious lodged deep within themselves since he had abandoned the safe house the dreams had come less often but there were still nights when he ascended from the depths of sleep to a crawling sensation on his skin and a faint stench that had not been there when he closed his eyes had eldritch reckoning merrick to be a liability told the russians where he was facilitated by the other or by the man in the ragged black coat were this man and eldritchs client one and the same merrick did not know and it no longer mattered it was all nearing an end and soon there would be peace the russians had been careless he had seen them coming watching in the rearview as they hung three or four cars back occasionally overtaking when it was necessary to keep him in sight he had pulled over at one point to see if they would pass him and they had keeping their eyes fixed straight ahead scrupulously ignoring him as he spread a map upon the steering wheel and pretended to trace his route with a finger too many trucks passing for them to be able to take him while he was stopped he had let them go then pulled out after a few minutes had gone by he saw them ahead hanging back in the slow lane hoping that he would pass them again and he obliged after a couple of miles he turned onto stream road and from there found a dirt track that would suit his purpose he followed it for over a mile past abandoned shacks set back from the road past a doublewide trailer and cars slouched on tireless rims until even those humble tokens of human habitation disappeared and the road became rougher yet bouncing him in his seat and causing his spine to ache when there was only forest before and behind to north and south east and west he cut the engine he could hear them approaching he got out of the car leaving the drivers door open and moved into the trees heading back in the direction in which he had come until the russians appeared they stopped when they came to his abandoned car he could almost guess the conversation that was taking place within they would have known that they had followed him into a trap the only question for them was how to free themselves from it while ensuring merrick s death and their own survival crouched in the undergrowth merrick saw the one in the passenger seat the man with red hair look over his shoulder their options were limited they could reverse and leave hoping to catch him again on the road whether he tried to escape on foot or by car or they could get out one from each side and try to hunt him on foot they would be at their most vulnerable when they opened the doors but their reasoning would be that if he opened fire on them he might hit one of them at most if he was lucky and in doing so he would expose his position in the end merrick did not wait for them to open the doors as soon as the redheaded man looked away merrick lunged out of the bushes and began firing through the rear window once twice three times and as it disintegrated he saw a wash of blood appear on the windshield and the driver collapse sideways his partner opened the passenger door and dropped to the ground firing at merrick as the older man advanced for there was no retreating now merrick felt a tug at his side and a sensation of numbness followed by a searing redhot pain but still he fired experiencing a surge of satisfaction as the body of the second russian jerked on the ground and the shooting stopped he advanced on the slumped figure slowly feeling the blood flowing down his side soaking his shirt and his pants he kicked the russians gun away and stood over him the redheaded man was lying on his side against the right rear wheel there was a wound beneath his neck and another almost dead in the center of his chest his eyes were halfclosed but he was still breathing gasping at the pain of his injury merrick bent down picked up the russians colt then searched the pockets of the mans jacket until he found a wallet and a spare magazine for the pistol the name on the drivers license was yevgeny utarov it meant nothing to him merrick took the from the wallet and jammed it into his own pocket then tossed the wallet on the dying mans lap he spit on the ground and was happy to see that there was no blood in the sputum nevertheless he was angry at himself for being wounded it was the first time he had been hit in many many years it seemed to speak to him of the slow march of time of his age and his impending mortality he swayed slightly on his feet the movement seemed to distract the man named yevgeny from the fact of his own dying his eyes opened wider and he tried to say something merrick stood over him give me a name he said you got time in you yet otherwise ill leave you here to die itll be slow and that pain youre feeling will get worse you give me a name and itll go easier on you utarov whispered something speak up now said merrick i aint bending down again utarov tried once more this time the words sounded like blades being whetted against rough stone deep in his throat dubus he said merrick shot the russian twice more in the chest then staggered away leaving a trail of blood behind him on the road like squashed berries he leaned against his car and stripped to the waist exposing the wound the bullet was lodged deep in the flesh in the past there were men whom he could have called upon to help him but they were all gone now he tied his shirt around his waist to stem the bleeding then put his coat and jacket on over his naked torso and got back in the car he slipped the smith with only three rounds left back under the drivers seat and placed the colt in the pocket of his coat turning the car back toward the main road was agony and the ride along the trail caused him to grit his teeth so that he would not have to hear himself cry out but he managed it he drove for three miles before he found a veterinary practice and there he made the old man whose name was on the sign outside remove the bullet while merrick held a gun on him he did not pass out from the pain but it was a close thing merrick knew who dubus was somehow all of this had started with him had begun the first time dubus forced himself upon a child he had brought his appetites with him to gilead and from there they had spread merrick held a gun to the veterinarians head and asked him if he knew where mason dubus lived and the old man told him for dubus was wellknown in the region merrick locked the veterinarian in the basement with two pint bottles of water and some bread and cheese so that he could keep body and soul together he promised the vet that he would call the cops within twentyfour hours until then he would just have to amuse himself as best he could he found a bottle of tylenol in a medicine cabinet and helped himself to some rolls of clean dressing and a pair of fresh pants from the old mans closet then left and continued on his journey but driving was hard the tylenol took some of the edge off the pain though and at caratunk he turned off the again as the vet had told him to do and came at last to mason dubuss house dubus saw him coming in a way dubus had been expecting him he was still talking on his cell phone when merrick shot the lock from the front door and entered the house already dripping the spots of blood on the pristine floor dubus pressed the red button to end the call then dropped the phone on a chair beside him i know who you are he said thats good said merrick your little girl is dead i know that soon youll be dead too maybe but youll be dead sooner dubus pointed a trembling finger at merrick you think im going to plead with you for my life you think im going to help you merrick raised the colt no i dont he said and he shot dubus twice as the old man lay spasming on the floor merrick picked up the cell phone and redialed the phone was answered after two rings there was no voice but merrick could hear a man breathing then the connection was ended merrick put the phone on the floor and left the house dubuss final breaths slowly fading from hearing as he left him to die dubus listened to merrick s footsteps then the noise of a car driving away there was a great weight on his chest studded with pain as though a bed of nails had been laid upon him he stared at the ceiling there was blood in his mouth he knew that he was only moments away from death he began to pray to ask god to forgive his sins his lips moved soundlessly as he tried to remember the right words but he was distracted by memories and by his anger at the fact that he should die this way the victim of a killer who would shoot an unarmed old man he felt cold air and there came a sound from behind him someone approached and he thought that merrick had come back to finish him off but when he moved his head he saw not merrick but the end of a filthy tan coat and old brown shoes stained with dirt there was a stench in the air and even in the time of his dying it made him gag then there were more footsteps to his left and he was aware of presences behind him of unseen figures watching him dubus tilted his head and saw pale features and black holes gaping in withered skin he opened his mouth to speak but there were no more words left to say and no more breaths left in his body and he died with the hollow men in his eyes merrick drove for miles but his vision began to blur and the pain and the loss of blood had weakened him he made it as far as the old moose lodge and there fooled like so many others in the past by the names false promise of a bed he stopped now he was sitting at the deuce drinking jack daniels on top of the tylenol snoozing a little in the hope that he might recover some of his strength so that he could continue on to gilead nobody bothered him the old moose lodge actively encouraged its customers to take the occasional short rest as long as they got back to drinking when they were done a jukebox played honkytonk music and the glass eyes of dead animals stared down at the patrons from the walls while merrick drifted unsure if he was sleeping or waking at some point a waitress asked him if he was okay and merrick nodded pointing to his whiskey glass to order another even though he had barely touched the first he was afraid that they might ask him to move on and he wasnt ready to do that yet waking sleeping music then no music voices whispers daddy merrick opened his eyes there was a little girl sitting across from him she had dark hair and her skin was broken where the gas had erupted from within a bug was crawling across her forehead he wanted to brush it away but his hands wouldnt move hi honey he said where you been there was dirt on the little girls hands and two of her fingernails were broken waiting waiting for what honey for you merrick nodded i couldnt come until now i wasthey had me locked up but i was always thinking about you i never forgot about you i know you were too far away now youre near now i can come to you what happened to you darlin whyd you go away i fell asleep i fell asleep and i couldnt wake up there was no emotion in her voice her eyes never blinked merrick noticed that the left side of her face was cherry red and purple marked by the colors of lividity wont be long now honey he said he found the strength to move his hand he reached for her and felt something cold and hard against his fingers the whiskey glass toppled on the table distracting him for a moment so that when he looked back the girl was gone the whiskey flowed around his fingers and dripped onto the floor and the waitress appeared and said i think maybe you ought to be heading home now and merrick nodded and replied yeah i think maybe youre right its time to go home he stood feeling the blood squelch in his shoe the room began to spin around him and he gripped the table to give himself some support the sensation of giddiness went away and he was aware once again of the pain in his side he looked down the side of his trousers was soaked a deep red the waitress also saw the stain hey she said what and then she looked into merrick s eyes and thought better of asking the question merrick reached into his pocket and found some bills there was a twenty and a ten among them and he threw them all on the waitresss tray thank you darlin he said and now there was a kindness in his eyes and the waitress was uncertain whether he thought that he was talking to her or to another who had taken her place in his mind im ready now he walked from the bar passing through the ranks of dancing couples and noisy drunks of lovers and friends moving from light to darkness from the life within to the life beyond when he stepped outside the cool of the night air made him reel again for a moment then cleared his head he took his keys from his jacket pocket and headed for his car each step forcing more blood from his wound each step taking him a little closer to the end he stopped at the car and used his left hand to support himself against the roof while his right fitted the key into the lock he opened the door and saw himself reflected in the glass of the side window then another reflection joined his hovering behind his shoulder it was a bird a monstrous dove with a white face and a dark beak and human eyes buried deep in its sockets it raised a wing but the wing was black not white with claws at the end that held something long and metal in their grip and then the wing began to beat with a soft swishing sound and he felt a new sharp pain as his collarbone was broken by a blow he twisted trying to get to the gun in his pocket but another bird appeared this time a hawk and this bird was holding a baseball bat a good oldfashioned louisville slugger designed if held in the right hands to knock that baby right out of the ballpark except now the slugger was aimed at his head he couldnt duck to avoid the blow so he raised his left arm instead the impact shattered his elbow and the wings were beating and the blows were raining down upon him and he dropped to his knees as something in his head came apart with a noise like bread breaking and his eyes were filled with red he opened his mouth to speak although there were no words for him to form and his jaw was almost torn from his face as the crowbar swung in a lazy arc felling him like a tree so that he lay flat on the cold gravel while the blood flowed and the beating went on his body making strange soft sounds bones moving inside where bones had no right to move the framework within fracturing the tender organs bursting and still he lived the blows stopped but the pain did not a foot slid under his belly levering him upward so that he flopped onto his back resting slightly against the open door half in half out of the car one hand lying useless by his side the other thrown back into the interior he saw the whole world through a red prism dominated by birds like men and men like birds hes gone said a voice and it sounded familiar to merrick no he aint said another not yet there was hot breath close to his ear you shouldnt have come here said the second voice you should have just forgot about her shes long dead but she was good while she lasted he was conscious of movement to his left the crowbar struck him just above the ear and light shone through the prism refracting the world in a redtinged rainbow turning it to splinters of color in his fading consciousness daddy almost there honey almost there and still still he lived the fingers of his right hand clawed at the floor of the car they found the barrel of the smith io and he tugged it free of the tape and flicked at it until he could reach the grip pulling it toward him willing the blackness to lift if only for a moment daddy in a minute honey daddys got something he has to do first slowly he drew the gun to him he tried to lift it but his wounded arm would not hold the weight instead he allowed himself to fall on his side and the pain was almost beyond endurance as splintered bone and torn flesh shuddered from the impact he opened his eyes or perhaps they had always been open and it was just the new waves of pain provoked by the movement that caused the mist briefly to lift his cheek was flat against the gravel his right arm was outstretched before him the gun lying on the horizontal there were two figures ahead of him walking side by side perhaps fifteen feet from where he lay he shifted his hand slightly ignoring the feeling of his fractured bones rubbing against one another until the gun was pointing at the two men and somehow merrick found the strength within himself to pull the trigger or perhaps it was the strength of another added to his own for he thought he felt a pressure on the knuckle of his index finger as though someone were pressing softly upon it the man on the right seemed to do a little jog then stumbled and fell as his shattered ankle gave way he shouted something that merrick could not understand but merrick s finger was tightening on the trigger for the second shot and he had no time for the utterances of others he fired again the target larger now for the injured man was lying on his side his friend trying to lift him but the shot was wild the gun bucking in his hand and sending the bullet over the recumbent figure merrick had the time and the strength to pull the trigger one last time he fired as the blackness descended and the bullet tore through the forehead of the wounded man exiting in a red cloud the survivor tried to drag the body away but the dead mans foot caught in a storm drain people appeared at the door of the old moose lodge for even in a place like this the sound of gunfire was bound to attract attention voices shouted and figures began to run toward him the survivor fled leaving the dead man behind merrick exhaled a final breath a woman stood over him the waitress from the bar she spoke but merrick did not hear what she said daddy im here lucy for merrick was gone chapter xxxiii while frank merrick died with his daughters name upon his lips angel louis and i decided on a course of action to deal with caswell we were in the bar the remains of our meal still scattered around us but we werent drinking we agreed that caswell appeared close to some form of breakdown although whether caused by incipient guilt or something else we could not tell it was angel who put it best as he often did if hes so overcome with guilt then why lucy merrick has been missing for years unless they kept her there for all that time which doesnt seem too likely then why is he so consciencestricken now all of a sudden merrick perhaps i said which means somebody told him that merrick has been asking questions not necessarily its not like merrick has been keeping a low profile the cops are aware of him and thanks to demarcians killing the russians are too demarcian was involved somehow merrick didnt just pick his name out of a hat you think maybe these guys were sharing images of the abuse and thats the connection to demarcian asked angel dr christian said that he hadnt heard of anything involving men with bird masks turning up in photos or on video but that doesnt mean theres nothing like that out there they would have been taking a chance by selling it said angel might have risked drawing attention to themselves maybe they needed the money said louis but caswell had enough to buy the gilead land outright i replied it doesnt sound like money was an issue but where did the cash come from asked angel had to have come from somewhere so maybe they were selling this stuff how much does it go for though i said enough to buy a patch of unwanted land in a forest the barman said that the land wasnt exactly given away for free but it didnt cost the earth either he could have bought it for the equivalent of nickels and dimes angel shrugged depends what they were selling depends how bad it was for the kids i mean none of us said anything more for a time i tried to create patterns in my mind to put together a sequence of events that made sense but i kept losing myself in contradictory statements and false trails more and more i was convinced that clay was involved with what had occurred but how then to balance that with christians view of him as a man who was almost obsessed with finding evidence of abuse even to the detriment of his own career or rebecca clays description of a loving father devoted to the children in his charge then there were the russians louis had asked some questions and discovered the identity of the redheaded man who had come to my house his name was utarov and he was one of the most trusted captains in the new england operation according to louis there was paper out on merrick a piece of unfinished business relating to some jobs he had undertaken against the russians sometime in the past but there were also rumors of unease in new england prostitutes mainly those of asian african and eastern european origin had been moved out of massachusetts and providence and told to lie low or they had been forced to do so by the men who controlled them more specialized services had also been curtailed particularly those relating to child pornography and child prostitution trafficking louis had concluded explains why they took the asians and the others off the streets and left the pure american womanhood to take up the slack theyre worried about something and its connected to demarcian their appetites would have stayed the same wasnt that what christian had told me these men wouldnt have stopped abusing but they might have found another outlet for their urges young children acquired through boston perhaps with demarcian as one of the points of contact what then did they film the abuse and sell it back to demarcian and others like him one operation funding another was that the nature of their particular project caswell was part of it and he was weak and vulnerable i was certain that he had put in a call as soon as he had encountered us a plea for help from those whom he had assisted in the past it would have increased the pressure on all of them forcing them to respond and we would be waiting for them when they came angel and louis went to their car and drove up to caswells place parking out of sight of the road and his house to take the first watch i could almost see them there as i went to my room to get some sleep before my turn came the car dark and quiet perhaps some music playing low on the radio angel dozing louis still and intent part of his attention on the road beyond while some hidden part of him wandered unknown worlds in his mind in my dreams i walked through gilead and i heard the voices of children crying i turned to the church and saw that there were young girls and boys wrapped in stinging ivy the creepers tightening on their naked bodies as they were absorbed into the green world i saw blood on the ground and the remains of an infant wrapped in swaddling clothes points of red seeping through the cloth and a thin man crawled out of a hole in the ground his face torn and ruined by decay his teeth visible through the holes in his cheeks old gilead said daniel clay it gets in your soul the call came through on the phone in my room while i was sleeping it was orourke since there was no cell phone coverage in jackman it had seemed like a good idea to let someone know where i was in case anything happened back east so both orourke and jackie garner had the number of the lodge after all my gun was still out there and i would bear some responsibility for whatever merrick did with it merrick s dead he said i sat up i could still taste food in my mouth but it tasted of dirt and the memory of my dream was strong how killed in the parking lot of the old moose lodge it sounds like he had an eventful final day he was busy right up to the end mason dubus was shot dead yesterday with a tenmillimeter bullet were still waiting on a ballistics match but its not like people get shot here every day and not usually with a ten couple of hours ago a somerset county sheriff s deputy found two bodies on a side road just out of bingham russians it looks like then they got a call from a woman who found her father locked in his basement a couple of miles north of the scene seems the old guy was a vetthe animal kind not the war kindand a man matching merricks description forced him to treat a gunshot wound and give him directions to dubuss house before locking him up from what the vet said the wound was pretty serious but he sewed it and strapped it as best he could it looks like merrick continued northwest killed dubus then had to stop at the lodge he was bleeding badly by then according to witnesses he sat in a corner drank some whiskey talked to himself then headed outside they were waiting for him there how many two both wearing bird masks ring any bells they beat him to death or near enough to it i guess they thought the job was done when they left him how long did he survive long enough to take your gun from under the drivers seat and shoot one of his attackers im going on what ive been told but the cops at the scene cant figure out how he managed it they broke just about every bone in his body he must have wanted to kill this guy real bad he got him with one in the left ankle then one in the head his pal tried to drag him away but he got the dead guys foot caught in a drain so he had to leave him did the vic have a name im sure he did but he wasnt carrying a wallet that or his friend removed it before he left to try to cover his tracks you want maybe i can make some calls and arrange for you to take a look at him hes down in augusta now mes due to conduct an autopsy in the morning how you liking jackman i never took you for the hunting kind not animals anyhow he stopped talking then repeated the name of the town jackman he said thoughtfully the old moose lodge is kind of on the way to jackman i guess i guess i echoed him and jackmans pretty close to gilead and mason dubus was the big dog when gilead was open for business thats about it i said neutrally i didnt know if orourke was aware of merrick s act of vandalism at harmons house and i was sure he didnt know about andy kellogs pictures i didnt want the cops up here dancing all over the site not yet i wanted to break caswell for myself i now felt that i owed it to frank merrick if i can work it out you can bet that soon a lot of other cops will have worked it out too said orourke i think you may be having some company up there you know i might feel bad if i thought youd been holding out on me but you wouldnt do that would you im figuring it out as i go along thats all i said wouldnt want to waste your time before i was certain of what i knew yeah ill bet said orourke you give me a call when you go to look at that body i will dont forget now otherwise i really might start to take things personally he hung up it was time i called caswell it took him four rings to pick up he sounded groggy given the hour i wasnt surprised who is this its charlie parker i told you i got nothing shut up otis merrick is dead i didnt tell him that merrick had managed to kill one of his attackers it was better that he didnt know not yet if merrick had been killed at the old moose last night then anyone who was planning on hitting jackman afterward would have been here by now and would have run into angel and louis but we had heard nothing which meant that merricks killing of one of the men had scared them off for the moment theyre closing in on you otis two men attacked merrick on the id say that they were on their way up here when they took him and this is their next stop it could be that theyll try and take my friends and me out but i dont think theyre that brave they took merrick from behind with bats and bars we carry guns maybe they do too but were better than they are i guarantee it its like i told you otis youre the weak link they get rid of you and they can remake the chain stronger than it was before right now im your best hope for making it alive to daybreak there was silence on the other end of the line then what sounded like a sob i know you didnt mean to hurt her otis you dont look like the kind of man whod hurt a little girl this time the crying was clearer i pressed on these other men the ones who killed frank merrick theyre different from you youre not like them otis dont let them drag you down to their level youre not a killer otis you dont kill men and you dont kill little girls i cant see it in you i just cant caswell drew in a ragged breath i wouldnt hurt a child he said i love children and there was something in the way he said it that made me feel filthy inside and out it made me want to bathe in acid then swallow what was left in the bottle to purge my insides i know i said and i had to force the words from my mouth i bet you take care of those graves out at moose river too dont you im right arent i yes he said they shouldnt ought to have done that to little babies they shouldnt ought to have killed them i tried not to think about why he thought that they should have been spared why they should have been allowed to grow into young children it wouldnt help not now otis what happened to lucy merrick she was there wasnt she in that house then she disappeared what happened otis where did she go i heard him sniffing could see him wiping his nose on his arm it was an accident he said they brought her here and he stopped he had never had to put a name to what he did to children before not to someone who was not like him this was not the time to make him theres no need to tell me that otis not yet just tell me how it ended he did not reply and i feared that i had lost him i did bad said caswell like a child who had soiled itself i did bad and now theyve come what i didnt understand there are men there now i cursed the lack of coverage up here maybe i should have gone straight to angel and louis but i remembered caswells sweaty hands on his shotgun he might have been on the verge of a breakdown but there was always the risk that he could be willing to take someone with him when he finally fell apart according to angel his cottage had barred windows and a heavy oak door like the cottage in which lucy merrick had been held breaking in without being shot at would have been anything from difficult to impossible theyve been here all along caswell continued the words slipping from his mouth in near whispers least for this past week maybe more i dont recall properly it feels like theyve always been here and i dont sleep so good now because of them i see them at night mostly out of the corner of my eye they dont do nothing they just stand there like theyre waiting for something who are they otis but i already knew they were the hollow men faces in shadow old dirty coats ive tried talking to them asking them what they want but they dont answer and when i try to look straight at them its like theyre not there i have to make them go away but i dont know how my friends and i will come up there otis well take you somewhere safe you just hold on you know said caswell faintly i dont think theyll let me leave are they there because of lucy otis is that why theyve come her the others but the others didnt die otis thats right isnt it we were always careful we had to be they were children something sour bubbled in my throat i forced it back down had lucy been with you before not up here a couple of times someplace else i wasnt there they gave her pot booze they liked her she was different somehow they made her promise not to tell they had ways of doing that i thought of andy kellog of how he had sacrificed himself to save another little girl they had ways what happened to lucy otis what went wrong it was a mistake he said he had grown almost calm as though he were talking about a minor fender bender or an error on his taxes they left her with me afterafter he coughed then went on again letting what was done to lucy merrick a fourteenyearold girl who had lost her way remain unsaid they were going to come back the next day or could be it was a couple of days i dont remember im confused now i just had to look after her she had a blanket and a mattress i fed her and i gave her some toys and some books but it got real cold all of a sudden real cold i was going to bring her up to my place but i was afraid that she might see something up there something that would help them to identify me when we let her go i had a little gasoline generator in the house so i turned it on for her and she went to sleep i had a mind to check on her every few hours but i dozed off myself when i woke up she was lying on the floor he started sobbing again and it took him almost a minute before he could continue i smelled the fumes when i got to the door i wrapped a cloth around my face and i still could hardly breathe she was lying on the floor and she was all red and purple shed been sick on herself i dont know how long shed been dead i swear the generator had been working fine earlier maybe shed tried to tinker with it i just dont know i didnt mean for it to happen oh god i didnt mean for it to happen that way he started to wail i let him cry for a while then interrupted him where did you put her otis i wanted her to rest somewhere nice near god and the angels i buried her behind the steeple of the old church it was the closest i could get to hallowed ground i couldnt mark the place or nothing but shes there i sometimes put flowers on the spot in summer i talk to her i tell her im sorry for what happened and the private detective what about poole i had nothing to do with that he sounded indignant he wouldnt walk away he kept asking questions i had to make a call i buried him in the church too but away from lucy her place was special who killed him ill confess my own sins but i wont confess another mans its not for me to do daniel clay was he involved i never met him otis replied i dont know what happened to him i just heard the name you remember now i didnt mean for it to happen the way it did i just wanted her to be warm i told you i love children what was the project otis the children were the project he replied the little children the others found them and brought them up here thats what we called it the project it was our secret who were those other men i cant tell you i got nothing more to say to you okay otis were going to come up there now well take you somewhere safe but now as the last minutes of his life slipped slowly by the barriers that otis caswell had erected between himself and the reality of what he had done seemed to fall away nowheres safe he said i just want it to end he drew in a deep breath stifling another sob it seemed to give him some strength i gotta go now i gotta let some men in he put the phone down and the connection was broken i was on the road five minutes later and at the spot where the trail to caswells place joined the main road in ten i flashed my lights where i knew louis and angel to be but there was no sign of them farther ahead the gate was open and the lock busted i followed the trail to the house there was a truck parked outside louiss lexus was beside it the front door to the house was open a light shining outside its me i called in here replied louis from somewhere to my right i followed his voice into a sparsely furnished bedroom it had whitewashed walls exposed beams ran along the ceiling otis caswell was hanging from one of them there was an overturned chair on the floor and drops of urine were still falling from his bare feet i was out taking a leak said angel i saw he struggled to find the words i saw the door was open and i thought i saw men go in but when we got up here there was nobody but caswell and he was already dead i stepped forward and rolled up each sleeve of his shirt in turn his skin was bare of tattoos however else he was involved otis caswell was not the man with the eagle on his arm angel and louis looked at me but said nothing he knew i said he knew who they were but he wouldnt tell now he was dead and that knowledge had died with him then i remembered the man killed by frank merrick there was still time first though we searched the house carefully going through drawers and closets checking the floors and the skirting for any hiding places it was angel who found the stash in the end there was a hole in the wall behind a halfempty bookcase it contained bags of photographs most printed from a computer and dozens of unmarked videocassettes and dvds angel leafed through a couple of the pictures then put them down and stepped away i glanced at them but did not have the stomach to go through them all there was no need i knew what they would contain only the faces of the children would change louis gestured at the cassettes and dvds there was a metal stand in one corner dominated by a new flatscreen tv it looked out of place in caswells home you want to look at these no i have to leave i said clean down anything youve touched then you get out of here too you going to call the cops asked angel i shook my head not for a couple of hours what did he tell you he said that merricks daughter died of carbon monoxide poisoning he buried her behind the steeple in the forest you believed him i dont know i looked at caswells face purple with blood i could feel no pity for him and my only regret was that he had died without revealing more you want us to stay close asked louis go back to portland but stay away from scarborough i need to look at a body then ill call you we went outside the air was still the forest quiet there was an alien scent in the air behind me i heard louis sniff someones been smoking he said i walked past caswells truck over short grass and a small vegetable patch until i came to where the forest began after a few steps i found it a rollup discarded in the dirt i lifted it carefully and blew on the tip it glowed red for an instant then died louis appeared beside me angel close behind they both had guns in their hands i showed them the cigarette he was here i said we led him to caswell theres a mark on the little finger of caswells right hand said angel looks like there was a pinkie ring once no sign of it now i stared into the darkness of the forest but i had no sense of the presence of another the collector was gone orourke had done as he had promised he had left word with the mes office to say that i might be able to identify the dead man i was at the office by seven and was joined soon after by orourke and a pair of state police detectives one of whom was hansen he didnt speak as i was led into the icebox to view the body in total there were five bodies set to go under the mes knife the unidentified man from the old moose lodge mason dubus the two russians and merrick they were so pressed for space that the two russians were being stored at an undertakers office nearby which one is merrick i asked the mes assistant the man whose name i did not know pointed at the body nearest the wall it was covered with a white plastic sheet you feeling sorry for him it was hansen he killed four men in twelve hours with your gun you ought to be feeling sorry but not for him i said nothing instead i stood over the body of merricks killer i think i even managed to keep my face expressionless when the mans face was revealed the red wound on the right side of his forehead still messy with dirt and congealed matter i dont know him i said you sure asked orourke yeah im sure i said as i turned away from the body of jerry legere rebecca clays exhusband hes nobody i know they would come back to haunt me of course all of the lies and halftruths they would cost me more than i could then have imagined although perhaps i had been living on borrowed time for so long that i shouldnt have been surprised at the consequences i could have given the detectives all that i knew i could have told them about andy kellog and otis caswell and the bodies that might be buried within the walls of a ruined church but i did not i dont know why i think that maybe it was because i was close to the truth and i wanted to reveal it for myself and even in that i was to be disappointed for what in the end was the truth like the lawyer elwin stark had said the only truth was that everybody lied or perhaps it was because of frank merrick i knew what he had done i knew he had killed and would have killed again if he had been allowed to live i was still bruised and sore from where he had punched me and i was aware of a lingering resentment at the way he had humiliated me in my own home but in his love for his daughter and in his singleminded obsession with discovering the truth behind her disappearance and with punishing those responsible for it i saw something of myself reflected now that lucy merricks resting place had been revealed the rest of the men who had led her to that place remained to be found three of those involvedcaswell legere and it now seemed dubuswere dead andy kellog had recalled four masks and i had seen no tattoos on the arms of caswell or of legere the man with the eagle the one who andy felt was the leader the dominant one was still alive i was climbing into my car when a piece fell into place i thought of the damage to one corner of the cottage in which lucy merrick had died the holes in the wall and the marks where screws had once held something in place and recalled part of what caswell had said to me on the phone it had bothered me at the time but i was too intent upon squeezing him for more information to notice it it came back to me nowi had a mind to check on her every few hours but i dozed off myself when i woke up she was lying on the floorand i found the connection three were dead but now i had another name chapter xxxiv raymon lang lived between bath and brunswick on a small patch of land off route close by the northern bank of the new meadows river id taken a cursory look at langs home when i got there just before nine he hadnt done much with his property apart from plant a tan trailer home on it that looked at first sight like a strong sneeze might blow it away the trailer sat high off the ground in a cursory nod to aesthetics a kind of picket fence had been erected between the bottom of the trailer and the earth masking the dirt and pipes beneath i had managed only three or four hours sleep that night but i was not tired the more i thought about what caswell had told me before he died the more convinced i was that raymon lang was involved in the abduction of lucy merrick caswell had told me that he had seen lucy lying on the floor dying or already dead the question was how had caswell known how could he have seen her when he had woken up after all had he been in the cabin with her then he too would have died he hadnt fallen asleep there he was sleeping back in his own place which meant that there was a way of watching the cabin from his home there was a camera the mark in the corner of the cabin wall indicated where the camera had been and whom did we know who put cameras in places raymon lang helped by his old buddy jerry legere regrettably no longer with us asecure the firm for which lang worked had also installed the security system at daniel clays house which now seemed less like a coincidence than before i wondered how rebecca would take the news of her exhusbands death i doubted that she would be overcome by grief but who could be certain i had seen wives weep themselves into a stupor over the sickbeds of abusive husbands and children cry hysterically at the funerals of fathers who had torn stripes in their thighs and buttocks with a belt sometimes i didnt think they even understood why they were in tears but grief was as good a name as any to give to their reason i guessed that lang was also the other man involved in the killing of frank merrick according to eyewitnesses a silver or gray car had been seen leaving the scene and from where i sat i could see langs silver sierra shining through the trees the cops hadnt picked it up on the road to the old moose lodge as they headed north but that didnt mean anything in the panic after the shooting it might have taken the cops a while to get witness statements by which time lang could have driven as far as the highway even if someone had reported seeing a car during the initial call lang would still have had time to get at least as far as bingham and there he would have enjoyed the choice of three routes north south or to continue on the he would probably have kept going south but there were enough side roads after bingham to enable him to avoid dozens of cops if he was lucky and kept his cool i was parked by the side of a gas station about fifty feet west of langs drive drinking coffee and reading the press herald there was a dunkin donuts attached to the gas station with seating for only a handful of customers which meant that it wasnt unusual to see people eating in their cars it meant that i wasnt likely to stand out while i was watching langs place after an hour lang emerged from the trailer and the patch of silver started to move as he turned onto the main road and headed in the direction of bath seconds later louis and angel followed him in the lexus i had my cell phone close to hand in case it turned out to be just a short trip even though lang had his toolbox with him when he was walking to his car i still gave him a half hour on the off chance that he decided to head back for some reason then left my car where it was and cut through the trees to get to the trailer lang didnt seem to keep a dog which was good news its hard to perform a little breaking and entering while a dog is trying to rip your throat out the trailer door didnt look like much but i still didnt have angels ability to pick a lock frankly its a lot harder than it looks and i didnt want to spend half an hour squatting in front of langs door trying to open it with a pick and tension tool i used to own an electric rake which did the job just as well but the rake got lost when my old mustang was shot up a few years back and id never bothered to replace it anyway the only reason a private detective might keep a rake in his car would be in order to bust illegally into someones place and if my car was searched for any reason by the cops it would look bad and i might lose my license i didnt need angel to help me break into langs trailer because i didnt plan on leaving lang in any doubt that his place had been searched at the very least it would rattle him and i wanted him rattled unlike caswell lang didnt look like the kind of guy who was going to reach for a noose when things got tough instead if merrick s fate was any indication he was the kind to lash out the thought that lang might not be guilty of anything never really crossed my mind for the purposes of breaking into langs trailer i had a crowbar under my coat i forced it between the door and the frame of the trailer then kept pushing until the lock broke the first thing that struck me about the interior of langs trailer was that it was stiflingly hot inside the second was that it was tidy and therefore not what i had expected from a single mans trailer to the left was a galleystyle kitchen with a table beyond it surrounded by a threesided couch arrangement that took up the entire lower quarter of the trailer to the right just before the sleeping area was a lazboy recliner and an expensive sony widescreen television beneath which stood a matching dvd a dvd recorder and a twin vcr there were tapes and dvds on a shelf beside it action movies some comedies even a couple of bogart and cagney classics under them was a selection of porn on both dvd and video i glanced at some of the titles but they seemed like pretty average fare there was nothing related to children but then i supposed that most of the stuff involving children was probably packaged to look like something else anyway that or it was buried on other tapes or disks so that it would not be found in the event of a casual search i turned on the tv and picked some of the porn at random skipping forward in case anything unusual was to be seen but it was just as advertised i could have spent an entire day trying to go through all the movies in the hope that i might find something but there didnt seem to be much point it was also kind of depressing next to the tv was a home depot computer desk and a new pc i tried accessing the computer but it was password protected i turned it off and went through the books on the shelves and the magazines stacked beneath a small corner table again there was nothing not even porn it was possible that lang had other material hidden elsewhere but after searching the entire trailer i couldnt find any trace of it all that was left was the laundry basket in the spotless bathroom which seemed to be full of langs dirty tshirts underwear and socks i tipped it onto the floor just in case but all it left me with was a pile of stained clothing and the smell of stale perspiration in every other way lang appeared to be clean i was disappointed and for the first time i started to doubt my actions in relation to him maybe i should have called the cops if there was incriminating material on his computer then they could have found it i had also managed to contaminate the trailer so that even if they found evidence that lang had been involved in merricks killinga bloodstained baseball bat or a splattered barit wouldnt take much of a lawyer to argue that i could have planted the weapons assuming i confessed what i knew to the cops for the moment it seemed like lang was a dead end i would just have to wait and see how he reacted to the breakin i looked out of the window to make sure there was nobody approaching then opened the door and prepared to head back to my car it was only when my foot touched the gravel and i glanced at the picket fence that i realized that while i had searched the inside of the trailer i hadnt checked underneath i went around to the rear out of sight of the road then knelt and squinted through the fencing there was a large metal container seven or eight feet in length and four feet in height under the trailer it seemed to be bolted to the underside i did a full circuit with the flashlight and could see no sign of a door which meant that the only way in was through the trailer itself i went back inside and examined the floor it was carpeted from wall to wall in a thick brown fabric that looked like wet dog fur i went over it with my fingers and felt rough patches and gaps i dug my fingers into one of the gaps and pulled there was the crackle of velcro releasing then the carpet came away i was looking down at a twofootbytwofoot trapdoor with locks at either side i took off my coat and went to work with the crowbar but this time it wasnt as easy as it had been with the door it was steel and no matter how hard i tried i couldnt raise it enough to press home the crowbar i sat back down on the floor and considered my options i could leave things as they were replace the carpet and try to come back another time which would give lang ample opportunity to remove anything incriminating once he realized that someone had broken into his place i could call the cops in which case id have to explain just what i thought i was doing busting into the mans trailer to begin with assuming they were even able and willing to get a warrant to search langs trailer the metal box might just be storing the manuscript of his great novel or his late mothers dresses and jewelry and id be facing jail time on top of everything else i called angel where is he bath iron works he said i can see him from where we are looks like theres some problem with the monitors for their surveillance system hes checking cables and opening shit should be a while disable his car i said two tires should be enough then come back here a half hour later they were with me at langs place i pointed angel to the door in the floor and he went to work he didnt speak once not even when five minutes later he cracked the first lock and shortly after the second he didnt speak when a flat metal storage shelf was revealed containing unmarked videocassettes dvds computer disks and plastic files with transparent pages within each page containing images of naked children sometimes with adults and sometimes with other children he didnt speak when he released the shelf using a pair of clasps at either end raising it up to uncover a boxlike cell in which was crouched a small girl wrapped in layer upon layer of blankets her eyes blinking in the light some old dolls scattered around her alongside chocolate bars cookies and a box of breakfast cereal he didnt speak when he saw the bucket she was forced to use as a toilet or the circular opening in the wall covered by a grille that allowed air into the prison he only spoke when he leaned down and reached out a hand to the frightened girl its okay now he said we wont let nobody hurt you again and the child opened her mouth and howled i called the cops angel and louis left there was only me and a tenyearold girl with sallow skin whose name appeared to be anya she wore a cheap necklace around her neck with those four letters picked out in silver upon it i put her in the front seat of my car and she sat there unmoving her face turned away from the trailer her eyes fixed on a spot on the car floor she couldnt tell me how long she had been held there and i could only get confirmation of her name and her age out of her in thickly accented english before she went silent again she said she was ten years old i doubted that she trusted me and i didnt blame her while she sat in the car lost in her own thoughts i went through raymon langs album of photographs some of them were very recent anya was among the children pictured masked men on either side of her i looked closely at one of the photographs and thought i saw on the arm of the man on the right what might have been the yellow beak of a bird i flicked back through the rest the tones and colors changing as the pictures grew older polaroids taking the place of computer images before their place was taken in turn by the oldest of the photographs blackandwhite pictures probably developed by lang himself in a home darkroom there were boys and girls sometimes photographed alone and at other times with men their identities hidden by bird masks it was a history of abuse that spanned years probably decades the oldest images in the album were photocopies their quality poor they showed a young girl on a bed two men taking turns with her the pictures cropped to remove their heads in one of the photos i thought i saw a tattoo on the arm of one of the men it was blurred i imagined that it could be cleaned up and that when it was it would reveal an eagle but one of the photographs was different from the rest i looked at it for a long time then removed it from its plastic sleeve and carefully rearranged the other images to disguise what i had done i tucked the picture beneath the rubber mat on the floor of my car then sat on the cold hard gravel with my head in my hands and waited for the police to come they arrived out of uniform and in a pair of unmarked cars anya watched them coming and curled up fetally repeating a single word over and over in a language that i did not recognize it was only when the doors of the first car opened and a pair of women emerged that anya started to believe she might be safe the two women approached us the passenger door of my car was open and they could see the little girl just as she could see them i hadnt wanted anya to feel she had simply been moved from one cell to another the first cop squatted before her she was slim with long red hair tied back tightly on her head she reminded me of rachel hi she said my name is jill youre anya is that right anya nodded recognizing her name if nothing else her face began to soften her lips turned down at the corners and she started to cry this wasnt the animal response that had greeted angel this was something else jill opened her arms to the little girl and she fell into them burying her face in the womans neck her body jerking with the force of her sobs jill looked over anyas shoulder at me and nodded i turned away and left them to each other chapter xxxv bath isnt a very beautiful town when seen from the water but then most places dependent upon one form of heavy industry rarely are and nobody ever designed a shipyard with aesthetics in mind still there was something majestic about its massive cranes and the great ships that the yards still turned out at a time when most of its rivals had seen shipbuilding either collapse entirely or become a mere shadow of its former grandeur the shipyard might have been ugly yet it was an ugliness born not of decay but of growth with four hundred years of history behind it four centuries of noise and steam and sparks of wood replaced by steel of sons following fathers with skills that had been passed down for generations the fate of bath and the fate of the shipyard were forever intertwined in a bond that could never be severed like any town where large numbers of people traveled to work for one major employer parking was an issue and the huge lot at king street right at the intersection with commercial and nearest to the main north gate to the yard was packed with cars the first shift was about to end and buses idled nearby waiting to transport those who came from out of town and preferred to avoid the hassle of parking either by dispensing with their cars entirely or by leaving them in the suburbs a sign warned that the bath iron works was a defense contractor and all photography was prohibited over the employee entrance was another sign that read through these gates pass the best shipbuilders in the world the cops had gathered at the riverside sports club there were a dozen all told a mix of bath pd and state police all of them in plain clothes in addition two cruisers lurked out of sight the yards own security people had been advised that an arrest was imminent and at their request it had been decided to take raymon lang as he emerged into the parking lot he was being watched continuously and the yards head of security was in direct contact with jill carrier the state police detective who had taken anya into her arms and who was in charge of apprehending lang i was parked in the lot with a clear view of the gates id been allowed to tag along on condition that i stayed out of sight and took no part in what occurred i had spun the cops quite a story to tell them how id come to find the little girl in langs trailer and how i had come to be at the trailer to begin with but in the end i had to admit to lying during the viewing of legeres body i was in trouble but carrier had been kind enough to let me see the lang thing through to its end even if one of the conditions she attached was to have a plainclothes officer seated beside me at all times his name was weintraub and he didnt say very much which was fine with me at pm the gates opened with a rumble and men began to pour out all dressed near identically in baseball caps and jeans and lumberjack shirts open over tshirts each carrying his flask and his lunch pail i saw carrier speaking on her cell phone and half a dozen of the cops broke away from the main group carrier leading and began to ease their way through the throng of men over to the right i saw raymon lang emerge from a turnstile carrying his long metal toolbox he was dressed just like the shipbuilders and was smoking the end of a cigarette as he took a final drag and prepared to throw the butt to the ground he saw carrier and the others approaching and he knew immediately who they were and for whom they had come a predator immediately aware of other more powerful predators descending upon him he dropped the toolbox and started to run heading east away from his pursuers but a bath pd cruiser appeared and blocked the road out of the lot lang altered direction weaving in and out of cars even as the second cruiser appeared and uniforms moved in on him now carrier was closing faster and more lithe than the men she was with she had her gun in her hand she ordered lang to stop lang turned and reached behind his back his hand searching for something beneath his shirt i heard carrier give him a final warning to put his hands up but he did not then i saw the gun buck in carriers hand and heard the shot as lang spun and fell to the ground he died on the way to the hospital he did not speak as the paramedics struggled to save his life and nothing was learned from him they stripped him of his shirt as they placed him on a gurney and i saw that his arms were bare of tattoos raymon lang had been unarmed there seemed to have been no reason for him to reach behind his back no reason for him to draw carriers fire upon himself i think though that in the end he just didnt want to go to jail perhaps out of cowardice or perhaps because he couldnt bear to be separated from children for the rest of his life six and in my best behavior i am really just like him look beneath the floorboards for the secrets i have hid sufjan stevens john wayne gacy jr chapter xxxvi i rang the doorbell of rebecca clays house i could hear the waves breaking in the darkness jackie garner and the fulcis were long gone now that merrick was dead i had called ahead and filled her in on what had happened she told me that the police had called her after i admitted that i had lied about jerry legere and she had made a formal identification of his body earlier that day they had interviewed her about her exhusbands death but there was little that she could add to what they already knew she and legere had been completely estranged and she had neither seen nor heard from him in a long time until i had begun asking questions and he had called her a couple of nights before his death drunk and demanding to know what she thought she was doing by setting a private eye on him she had hung up and he had not called back she answered the door wearing an old sweater and a pair of loosefitting jeans her feet were bare i could hear the tv in the living room and through the open door i saw jenna seated on the floor watching an animated movie she looked up to see who had entered decided that i wasnt anyone for whom it was worth missing anything and returned to her viewing i followed rebecca into the kitchen she offered me coffee or a drink but i declined both legere she said would be released for burial the following day apparently he had a half brother down in north carolina who was flying up to take care of the arrangements she told me that she would be attending the funeral for the half brothers sake but that she wouldnt be taking her daughter along its not something that she needs to see she said she sat at the kitchen table and fiddled with an empty cup so its all over she said in a way frank merrick is dead your exhusband is dead ricky demarcian and raymon lang are dead otis caswell is dead mason dubus is dead the somerset county sheriff s department and the mes office are digging for the remains of lucy merrick and jim poole up at gilead thats a lot of dead people but i suppose youre right its over for all of them you sound sick of it i was i had wanted answers and the truth about what had happened to lucy merrick and andy kellog and the other children who had been abused by men masked as birds instead i was left with the sense that the girl named anya apart and the removal of a little evil from the world it had all been for nothing i had few answers and at least one of the abusers remained at large the man with the eagle tattoo i also knew that i had been lied to all along lied to in particular by the woman who now sat before me and yet i could not find it in my heart to blame her i reached into my pocket and removed the photograph that i had taken from raymon langs album the little girls face was almost hidden by the body of the man who knelt above her on the bed and he himself was visible only from the neck down his body was almost absurdly thin the bones visible through the skin of his arms and legs every muscle and sinew standing out upon his frame the photo had been taken more than a quarter of a century before judging by the age of the girl she couldnt have been more than six or seven beside her jammed between two pillows was a doll with long red hair and dressed in a blue pinafore it was the same doll that rebecca clays daughter now carried around with her a doll passed on to her by her mother a doll that had given rebecca comfort during the years of her abuse rebecca looked at the photograph but she did not touch it her eyes grew glassy then damp with tears as she stared at the little girl that she once was where did you find it she asked in raymon langs trailer were there others yes but none like this one this was the only one in which the doll was visible she pressed her hand against the picture blotting out the form of the man who towered above her younger self covering the naked body of daniel clay rebecca i asked where is your father she stood and walked to a door behind the kitchen table she opened it and flicked a switch light shone on a set of wooden steps that led down to the basement without looking back at me she began to descend and i followed the basement was used for storage there was a bicycle now too small for her daughter and assorted boxes and cartons but there was nothing that looked as if it had been moved or used in a long time it smelled of dust and the concrete floor had begun to crack in places long dark lines extending like veins from a spot in the center rebecca clay extended a bare foot and pointed its painted toes at the floor hes down there she said thats where i put him she had been working down in saco that friday and there had been a message on her answering machine when she got back to her apartment her babysitter ellen who looked after three or four kids each day had been taken to the hospital following a heart scare and ellens husband had called to say that obviously she would be unable to pick up any of her charges from the school rebecca checked her cell and found that the battery had run down while she was in saco she had been so busy that she had failed to notice for a moment she felt utter panic where was jenna she called the school but everyone had gone home she then called ellens husband but he didnt know who had taken jenna after school he suggested that she call the principal or the school secretary for both had been informed that jenna would not be picked up that day instead rebecca called her best friend april whose daughter carole was in jennas class at school jenna wasnt with her either but april knew where she was your father collected her she said seems the school found his number in the book and called him when they heard about ellen and couldnt get in touch with you he came by and took her back to his house i saw him at the school when he came to collect her shes fine rebecca but rebecca thought that nothing would ever be fine again she was so scared that she threw up on her way to the car and threw up again as she drove to her fathers house coughing up bread and bile into an empty convenience store bag as she waited at the lights when she got to the house her father was out in the garden raking dead leaves and the front door was open she rushed past him without speaking and found her daughter in the living room doing just what she was doing now watching tv from the floor and eating ice cream she couldnt understand why her mommy was so upset why she was hugging her and crying and scolding her for being with grandpa she had been with grandpa before after all although never alone and always with her mommy it was grandpa he had bought her fries and a hot dog and a soda he had taken her to the beach and they had collected seashells then he had given her a big bowl of chocolate ice cream and left her to watch tv shed had a nice day she told her mommy although it would have been even better if her mommy had been there with her and then daniel clay was at the living room door asking her what was wrong as though he was just a regular grandfather and a regular father and not the man who had taken his daughter to his bed from the age of six until fifteen always being gentle and kind trying not to hurt her and sometimes when he was sad or when he had been drinking apologizing for the night that he had let another man touch her because he loved her you see that was what he always told her im your father and i love you and ill never let that happen to you again i could hear the bass notes of the television vibrating above our heads then it went silent and there were footsteps as jenna headed upstairs its her bedtime said rebecca i never have to tell her when to go she just heads up to bed all by herself she likes her sleep ill leave her to clean her teeth and read then ill kiss her good night i always try to kiss her good night because then i know that shes safe she leaned back against the brick wall of the basement and ran the fingers of her hand through her hair pushing it back from her forehead and exposing her face he hadnt touched her she said hed done just what she said hed done but i understood what was happening there was a moment just before i brushed past him and took jenna home when i could see it in his eyes and he knew that i saw it he was tempted by her it was starting again it wasnt his fault it was an illness he was sick it was like a disease that had been in remission and now it was returning why didnt you tell someone i asked because he was my father and i loved him she replied she didnt look at me as she spoke i suppose that sounds ridiculous to you after what he did to me no i said nothing sounds ridiculous to me anymore she worried at the floor with her foot well its the truth for what its worth i loved him i loved him so much that i went back to the house that night i left jenna with april i told her that i had some work to do at home and asked if shed mind letting jenna sleep over with carole they often did that so it was no big deal then i came here my father answered the door and i told him that we needed to talk about what had happened that day he tried to laugh it off he was doing some work in the basement and i followed him down here he was going to lay a new floor and he had already started breaking up the old concrete the rumors had started by that point and hed virtually been forced to cancel all of his appointments he was already becoming a pariah and he knew it he tried to hide his unhappiness about it he said it would give him the time to do all kinds of jobs around the house that hed been threatening to do for so long so he just kept breaking the floor while i screamed at him he wouldnt listen it was as though i was making it all up all the things that had happened to me all the things that hed done and that i believed he wanted to do again but this time with jenna he would only say that whatever he had done hed done out of love youre my daughter he said i love you ive always loved you and i love jenna too and when he said that something fell apart inside of me he had a pickax in his hands and he was trying to lever up a slab of concrete there was a hammer on the shelf beside me he had his back to me and i hit him on the crown of the head he didnt fall down not at first he just bent over and put his hand to his scalp like hed smacked it against a beam i hit him again and he fell down i think i hit him twice more he started to bleed into the dirt and i left him there i went upstairs to the kitchen blood had splashed on my face and hands and i washed it off i cleaned the hammer too there was hair caught in it i remember and i had to pick at it with my fingers i heard him moving down in the basement and i thought he tried to say something i couldnt go back down though i just couldnt instead i locked the door and sat in the kitchen until it got dark and i couldnt hear him moving around any longer when i unlocked the door he had crawled to the bottom of the stairs but he hadnt been able to climb up i went down to him then and he was dead i found some plastic sheeting in the garage and i wrapped him in it there used to be a greenhouse in the back garden it had a dirt floor it was dark by then and i dragged him out there that was the hardest part getting him up from the basement he didnt look like he weighed a lot but it was all muscle and bone i dug a hole and put him in then covered him up again i suppose i was already planning already thinking ahead it never crossed my mind to call the police or to confess to what id done i just knew that i didnt want to be separated from jenna she was everything to me when it was all done i went home the next night i waited until dark then drove my fathers car up to jackman and left it there i reported him missing once the car was taken care of the police came some detectives looked at the basement floor like i knew they would but my father had only just started tearing it up and it was clear that there was nothing underneath it they knew all about my father and when they found the car up in jackman they figured hed fled after a couple of days i came back and moved the body id been lucky it had been wicked cold that month i guess it kept him well you know from rotting too much so there wasnt a smell not really i started to dig in the basement it took me most of the night but he had taught me what to do he always said that a girl should know how to take care of a house how to fix things and keep them in order i cleared a space of rubble and dug down until there was a hole big enough to take him i covered him up then i went upstairs and fell asleep in my old room you wouldnt think that someone could just fall asleep after doing something like that but i slept straight through until midday i slept so peacefully better than i could ever remember doing before then i went back down and kept working everything that i needed was down there even a little mixer for the cement getting the rubble up took some time and my back ached for weeks after but once that was done it was all pretty easy it took me a day or two over the weekend all told jenna stayed with april everything just worked out and then you moved into this house i couldnt sell it because it wasnt mine to sell and anyway i would have been afraid to do that even if it had been just in case someone decided to renovate the basement and found what was there it seemed better to move in then we just stayed here you know what the strange thing is though you see those cracks in the floor theyre new they only started appearing in the last couple of weeks ever since frank merrick came around causing trouble its like he awakened something down there as if my father heard him asking questions and tried to find a way back into the world ive started to have nightmares i dream that i hear noises from the basement and when i open the door my father is climbing the steps hauling himself up from the dirt to make me pay for what ive done because he loved me and id hurt him in my dream he ignores me and starts crawling toward jennas room and i keep hitting him over and over but he wont stop he just keeps crawling like a bug that wont die her toe had begun to explore one of the cracks in the floor she withdrew it quickly when she became aware of what she was doing the description of her nightmares reminding her of what lay below who helped you with all of this i asked nobody she said i did it alone you drove your fathers car up to jackman how did you get back down after youd abandoned it i hitched a ride really yes really but i knew that she was lying after all that she had done she wouldnt have taken a chance like that someone followed her up to jackman then drove her back east again i thought it might have been the woman april i remembered the way they had looked at each other that night after merrick had broken the window something had passed between them a gesture of complicity an acknowledgment of a shared understanding it didnt matter none of it really mattered who was the other man rebecca the one who took the photograph i dont know it was late i heard someone drinking with my father then they came to my room they both smelled pretty bad i can still recall it its why ive never been able to drink whiskey they turned on the bedside light the man had a mask on an old halloween mask of a ghost that my father used to wear to frighten the trickortreaters my father told me that the man was a friend of his and that i should do the same things that i did for him i didnt want to but she stopped for a moment i was seven years old she whispered thats all i was seven they took pictures it was like it was a game a big joke it was the only time it ever happened the next day my father cried and told me he was sorry he told me again that he loved me and that he never wanted to share me with anyone else and he never did and youve no idea who it might have been she shook her head but she would not look at me there were more pictures of that night in raymon langs trailer your fathers drinking buddy was in them but his head wasnt visible he had a tattoo of an eagle on his arm do you remember it no it was dark if i did see it ive forgotten it over the years one of the other children who was abused mentioned the same tattoo someone suggested to me that it might be a military tattoo do you know if any of your fathers friends served in the army elwin stark he did she said i think eddie haver might have been in the army too theyre the only ones but i dont think either of them had a tattoo like that on his arm they came on vacation with us sometimes i saw them on the beach i would have noticed i let it go i didnt see what else i could do your father betrayed those children didnt he i asked she nodded i think so they had those pictures of him with me i guess thats how they made him do what he did how did they get them i suppose the other man from that night passed them on to them but you know my father really did care about the kids he treated he tried to look out for them those men made him choose the ones that he gave to them made him pick children to be abused but he seemed to work twice as hard for the rest because of it i know it makes no sense at all but it was almost like there were two daniel clays the bad one and the good one there was the one who abused his daughter and betrayed children to save his reputation and the one who fought tooth and nail to save other kids from abuse maybe that was the only way he could survive without going insane by separating the two parts and by taking all of the bad stuff and calling it love and jerry legere you suspected him after you found him with jenna didnt you i saw something of what i had seen in my father in him she said but i didnt know he was involved not until the police came and told me how he had died i think i hate him more than anyone i mean he must have known about me he knew what my father had done and somehow it made me more attractive to him she shuddered it was like when he was fucking me he was fucking the child i was as well she sank down on the floor and laid her forehead on her arms i could barely hear her when she spoke again what happens now she asked will they take jenna away from me will i go to jail nothing i said nothing happens she lifted her head youre not going to tell the police no there was no more to say i left her in the basement sitting at the foot of the grave she had dug for her father i got in my car and i drove away to the susurration of the sea like an infinite number of voices offering quiet consolation it was the last time i would ever hear the sea in that place for i never returned there again chapterxxxvii there was one more link one more connection that remained to be explored after gilead i knew what connected legere to lang and what in turn connected lang to gilead and to daniel clay it wasnt merely a personal link but a professional one the security firm asecure joel harmon was in his garden when i arrived and it was todd who answered the door and escorted me through the house to see him you look like you might have spent time in the army todd i said i ought to bust your ass for that he replied goodhumoredly navy five years i was a signalman a damned good one too you get all tattooed up in the navy damn straight he said he rolled up the right sleeve of his jacket revealing a twisted mass of anchors and mermaids im real traditional he said he let the sleeve fall you got a reason for asking just curious i saw how you handled your gun on the night of the party it looked like youd held one before yeah well mr harmons a wealthy man he wanted someone who could look out for him you ever have to look out for him todd i asked he stopped as we reached the garden and stared at me not yet he said not like that harmons son and daughter were both home that day and halfway down the lawn harmon was pointing out changes to them that he hoped to make to the flowers and shrubs come the spring he loves the garden said todd following the direction of my gaze and seemingly anxious to move the subject away from his gun and his obligations real or potential to harmon everything out there he planted himself or helped to plant the kids lent a hand too its their garden as much as his but now i wasnt looking at harmon or his children or his garden i was looking at the surveillance cameras that kept vigil on the lawn and the entrances to the house it looks like an expensive system i said to todd it is the cameras themselves switch from color output to blackandwhite when the lighting conditions are poor theyve got focus and zoom capabilities pan and tilt and we have quad switchers that allow us to view all camera images simultaneously there are monitors in the kitchen mr harmons office the bedroom and in my quarters you cant be too careful no i guess not who installed the system a company called asecure out of south portland uhhuh that was the company raymon lang worked for wasnt it todd jerked like hed just been hit with a mild electric shock ii suppose it was langs shooting and the discovery of the child beneath his trailer had been big news it would have been hard for todd to have missed it was he ever out here possibly to check the system im sure it needs maintenance once or twice a year i couldnt say said todd he was already going on the defensive wondering if hed said too much asecure sends someone out regularly as part of the contract but its not always the same guy sure that figures maybe jerry legere came out here instead i suppose the company will have to find someone else to take care of it now that theyre both dead todd didnt reply he seemed about to walk me down to harmon but i told him it wasnt necessary he opened his mouth to protest but i raised a hand and he closed it again he was smart enough to know that there was something going on that he didnt fully understand and the best thing to do might be to watch and listen and intervene only if it became absolutely necessary i left him on the porch and made my way across the grass i passed harmons kids on the way down as they headed back to the house they looked at me curiously and harmons son seemed about to say something but they both relaxed a little when i smiled at them in greeting they were goodlooking kids tall healthy and neatly but casually dressed in various shades of abercrombie ampfitch harmon didnt hear me approach he was kneeling by an alpine garden flower bed dotted with weathered limestone the rocks sunk firmly into the ground the grain running inward and the soil around them scattered with stone chips low plants poked through the gaps between the rocks their foliage purple and green silver and bronze my shadow fell across harmon and he looked up mr parker he said i wasnt expecting company and you sneaked up on my bad side nevertheless now that youre here it gives me the chance to apologize for what i said to you on the telephone when last we spoke he struggled a little to stand i offered him my right hand and he took it as i helped him up i gripped his forearm with my left hand forcing the sleeve of his shirt and his sweater up on his forearm the claws of a bird were briefly revealed upon his skin thank you he said he saw where my attention was directed and moved to pull his sleeve back down i never asked you how you damaged your hearing i said its a little embarrassing he replied my left ear was always weaker than my right the hearing just slightly worse it wasnt too serious and it didnt interfere any with my life i wanted to serve in vietnam i didnt want to wait for the draft i was twenty and full of fire i was assigned to fort campbell for my basic training i hoped to join the rd airborne you know the rd was the only unit to make an airborne assault on an enemy position in vietnam operation junction city in sixtyseven i might have made it over there too except a shell exploded too close to my head during basic training shattered my eardrum left me near deaf in one ear and affected my balance i was discharged and that was as close as i ever got to combat i was one week away from finishing basic is that where you got the tattoo harmon rubbed his shirt against the place on his arm where the tattoo lay but he did not expose the skin again yeah i was overoptimistic i put the cart before the horse never got to add any years of service underneath im just embarrassed by it now i dont show it much he peered carefully at me you seem to have come here armed with a lot of questions ive got more did you know raymon lang mr harmon i watched him think for a moment raymon lang wasnt he the guy who got shot up in bath the one who had the child stashed under his trailer why would i know him he worked for asecure the company that installed your surveillance system he did maintenance for them on cameras and monitors i wondered if you might have met him in the course of his work harmon shrugged i might have why i turned and looked back toward the house todd was talking with harmons children all three were watching me i recalled a remark of christians that a pedophile might prey on the children of others yet never make any approaches to his own children that his family might remain entirely unaware of his urges allowing him to preserve the image of a loving father and husband an image that was in a sense simultaneously both the truth and a lie when i had spoken to christian it was daniel clay whom i had in mind but i had been wrong rebecca clay knew exactly what her father was but there were other children who did not there might have been many men with tattoos of eagles on their left arms even men who had abused children but the links between lang and harmon and clay however tentative could not be denied how did it happen i wondered how did lang and harmon come to recognize something in each other a similar weakness a hunger that they both shared when did they decide to approach clay using his access to target those who were particularly vulnerable or those who might not be believed if they made allegations of abuse did harmon bring up that drunken night when clay had allowed him to abuse rebecca as leverage against the psychiatrist for harmon had been the other man in the house on the night that daniel clay for the first and last time had shared his daughter with another and had drunkenly allowed pictures to be taken of the encounter if these were used carefully harmon could have destroyed clay with them while making sure that his hands were clean even an anonymous mailing to the cops or the board of licensure would have been enough or did clay even have to be blackmailed did they share the evidence of their abuse with him was that how he fed his own hunger in those years after he ceased to torment his own daughter as she grew older before the reemergence of those old urges that rebecca saw in his face as her own child began to bloom i turned back to harmon his expression had changed it was the face of a man who was calculating the odds assessing his degree of risk and exposure mr parker he said i asked you a question i ignored him how did you do it i continued what brought you together you and lang and caswell and legere bad luck mutual admiration what was it then after clay disappeared your supply dried up didnt it that was when you had to look elsewhere and that brought you into contact with demarcian and his friends in boston and maybe mason dubus too or had you paid him a visit long before then you and clay both did you worship at his feet did you tell him about your project the systematic abuse of the most vulnerable children the ones who were troubled or whose stories were less likely to be believed all targeted through clays inside knowledge you be careful now said harmon you be real careful i saw a photograph i said it was in langs trailer it was a picture of a man abusing a little girl i know who that girl was the photos not much to go on but it will be a start ill bet the cops have all sorts of ways to compare a picture of a tattoo with an actual mark on skin harmon smiled it was an ugly malicious thing like the opening of a wound upon his face you ever find out what happened to daniel clay mr parker he said i always had my suspicions about his disappearance but i never spoke them aloud out of respect for his daughter who knows what might turn up if i started poking around in corners i might find pictures too and maybe i might recognize the little girl in them as well if i looked hard enough i might even recognize one of her abusers her father was a distinctivelooking man all skin and bone i discover something like that and i might have to turn it in to the proper authorities after all that little girl would be a woman by now a woman with troubles and torments of her own she might need help or counseling all kinds of things might come out all kinds you start digging mr parker and theres no telling what skeletons could be exposed i heard footsteps behind me and a young mans voice said everything okay here dad everythings fine son said harmon mr parkers about to leave id ask him to stay for lunch but i know he has things to do hes a busy man he has a lot to think about i didnt say anything more i walked away leaving harmon and his son behind his daughter was gone but a figure stood at one of the upper windows staring down at us all it was mrs harmon she was wearing a green dress and her nails were red against the white of the drape she held back from the glass todd followed me through the house to make sure that i left i was almost at the front door when mrs harmon appeared on the landing above my head she smiled emptily at me seemingly lost in a pharmaceutical haze but the smile didnt extend farther than her lips and her eyes were full of unspeakable things seven and what i want to know is how do you like your blueeyed boy mister death e e cummings buffalo billsdefunct epilogue for a few days nothing more happened life went back to much the way it had been angel and louis returned to new york i walked walter and took calls from people who wanted to hire my services i turned them down i was tired and there was a bad taste in my mouth of which i could not rid myself even the house was still and quiet as though watchful presences were waiting to see what would transpire the initial letter was not entirely unexpected it informed me that my gun was being held as evidence in the commission of a crime and might possibly be returned to me at a later date i didnt care i didnt want it back not now the next two letters arrived almost simultaneously by special delivery the first from the office of the chief of the state police informed me that an application had been made to the district court for the suspension of my private investigators license with immediate effect on the grounds of fraud and deceit in connection with my work and the uttering of false statements the application had been filed by the state police the court had granted an interim temporary suspension and a full hearing would follow in due course at which i would be given the opportunity to defend myself the second letter was also from the office of the chief of the state police notifying me that my concealed weapons permit was being revoked pending the outcome of the hearing and that i should return it along with any other relevant documentation to his office after all that had happened and after all that i had done things had fallen apart in the aftermath of a case in which i had not even fired a weapon i spent the days that followed the receipt of the letters away from my house i traveled to vermont with walter and passed two days with rachel and sam staying at a motel a few miles from the house the visit passed without incident and without a harsh word spoken between us it was as if rachels comments when last we met had cleared the air somewhat i told her of what had happened about the loss of my license and my permit she asked me what i was going to do and i told her that i did not know money was not a huge problem not yet the mortgage on the house was small as most of the cost of its purchase had been covered by the cash the us postal service had paid for my grandfathers land and the old house upon it there would be bills to pay though and i wanted to continue to help rachel with sam she told me not to worry too much about it although she understood why it was important to me when i was about to leave rachel held me close and kissed me softly on the mouth and i tasted her and she tasted me the following evening there was a dinner at natashas for june fitzpatrick joel harmon wasnt present there were just some of junes friends and phil isaacson the press herald s art critic and a couple of other people that i knew by reputation i hadnt wanted to attend but june had insisted and in the end it turned out to be a pretty nice evening i left them after a couple of hours with bottles of wine to finish and desserts to be ordered a harsh wind was blowing in off the sea it stung my cheeks and made my eyes water as i headed for my car i had parked on middle street not far from city hall there were plenty of empty spaces and i passed few people on the streets as i walked ahead of me a man stood outside an apartment block not far from the headquarters of the portland pd he was smoking a cigarette i could see the end glow in shadows cast by the awning above the doorway as i drew closer he stepped into my path i came to say goodbye he said for now the collector was dressed as he was always dressed in a dark coat that had seen better days beneath which was a navy jacket and an oldfashioned widecollared shirt buttoned up to the neck he took a long final drag on his cigarette then cast it away i hear things have gotten bad for you i didnt want to talk to this man whoever he truly was but it didnt seem like i had much choice anyway i doubted that he was here just to wish me farewell he didnt seem like the sentimental type youre bad luck for me i said youll forgive me for not shedding a tear when you go i think you may be bad luck for me too ive had to move part of my collection ive lost a secure house and mr eldritch has been subject to some unwelcome publicity he fears that it will be the death of him heartbreaking he always seemed so full of life the collector removed his tobacco and papers from his pocket and carefully rolled then lit another while the first still smoldered in the gutter he appeared unable to think properly without something burning between his fingers or his lips since youre here i have a question for you i said he put the cigarette to his mouth inhaled deeply then blew a cloud of smoke into the night air as he did so he waved a hand in the air inviting the question why those men i asked why the interest in this case equally the same question could be asked of you he replied after all you were not being paid to find them perhaps a fairer question might be why not those men it has always seemed to me that there are two types of people in this world those rendered impotent by the sheer weight of evil it contains and who refuse to act because they see no point and those who choose their battles and fight them to the end as they understand that to do nothing is infinitely worse than to do something and fail like you i decided to pursue this investigation and to follow it through to its conclusion i hope the outcome was more satisfactory for you than it was for me the collector laughed you cant be entirely surprised by what has happened to you he said you were living on borrowed time and even your friends couldnt protect you any longer my friends my mistake your unseen friends your secret friends i dont mean your lethally amusing colleagues from new york oh and dont worry about them i have other more worthy objects of my disaffection to pursue i think ill leave them be for now they are making recompense for past evils and i wouldnt want to render you entirely bereft no im talking about those who have followed your progress quietly the ones who have facilitated all that you have done who have smoothed over the damage that you have left in your wake who have leaned gently on those who would rather have seen you resting behind bars i dont know what youre talking about no i dont suppose that you do you were careless this time your lies tripped you up there was momentum building against you and the consequences have now become apparent you are a curious empathic man who has been deprived of a license to do the thing that he does best a violent individual whose toys have been taken away who can say what will happen to you now dont tell me that youre one of these secret friends otherwise im in more trouble than i thought no im neither your friend nor your enemy and i answer to a higher power youre deluded am i very well then it is a delusion that we both share ive just done you a favor of which you dont yet know now ill do you one final service you have spent years drifting from the light into the shadows and back again moving between them in your search for answers but the longer you spend in the darkness the greater the chance that the presence within it will become aware of you and will move against you soon it will come ive met things in the darkness before theyve gone and i am here this is not a thing in the darkness he replied this is the darkness now we are done he turned to walk away sending another dying cigarette after the first i reached out to stop him i wanted more i grabbed his shoulder and my hand brushed his skin and i had a vision of figures writhing in torment of others alone in desolate places crying for that which had abandoned them and i saw the hollow men and in that instant i knew truly what they were the collector pirouetted like a dancer my grip on him was broken with a sweep of his arm then i was against the wall his fingers on my neck my feet slowly leaving the ground as he forced me up i tried to kick out at him and he closed the distance between us as the pressure on my neck increased choking the life from me dont ever touch me he said nobody touches me he released his hold upon me and i slid down the wall and collapsed onto my knees painfully drawing ragged gulps of air through my open mouth look at you he said and his words dripped with pity and contempt a man tormented by unanswered questions a man without a father without a mother a man who has allowed two families to slip through his fingers i had a father i said i had a mother and i still have my family do you not for long something cruel transformed his features like those of a small boy who sees the opportunity to continue the torture of a dumb animal and as for a father and a mother answer this your blood type is b see the things i know about you now heres my problem he leaned in close to me how can a child with b blood have a father who was type a and a mother who was type o its quite the mystery youre lying am i well then so be it he stepped away from me but perhaps you have other things to occupy your time halfseen things dead things a child who whispers in the night and a mother who rages in the dark stay with them if you wish live with them in the place where they wait and i asked him the question that had troubled me for so long and for which i thought he might have some answer where are my wife and child the words burned my damaged throat and i hated myself for seeking answers from this vile creature you spoke of beings cut off from the divine you knew about the writing in the dust you know tell me is that what they are lost souls is that what i am do you even have a soul he whispered as for where your wife and child dwell they are where you keep them he squatted before me bathing me in nicotine as he spoke his final words i took him while you were at dinner so you would have an alibi that is my last gift to you mr parker and my last indulgence he rose and walked away and by the time i got to my feet he was long gone i went to my car and drove home and i thought about what he had said joel harmon disappeared that night todd was ill and harmon had driven himself to a town meeting in falmouth where he handed over a check for as part of a drive to buy minibuses for a local school his car was found abandoned at wildwood park and he was never seen again shortly after nine the next morning i received a telephone call the caller didnt identify himself but he told me that a search warrant for my property had just been signed by judge hight authorizing the state police to seek any and all unlicensed firearms they would be at my house within the hour they were led by hansen when they came and they went through every room they managed to open the panel in the wall behind which i used to keep the guns i had retained despite the suspension of my permit but i had sealed them in oilcloths and plastic and dropped them in a marsh pond at the back of my property anchored by a rope to a rock on the bank so all they found was dust they even searched the attic but they did not stay there long and i could see in the faces of the uniformed men who descended that they were grateful to leave that cold dark space hansen did not speak to me from the time the warrant was served until the moment the search was complete his final words to me were this isnt over when they were gone i began to empty the attic i removed boxes and cases without even looking at their contents casting them onto the landing before carrying them down to the patch of bare earth and stones at the end of my yard i opened the attic window and let fresh air flood in and i wiped away the dust from the glass cleansing it of the words that remained upon it then i went through the rest of the house cleaning every surface opening cupboards and airing rooms until all was in order and it was as cold inside the house as it was outside they are where you keep them i thought that i felt their anger and their rage or perhaps it was all inside me and even as i purged it it fought to survive as the sun went down i lit a pyre and i watched as grief and memories ascended into the sky forming gray smoke and charred fragments that fell into dust as the wind carried them away i am sorry i whispered i am sorry for all of the ways that i failed you i am sorry that i was not there to save you or to die alongside you i am sorry that i have kept you with me for so long trapped in my heart bound in sorrow and remorse i forgive you too i forgive you for leaving me and i forgive you for returning i forgive you your anger and your grief let this be an end to it let this be an end to it all you have to go now i said aloud to the shadows its time for you to leave and through the flames i saw the marshes gleaming and the moonlight picked out two shapes upon the water shimmering in the heat of the fire then they turned away as others joined them a host journeying onward soul upon soul until they were lost at last in the crashing triumph of dying waves that night as though summoned by the fire rachel rang the doorbell of the house that we once shared driving walter into a frenzy when he recognized her she said that shed been worrying about me we talked and ate and drank a little too much wine when i woke the next morning she was sleeping beside me i did not know if it was a beginning or an ending and i was too afraid to ask she left before midday with just a kiss and words unspoken on both our lips and far away a car pulled up before a nondescript house on a quiet country road the trunk was opened and a man was dragged from within falling to the ground before he was forced to his feet his eyes blindfolded his mouth gagged his hands tied behind his back with wire that had bitten into his wrists causing blood to flow onto his hands his legs bound in the same way above the ankles he tried to remain standing but almost collapsed as the blood began to flow through his weakened cramped limbs he felt hands on his legs then the wire was clipped away from them so he could walk he began to run then but his legs were swept from under him and a voice spoke a single nicotinesmelling word into his ear no he was hauled to his feet once more and led into the house a door was opened and he was guided carefully down a set of wooden steps his feet touched a stone floor he walked for a time until the same voice told him to stop and he was forced to his knees he heard something being moved as though a board were being hefted away from something in front of him the blindfold was undone the gag removed and he saw that he was in a cellar empty apart from an old closet in one corner its twin doors standing open to reveal the trinkets lying within although they were too far away for his eyesight to distinguish them in the gloom there was a hole in the ground before him and he thought that he smelled blood and old meat the hole was not deep perhaps only six or seven feet and scattered with stones and rocks and broken slates at its base he blinked and for a moment it appeared that the hole was deeper as though the base of stones was somehow suspended above a far greater abyss beneath he felt hands moving upon his wrists and then his watch his treasured patek philippe was being removed thief he said youre nothing but a thief no said the voice i am a collector then take it said harmon his voice rasped from lack of water and he felt weak and sick from the long journey in the trunk of the car just take it and let me go i have money too i can arrange to have it wired to anywhere you want you can hold me until its in your hands and i promise you that youll have as much again when im freed please just let me go whatever ive done to you im sorry the voice sounded by his good ear once again he had not yet seen the man himself he had been struck from behind as he walked to his car and he had awoken in the trunk it seemed to him that they had driven for many many hours stopping only once for the man to refill the gas tank even then they had not done so at a gas station for he had not heard the sound of the gas pump or the noise of other cars he guessed that his abductor had kept cans in the backseat of the vehicle so that he would not have to refuel in a public place and risk his captive making noise and attracting attention now he was kneeling in a dusty basement staring into a hole in the ground that was both shallow and deep and a voice was saying you are damned no said harmon no thats not right you have been found wanting and your life is forfeit your soul is forfeit no said harmon his voice rising in pitch its a mistake youre making a mistake there is no mistake i know what you have done they know harmon looked into the hole and four figures stared back at him their eyes dark holes against the thin papery covering of their skulls their mouths black and wrinkled and gaping his hair was gripped in strong fingers and his head was drawn back exposing his neck he felt something cold against his skin then the blade cut into his throat showering blood onto the floor and into the hole splashing on the faces of the men below and the hollow men raised their arms to him and welcomed him into their number acknowledgments this book could not have been written without the patience and kindness of a great many people who gave me the benefit of their knowledge and experience without a murmur of complaint i am particularly grateful to dr larry ricci director of the spurwink child abuse program in portland maine vickie jacobs fisher of the maine committee to prevent child abuse and stephen herman md forensic psychiatrist and fountain pen aficionado of new york city without the assistance of

to them i am very grateful matt mayberry real estate tom hyland vietnam and matters military philip isaacson matters of law vladimir doudka and mark dunne matters russian and luis urrea my fellow infinitely more gifted author who kindly corrected my very poor attempts at spanish officer joe giacomantonio of the scarborough police department was once again decent enough to answer my questions about matters of procedure finally ms jeanette holden of the jackman moose river valley historical society provided me with great material and an afternoon of good company i am also indebted to the jackman chamber of commerce for its assistance and the help of the staff at the research library of the maine historical society in portland as always the mistakes that undoubtedly crept through are all my own a number of books and articles proved particularly useful for research purposes including the yard by michael s sanders perennial history of the moose river valley the jackman moose river valley historical society and arnolds expedition up the kennebec to quebec in by h n fairbanks archive of the maine historical society south portland a nostalgic look at our neighborhood stores by kathryn onos di phillipo barren hill books and the portland phoenixs awardwinning reporting on the use of the choir in the maine supermax facility particularly torture in maines prison by lance tapley

surgeons thanks also to jamie hodderwilliams martin neild lucy hale kerry hood swati gamble auriol bishop toni lance and all at hodder and stoughton and to judith curr louise burke david brown sarah

my career finally to jennie cam and alistair thanks for putting up with me finally a word on dave the guesser glovsky dave really did exist and he did ply his trade at old orchard beach although it is my fervent hope that he never encountered a man like frank merrick at one point i had considered including a thinly disguised version of the guesser in this novel but that seemed unfair on this most unusual of men so he appears as himself and should any of his relatives encounter him in these pages i hope that they will recognize it as the tribute to him that it is meant to be john connolly
