trust me jeff abbott the old man had spent his entire life surrounded by unimaginable power and wealth except for today he was dressed as if for regional theater playing the part of a retiree whod failed to save for the long stretch of old age wearing decrepit khakis and a threadbare jacket mud sliming the heels of his boots sitting on a park bench in the gray london afternoon tossing crumbs to the pigeons the crumbs were tiny the size of diamonds the man in the gray suit standing near him pretending to talk on a cell phone didnt look at the old man instead he watched the people strolling in the park his eye keen for an enemy a young couple walking handinhand two teenage boys ambling trying to look cool and tough and failing a welldressed mother pushing a stroller laughing on a cell phone tucking a blanket around a baby a pair of old ladies clutching purses close to their coats one talking in monologue the other listening and nodding no danger here the man in the gray suit fought the urge to smile at the disguise the old man had chosen but to laugh would be fatal one had to indulge people with money and one did not laugh at a billionaire no matter how eccentric i hardly recognized you your majesty the man in the gray suit said he cast his gaze around the park again the silent phone close to his ear look at them go to war the old man said in soft arabic as the pigeons battled over the bread pecking at each other and the bare ground they dance for me as if i have strings on their wings he threw another scattering of food to the flocks left laughed as they scurried for the crumbs the birds arent the only ones the man in the gray suit thought but he waited for the old man to speak again the old man loved the sound of his own words like most bullies all is prepared the old man asked yes he said nearly so would have been a more exact answer but the old man had never cared for details everything would be ready soon enough then he could start to change the world your people are ready for the money yes your banker has been a great help hes set up accounts hes covered our trails so as to not raise suspicion it was an effort to control his temper to not say yes you old fool now just give me what i want and get out of the way the man in the gray suit asked the question hed come there to ask i need only to know the amount youre willing to invest fifty million dollars now the prince dressed as a pauper tossed his last handful of stale bread to the ground watched the pigeons dart and peck for the leftovers a smile played across his face as the birds battled if your proposed attacks succeed over the next five years then another fifty million for further work the man in the gray suit felt a heaviness seize his chest felt the thud of blood in his ears a hundred million dollars to flow through his hands but he showed no emotion he kept the cell phone up to his ear didnt even cost a million dollars to carry out yes but it was not a longterm investment i offer you much more i give you many times the resources of the old man glanced up at the man in the suit and for a moment he smiled an awful flexing of skin and teeth give me many times the results for years to come make them bleed for a lifetime i will the old man paused and for a moment there was only the whisper of the nearby traffic of the wind creaking through the branches of the trees it is an investment in the future of a better world the pigeons pooled around the mans feet hungry for more he kicked them away from his foot with a disgusted snarl you are generous the old man looked up if you fail me you and anyone you care about will die the man in the gray suit said threats and kicks work on a dog sir not on me you neednt worry he didnt like being threatened but he didnt let his feelings show you have selected the right people i dont wish to trust fools or amateurs yes we have a willing cadre and we are recruiting more there will be a first wave of attacks to distract to confuse to panic then those fighters who successfully carry out those initial operations will get the honor to participate in the second phase which is actually a massive attack we call it hellfire heavy loss of life devastating economic damage i promise you will get your moneys worth sir the old man smiled again at the man in the gray suit spend my money well he rose from the bench dusted the bread from his lap and walked away through the rising cloud of the birds fifty million the man in the gray suit thought it was everything he had hoped for enough to make the world pay enough to make him respected he turned and left the park folding the unused cell phone dropping it into his pocket fifty feet behind him the mother with the stroller giggled into her phone she leaned down and eased the blanket around the sleeping infant she pushed in the baby carriage shed offered to take her friends baby for a stroll give the friend a muchneeded break the young mother had barely slept in the past few days and the offer nearly made her cry with gratitude i know youre not in town long jane dont you have things to do nothing important darling please take a break from nappies and crying ill take her for a long walk and jane had giving the baby a dropper of allergy medication as soon as they were out of sight of the house so the darling would sleep the whole time the baby nestled in its stroller made for perfect camouflage for janes afternoon jane checked the settings on the parabolic microphone and digital recorder that lay next to the dozing baby holding a modified cell phone she heard the old billionaires and the man in the gray suits words with a clarity as if they stood a foot in front of her they both spoke arabic but that was not a concern to her she understood every word the money would be on the move it was time for her to put her plan into action a tingle of anticipation and fear tickled her spine she turned on her real cell phone and dialed she steered the stroller away at an angle from two approaching older women walking arm in arm old ladies liked to look at babies she didnt want them to notice her eavesdropping gear yes its jane the woman said in english and the money is headed to america fifty million we start tonight rock and roll rock and roll jane hung up there was nothing more to be said jane pushed the stroller out of the park humming a jaunty tune to the sleeping baby the sky was going gray but jane thought it the loveliest day shed ever seen fifty million dollars for years of s to come her throat went dry behind her smile she dropped off the microphone and its gear at her hotel room she had a flight to catch tonight a report to write for her bosses it would not mention the fifty million or the impending attacks and she would have to edit the recording shed made the baby began to wake and cried jane sang to her softly all the way home luke dantry was now the most dangerous man in the world he had no idea of his status of course right now he wanted only a mindclearing jog luke ran no one watching him could have guessed the danger he represented they would only see a lanky twentyfouryearold curly dark brown hair a bit long over his ears his strong build clad in shorts and a tshirt that read psychologists do it on the couch he didnt much like the shirt a gag gift from an old girlfriend but it was the only clean one he had for todays run along lady bird lake in the heart of austins downtown his blue eyes focused on his path through the crowd he did not pause to linger on the faces of pretty girls or the shine of the light on the water he ran alongside or the shifting shadows cast by the oak branches jostled by the wind he dodged slower runners faster bicyclists leaping dogs tethered to leashes he had to hurry get back to work the work possessed his thoughts day and night the austin air was cool not too humid it was midmarch and the long steamy summer bake hadnt yet gripped the city the breeze felt delicious on him clearing his head of his worries if for just a few moments luke crossed the bridge into downtown slowed his pace he bent over breathing hard his medal slipped free from under the tacky tshirt the silver of the angels sword cutting the sunlight he was careful to tuck the medal back under his shirt it lay cool against the sweat of his chest he stood and walked the last three blocks to the highrise condo his stepfather had bought him when hed moved back to austin for college he waved at the doorman who gave luke a slightly disapproving look as he waited how many miles the doorman asked only two only two get your lazy butt in gear the doorman was a more devoted runner than luke i was up late why you bother to live downtown if you never go to the clubs go out and party how do you know i dont luke gave the guard a halfsmile on night shift i see who parties whos been down in the warehouse district whos been on sixth street you never stagger in late im on the internet most of the time right now well get the hell off the guard gave him a grin lifes too short the elevator arrived and luke said ill try to fix that partying deficit not tonight your stepfather is waiting for you got here a few minutes ago thanks the doors closed and luke punched the tenth floor button henry was back again all the way from washington and luke hadnt finished the project he took a deep breath the elevator door slid open and he walked down a short hallway to his condo the door was slightly ajar henry had forgotten to shut it typical he opened the door and called out hey its me luke closed the door behind him and he could hear the scratch of pen on paper the sound he always associated with henry henry sat at the dining room table his luggage at his feet writing on a yellow legal pad a thick book open in front of him luke knew better than to interrupt henry when he was thinking and henrys thoughts could be long tortured affairs henry raised one hand slightly from the table as he wrote begging for patience and so luke went and got a bottle of water from the refrigerator drank deeply listened to the scratch of henrys pen looked at the stunning view that faced the lake and the green stretch of zilker park beyond sorry luke he said with an embarrassed smile im working on a dozen position papers at once and all my ideas are sprouting like weeds thats too many i think a lot of change is in the wind did you have a good run henry looked up from the paper fiftyish lean but with slightly mussed gray hair standing in stray stalks from his fingers constantly running through it as he spoke and an equally rumpled suit henry never traveled well i only sweat in front of the computer these days he went over and henry stood and gave him an awkward embrace well go get showered and ill take you out for a decent dinner youve got nothing edible in that fridge he leaned back studied his stepson youre pale thin and you need a shave ive been working you too hard i wanted the research project to go well but i worry im not delivering what you need henry sat down put his glasses back on his face his nose was slightly crooked hed always kidded luke that it had been broken in a bar fight but luke knew henry had never set foot in a bar the data youve sent me has been extremely compelling im afraid its nothing more than the crazy internet ravings of vicious losers but you never know when the crazy raving is the seed of something bigger something dangerous collecting crazy ravings isnt necessarily going to help identify and stop extremists before they turn violent thats for me to decide luke finished his water i would like to know who your client is i want to know who wants to find potential extremists on the internet henry folded the paper hed been writing on tucked it in his pocket and shut the book the title of the book was the psychology of extremists henrys own masterpiece hed written it some years before in the aftermath of the mcveigh bombing to little acclaim until changed everything and his theories about the mental makeup of terrorists bore fruit after holding a series of professorships around the world sort of a traveling scholar much like lukes own father had been last year he had set up a small but successful think tank in washington called the shawcross group they studied and wrote about psychology and the role it played in governance in terrorism and extremism in international crime and in a host of other topics his clients were the movers and shakers in washington london paris and around the world key government decisionmakers and multinational companies who wanted to protect their operations from terrorist and extremist threats i cant tell you not now im sorry i just think we should give this information to the police or your client should have you found evidence of actual criminal activity henry took off his wirerim glasses um no but youve found the potential for criminal activity come see the latest from the night road for yourself luke sat down at his computer he had a list of more than a hundred websites discussion groups and online forums to survey where he would try to draw in and talk with people who had extreme and even violent responses to the worlds problems a window opened to report on the responses to his many varied comments from before hed gone on his run he kept his user names and passwords in a text file on his mac because he could not remember them all he logged onto the first online discussion group where topics ranged from immigration reform to privatization of social security this one tended to be far right wing and multiple retorts to his mild comments had sprouted up since yesterday luke scanned them mostly the contributors agreed with each other but they fueled each others anger he signed on as mreagle his pen name and posted a far more moderate view of the immigration issue it would not take long for venomous arguments against his position to flow in for him to collect and measure he would also post under other names agreeing with those who attacked his initial postings seeing if they were interested in violence as a solution sometimes they ignored his prods other times they agreed that violence was the answer luke jumped to another forum found another pot to stir on a farleft discussion group his middleoftheroad comments left last night on the issue of military contractors had produced everything from abrasive disagreement to incoherent fury that practically blazed fire through the computer screen the night road henry asked oh yes your nickname for these people luke had been using the nickname for weeks but typical of absentminded henry to forget henry had been traveling a lot in the past few days and apparently the jet lag weighed hard i used to call them the angry bitters but that sounded like a punk band i dreamed one night that an angry mob of extremists of every stripe were chasing me down a long road into an endless night so i call them the night road the night road right rather dark of you henry had an odd look on his face as though a light had suddenly shut off behind his eyes then he smiled so far this evening my masculinity my patriotism and my intelligence have all been called into serious question luke shrugged let a smile play across his face then the ones i pretend to agree with i have to get them talking to see if they really are interested in violence the troublemaker as always henry flicked a smile so youre continuing to get a lot of responses fifty per cent more than when i started back in november i think its the anonymity of the net people express themselves a lot more strongly and these people theyre looking for others to reinforce their views so the anger the perceived injustice ratchets up higher and higher how much data do you have so far luke glanced at a screen the most interesting and extremist ravings on the websites and forums were scanned copied and uploaded into a database close to ten thousand comments now from roughly six thousand individuals over the past four months wow its weird i feel like a cop who pretends to be a thirteenyearold girl luring the old perverts but instead im trying to draw out the next timothy mcveigh or the next madrid bomber the next alqaeda wannabe here in america you really think some of them are that dangerous look at todays batch he pulled up a comment from the days database not surprising a lot of them are antigovernment lets start fresh end their lifetime appointments kill all the judges now maybe this guys just venting maybe hes harmless its the first time he posted i have to wait and see if he amps it up if he does then hes a possibility to follow henry rubbed at his lip prod him harder see what else he says heres one from one of my more consistent correspondents luke said chicagochris hes on a number of discussion boards for anarchists organized anarchists i love the concept henry said and he loves to talk about ecoterrorism luke hit a button and a long series of comments made by chicagochris over the past few days rolled up the screen burn every mcmansion to the ground thats the start a serious attack on a gated community would send a message dont kill people warn them first but level the houses sabotage the construction equipment get busy to save the earth people who destroy the earth deserve whatever bad stuff happens to them killing our environment is akin to the greatest murder ever committed i blame the oil and construction companies i know those guys what theyre like when the attention isnt on them and theyre scum kill them kill all of them and there would be change a change is in the wind i know it its coming fast i want to be a part of the storm of change hes a charmer henry said and he believes every word he says he emails me a lot through the boards im his new best online friend and hes not just crazy henry hes focused thats whats scary you said in last months report you think hes one of the most likely to go violent yeah hes promising luke made a face but crazy im not interested in the crazy ones im interested in the committed ones theres a big difference i cant really diagnose these people i can only catalog their comments i hope this is enough data for your research looking at all the hate made him tired for your client henry heard the stubborn question in lukes voice i told you i have to keep my client confidential let me guess its the government they want to watch these people make sure theyre only hot air and not actually acquiring weapons or putting bombs on buses or targeting politicians i cant say but i know my client will be extremely pleased with your work luke said im surprised you dont trust me you always have and i always will but the client set very specific parameters for me if you worked for me fulltime were officially on the payroll then maybe henry gave a shrug a halfsmile im not a thinktank kind of guy please were academics just in nicer suits henry said let me guess you would like to get a paper out of this data yourself maybe the foundation of a doctoral dissertation luke nodded yes i would but i respect that you hired me to do the research its your data not mine luke i understand why youre driven to dissect the minds of those who think violence is a solution to every problem the silence between them felt suddenly awkward but understanding why violence happens thats the puzzle that can never be solved and it wont bring your father back henry cleared his throat looked at the picture of luke and his father his lips narrowed and he bowed his head slightly as if under a weight henry was a giver of speeches and his phrases worked at podiums not at dinner tables hed spent so much time with his books and found his family so late in life that luke had gotten used to his stepfathers wellmeant but flatfooted phrases i know but i would hope this research would find the next asshole who wants to kill innocent people for a cause luke didnt look at henry he didnt look at the photo of his father the one decoration on the fireplace mantel a photo of warren dantry and luke age seven holding a freshly caught bass dripping from a virginia lake he could remember the smell of the clean fish the scent of the pines the warm sun against his skin his fathers quiet laughter a happy memory of a rare time with his dad long before evil in the form of a coldblooded airplane mechanic named ace beere stole his father away from him evil that luke felt compelled to understand reading ace beeres rambling incoherent suicide note left at the airport hangar after he had killed lukes father and several others had fueled lukes desire to understand the psychology of the violent mind i did it because god said i must the only way to get my pride back to strike back at my employer and i had to pick a flight to kill and since they were professors they were useless to society no one will miss them rambling garbage but inside the long letter there must have been the seed of an answer a cogent reason why luke had never found it tell me this luke said your client whoever it is they want to find nascent terrorists before they move from ideology to violence this isnt just a fancy profiling project luke identifying terrorists is far bigger than simply drawing out the disaffected on internet forums but we already know that plenty of extremists connect through the internet if we could narrow in on them discourage them before they take those final steps make the choice of violence unappealing or impossible luke got up from the computer went to the window any of these people might be harmless or be a time bomb ten thousand comments hundreds of people but i cant prove any of them will turn terrorist really the next stage of the project should be to follow them to see if there are ways to convince them that violence isnt an option youve done a fantastic job and my client will sift through all the data you never know maybe you did find the next mcveigh or the next person whod mail anthrax to congress or decide to take up the mantle of alqaeda but youve spent so much time on it im starting to think this is an unhealthy obsession no i want to finish the project but but what the mail accounts i had to set up the emails make clear that these people all think that im ready to join their battle im worried they might find me even though i post from different addresses use a bunch of fake names i could be traced if someone tried hard enough but theyre on the other side of the glass in wonderland henry tapped the computer monitor you dont exactly live in a dangerous world luke i suppose not not any more he never spoke with henry about the time after his father died when he ran away and lived on the streets for two months there was no point that was a darkness in his life where hed long ago shut the door i wonder if you might take me to the airport tomorrow my flights in the afternoon i have meetings at the university all morning as though his stepfather hadnt heard his concerns henry he thought had just moved on to his next idea sure a response to one of lukes fake comments popped up on the screen your right a race war is inevitible in this country whats got to be done is get all the undesirables to leave this country killin em will encurage em to go faster maybe you and me can get together and talk about it i could see if your serius or not henry read the message you bait your hooks well luke very well i want you to listen to me and luke thought with affection here comes henry trying to be a dad here comes the hand on the shoulder yep and now here comes the fumbling advice luke you know i loathe sentiment but im the only family youve got luke paused and this greeting card moment is brought to you by the shawcross group now luke but henry offered a rare smile i promised your mom when i married her that id take care of you if anything happened to her to me that was a solemn vow his mother he put up the photos of her when he knew henry was coming for a visit it was too raw too painful for henry the car crash had been only a year ago henry dont treat me like a child you dont have to watch out for me habits are hard to break he cleared his throat as though preparing to deliver another speech or presentation he seemed to have trouble looking at luke aside from you the thinktank is my life come work for me i would love to pass the thinktank on to you one day the final words came in a rush henry wow i dont know what to say he felt touched honored henry was a bit of an oddball all into his researches his pondering about the political trends of the world his books and papers but he was the only family luke had a world without family was a lonely place and luke thought it had been an unbearably lonely place for henry before henry married lukes mom it had not always been an easy road for him and his stepfather but luke never doubted that henry in his own way loved him on the screen a comment appeared youre right what we need in america is a nice dirty bomb set off in the beltway clean up the whole act make the potomac a toilet for all the human waste in dc start fresh another loon chirping to be heard a nice dirty bomb as opposed to an awful dirty bomb these people made his blood run cold my god henry said blinking at the comment this is the other reason i want you working with me you get results say yes please luke please begging was most unhenrylike and luke felt a swelling of gratitude i will sleep on it after i wander a bit down the night road this evening fair enough i need to make a couple of a phone calls and then well go out to dinner go get cleaned up his stepfather patted his shoulder and went off to the condos guest room luke turned back to the computer eight more bits of poison on his screen and had to smile at the viciousness of the responses he didnt want to admit it but this taunting of people with such strong opinions was addictive he wondered despite all his worries about those he angered if he could give this work up so easily behind the mask of the internet he was a badass a troublemaker a takenoprisoners tough guy nothing like the mild academic who typed on the keyboard and thought hard about what precise words would evoke what terrifying responses luke went to his bathroom and showered rubbing the shampoo into his hair he wondered about the thousands of people he touched angry bitter so convinced in their hate that they were blind to nuance or circumstance or even to a basic morality the web connected them all electronic threads spanning the country and he had the uneasy feeling that the people he called the night road could reach out and touch him know him for the fraud that he was in an instant luke hated airports he had last seen his father alive at dulles ten years earlier every time he stepped into the wide cool expanse of a terminal he thought of his father a darksuited arm raised in farewell lukes clothes still wrinkled from the force of his fathers parting hug have a good trip dad hed said his father had stood close to him he was a handsome man with a trim beard a full head of hair going gray early and bold blue eyes ill be back soon mind your mother i will you want me to bring you back some fish in my pocket an old joke between them from when luke had caught a perch when he was five and promptly stuck it in his pocket and left it there for a few hours theyd burned his shorts no mom will get mad mom will be buying you new clothes mom had said with a smile touching his fathers arm then his father had rumpled lukes hair gently ill miss you every moment thats way too much missing luke said he was fourteen and easily mortified in public by parental affection he wanted to get back to the car crack open his computer game finish the level he was on he let his impatience show with a sigh an eye roll when you have a kid youll understand what it is to miss someone each moment youll be relieved to know i just got a girl pregnant ha ha his father said then looked at him with mock surprise kidding luke said two girls funny man his father kissed the top of his head be a good boy i got to go catch up with the others then a quick firm kiss for his mother and his father had gone walking away with his fellow professors for a fishing trip in north carolina gone forever luke did not even get to see him in the coffin the atlantic had hoarded his fathers body in its gray clutches he had walked on the beach closest to where the plane had gone down wondering if he could hear his fathers gentle baritone in the crash of the surf it had been a crazy thought but after the long darkness of his grief and the long weeks wandering the roads as a runaway being close to where his father died had been a strange comfort his father had become a regrettable haze defined by only a few sharp memories swimming at home in suburban virginia walking on the georgetown campus to his fathers office enjoying a redskins game when luke was five hoisting luke on his shoulders a finger moving across the night tapestry naming every star in the constellations that light dad said in his quiet voice its taken lifetimes to reach us starlight is longterm big picture always remember longterm and big picture luke he needed his fathers advice now he knew he was facing a crossroads in his life luke parked the bmw henry had bought him as a graduation gift in the shortterm parking lot on the passenger side henry huffed out of the car his appointments had run long and they were running late luke pulled henrys small bag from the trunk of his car i put a copy of my latest report in your bag and a copy of the current database luke said you can scare your fellow passengers by reading the report aloud fun for everyone what did you call it henry gave him a smile as they boarded the parking garage elevator a drive down the night road it sounds like a bad heavy rock album yes but the subtitles pure jazz a continuing analysis of extremists on the internet henry laughed thanks for all your work on this luke seeing you was the best part of my trip trying to convince my fellow academics about the threats we face was much less fun your peers wont listen to you i believe huge attacks are coming but theyre treating me like im saying the sky is falling henry couldnt keep the anger out of his voice they walked toward the main terminal of the austin airport the spring breeze was cool but the sunshine was bright and hard against their eyes so what about the job offer if i take it then my job is now to officially think mom would be amused your mother would have been incredibly proud of you silence then for always about ten seconds when they both spoke of lukes mother proud of us working together they waited for a security officer to wave them across the walkway stopping traffic with a gesture henry gave the officer a polite nod im not sure this is going to put my psychology degree to real use but playing tag with the crazies is slightly addictive danger is addictive henry said luke thought henrys sense of danger was probably doubleparking or placing a fivedollar bet at a casino but what your research is luke is important henry stopped in front of the terminal his sharpplaned face made a frown the hinges of history are at a critical turn right now luke the world has grown far smaller than we ever dreamed it could be its easier than ever for people with certain violent intentions to find each other you could help us find ways to understand them and fight them us i wish youd tell me who your client is take the job and youll know theyd stopped at the american airlines checkin touch screens henry tapped in his info and the kiosk spat out his boarding pass luke followed him to the line of people waiting to thread through the security checkpoint i dont want luke stopped what son henry didnt often call him son only when he was worried about luke i dont want a pity job offer henry just because you made a promise to mom good because pity doesnt play with me youve done brilliant work for me luke on researching the um night road as you charmingly call it but i would never offer you a career out of pity for you i respect you and my company far too much nice luke thought how does that shoe taste your one family member offers you a job and you manage to insult him i didnt mean that i know youre serious luke cleared his throat and his stomach gave a nervous lurch yes ill take the job a surprising relief lit henrys eyes youve made me happy and proud us working together itll be you know cool luke couldnt resist a smile henrys definition of cool was singular monographs on political economics treatises of the history of terrorism all qualified as henry cool and maybe it would make their relationship easier more adult he wouldnt be seen as just a kid any more youre right itll be cool henry did a poor job of keeping the happiness from spreading across his face ill call you tomorrow and well get the paperwork started thanks henry go home and get some sleep stay clear of the night road for a while hang out in the sunshine ill miss shaking the tree and seeing the rotten fruit fall you and me were going to change the world tall order we can change the world trust me and then henry shook his hand gave him an awkward hug luke hugged him back then henry turned and joined the security line luke walked back out into the glare of the afternoon and headed toward the parking garage were going to change the world henry said at least he didnt lack for ambition luke stopped at the edge of the parking garage trying to remember where hed left his bmw luke hey hows it going a heavy arm went around his shoulder a mans face thirtyish brownhaired a crooked nervous smile was close to his too close luke started to pull back a metal object darted into the small of his back dont yell luke dont run you have a very large gun against your spine can you stay calm for me the man had pulled luke close so he could whisper in his ear he was dressed in an expensive pinstripe suit a conservative navy tie his face was a little fleshy and soft he did not look like a man who routinely carried a gun luke could smell his mintdrenched breath his nervous sweat dont the man pressed the gun harder into lukes back luke hushed he could not remember how to breathe not with a gun in his back against his spine up under his jacket this couldnt be possible it wasnt happening you parked in row h lets go easy stay calm take the keys just take them luke found his voice he held up the bmw keys with a tremble panic swept through him that was what you were supposed to do just let them have the car the car could be replaced no you keep the keys luke youre driving what do you weve got places to go people to see he steered luke toward row h itll all be fine a family young mom and dad two daughters maybe six and four approached them from a minivan the younger girl was singing loudly offkey dancing in the rows ill make you a deal the man hissed you yell you run and ill shoot all four of them in the head be good and they live this cannot be happening to me luke made his mouth a tight thin line his skin prickled away from the guns barrel he tried not to look at the parents faces while the girl mangled her tune with offkey gusto he just kept walking five feet away from the family now and the man with the gun said in a calm businesslike voice so what i need for you to do when we get back to the office is to review all the accounts yes luke managed to say i understand every fiber in him wanted to run to get away but the family jesus he couldnt risk their lives the oldest girl moving away from her sisters annoying singing as it echoed in the concrete garage met lukes eyes she smiled and they moved past the mother chiding the youngest emma okay enough with the singing mommys getting a threepill headache well done the man hissed into lukes ear were going to get into your car fight or yell and ill shoot that nice dad dead luke heard a click in the mans throat as he swallowed the cars yours just take it please do as youre told he forced luke to enter the bmw from the passenger side awkwardly scooting across the gearshift the gun firmly planted in his back luke settled into the seat and the man closed the passenger door what the hell do you want please just let me go drive dont draw attention to us or ill kill you and then ill kill whoever notices us he pulled out a steel knife from a holster under his coat the edge looked brutally sharp lukes throat turned to sand you see its worse than a gun i can hurt you and keep you alive to hurt some more start the engine luke hands shaking breath coming in hollow gulps obeyed he told himself to stay calm he thought of those long weeks hed spent on his own fourteen years old running away from his grief hiding from the police walking along the back roads hitching rides desperate to get from washington dc to cape hatteras to the beginning of the long stretch of ocean where his father had been lost hed seen knives and guns then once and hed gotten away he could get away again the key was to wait for the right moment head out say nothing to the attendant luke backed out of the parking space drove out of the garage blinking at the sunlight two of the tollbooths were open it was midafternoon the rush of lateday flights not descending yet heres money for your parking the man said my treat he stuck a fivedollar bill under lukes nose and the money trembled slightly hes scared too luke realized and the thought did not comfort a panicked man with a gun and a knife was more frightening than an icy calm kidnapper luke closed his fist around the money powered down the window your ticket sir the attendant asked he was a big kid college age dark hair cut in a burr a wide friendly smile luke dug into the pocket of his coat and felt the knife nestle into his ribs where the attendant couldnt see it he yanked the ticket from his pocket handed it to the attendant with the crushed fiver the attendant returned his change in ones you all right sir most people would never notice luke heard himself say airsick rough flight he sounded unsteady feel better the wooden gate rose and he drove forward the bite of the knife went through his shirt and he nearly drove off the road do you think im stupid luke do you were you trying to make him remember you luke winced at the sharp pain the knife withdrew from denting his flesh and he now felt the barest trickle of blood ease along his ribs no i didnt mean anything i did what you asked you just paid for shortterm parking but you complain of a rough flight flyers dont park in shortterm you tried to stick in his memory for when he talks to the police luke flinched then put his eyes back to the road i didnt know what to say you cut me are you crazy ill make you a deal this was apparently the guys favorite phrase you cause trouble and ill cut your stomach open and you can see what your guts look like do you understand yes i understand exit the airport head east on highway look seriously i didnt know what to say dont pretend to be stupid it will just piss me off luke turned onto highway which threaded through the outskirts of austin and eastward toward houston he eased into the traffic the knife left his side but the gun returned to his ribs drive to houston three hours away three hours sitting next to this lunatic the suggestion unnerved him what did this guy want he knew your name he knew where you parked houston why youll find out when we get there you pull over or try and wreck us or get brave and fight me youre dead you obey me you get out alive now shut the hell up and drive youre crazy man please just let me go crazy the word thudded past all his fear a guy who looked ordinary but had a singleminded mission of violence luke glanced at him again im not crazy the man said and luke saw that he wasnt not a glint of madness in his eyes he was utterly and completely intent on what he was doing are you one of them luke thought one of the people i drew out of the darkness the night road luke realized had found him highway curled past the towering lost pines of bastrop county crossed over the colorado river as the waterway snaked south and east toward the gulf of mexico the land was rolling as it slowly flattened into the coastal plain traffic was light i am being kidnapped the realization cut through the shock in lukes brain no one would be missing him until tomorrow henry said hed call tomorrow an eternity now no one else would be expecting him or looking for him maybe the doorman at his condo but if he didnt see luke he wouldnt think much of it he wasnt on duty every day maybe luke thought hysterically the doormanll think ive finally gone out to party he drove in silence luke ran the options through his mind trying to calm his nerves stopping the car and simply running would get him a bullet in the back he rejected the idea of crashing the car if other drivers stopped to help hed be putting them in danger brawn couldnt beat a gun he needed to figure out how he might reason with the guy but everything he knew about the psychology of violence seemed to evaporate from his brain he kept thinking about the knife and the gun dont quit your day job to play poker the man said he had not spoken since ordering luke toward houston forty minutes of gallows silence what youre thinking it through how soon youll be missed how long it will take for someone to realize youre not where you should be plan a is obeying me youre trying to hatch plan b i wasnt you live alone in a tower condo in downtown youre sort of friendly with your neighbors but not so much that theyll notice youre not around today or tomorrow or even the day after its spring break you dont have classes you know a lot about me maybe luke thought because hes one of the people you went looking for he played out the times when the night road responded to his postings via private messages to his online accounts engaged him in long conversations about their obsessions and agendas hed been most careful not to reveal any real information about himself but this man had still found him what do you want from me lukes voice was steadier i just want you to come with me play nice and you dont get hurt draw him out luke thought draw him out the same way you would if he was on the other side of the computer monitor if i understood what you were trying to accomplish you dont have we talked before maybe online the man gave a soft laugh im not one of your research projects he definitely knew about the night road then at the least he knew what luke was doing for henry my stepfather will call me as soon as he lands in new york give me your cell phone the guns barrel dug into his ribs luke winced and fished his smartphone out of his jacket pocket the man took it and tossed it to the cars floor he crushed it under the heel of his heavy shoe instant peace of mind luke glanced at the radio above it was a button to a locatormonitoring service one that would call him if the car was in an accident or that he could call if he needed directions or assistance but he remembered with a jolt that he hadnt bothered to renew the service contract last summer the monitoring service was useless if you let me go luke said i wont tell the police well pretend this didnt happen i never saw you it cant work that way the mans voice went quiet and low but not calm im sorry for you but this is going to happen going to happen he thought of all the empty side roads that lay between austin and houston the woods places a body could be dumped he made himself stay calm doesnt have to luke said well say you let me out here by the time i walk to a town youre already halfway to houston ive already forgotten what you look like no negotiation the man wiped his lip with his finger trust me i dont need to remember you i wont i am very practical that way were already past the point of no return wrong you can always turn back he didnt want this guy feeling more desperate than he already was you have a choice you havent gotten out much in life have you the man choked on a nervous laugh luke couldnt tell how to read this guy one second he seemed like a hardened criminal confident in his capacity for violence the next he seemed nervous fretful as though hed taken on the wrong job and he knew it look mistakes were made things were said its all in the past im the worlds most forgiving dude also the most generous just let me go we need us some bright and cheery tunes and for you to shut the hell up the man fiddled with the radio and spun past stations but found nothing he liked and switched it to silence i hate not having driving tunes or even the news except all the news is bad these days its the way weve made the world nothing but bad bad news luke drove on in eerie silence the man just stared out the window lost in thought but the gun stayed steady in lukes side and he kept imagining the blood and torn intestines that would gush into his lap luke saw a sign for mirabeau a goodsized town halfway between houston and austin he remembered there was often a speed trap on the eastern edge of the town he pressed gently but steadily on the accelerator rev the speed up past the limit slow enough where the man wouldnt notice for the first time in his life luke hoped hed fall into a speed trap talk to him dont let him notice what youre doing but before he could say anything the mans cell phone rang he pulled it free of a pocket and read the display you stay quiet he said he flicked the knife up along lukes ribs and luke winced and nodded yeah the man said into the phone luke heard a womans voice crackle through the cell saying eric this is jane how goes the project gathered the nerve to grab our boy yet her accent was british luke pushed the car to four miles an hour over the limit its its under control but i really cannot talk right now hard for you im sure to do two things at once the woman jane said she gave a sick cruel laugh but hurry times running out the man thumbed the volume control on the phone making janes words into a murmur eric his name is eric luke kept his eyes on the road under control this jane woman must know what eric was planning and why a barely felt tap and he was six miles an hour faster than the limit eric huddled listening on his cell wasnt watching the speedometer or luke and luke jolted the speed up higher eight over the limit and then ten he debated in his mind as to whether to push it higher to risk it no he couldnt risk eric noticing he squeezed the steering wheel hard eric listened to the phone and finally he said ill call you when the rest is complete and you better keep your side of the bargain the rest is complete keep your side what did eric mean and why would a british woman be involved in his kidnapping when his focus was on finding american extremists he didnt look over as eric switched off the phone without a goodbye to his caller mirabeau spanned a few exits on the highway the bmw shot past a mcdonalds a bakerygas station selling kolache pastries an exit for the downtown business district no sign of a patrol car please please be up ahead luke thought eric seemed lost in thought and didnt notice lets keep it that way luke thought lets make him just a little mad enough to keep him distracted was that your girlfriend shut the hell up i bet she doesnt know youre carjacking innocent people at airports shed be so proud this isnt a carjacking i thought most kidnappers did their own driving youre a cheapass kidnapper making me do my own driving eric stared at him are you trying to be funny yes i want to lighten the mood luke risked a bad imitation of a smile where the hell was the cop that was on every other trip luke made through this stretch of highway so ready to give out a ticket he wanted to pound his fist against the steering wheel in rage but he had to keep erics mind engaged his eyes off the dashboard theres nothing funny about today but luke heard a jagged curl in erics words nerves on end the hell im trapped in is not a joke exactly what hell are you trapped in you have the gun luke screamed back in his face they shot under a bridge and on the opposite side a mirabeau police cruiser sat waiting like a spider in the heart of its web yes luke thought thank you jesus and the patron saint of speeders he was saved eric glanced in the rearview saw the blues and reds flash to life slow it down eric yelled luke obeyed but it was too late the cruiser launched itself off the incline onto the highway oh you rotten prick eric screamed im sorry you made me nervous i didnt watch should i pull over if i have to kill this poor stupid cop its your fault eric hissed dont kill anyone you dont really seem to want to do this i cant i cant you dont understand you dont know what youre doing eric steadied his voice pull over and say nothing not a word and he wont notice the gun in your hand im going to put the gun out of sight luke thought good because then im going to yell my head off because if you say a word i dont like if you do anything other than take the ticket and thank the officer im going to shoot you both you just put this cops life in needless danger because yes i will kill him and if i have to kill him you die too i always have a plan b and this is it right now that cop is walking into a trap you set for him you stupid heartless moron an icy certainty colored erics tone now unmistakable resolve heartless youre the goddamned kidnapper luke stopped the bmw the police car halting behind it bile clouded into lukes throat in the rearview he saw the officer get out of the car and start to approach get out your insurance and registration now i have the gun where i can reach it instantly you warn him you both die luke gathered the papers the rising courage he thought hed feel if he could attract police attention felt crushed he powered down the window as the officer reached the door im sorry sir luke said the officer was middleaged tall heavybuilt he wore the professional look that said hed already heard every excuse a hundred times before his nametag read moncrief you didnt pull over very fast sir no sir i didnt luke handed the officer his license and registration thats my fault officer eric said with a crooked wan smile he sounded like a disappointed big brother i was yelling at him about his speeding and hes already upset we just got word of a death in the family our grandma and we were heading fast too fast i guess to houston im sorry for your loss the officer said real sympathy in his voice but still he began to write the ticket luke watched the pen move across the paper the cops hands busy and not near his gun the chance had passed luke squeezed the steering wheel with frustration if he called for help now eric would shoot officer moncrief before he could react he glanced at eric and the barest smile of triumph flickered on erics face officer moncrief handed luke his ticket and luke signed he wanted to write help me on the signature line but he could feel eric watching him he paused halfway through his scrawl and he could hear erics very quiet intake of breath readying the gun he wrote his last name handed the pad back to the officer slow it down gentlemen if youre dealing with one tragedy you dont want another words to live by officer thank you eric said yes luke said it was true as soon as the officer turned away and started back to his cruiser the gun moved to lukes hip back on the road now speed limit luke obeyed his hands shaking on the wheel raging at himself for his lost nerve ill make you a deal eric said breaking the silence as they left mirabeau behind them you and your deals your deals only benefit you another stunt and i shoot off your big toe i dont have to deliver you in perfect condition we dont have much time deliver luke thought he was now a delivery who wanted him houston the city spread out across the vast coastal plain a seemingly endless quilt of shopping centers office buildings housing developments all connected by a stitching of highways haze moped above the horizon it was a city of drivers a constant thrumming jolt of energy and movement as the afternoon rush hours approached i traffic headed east into the city slowed in fits and starts the creeping pace of traffic gave luke a fresh hope he kept cussing himself inside his brain for his fear in not trying to escape when the mirabeau police officer was there to help him but he believed it would have gotten them both dead the desperation in erics eyes was a fierce awful fire theyd hit their first real traffic now if the car came to a full stop maybe he could bolt eric might not be eager to shoot him in front of dozens of other people or he could mouth a plea for help if anyone would look at him the drivers kept their eyes on the road strangers did not exchange glances in cars in houston the knife likes you to have your eyes forward eric said the knife likes to not stab me when im driving because well crash but god knows we want to keep the knife happy stay calm tonight youll be safe eric sounded hollow he had shushed luke the few times in the past hour when luke had tried to speak again stay in the middle lane until we get to the downtown exits traffic slowed again and for the first time eric clutched lukes shirt grabbing the seat belt in his fist as well youre considering making a run im telling you i will kill you you dont need the threats im done fighting you he was gripped by a panic that someone would see eric threatening him and try to help him making it worse luke glanced at the car on his left he saw a woman driving a minivan a bored teenage girl in the passenger seat texting on a phone to his right an older man in a pickup truck drummed a beat on the steering wheel none of them looked over at lukes car lost in the world of what was directly ahead of their windshields strange to be so alone each of us when surrounded by thousands of others we dont even know who we can reach out to who will understand us eric gave a ragged laugh thats why the worlds going to hell then lets not take one further step into hell please youre not a bad guy you need to be afraid of me luke i am but you dont want to hurt me i can tell youre not a criminal you dont want to do this let me help you get out of whatever mess youre in he had to convince eric it wasnt too late to stop to let him go you are helping me you just dont know it yet erics jaw clenched but it changes you breaking the law eric said quietly i cant go back i made my choice and i want you to shut up now they had to work past a traffic jam caused by a chain reaction of fender benders and by the time they reached the heart of the city evening had begun its slide over the sky eric got more agitated checking his watch every halfminute sweat was bright on his face downtown houston rose in lightbejeweled towers downtown had undergone a renaissance in recent years old abandoned hotels and buildings reborn into new establishments lodgings and office space luke steered the bmw through the weaving pedestrians office workers heading to the light rail and bus stops and parking garages or to trendy new bars and restaurants luke had always thought houston a place of unbounded energy and bustle but right now he just wished someone would slow down long enough to notice he was in trouble this is about to get dangerous eric said he leaned forward as though scanning the pedestrians for a face for a threat like it wasnt already turn here they drove past minute maid park where the astros played then deep into a neighborhood that had not yet benefited from the economic renaissance of downtown the buildings were older the businesses humbler unrepaired potholes the byproduct of houston humidity pocked the pavement luke reached a small parking lot and eric said pull in here luke did parking in a slot closest to the street at erics order they had a view down the street the sidewalks were less crowded fewer pedestrians strolled to their evenings entertainment luke saw an old couple ambling slowly carrying grocery bags a young woman hurrying past chattering on a cell phone and gesturing wildly an older woman dressed too young venturing into the twilight with her painted pained smile down the street luke could see a small bar a homeless shelter operated by an episcopal charity a liquor store a clothing resale shop a neonsigned texmex eatery the storefronts were weathered and worn now what luke asked we wait for what was someone coming here to meet them to collect luke this might be his one remaining chance to escape but no way he could get clear of the car without eric shooting or knifing him what are you going to do eric glanced again at his watch tugged nervously at his lip everything will be okay trust me twenty minutes passed sundown completed its glory the night threw its stars across the darkpurpled sky erics gun rested back in its second home lukes ribs lukes legs ached from sitting so long hunger rumbled his stomach but he kept fighting off a fearinduced nausea hed already decided that if he puked he was aiming at erics rotten face puke and run for his life a mark of real heroics he thought he was starting to lose his grip he closed his eyes he wondered if this sinking acceptance in his chest that the end was close was what his father felt like in the moments before he died if dad had realized the plane he was on was doomed lukes hand found the medal under his shirt and clutched at it he thought of the conversation hed had with his father his mom asleep in the sleeping bag he and his dad sitting by the soft flicker of the campfire i want you to have this son keep it close to you always his father had said always it will shield you from danger dad seriously youre not religious his father had been raised episcopalian but he wasnt a churchgoer except maybe at easter and christmas when lukes mom insisted no atheists in foxholes luke warren dantry had said were camping this isnt a foxhole luke said he raised the medal to the firelights glow a faceless angel muscular wings holding a sword and shield saint michael the archangel is an emblem of strength and determination of order and reason overcoming chaos and violence hes special in that he figures in christian jewish and islamic traditions hes a hero for the world good overcoming enormous evil evil like darth vader he didnt remember the story of what saint michael had done what evil he had defeated worse than darth vader his father had said saint michael will keep you safe luke if not now then someday safe from what from whatever darkness comes into your life you might be called to fight one day luke think of michael think of strength and know you can win brains are better than strength dad his dad smiled at him yes but together theyre unbeatable thanks dad luke didnt like jewelry of any sort he thought this a goofy gift and most unlike his dad and he put the medal in his pocket his father had said nothing more poking at the fire with a stick and a month later his father was dead and luke had worn the medal every day what are you doing erics voice rose luke opened his eyes nothing eric jabbed the gun hard into lukes side pried his fingers from the medal pulled it from lukes shirt a flat circular medal with an angel armed with a fiery sword the angels wings were wide strong like an eagles whats this an edge came to erics voice saint michael the archangel my dad gave it to me you you dont need to be praying everythings cool if you do what i say eric let go of the medal as though it burned him luke tucked the silver back into his shirt eric put his gaze back to the street saint michael hes the one who casts satan out of heaven right sends him plummeting to hell yeah luke said who sent you to this hell eric this might be his only chance to reason with him they were waiting for god knew what and eric was scared he swallowed past the brokenglass ache in his throat the woman on the phone who is she shut up shes giving you orders shut up she ordered you to kidnap me why eric kept his eyes locked on the street hello eric said luke followed erics stare and saw a flicker of light as the homeless shelters door closed a tall older man approached their car his weathered face lit by the juxtaposition of passing headlights and the pool of a streetlamp he was dressed in the uniform of the homeless a shabby coat a bandanna secured over greasy hair they waited in silence as the man approached start the car erics voice crackled energy as though the exhaustion of the past several hours was forgotten pull out into the street why just do it luke started the engine and pulled out onto the street the homeless man was forty feet ahead of them walking on the left i have to be sure eric said to himself stay close but not too close luke stopped the bmw at a light the homeless man kept walking stare fixed ahead on the buckling sidewalk the light flashed green go eric ordered luke drove the car closed the gap on the homeless man they drove past him and the man glanced up drive another block then go back eric ordered luke uturned at the next light and now the passenger side window was closer to the homeless man eric studied his quarry its him eric said okay be cool be cool luke wasnt sure if eric was talking to him or to himself the homeless man raised his head as he walked on in his broken shuffle he wiped at his nose with the back of his hand another man waited at the street corner leaning against the traffic light turning to watch as both the first man and the bmw approached the second man dressed in a leather jacket with a colorful bald eagle stitched on the back jeans and heavy dark sunglasses unnecessary at night seemed to sense trouble rising he turned and ran into the shadows of an alley at top speed glancing once over his shoulder luke saw naked fear on his broad scarred face that guy in the eagle jacket was going to talk to the homeless man luke said he was not sure why he said this thought aloud but he had seen a smile of expectation rise and then fade in the second mans face luke had the sense they were interrupting something a rendezvous or an appointment the homeless man stopped as the leatherjacketed man rushed away from the scene they drew level with the homeless man and he paused as the bmw crawled to a stop eric lowering the window the homeless man took an awkward step forward into the pool of light then he turned and began to hurry away walking with purpose digging into his pocket follow him eric ordered with a hard jab of the gun into lukes tender ribs the homeless man broke into a run he cut across the street toward the parking lot of a bank the building looked new the foothold into the neighborhood for the revitalized edge of downtown catch up with him i have to talk to him eric said the homeless man ran toward the narrow empty drivethrough lanes toward the soft glow of the atm machine cut him off dont let him get away eric said luke cut the bmw between the homeless man and the building he glided into the atm lane and slammed to a stop the drivers side was close to the atm the passenger side fronting the running man the homeless guy rocked on his heels and then lurched to retreat the other way the gun left lukes ribs no he yelled but eric leaned out the window and fired three loud pops the homeless man jerked fell collapsed in a huddle the back of his head welled bone and blood luke lunged at erics arm at the gun he stepped off the brake and the bmw lurched past the atm eric socked his elbow back hard and lukes head snapped into the drivers window pain lashed his nose his face the gun warm from duty pressed against the side of his throat eric turned held up his phone with the other hand and snapped a photo of the dead man he closed the phone and jabbed the gun harder against lukes throat oh god you shot him luke whispered drive fast now luke drove his hands shivering his whole body numb with shock he steered back onto the road the gun was warm against his skin holy jesus he had just witnessed a murder fear pounded an ache in his chest he wasnt sure what he felt except that he did not want to die get us onto the highway erics voice broke go go which which one as if it mattered luke thought eric had just killed a man and luke knew he was next just get us on a highway get us out of here eric flipped open his phone worked the keypad with his thumb then he punched in another number shaking he emitted a hard nervous laugh an awful mockery of a laugh and put the cell phone up to his ear its done hes dead i just emailed you the proof so you tell me where she is luke felt erics stare come onto his skin he drove like a robot he tried to focus on the driving where she is eric closed the phone get us to highway and head northeast what so i can drive you to kill someone else no now we go save a life and like an old friend the gun went back against lukes ribs they were well past the city now past the sprawl of lights and the scattering of outer suburbs and smaller towns into the denseness of the piney woods luke kept a hard grip on the wheel he badly needed to go to the bathroom and hunger clenched its fist around his stomach the gas needle hovered toward the red zone of empty we need to make a gas stop he said youll pull over when i say two minutes later they came upon a farm to market road empty of traffic beyond its edges heavy growths of loblolly pines stood like guardians drive a ways down the road eric ordered hes going to kill me now whatever strange reason i was useful to him is over and hes going to kill me terror rose in his throat stop luke stopped eric removed the keys from the ignition get out of the car slowly the last movements his muscles would ever know luke obeyed hed been stuck behind the wheel body locked in fear for hours the night was silent the stars mute witnesses you need to pee yes was this a final kindness what did it matter go on the other side of the car he stuck the gun between lukes shoulder blades luke relieved himself when he was done eric steered him toward the trunk he popped it open with the remote im going to give you a break from driving but if i hear one peep out of that trunk youre dead as much fun as weve had together ill just pretend youre the guy i killed and its boom youre done the shakiness was gone from erics voice hed said earlier that breaking the law changed you and now he had broken the greatest law of man he had taken a life i know shivering luke climbed into the trunk the lid slammed down darkness the engine revved the tires hissed softly on the gravel and the car backed and pulled into a uturn luke alone stretched his legs out as far as he could you may be called upon to fight dad had said the time was now he had to think of something the car stopped and luke opened his eyes in the dark he heard erics soft whisper near the trunk filling the tank up no noise from you or ill kill the clerk inside luke pressed a fist against the door the funny thing is shooting that man was much harder in my mind id built it up as this terrible thing but after the first squeeze of the trigger my mind turned off a little bit and it wasnt too bad he sounded almost surprised i have to stop you luke thought i cant let you hurt another person the pump clicked as eric settled it back into its slot luke groped in the darkness he needed a weapon he felt a circular shape a set of jumper cables he groped past the cables and his fingers closed on a pile of plastic boxes old cassette tapes nothing beneath he kept searching turning over to face the front of the trunk he felt the rim of the spare tire there were tools to change it but they lay under the tire and he couldnt get to them with the trunk closed he reached out and touched the coil of the jumper cables again heavy plastic like a thick braided rope with the copper clamps on the end as the car started and pulled away from the station luke began to uncurl the coil luke lost the sense of time he kept the jumper cables close to him and he thought long and hard about what he would do when eric the murderer opened the trunk finally the car stopped luke tensed he pulled the cables close to him he practiced what he was going to do best as he could given the tight quarters it was insane to try but to not try was worse he heard a voice close to the trunk luke you awake as if he could sleep im awake im going to open the trunk now you will get out and you will do exactly as youre told the trunk opened the dark night had become gloomier gray clouds obscuring the stars in the distance thunder rumbled he could see the shadow of eric standing centered at the trunks opening the arm cocked holding the gun aimed toward him luke snared the cable over erics arm one neat quick motion and yanked down pulling eric toward the trunk then he kicked out hard caught eric in the chest dumbass eric roared now luke yanked eric toward him keeping him off balance trying to scramble out of the trunk the pistol bound in the cables was caught between the two of them eric fired heat burning luke heard the thump of bullets ripping into the trunks body he kicked out again suddenly afraid of a bullet smashing into the now full gas tank the two men hit the ground scrambling for the loose gun eric twisted his hands free of the cables luke tackled him drove knees into erics back as he lunged toward the weapon the gun lay close to his reach lying now on the grass lit only by moonlight peering through the clouds grass and dirt clogged lukes teeth as eric pushed him off lukes fingers closed around the barrel and then the heavy rope of the jumper cables looped around his throat the cables tightened into the flesh of his neck like a noose erics knee ground hard into his spine luke struggled to turn to better the grip on the gun and aim the gun at eric but he couldnt move eric began to strangle him the pain from the pressure from the lack of air burst in lukes throat let the gun go luke eric hissed in his ear let it go if he let go he would die if he didnt let go he would die he couldnt turn the gun around to aim it at eric he didnt have the leverage or the grip on the trigger he released the gun spreading fingers feeling the cool of the grass instead of the heat of the steel the noose didnt loosen but eric yanked him several yards away from the gun dragging into the dirt and grass then pounded him with a brutal kick to the back of the head darkness pain luke lay stunned gasping the ache in his head bright as fire blood oozed on his ear on his jaw the gun barrel nestled against his hair youre not going to screw me over spittle hit the back of lukes neck luke hardly able to speak past the pain in his throat nodded facedown in the grass eric yanked him to his feet and shoved him toward a dirt road that cut through the grass loblolly pines rose in thin majesty around him and the air smelled of wet earth and gathering storm in the distance thunder sounded clouds clearing their throats luke and eric moved down the road and suddenly a light flickered on high and bright luke blinked at the harsh brightness he could see a chained gate cutting across the road a light above the gate glowed no person stood on the other side of the gate the light must be keyed to a sensor eric shoved luke against the gate it was secured with chains and the links clattered as luke stumbled against it turn around luke did and eric held up a cell phone smile luke didnt i want that bitch to see youre being delivered in good condition smile delivered luke bit his lip then smiled good eric fiddled with the smartphone he clicked buttons kept his gaze flickering between the keypad and luke luke guessed the pine forest had been cleared of a width about forty feet for the scrabble of road eric could gun him down before he reached the woods eric put the phone up to his face i just sent you a photo of luke dantry where is she eric listened said you better not be lying he clicked off the phone you called the british woman luke said eric didnt answer he powered a bullet into the chains lock it shattered in the quiet sent birds flocking up from the pines eric unwound the chains creaked the gate open he produced a small flashlight from his pocket and waved luke forward with it luke shambled along gravel kicking under his shoes the road looked like it had been built for quiet murder the only noise was his footsteps the hiss of the wind and a low song of owls the dark smelled dank and the circle of flashlight danced at his feet a soft rain began to fall whod you send my photo to he asked first the dead man in houston now him who am i being delivered to he risked a thrust is it jane eric stared at him shook his head you are done talking period you dont say a word i dont need you making things worse for me like eric was the victim more than luke or the dead homeless guy the road split and eric said turn left and hurry up hurry he prodded luke in the shoulder blades with the gun ahead he saw a soft glow of light luke stumbled forward eric urging him into a loping run suddenly the trees on each side opened up and a small cabin stood in the clearing of the pines a thin light shone from a small window near the front door eric stopped him as they reached the door eric kicked over a flowerpot filled with dead remnants of rosemary in the puddle of the light luke saw two keys one large like a house key the other was smaller similar to the kind to undo a luggage lock open the door eric ordered luke slid the key into the lock eased the door open they stepped into a dark short entryway the thin framing of light came from a closed door on his right eric put a hand on his shoulder almost gently and opened the door it was a small room and it smelled of cleaning fluid and sweat a small lamp stood in a corner and in its feeble circle of light luke saw a woman she lay on a metal bed she was in her midtwenties dark haired she wore jeans and a thin sweater her hair was a tangle over her face and she smelled of having gone a couple of days without a good wash she stared at luke in complete terror baby its me eric said stepping from behind luke the woman coughed a whisper that sounded like oh god eric and she trembled oh my god why get me out of here its all okay its all okay eric said luke could see that shackles bound the woman to the bed a set of chains braceleting her to the cot at her wrists another set of shackles at her feet eric hurried toward her but stopped himself he made sure to not turn his back on luke and he backed away from the bed he pressed the small key into lukes hands set her free eric who is he where are the police the woman asked say nothing more youre safe thats all that matters eric stepped back the gun not aimed at luke but at the ready why the hell do you have a gun the woman demanded an edge in her rising voice just hush babe youre safe now iron in erics voice a huge relief safe and sound luke fumbled with the keys he unlocked the chains cuffing her wrists and the links fell to the mattress she slapped the constraints away as if they were radioactive the links tinkled as they slid to the hardwood floor thank you the woman said to luke thank you so much dont thank him eric screamed dont say a goddamned word to him luke unlocked the shackles on her legs he met the womans gaze she was confused glancing at him and then eric she kicked the chains away and wriggled past luke off the bed she fell against erics chest drinking in the comfort of his touch he kept the gun aimed at luke i want to go home the woman sobbed into erics shoulder so do i said luke eric kissed the top of the womans head stroked her shoulder he eased her toward the door and turned back to luke get on the bed luke sat on the mattresss edge ive moved heaven and earth to keep you safe he said to the woman she nodded looking confused and he kissed her forehead but i need you to do what i say i need to keep the gun on him so i need you to lock this guy to the bed lukes throat froze and the woman mumbled what lock him to the bed hes taking your place eric the woman began you cant abandon a person here no lets just go to the police please lets just go to the police at the same time luke stood no sit down eric shouted youre not leaving me here aubrey please eric said do as i say i dont understand the woman started to say and eric yelled dont question me not after ive put everything in my life on the line for you just do it goddamn it eric pushed her toward the bed and following her put the gun to lukes temple stay still dont struggle he swallowed hes a bad guy baby dont feel bad for him dont listen to him he kidnapped me luke shouted he stopped if he told this woman eric had committed murder then eric might kill him instead of leaving him here he shut his mouth hes one of the guys behind your kidnapping eric said i grabbed him hes your ransom so dont feel bad for him babe the woman aubrey stared hard at luke and luke shook his head he grabbed at her smooth wrists hes lying im not a bad guy please let her go eric roared he fired a bullet past lukes head into the wall luke and aubrey froze doubled over in surprise she trembled at the gunshot and luke released her she raised the cuffs to his wrists and clicked the shackles on him im sorry she murmured im sorry aubrey glanced at eric then she attached the chains to his ankles hes lying to you im innocent luke said all i did eric said was deliver a ransom aubrey stepped back shaking and the man embraced her again go outside wait for me were going home aubrey stumbled out of the cabin eric unfolded the phone he pulled a small metal device from his pocket luke guessed it was a modulator designed to mask his voice and snapped it over the phone and he punched in a number he raised his finger to his lips in a hushing motion the phone was on speaker and luke heard henry say hello henry shawcross i have bad news your stepson luke dantry has been kidnapped what who the hell is this lets just say im passing the baton to you eric said listen carefully to get your stepson back you must wire fifty million dollars to a series of offshore accounts henry doesnt have fifty million dollars are you insane luke said softly the idea was ridiculous youve made a serious mistake a long agonizing beat of silence i wish to speak to luke henry said tell him youre alive and well nothing else eric unhooked the device from the phone and put it close to lukes face luke said henry luke henry sounded stunned is this a joke no he grabbed me at the airport he had a gun he eric stood and replaced the modulator onto the phone hes alive and unhurt do what youre told or your stepson is dead another long stretch of silence luke could hear the rasp of henrys breathing im sorry i will not pay luke froze he thought he had misheard he said will not instead of cannot what henrys voice sounded thin tinny a ghost of his usual confident baritone i dont know what money youre talking about please dont hurt luke but i dont have this money you want eric said dont lie you know you have the fifty million you bastard i do not for gods sakes give him what he wants luke yelled he was thinking if you dont have the money just tell them that you do stall them make them think the money is coming get the fbi on the job please henry tell him youll cooperate maybe henry was too stunned by the ransom demand to know what to say luke i cannot i cannot his stepfather smart determined more than capable of thinking on his feet was not willing to bluff he was not willing to lie to promise complete cooperation and get off the phone and call the police he was leaving luke to the murderous mercies of a kidnapper the realization hit him like a stone hammering into his chest why wouldnt he lie say anything to save luke you dont understand you dont cooperate he will die eric said i cant help you henry unyielding hes already killed one guy he knows about the night road luke yelled give him what he wants silence like a thread pulled to a breaking point i suspect this is a sort of very bad joke luke why are you doing this eric retreated across from the room holding the phone still a look of disbelief on his face what does a kidnapper do when the family tells him to screw himself luke thought henry its not a joke i am going to hang up now henry said the line went dead eric and luke stared at each other in the dim light of the cabin after their yelling the room seemed to echo with the silence luke was afraid to speak instinct told him to be silent that eric was on the brink of either killing him or calling henry back or calling back jane the british woman the master pulling the strings to report henrys refusal eric stared at him raised the gun luke stared back in his eyes it was his only defense eric had shot the homeless man in the back he hadnt had to watch his victim face death shell hear luke said shell hear and shell know what you did know what you are the gun wavered you cant talk about this he said your stepfathers in deep thats all i can say youre in deep as well deep in what the woman who took aubrey jane shell call henry again im sure theyll work out an exchange for you erics voice broke i just want to go home please luke rattled the chains ill give you a bit of advice if you get free or henry pays up find a place to hide if you can trust no one thats your life now you know henry you know about the night road how eric leaned against the wall as though the weariness of the past day had drained him of bone and blood what the hell is my stepfather involved with why would he have fifty million dollars tell me now eric looked at him again i cant afford to feel sorry for you goodbye he walked toward the door dont do this dont leave me here luke struggled against the chains for gods sakes no one knows im here in the middle of nowhere youre right and that ignorance buys me time eric turned and he left slamming the door behind him a few minutes later luke heard a car his car start in the far distance past the grove past the gate the bmws engine gave what sounded like a joyful revving of course eric and aubreys ordeal was over his sure as hell wasnt he was alone chained to a bed in the middle of nowhere with no way out and no one to help him the bombs required a high level of trust it started with several hundred pounds of highgrade semtex explosive smuggled out of the czech republic and then sold to an operative in the farc terrorist group in colombia the explosives were then bartered for detailed intelligence on a new surge of antinarcotic operations supported in colombia by the american government this trade resulted in the eventual torture and murder of four undercover agents the semtex was muled into america by the most trusted couriers of a mexican drug lord in exchange for the name of a key government informant inside his own ring the informant was tortured for three days her body with her throat slit was left on her mothers doorstep in a quiet mexico city neighborhood once the explosives were in the united states the construction of the bomb was completed in a suburban garage outside of houston texas by an american woman who felt a deep and abiding hate for the government her nickname was snow it did not matter who was in power snow loathed all authority figures within the government with a fevered intensity snow had learned how to make semtexbased bombs when she was a youngster from her father before he died she refreshed her knowledge by perusing instructions found on the internet and studying worn teastained manuals left over from the irish republican armys campaign in the s that she had acquired on an online auction site snow made many of them in careful and rote fashion one after another for weeks working in the quiet of her aunts house her aunt had died a year before and snowd kept the house as a workshop her boyfriend grew tired of her long absence they fought on the second day when she came home exhausted her fingernails nicked from cutting wires her nerves raw and he left for his mothers house she was glad he was gone he wasnt committed to the cause he was a pain in the ass fortunately he didnt know about the bombs she went and bought her own supplies cell phones wire blasting caps then she made one special bomb shaping the plastic to detonate in a certain way with a calculated force to produce an exact result snow was so proud of it she called this bomb baby she was drinking coffee waiting at her house for the man to pick baby up hoping that her boyfriend wouldnt show up wanting her back she was done with the boyfriend its lighter than i thought it would be mouser said when he picked up the bomb he stood in snows suburban kitchen she had as ordered placed the bomb inside a reinforced canvas carryall he picked up the duffel bag measured the weight heavy but manageable i do good work snow said mouser thought the nickname fit her her hair was dyed a stark white cut short her gray eyes were like flecks of ice her body was muscled not afraid of hard work there was a thin crinkle of scar on her jaw and her neck shed been burned once maybe one of the bombs had backfired on her she watched him with crossed arms assuming your people provided the correct specifications they did snow raised an eyebrow if youre wrong about the tank thickness well have a problem or rather you will its been doublechecked threefourths of an inch thick nonnormalized steel more brittle the cars are old mouser didnt much like his facts being called in question you put in too much explosive well have more burn than drift i guarantee my work snow sipped orange juice you dont look like how i pictured you she was not at all what mouser expected in a bomb maker he knew a few and they were foreigners often older guys he suspected incompetent bomb makers died early and frequently missing fingers but she was supposed to be one of the best how did you picture me arab mouser cracked a grin with no humor in it sorry to disappoint im not disappointed snow said if you were an arab i wouldnt have let you have the bomb i dont much like arabs theyre worse than the government mouser said nothings worse than the beast the what a light hit her eyes she tilted her head to look at him the beast thats what i call the government im curious as to how you could have gotten the bomb away from me if you didnt like the look of me oh i would have just detonated it once you were about three miles away she said lightly ah mouser raised an eyebrow joking she said mouser was careful to keep his neutral expression on his face im not much for jokes no you shouldnt be this is important work take good care of my baby she put a proprietary hand on the duffel bag and shell take good care of you it creeped him out a bit to hear her call a bomb a baby and the rest ready when you are she watched him with a bright interest maybe making bombs living on the constant edge of disaster made her eager for physical sensations for release he had no interest in complicating his life with a woman he had the mission he had appointed himself in life to him the mission was everything the government had to be shown for the beast incarnate that it was the ravager of liberty the ruination of hope the devil that destroyed what made america great that was all that mattered ill call you when its done he said ill watch it on the news and then the next stage she nodded but she didnt seem to care so much about the money she watched him with an intensity that made his stomach twist strange woman he thought but useful he got into his car and drove through the quiet streets spring break was this week freed from the mindnumbing indoctrination of government schools lots of kids played on the lawns riding bikes with those dorky helmets that the beast insisted they wear for their protection another emblem of its constant meddling one girl waved at him and he raised his hand in a brief wave honey im going to set you free he thought bring you a different world where the beast has broken legs and dulled claws mouser drove through houston the bomb sitting on the passenger seat the duffel bag wrapped in a cloth cover he listened to speeches he had written for himself on his cassette player and thought he needed to polish his metaphors a bit he spoke too much of purpose not enough of war he was firing the first carefully considered shot in a long war and the realization thrilled him to the bone more shots would come in the next couple of days the resting place for snows baby had been selected with great care a quiet bend close to the rail switch station in ripley texas forty miles northeast of houston ripley was a small town of two thousand people a few farmers and ranchers mostly bluecollar workers employed by the oil refineries and related service industries mouser had no specific quarrel with the people of ripley but he had no regard for them either theyd chosen to live in a dangerous place ripley lay in a small depression along the railway with a heavy growth of trees ringing the entire town the people of ripley could suffer the consequences of their poor planning he thought it had taken him weeks to find and select the right spot he wore a carefully chosen costume jeans a shirt with the logo of a railway freight line no jacket because he wanted the railways logo visible he walked along the railroad with a cell phone in his hand pressed to his ear laughing as though someone on the other end had told a joke the duffel bag was fashioned from camouflaged fabric painted to match the gray puzzle of stones along the rails he set the bag down close to the rail as he walked in view of the train station but no one saw him he put a foot on the rail and waited until he felt the barest vibration of the approaching train he walked across the grassy slide down to the road where his car was parked closing the phone that he wasnt looking at and glancing at his watch three minutes he guessed mouser got in the car no one had seen him no one had noticed him a pickup truck drove past him loud country music spilling from the windows two young men laughing on their way to an evening shift at the railway mouser liked the song they were playing he started to hum it under his breath he used to sing back in church when he was a kid and he had a fine tenor he drove away from ripley the farmtomarket road that led back to the highway the pavement threaded alongside the rail track a pickup truck with a bunch of young mexican workers in the bed shot past him then another car a minivan a harried mother at the wheel he could see she was yelling at the kids bouncing in the back you should take the time to tell them you love em lady mouser thought instead of yelling at them he heard the approaching train before he saw it a long low whistle of approach ripley was a scheduled stop a water treatment plant was nearby that served much of the northern stretches of suburban houston he pulled his cell phone back out dialed a number poised his finger over the button snow had given him a choice on the bomb timer or detonation through calling the phone hed picked calling the train wasnt impressively long just a stretch of old weathered rail cars each carrying tons of chlorine gas he pushed the car up to a hundred miles an hour counted down another minute and pressed send ashley barton drummed her fingers on the steering wheel the kids were wearing on her last nerve but the morning was nearly done thank god shed had her two boys and her sisters girl and theyd zoomed like little rockets she was exhausted as it was she would get home from the shopping trip to houston just in time to get a lunch of hot dogs and carrot sticks and an icecream sandwich in each kid park them in front of cartoon network while she could catch up on laundry and have a glass of iced tea and a moments delicious peace and quiet she aimed the air conditioning vent toward her face the day had grown warm and she felt sticky shed taken the kids to one of the big houston malls to get clothes where the kids begged her to buy toys for them she knew she was an easy mark shed let them pick out a toy each nothing too expensive though they were still paying for christmas give it back her sevenyearold kevin yelled behind her and she heard the familiar sound of a boyfist hitting a boyshoulder kevins hitting brandon her niece megan announced in a tired voice over those stupid trading cards megans tone made it clear what she thought of trading cards kevin she said glancing back at him we dont hit you dont but i do kevin said hes gonna tear my card mom brandon give him his card back kevin do not hit your brother if i have to get on yall again no dessert she drove past the ripley rail yard her own house was only two minutes away in the rearview mirror she saw kevin had his face pressed to the window glass watching the long freight train lumber into ripley kevin and trains hed been fascinated with them from when he was a toddler god that was only a few years ago they were getting so big so fast suddenly a roar pounded her ears the minivan bucked on the road and at first ashley thought shed blown a tire the sound of the derailment was deafening steel hammering onto steel metal tearing in a horrific screech she felt in her bones jesus she screamed then kevin was hollering and she braked to see that the windows were broken one of the back ones blown in glass dusting the kids the noise had been so loud she hadnt heard the shattering all three of the children screamed she stood on the brakes wrenched around in the seat the train derailed kevin screamed mom i saw it i saw it his forehead trickled blood from a cut megan kept shrieking brandon covered his face with his hands still clutching his brothers japanese game card ashley only had eyes for the children and she did not see the men in the rail yard some of them men she had gone to high school with to church with staggering dropping as they hurried toward the accordion of derailed tanks as though slapped down by an unseen fist mom it hurts kevin started to cough started to rub at his eyes what throat my throat kevin moaned and then ashley felt it too a terrible burning in the back of her throat her eyes her eyes her throat burned like matches had been jabbed into the skin a heavy smell like an ocean of bleach swamped her the children clawed at their eyes their mouths get out of here ashley thought something awful had been freed from the broken jumble of rail cars a haze blanketed the ground coiling the greenyellow of a snakes scales oh my god not my kids no she thought she managed to shift gears her eyes and nose and throat aflame nausea gutted her stomach her upper airway constricted like a fist closing she jammed the accelerator to the floor blinking and gasping through the agony ashley saw the turn to her house half a block away best sight in the world get home call wash the kids in the tub everything would be okay it would have to be okay she was dimly aware of people running on the streets running from the rail yard collapsing as she roared past them just get away get away get the kids inside this cant happen to us ashley barton took the turn too soon and far too fast fueled by her blind panic she missed the street and plowed through the front of a small liquor store she went through the windshield and she thought not happening not happening and then the pain was gone the screams were silent the explosion wasnt as loud as he thought it would be but then the bomb had to be calculated to precision big enough to rupture the chlorine tanks but not so powerful for extreme heat to oxidize the chlorine rendering most of the gas nontoxic or to burn up much of it the shape of snows charge was designed to puncture the tanks derailment was a given he could imagine the chaos in his minds eye everything within a thousand feet of the derailment site would be enveloped in a choking cloud of chlorine the cloud could expand if lucky to a mile and a half in width and with the boost from the wind carry close to eighteen miles twenty thousand people would be within the clouds path the beast would of course order evacuations fight like the wounded giant that it was but the death toll could easily be in the hundreds or even the thousands he smiled he hoped as a first shot this would prove a great success he drove fast on the empty road heading toward houston he had a gas mask but he didnt feel he needed it ripley was far enough behind and he was driving into the prevailing wind he drove south back to houston to snows house without calling because he thought the beast with its thousands of eyes would be tracking every cellular call made near ripley as part of the towns postmortem he listened to the radio the music interrupted by a news bulletin the increasingly frantic coverage and the order for immediate evacuation when he got back to snows house the yards were empty he saw cars filled with families heading out even though the cloud was far away and the wind wasnt moving the poison in this direction people panicked so easily he got out of the car breathed in the cool air and walked inside the house snow sat on her couch watching cnn eating pretzels and sipping a congratulatory beer he watched the coverage the panic the horror thinking i did that good for me she looked up at him i guess my baby delivered mouser had a sudden hunger to touch her throat feel the taste of her skin but he barely knew her so it would be wrong the mission first the mission always he went and got a glass of water only one car punctured by the blast she said watching the tv coverage a satellite image of the derailment was on the screen the cloud is going to be big theyre evacuating everyone within twenty miles he could see the dead by the rails on the streets of ripley he counted a dozen bodies as the cameras eye moved along the main drag he saw a wrecked minivan halfway in a storefront close to the rail yard a flipped pickup truck the chattering experts said the chlorine cloud was not likely to move south toward houston and heavy rain pushing in from the gulf would help ground the chlorine but the situation was already being labeled a chemical attack not simply an accident and the words alqaeda and terrorists were already on the commentators tongues alqaeda they always think of them first snow said my god mouser thought that was simple and cheap what blows to the beast could he inflict with real money money to last him for years now that he had proven his worth he nearly laughed in joy the doorbell rang snow glanced up at mouser you expecting anyone maybe my ex we broke up he might come here begging mouser pulled the gun went to the window answer the door move out of the way if you dont know em if its police im not being taken you she shook her head without hesitation mouser positioned himself snow answered the door i thought you were in washington snow said on the porch henry shawcross said we have a serious problem please tell us youre here to celebrate mouser said he knew it wasnt the case but he wasnt ready to let go of the euphoria he felt no my stepson has been kidnapped henry stood against the living room wall arms crossed exhaustion marked his face mouser sat on the edge of snows couch and i care why thats not our problem wrong lukes kidnapping affects everything the first wave and the hellfire attack henry told him about luke the demands of the kidnapper they want the fifty million for his safe return then no safe return they cant have it mouser said an absolute statement no room for discussion i am not going to let them kill my kid im not going to let them have our money mouser said and hes warren dantrys kid right a long pause a curled lip that told mouser henry was uncomfortable with mousers knowledge of his family mouser studied the professor in front of him henry always looked like he was running late for a lecture and he looked the same now except in his gaze an intense anger steamed yes he was warrens son henry folded his arms i think of him as my son now answer me one question do you have our money henry henry stared at him as though anticipating the sight of a gun or a knife no i tried to access the accounts the passwords have been changed all of mousers pride all his excitement over the mission well done the blow against the beast turned to ash you cant access the money snow asked as though she didnt understand not for you not for anyone in the night road henry crossed his arms i rushed back here as soon as i could so we can figure out what to do no no mouser lurched forward to seize henry henry raised a gun from under his own jacket mouser stopped stop we cant fight amongst ourselves whats done is done listen to me were going to fix this we have to move forward with the first wave and hellfire stays on schedule mouser stopped himself he wanted to strangle the life out of henry shawcross at that moment another betrayal thats all this was just like every other moment in his life where he approached greatness only to see his glory snatched away he forced calmness into his breath he felt the pressure of a hand on his shoulder he glanced behind him snow said was there any mention from the kidnapper about the first wave of attacks no or of hellfire her eyes were bright no so the kidnapper is interested in the fifty million not in stopping the attacks themselves henry said all right they asked for a ransom of our money what did you say mouser sat back down on the couch henry returned his gun to his jacket i wasnt willing to acknowledge that i had the money in case the conversation was being taped so you refused to ransom your own kid your loyalty is an inspiration i may have saved us all by doing so because i know who kidnapped luke who the banker who was in charge of setting up the financial accounts around the country for the fifty million is missing eric lindoe he hasnt been at his job in the past three days who could have shut you out of the accounts only eric only he and i had access mine is under a false name of course youre not making sense henry if eric lindoe took the money he has no reason to kidnap your stepson snow said in an even tone she kept her grip on mousers shoulder and he shrugged it off i think there is a simple explanation if eric was just a common embezzler then he could simply steal the money and try to hide from us there would be no reason to involve luke if the government the beast as you so charmingly say mouser has discovered us and turned eric against us again there would be no need to kidnap my son the fbi would freeze the funds arrest eric and arrest me try to force your names and those of everyone in the night road from me and they would care about stopping the attacks and then stopping hellfire they wouldnt have the money as a focus we face contradictory facts ergo we must follow a third alternative eric wants everyone us and our enemy to think he doesnt have the money and our enemy is not the government ergo so who mouser asked mocking our enemy wants the fifty million for themselves it might be someone in the night road turning traitor against us although no one in the group knows that eric is our banker only i know him so i believe its an outsider who has discovered the existence of the fifty million and knows we can hardly report the theft of it to the police but why would eric ask for a ransom that you couldnt pay if he knew you couldnt access the accounts snow asked a sharpness like a newforged knifes shone in her words whats the point the point of the ransom may have been to get me to agree to pay the money get me on tape acknowledging that i knew about the money blackmail me maybe our enemy grabbed eric couldnt get the money from him if he had changed the access codes to protect the money he lied that he had no access to the money and so the enemy panicked and grabbed luke or had eric grab luke thinking i could still deliver the funds and eric let the enemy think he didnt have the funds but this is all theory you mean we cant even confirm if our money is still in the accounts mouser said in a cold whisper no not without knowing what the passwords are now he took my name off and changed the access im sure hes hidden the funds with that much money eric can hide forever he can buy serious protection how could he hes an officer at the bank he could manipulate the system to hide the money in a hundred places i have one of our hackers trying to break into the banks database so we can see if and where the money was transferred but hes had zero success mouser began to pace a cold fury moving his legs without the money hellfire doesnt happen everything weve worked for doesnt happen every risk weve taken wasted i want to aim you at the problem under one condition henry said what no harm comes to my stepson he cant know about us henry not unless he joins us i will deal with him but you will not harm him he could be very valuable to us after a moment mouser nodded we need to find eric and we need to find luke how ive got a night road contact working on hacking the gps system on lukes car see where it is see where its been then i want you to go find luke and stash him somewhere so i can talk to him failing that or if theyve killed him find his kidnappers i will work on locating eric snow said you turned down their ransom demand theyll have killed him they wont give up on fifty million just because i said no the first time they might conclude i was worried about being taped or trapped theyll let me squirm then send lukes finger to me or an ear henry stopped a moment to steady his voice to prove the channels of negotiation are still open all right i am going to return to washington ill let you know what the hacker finds on lukes car you are not to harm luke and if you find his kidnapper keep him alive for questioning do you understand me im taking an extra risk here mouser said and youll be rewarded with a greater share of money for your cause and glory i need backup ill go with you snow said mouser made a noise in his throat lowered his voice no offense but youre a techhead a bomb maker im a soldier same as you snow said i know how to fight and fight hard and no one is going to derail hellfire no one not after all the work ive done i risked my life every day for weeks to build the bombs i would rather you stay here mouser said youve got more work to do for hellfire let me help you we can make quick work of finding these people together henry said i agree with snow ill call you as soon as i know something you sure got here quick mouser said maybe you took the money fed us this story and youre walking off with it he put his hand back on his gun i wouldnt have built the night road if i was going to betray it henry said i have to be back in washington immediately i can hitch a ride back on a friends plane he shook mousers hand snows hand were off to a brilliant start today well get the money back well make hellfire happen he stood leveled a look at them both take care of luke no harm to him i have your word henry left he must be scared to death he could have told us this over the phone better to tell us face to face snow said especially since hes asking you to save his kid mouser considered you have a point disappointment is always easier in person you want something to eat im hungry gonna make me a sandwich snow said mouser shook his head she went into the kitchen he sat on the edge of the couch and thought how hed sunk from the joy of the bombing to the anger of the missing money rescue a snotnosed grad student who had been taught in the beasts taxfunded universities where his mind had been poisoned to think the beasts system was good and noble did henry honestly think hed let the kid live if the kidnappers knew about the night road then they were all at risk and luke dantry was just an unfortunate witness a risk he walked back into the living room snow had opened him a beer left it for him on the coffee table she was watching the coverage from ripley i might have put too much oomph in the baby ruptured two tanks for sure they say now but a lot of the chlorine mustve burned off its given them time to evacuate more people ripleys served its purpose drawn the beasts stare right where we want it to be she glanced at him poetic mouser made a face at the idea of being poetic and she laughed quietly he ignored it i need to crash here guest rooms down the hall she put her eyes back to the television screen you sure you can help me if we run into trouble i can be whatever life needs me to be snow said watching the dying town on the television not looking at him youre gonna kill his kid mouser didnt answer and that was answer enough henry shawcross did not take a commercial flight back to washington as he had the day before rather he returned to washington the same way hed flown down this morning he went to the airport and boarded a travport freight cargo jet by flashing an id and drivers license that confirmed him as a travport consultant entitled to fly at a moments notice on any of the carriers flights domestic or international he sat in one of the few passenger seats watched the plane fly over east texas he would be home in a few hours whats wrong with you luke had screamed give them what they want his stepsons pleas tore at his chest but he had to keep his heart of stone i will get you back he thought i will get you back and i will make you understand luke he used the planes internet connection to watch the news coverage of the chlorine disaster in ripley the most visible attack so far in the first wave the bomb had burned up more of the gas than it should have but it had gotten the worlds attention security was being raised at chemical plants and railway stations and airports analysts pontificated on news stations as to whether it was an alqaeda attack or another jihadist group or a domestic terrorist or an accident every chemical facility in the country would be on heightened alert too many cities too many water treatment plants had massive stores of lethal chlorine and henry had thought long that it was a terrible weakness of american infrastructure he had written a paper about such a threat a month ago he checked his email now his paper held an urgency it had not a month before hed been proven smart and in tune with terrorist thinking he was being flooded with requests from new and old clients on how to deal with the threat and what the next threat might be he smiled fleetingly for the first time since lukes ransom call it was all a delicious prelude to hellfire very different from the first time hed written a paper about the possibility of a major terrorist attack and been ignored and jeered he had been right then he was making sure he was right now now he had struck made his point and all the governments resources would go to stop a repeat occurrence which was perfect henry arrived in dc picked up his car drove for an extra hour to be sure he wasnt being followed and went home he waited for another ransom call he was prepared to talk this time he knew what he would say that could shield him if the call was taped he kept calling eric lindoe no answer he did not want to call the prince hed met in the london park three days before and explain that the fifty million was missing it would be an immediate death sentence unless he ran but if he ran luke was dead he got up paced his floors he listened to bach to mahler to settle his mind to try and determine what he could do he tried to distract his mind by going back through lukes night road database reading the postings luke had made while playacting at extremism marveling at the discussions hed had with the lost brilliant work the young man had done complete insightful using everything hed learned about the emotional needs of extremists to connect with them even through the looking glass of the internet he had been nearly a perfect spy for henry henry had wept twice in his adult life first when his wife lukes mother died in a car accident that never should have been now he wiped a tear from his eyes when he thought about luke stupid weakness he told himself you didnt even like him at first or his mother youre weak you cannot care you cannot but he did didnt the prince have a family didnt mouser why should he be alone it was unfair just as so much of his life had been a constant unyielding thorn of unfairness on the ongoing television coverage he watched the bodies laying forlorn in the streets of ripley film taken from helicopters and he felt nothing he saw a minivan crashed near the train depot a boys body a few feet from the wreck and he thought of luke he slept fitfully at his desk the phone by his head he forgot to eat when the phone rang nearly a full day after the first ransom demand he grabbed it so hard that he nearly flung it across the room he forced himself to gain control before he spoke yes it was the hacker that he had asked to break into the gps database your sons bmw has been parked near the dallasfort worth airport for the past day where was it before from when it was at the austin airport the gps tracker followed it to houston it stopped at two addresses i can give them to you henry scribbled down the addresses he called up the addresses on his computer while the hacker continued to talk then it departed to an area outside a small town in east texas called braintree the coordinates match that of a rental cabin stayed parked there for nearly twenty minutes then proceeded to the dfw airport arriving at am a nowhere town called braintree why would a kidnapper after fifty million go to some rental cabin deep in the piney woods stashing luke perhaps or killing him and burying him among the pines the thought made henrys throat go dry the addresses in houston were for a parking lot and then a bank he thanked the hacker the doorbell rang again ten minutes later as he hung up from talking to mouser and giving him the information on the braintree cabin henry opened the door to find a reporter and a television camera standing on his porch the young woman shoved the microphone into his face and henry froze mr shawcross we need a comment from you everyone was dead luke knew it as soon as he opened his eyes he stood in the back of the private jet and began to walk through the small cabin the whine of the engines racing to nowhere was the only sound his fathers friends lay slumped in their seats faces blue jaws slack one had his fingers tucked into his collar as though the fabric had strangled him with a nooselike tightness luke wasnt breathing either he could see frost coating the inside of the jets windows he tried to wipe it away with his fingertips if he knelt he could see out the glass an endless smear of the atlantic below no land in sight the medal his father gave him the avenging angel burned with cold fury against his chest a ghost plane everyone dead a flight to nowhere he stood from the iceshrouded window that looked out over the empty sea the door to the cockpit was closed between him and the door stood a man in a mechanics uniform ace beere he was short redfaced pathetic you killed them all you sabotaged the plane you took my dad for no reason for every reason ace beere said he tapped his temple marred by a bullet wound luke pushed past him his father and the pilots would be in the cockpit they would be okay not dead like everyone out here he opened the door dad he called the cockpit was empty gone the ocean rushing at him like a wall luke jerked awake he thought for a moment he was on that ghost plane flying with its suffocated corpses over the ocean until its fuel was gone but it was just a dream he was in a far worse situation as he moved his arms and heard the clink of the chains and remembered he was bound to the cabin bed trapped in a death just like his father had been far from everyone he loved beyond rescue except his father had no chance luke was going to have to make his own luck betrayed that sonofabitch henry betrayed me the thought cut like a knife in lukes mind for most of the morning luke had slept exhaustion driven by the long dance with adrenaline put a stronger claim on him than fear he awoke in the late afternoon bleary from his nightmare twentysix hours after eric kidnapped him his stomach knotting in hunger and thunder blaring outside the windows he felt a childish urge to cry a clutching in his jaw and his chest and he kept it at arms distance until it passed he tested the chains again as though their strength had weakened while he slept and then he dozed some more when he awoke the rain dropped to a steady hiss a white noise that allowed him to think the chain cuffs were blistertight against his wrists and ankles he found enough give in the chains to allow him to sit up on the mattress and stand up next to the bed he examined the room the metal bed was pushed close to the wall and bolted to the wooden floor the shackles were attached to the iron bed not the wall under the bed sat a small plastic container he opened it it was a chemical toilet it needed emptying but he felt a sudden relief that he wouldnt have to soil himself or his bed crumpled peanut butter cracker wrappers and an empty water bottle were also under the bed under the heavily draped window a table stood on it was a small lamp casting an anemic glow on the hardwood floor a plain wooden chair another door was in a corner maybe leading to a closet he couldnt get close to it henrys betrayal echoed in his head i cant help you im going to hang up now henry could have lied he could have stalled he didnt he left luke at his kidnappers mercy henry was a judas of the basest sort and when luke tried to summon an excuse for his stepfather he could not so what would happen next the possibilities were few the british woman jane might come here either to get rid of him or to try and force a change of heart from henry she might prove she meant business with violence the other possibility was that no one was going to find him no one was coming and a slow lonely death from dehydration and starvation awaited him in the coming days or weeks how long would it take him to die luke had to find a way to escape he checked his pockets he still had his wallet and he dumped the contents on the bed texas drivers license fortyone dollars a visa card he used often another mastercard for emergencies a university of texas graduate student id and against his chest the cool of the saint michaels medal his fathers last promise of protection so much for promises nothing to use against the locks he got up from the bed and pulled hard on its metal frame it didnt budge he inspected the four legs of the bed three were bolted down tightly but one the left rear was a bit loose barely he noticed heel scuffs marring the wall aubrey hadnt just laid here waiting for her knight to come rescue her shed tried to kick the bed loose luke inspected the slightly loosened screw shed gotten it to give way from the floor just a hair not much the screw was a crosshatch philipsstyle he put the corner of the credit card in it tried to turn gently so the plastic wouldnt shred careful he felt eagerness a cousin to panic rise up his arm and he smothered the urge to hurry the screw wouldnt budge the plastic wasnt stiff enough to turn it he tried the drivers license same result he needed something stronger he had to look at the room with new eyes seeing everything as a potential tool but there was nothing panic churned in him and then he noticed the lamp lots of parts bulb base cord plug it was a good six feet away and he could see where it was plugged into the wall luke stood and took two steps from the bed that was close as he could get so he needed to get the lamp closer to him he had an idea luke tore the blankets and sheets from the bed he knotted them into a long rope with the care of a boy scout testing for a badge he doublechecked the knots then slowly fed the improvised rope thick and awkward through his hands he lay on the chilly hardwood floor and stretched as far from the bed as he could his feet remained on the bed the chains would not give farther he whipped the sheetrope hard toward the table he wanted to snag a table leg with the other end of the rope back in his hands first try it missed he tried again putting more snap into his wrist missed he realized he needed the heavier section the blanket whipping toward the table leg the sheet was too light he reversed his makeshift rope his arms ached he threw the rope again missed again his arms felt dense as stone missed tried again the makeshift rope caught the right front leg of the table part of it uturning past the leg back toward him but out of reach he got to his feet and picked up the little side table next to the bed he smashed it against the wall and jumped on the legs splintering them from the base he picked up a leg that had a bent nail sticking from its end holding the leg he reached for the edge of the makeshift rope that was wrapped back toward him he wanted to grab the blanket so he could pull the table toward him he pretzeled his body to reach as far as the chains would let him he turned the leg so the tip would face the blanket the cabin was cool from the rain but sweat poured down his back he didnt know how else he could drag the table toward him if this didnt work he aimed the leg with its nail tip toward the blanket rope the nail caught an edge of the blanket he let out a tense sigh he ached as though pushing a truck up a hill he began to pull the blanket back toward him using the jerryrigged table legs the nail trapped in the blanket made a light hiss as he dragged it across the hardwood soon he had both ends of the blanketrope in his hands slowly he began to tug at the rope the table with the lamp atop it began to inch away from the window he drew the table three feet nearer and the lamps cord went taut he stopped he stood holding the broken table leg with its bent crown of nail he leaned as far as he could the nail caught the edge of the lampshade and came free he tried again pulling the lampshade toward him every muscle straining against his chains the lamp tottered and it fell to the floor darkness but he saw as the light died where the lamp fell he groped in the dark used the nail to catch the lampshade now on the floor he could feel the counter tension of the lamps power cord still mired in the outlet if the lamps cord broke he was finished the lampshade crumpled but he kept pulling on the top of the lamp he heard the plug fall to the wooden floor breathless he pulled the cord toward him his fingertips caressed the narrow edges of the plugs metal tips thin and strong luke inched to the bed leg groping in the dark he wedged the plug against the groove in the bolt the screw turned he fought down the hammer in his heart he worked with the calm of a jeweler setting a tiny stone dont rush dont lose patience he pulled the first screw free it worked four screws on each base of the cots legs sixteen screws total fifteen to go he worked steadily in the darkness without panic he unscrewed the first leg and worked the chain loose moved to the second now the back legs of the bed were both free he started on the third leg then the fourth his fingertips felt raw and with the last leg removed he shivered in relief he staggered to the far wall the chains still on his ankles and wrists but free from the bed the barest glimmer of light began to touch the edge of the curtains flashlights whoever was coming would hear him running with the clinking shackles he remembered eric had taken the keys to unlock the shackles from underneath the flowerpot god only knew if eric or aubrey had returned them if he went out the front door whoever was coming would see him he opened the rooms door shuffled toward the back door he tested it locked he undid the deadbolt eased the door open and waddled out trying to keep the chains silent he closed the door behind him the night lay heavy and dark against the trees the rain had stopped and the wind hissed in the pines luke could hear voices and footsteps on gravel a man a woman for a crazy moment he thought eric and aubrey had returned but too much time had passed and they had been far too anxious to escape and leave him to his fate heres the problem with blowing up casinos the man said a bit of complaint in his voice its mostly going to affect just one industry no the woman said it makes entertainment venues likely targets theres a trickledown effect to theme parks movie houses resorts they clearly werent cops coming to rescue him blowing up casinos sounded like a plan hatched by one of his night road buddies his heart boomed in his chest luke heard another mumbled cursing from the woman and then the key working the lock the front door opening luke ran along the edge of the house toward the front door clutching the chains closer to him he lay in the dirt close to the cabin risked a look around the corner the front door was open and light came from the rectangle of the door the flowerpot had been moved from its base maybe the keys to the shackles were still there waiting for henry if hed changed his mind about the ransom he stood slowly trying to see if he could spot a silvery glint on the step were screwed he heard the woman say she had a low raspy voice or maybe he was never here someone was chained to that bed he dismantled it we better report in the man answered in a heavy baritone hes in chains he cant have gotten far she said her tone was like an echo in a cave of wet stone maybe someone came and collected him whoever grabbed him changed their mind took him again no mouser he heard the woman say they wouldve just unlocked him or killed him on the bed luke pulled an escape trick he heard a foot kick at the broken desk mouser and this woman knew lukes name luke put his eye back to the cabins corner it wouldnt take them long to search the upstairs and the downstairs maybe just a couple of minutes hed have a few seconds alone with the keys if they were still under the flowerpot then he could run like hell vanish into the woods the woman stepped out onto the front step she was tall thin wearing jeans from the light inside the cabin he could see a crown of dyed white hair and a thin tracery of scar along her jawline she held a gun in her hand and a flashlight in the other she walked toward the woods away from him luke would wait for the trees to swallow the woman and then hed hurry and retrieve the keys to the chains if they were there at least get his legs free then he could run she stepped into the heavy darkness of the trees he turtled toward the flowerpot trying to move quietly enough where the crinkle of the chains sounded like the wind nuzzling the pines luke knelt by the flowerpot he heard the man call out from deep inside the house theres food in the fridge he tipped over the flowerpot the keys to the shackles were gone behind him the woman called youre not very smart are you i guess not luke stood and faced her the woman wasnt even bothering to point the gun at him she walked close to him and aimed the flashlight into his face dont take it the wrong way im amazed you even got halfway free so close he thought he noticed she wasnt aiming the gun at him and wondered if she even considered him a threat in a flash he thought youve studied these people but youve never faced them this is different than reading a book or a loudmouth posting on the web you cant analyze them you just have to fight them because you know what theyre like singleminded brutal reasoning hadnt worked with eric it wouldnt work with these two luke felt the quiet scholar in him easing backward something new and primal emerging mouser hes out here still in chains looks like hes auditioning for a christmas carol she laughed a glassy sick giggle he looks like jacob marley cmere schoolboy luke jumped at her hammering into her before she could lift the gun shoving the flashlight so it smacked her in the face he fell to the grass with her and lassoed a length of the chain around her neck she swung the gun at him nailing him in the head but he was tall and strong and desperate he got her in front of him the chain a choker across her throat he knocked her down pried the gun from her fingers as he yanked her back to her feet the man mouser rushed into the doorway he aimed his gun at lukes head let her go no she comes with me his voice broke like a teenage boys luke put the gun on her head the chain was a twisted braid in his left fist the gun in his right hand dont think just do mouser lowered the gun and luke saw the gesture for what the womans laughter was a sign of contempt this couple werent remotely afraid of him not even with him having a gun so you stay there luke said to him all right luke dantry mouser said were here from your stepdad here to help you find out who took you youre not the police luke said no were better dont be a stupid kid let her go and well call him but they were talking about bombing casinos and resorts i just want the keys to these shackles luke said you dont know what a can of kickass you just opened up on yourself mouser sat on the porch step with a sign of anticipation ready for the show to begin it was not what luke expected where are the keys he yelled the woman began to choke and he realized how tight the chain was across her throat he eased his grip but barely im going to obliterate you the woman said snow means what she says mouser added where are the keys luke yelled again at mouser he tightened the chain again the woman pointed at mouser his pocket toss the keys to her luke said mouser didnt stand snow how you want to go here give him the keys snow said whatever you say mouser lumbered to his feet dug in his pockets and tossed the keys snow caught them deftly unlock me the feet first you think youre smart because you escaped from a bed she unlocked the chains binding his feet her skin was cool against his ankles he pulled her back straight to him she didnt resist he kicked the shackles free be still and ill unlock your hands she said then well play for real schoolboy if he lowered the chain from her throat she could fight him even with the gun their confidence was daunting he tightened the chain around her throat again just enough to pull her close not quite yet luke said lets walk to your car mouser has the car keys car keys he called no mouser said come on snow enough lets get going before the sky opens up again snow stayed still i just wanted to see what hed try what hed do its like watching a hamster work a maze im going to shoot you is what ill do luke said then shoot she said her calm was maddening i i need you alive for now you come with me to the car and well be hotwiring it she asked you saw that in a movie right schoolboy come on he gave the chains a harder pull than he meant to and she gagged for every second of pain you cause me i will give you an hour of it the icy tone of her promise chilled his skin he shouldnt be afraid of her but he was maybe he doesnt have the keys to toss me maybe you do he said in a harsh whisper in her ear you mouse mouser whatever you stay on the porch i see you come off i shoot her how you want to play it snow he asked again the rain started again hissing in the pines thunder booming in the distance do as he says snow said they hurried backward down the long path toward where he and eric had come through the gate the rain boomed out of the clouds thick again mud sucked at their shoes darkness drank them up except when the lightning flashed in the wet heavens luke blinked trying to keep sight of mouser looking back over his shoulder toward the gate the metal chains grew slick in his grasp from sweat or rain empty your pockets i dont shut up prove to me you dont have the keys pull out your pockets snow made a little grunt of anger and jammed her hand into her pocket she stumbled against the gun and he pulled the gun away from her head suddenly she lashed her head back to catch him in the face he tottered and she pivoted and powered him into the mud the hand holding the gun slid deep into the muck she wrenched free of the chains nearly breaking his arm she aimed a brutal kick at his head but he rolled and caught it on the upper back he raised the mudglopped gun but she knocked it free from his hand with a savage and precise kick the gun was gone no gun she was screaming for mouser he lashed the chains at her face she ducked back and fell and he turned and ran away from the gate from the glow of the automatic light into the raindrenched blackness the grass rolled down a slight incline toward a dense grove of pines he dodged around the trees the faint glimmer from the gate lights receded he had no light for his path except the inconstant slash of lightning he stumbled and fell ran ten more feet into a pine the bark scraping his cheek lightning again showed him an opening in the growth and he ran toward it he spotted the silvery barbs of a wire fence he eased below the bottom strand sliding in the mud slicking him from head to foot luke stumbled past the fence and back into a stretch of unpaved road roads led eventually to people he tried to get his bearings to his right the road bent into the darkness where hed run from to his left the road went straight toward civilization he ran hard to the left grateful for the clean smooth unobstructed line he was tired of dodging pines he ran aware of nothing but the bright pain in his legs and the pounding in his chest and the chains weighing his arms down suddenly headlights exploded into life behind him a loud growl of tires speeding engine revving the lights low to the ground cut across him pushing him to run faster as if the light had weight the car accelerated toward him he powered hard to the right a gully cut down along the side of the road topped by another wire fence the car couldnt go across the gully he slid down into the mossywet ditch hauled himself up the side and skidded under another wire fence the pine growth was heavy here the rain strengthened the wind rose he bounced off the trees trying to run as fast as he could he roped the chains around his arms to silence their clinking he could hear the sound of pursuit behind him moving past the trees running suddenly a flashlight sparked on caught his shoulders in its glow as he ran up to a jumble of fallen pines he slid under the brush and where his leg had just been he heard a pop like a bullet but it couldnt fly straight not in this rain a scream gelled in his throat and he moaned it away he scrabbled into the earth and slid under the pyramid of tumbled fallen pine trunks there was a narrow passageway formed by nature hoping to god he wasnt sliding into a dead end or a rattlers nest he saw an opening slithered through it staggered to his feet he ran for several more minutes before he collapsed against a heavy trunk gasping nearly drunk with exhaustion he heard an engine ahead of him soaked to the skin he followed the fading roar a minute later he stumbled out into another road paved a painted line gleamed on the center under a heavy cover of incessant rain a highway or farmtomarket road in the far distance he saw red taillights a car inching into another lane because of a dark shape huddled on the roads shoulder someone pulled over because of the torrential rain he ran toward the shape a semi tractortrailer he was twenty feet away when the trucks blinkers flashed and the truck inched forward heading back onto the road no he thought he had to get out of here now or they would kill him the back of the truck read winged feet transportation houstonbeaumonttyler the trucks left wheels turned onto the asphalt luke ran every muscle in his body screaming the trucks back was now ten feet away from him the pavement slick he stumbled nearly fell stayed on his feet he grabbed the back door of the semi and hauled himself onto the heavy metal bumper he stood on it and looked for a way to open the trucks doors he found the handle but it was locked it didnt matter as long as he was getting away from his pursuers he pressed his face close to the wet metal of the trucks doors steadied his feet on the wide metal bumper that served as a step into the vehicle he looped the chains around the doors handle an improvised safety belt his arms felt like jelly he considered signaling the truck but then the driver would stop and if they stopped mouser and snow might catch them better simply to get away the truck eased its speed slowly up to a cautious forty luke guessed and the wind and the rain plucked at him his own breathing boomed in his ears he shivered against the metal doors he heard a whoosh then another and the truck rocked in the wake of sudden hard surge of air two other trucks passing in the opposite direction how many minutes had he piggybacked ten twenty his legs ached crouched on the bumper lashed to the handle trying to keep his balance if he fell hed break his neck maybe his pursuers were still hunting him in the woods blissfully ignorant that he was gone speeding away on winged feet his arms screamed in pain he couldnt keep this up forever maybe it was time to signal the trucker he sensed the approaching lights behind him he looked behind him and saw headlights low to the ground not a truck a sedan the lights were racing toward him with the awful certain intensity of a snake slithering close its unbroken gaze a hypnosis it couldnt be them luke told himself at the worst the cars driver would signal the trucker and end lukes free ride the sedan veered up close to the trucks rear as though inspecting the odd big bug clutching the trucks door a mercedes the mercedes swung up closer the pulse of the trucks brakes jostled him the hiss of tires slowing on pavement the trucker gave a warning tap on his brakes the sedan slowed a fraction cut around the trucks corner and sped up the side through the curtain of rain as the car passed luke saw snow staring at him smiling then the mercedes was gone out of sight revving toward the trucks cab veering into the opposite lane to pass theyre going to cut him off force him to pull over luke realized but the truck was speeding far too fast for him to jump he inched along the bumper trying to get a view around the trucks corner the mercedes winged close to the trucks cabin snows window down her hand waving at the trucker to slow the truck slowed rocked then picked up its speed maybe the trucker didnt like what he saw snow looked crazy as hell with that sickening grin maybe he had valuable cargo and he just wasnt inclined to pull over in the middle of nowhere because another driver gestured at him he glanced around the corner again the mercedes swung out onto the opposite shoulder as another truck traveling the opposite direction barreled past horns blaring over the growl of the storm lukes arms seized in bonedeep cramps his muscles knotted in pain he eased the chains out of the door handles held onto the handles themselves and tested the locked doors again in blind desperation if only he could have gotten inside the doors squeezed inside mouser and snow would have never found him he heard the crack of a shot the truck lurched convulsed and nearly threw luke to the pavement he gripped the handles and braced his feet hard against the bumper the truck veered off the road it rocked and surged as pines and oaks snapped in its path a thick trunk splintered flying past luke in a cloud of pulverized wood and pine needles the truck rocketed down an incline and to his left he saw the beginning of a bridge rising past him the truck plummeted smashing down through the trees as the speed slowed luke put his face to the metal as spears of mud flew past him the jackknifing came with a wrench and if hed kept the chains looped in the door handle the force would have torn his arms from their sockets he tried to time the jump in a flash of pure instinct but the crash was chaos youll be crushed under the rig he thought and then the rig broke free and threw him he cartwheeled past the edge of the crumpling trailer air he opened his eyes falling and saw the swelling river beneath him rushing toward him water cold beyond reason and dark earth his shoulder scraped the rivers stony bottom he kicked toward the surface broke into air just long enough for a gulp then the chains weighed him down fire heat surging through the river like a pulse the current yanked him forward the force of a blast pushed him into sweet oxygen again and he saw gray sky dawn fighting to pierce the clouds then the maddened river took him luke kicked to the surface as the river swept him downstream sinking again fighting to rise he rode the rivers raging current for what seemed an eternity it was a constant ordeal to keep head above water to breathe he gathered the chains close around him terrified they would snag on rock or sunken tree and yank him downward to death the weight of the chains was like hands pulling him down to the sleeping depths a sudden bend in the river twisted ahead of him and the current battered him into the shallows cypress and pine lining the banks then he spun away he struggled tried to swim the river hurried him close to shore again and he spotted a black shape toppled into the water a rotting tree branches stuck out like spikes luke gathered the last of his strength and tossed the chain over one of the trunks branches he stopped he could breathe he lay in the water head above the surge greedy for air slowly he pulled himself close to the tree he used the chains to loop onto branches closer to shore and he collapsed onto the cold mud he became aware of a fresh onslaught of rain the pain in his arms in his chest brought him back to his senses he got to his feet slowly and staggered into the heavy growth along the bank arches of cypress and pine spread above him sheltering him from the worst of the downpour behind him the river was sick with rain beige with muddy runoff chunks of white floated in the brown water packages of shrimp and fish fresh from the gulf the trucks cargo theyll be looking for you he hurried up the rolling incline that led from the river and staggered into the deep cover of the pines please god he thought let the trucker have gotten out alive luke headed away from both river and road and deeper into the woods as he walked he took an inventory of himself pants caked with mud shirt torn open buttons gone ripped by the force of the river he glanced down the silver of the saint michael medal glinted on his chest thank god he thought he hadnt lost it hed lost one shoe and sock but the mud felt soothing against his foot his wallet and money were back in the cabin his wrists were bloodied and scored raw from the shackles he walked listened for the sounds of pursuit but heard only the soft hammering of the rain mouser and snow were from the night road it existed as a vicious force beyond his database of potential malcontents it was real he was convinced of it their talk of casinos being bombed his mind spun they said they were from his stepfather it didnt make any sense they couldnt be from henry and also from the night road the realization hit him like a stone dropped from the clouds could henry be involved with the night road it didnt seem possible but henry refusing to ransom him didnt seem possible either who is your client for this project hed asked henry what are you doing with this research henry had smiled and dodged and maybe bribed him with a lucrative job offer to stop him from asking questions luke had given him the discussiongroup postings and the names and a way to contact hundreds of people who might be extremists hed handed them to henry on a plate god only knew who his client really was he had to find a phone call the police suddenly he stumbled into a clearing in the pines a tidy little cottage stood in the glooming rain white paint a back porch that faced the river a swing and wicker chairs empty of cushions a small fishing pier jutted into the river he ran to the cottages back door and knocked but there was no answer the curtains were drawn on all the windows he listened at the glass no sound came from within he walked around the porch on the other side was a small onecar garage a dirt road driveway leading down to it from a paved road and a tool shed a lock bolted the tool shed door shut he got a rock from the flowerbeds and smashed down on the lock with four jackhammer blows but the lock held he ran back to the cottage his conscience made him hesitate at breaking and entering but he was desperate and this was his new reality he had to adjust to it he broke the window no screech of an alarm accompanied the tinkling glass he fingered the lock twisted it and stumbled inside he shivered and turned on the central heating it vroomed to life and the vents perfumed the air with a dusty burnt smell the cottage was well furnished someones riverside weekend getaway he decided he wanted food a shot of whiskey to warm him and to be out of his filthy sopping clothes but most of all he wanted to be free of the shackles he searched the kitchen and in a drawer he found a ring of keys he hurried back out to the tool shed and tried the keys the third opened the lock chalked with dust from his earlier attempts the orderly wall held a nice array of tools he saw what he needed a power drill nestled in its charger he inserted the drills bit into the lock he had to hold the drill at an awkward angle it revved to life and bit into the locks mechanism metal ground hissed and began to shred the shackles shook dancing to the bits beat and the lock gave way he uncuffed his right hand and felt the delicious feeling of the weight dropping away his skin under the cuffs was raw bloodied swollen he freed his left hand in short order luke put the tools back into place and relocked the tool shed door he threw the shackles into the kitchen trashcan no phone in the kitchen he searched the rest of the vacation home found two bedrooms two bathrooms and a den and no phone bizarre but this was a world choking on cell phones so maybe the owners didnt feel the need for a landline for their weekend house he went back to the curtained window no sign of pursuit no snow or mouser emerging from the dripping pines he was safe but god knew for how long he kept the lights off he stripped off his ruined clothes and stood in the stinging spray of the shower he scrubbed himself raw hating to leave the reviving heat of the water when he was done he wrapped a towel around himself in the master bedroom closet he found mens clothes luke was sixtwo and the mans jeans were surprisingly a bit too long and too wide in the waist but better he decided than too small he found a gray longsleeve tshirt a flannel shirt and a jacket he found no shoes but galoshes he put them on with a pair of white socks he found in case he had to leave quickly in the bathroom he slathered antibacterial gel on his hurt hands and wrapped them with gauze he looked like he was hiding an attempt at slashed wrists but he felt human again the medicine cabinet held a few prescription bottles in the name of olmstead he was hiding in the olmsteads house he hoped the olmsteads were nice understanding people a sharp sudden hunger dulled for long hours by adrenaline punched his stomach he hadnt eaten since lunch the day he dropped henry off at the airport which felt like a lifetime ago he found scant offerings in the fridge a jar of strawberry jam expired containers of milk and sour cream a few bottles of beer in the pantry he found peanut butter and canned vegetables and soups in the freezer were several packages of steak a loaf of bread and two vegetarian pizzas the steak would take too long he heated tomato soup and put one of the pizzas in the oven he stood over the soup the mist of it warming his face and in the distance under the fading thunder he heard the chopchopchop of a helicopter there and gone by the time he got to the window he clicked on the television while he drank the hot soup surfed to a twentyfour hour texasbased news channel the heavy rains drenching east texas and western louisiana were the lead story apparently thered been a derailment of a train carrying chemicals in the small town of ripley and a massive chlorine leak and the rainstorms had helped ground the poison thirty dead hundreds hurt the entire town and everything around it for twenty miles temporarily evacuated but the storm had stopped the threat of course whether this was an accident or as some sources on the scene have suggested a bombing of the rail line itself to cause the leak a bombing and here were mouser and snow talking about bombings luke sank to his knees before the tv the soup tasteless in his mouth the story went back to the wider effects of the wideranging rainstorms two people drowned in lufkin another swept away in longview and a dramatic truck crash near braintree they went to an aerial shot of a semi junked in an engorged river the truck driver was missing a search was underway missing please be okay he thought please but he knew from the shot from the force of the crash that it was a forlorn hope he ran to the sink and waited for the wave of nausea to pass he looked up at the screen as the anchor returned a brutal street shooting near downtown houston is caught on an atm machines camera and the stepson of the leader of a prominent political thinktank is implicated cut to a reporter standing in the rainsoaked morning daylight of the bank parking lot where eric had gunned down the homeless man cut to a grainy tape aimed at the banks parking lot he saw his own bmw roar into focus his own face closer to the camera as he slammed on the brakes to cut off the guy running toward the atm then luke lurched toward eric who could not be seen clearly the bmw jerked out of the cameras shot then returned as it exited the lot past the dead man the license plate grainy but visible the police must have enhanced the footage to read the plate the car used in the shooting is registered to luke dantry of austin stepson of noted political thinktank president henry shawcross dantry is described as sixfoottwo brown hair blue eyes slim build age twentyfour a masters candidate in psychology at the university of texas the camera cut to his drivers license picture a soft smile on his face hed never liked the photo but now he looked like one of those people who try to look too sincere and fail the car was found abandoned at a parking lot near the dallasfort worth airport dantry received a speeding ticket outside mirabeau a few hours before the shooting where it was reported by the officer that he was not alone in the car dantrys stepfather had this to say last night then cut to henry gaunt and pensive as though hed aged ten years i hope my stepson will immediately turn himself in to the authorities luke is a good kid who has made a few unfortunate choices in his past luke if you can hear this just turn yourself in thats for the best henry blinked wetly into the camera then cut to some jerk who lived in the condo below him dantry is kind of a loner he didnt say much to people didnt socialize you know but i guess i never thought hed shoot someone then with a shake of his head he should have been smarter not to do it in front of a camera grad students arent known for common sense he never liked that neighbor a little snot who hed had to ask to turn down his stereo several times being branded a loner on national television stung its what the commentators always said about the guys a jury would find guilty in five seconds and henry talking about his past mistakes not a single word that luke had been kidnapped or a ransom demanded for his return not a hint that he was innocent not a breath that henry knew he was in danger only an implication that luke himself was guilty were from your stepfather luke was sure now that snow and mouser had told him the truth the betrayal was complete not just abandoned but framed a rage rose in his chest im going to take you down henry he said aloud the words jarred him he had never made such a threat in his life in the quiet of the cottage the words sounded odd even frail lacking power he didnt know how to start but he was going to stop this stop henry force him to own up to what he had done the reason for henrys betrayal didnt matter luke could not understand it only the reality of it mattered what had his father said you might be called to fight one day luke think of michael think of strength and know you can win one day was now he heard the anchor say that the homeless victims name had not been released pending notification of kin eat get your strength back think he told himself luke devoured the pizza he knew if he went to the police he would be arrested charged at the least as an accessory to murder until he had information that could clear his name a terrible danger loomed in contacting the police or in asking henry for help and how would he explain the night road he had after all helped put it together would anyone believe that he didnt know its true purpose eric eric was the key eric had to know what was happening why luke had been grabbed to force henrys hand why the homeless man had to die luke turned off the television the weight of what he had to do hit him like an avalanche his only choice was to hunt down his kidnapper and force a confession the victim going after the kidnapper alone without the help of the police or anyone else luke finished the pizza he washed the plate and his cup as he put them back in the cabinet footsteps sounded on the porch hed broken a pane of glass on the door facing the river to get inside the cottage assuming the owners hadnt ventured into the torrent to check their weekend property this was either the police a neighbor or worse mouser or snow what would they have done when the truck crashed and burned run to the bridge to see if luke was dead maybe they saw him surface and then wash down the river they could just be following the river and heading towards the cottage he slid open a drawer and found a steak knife held it close to his hip luke had never fought with a knife but hed kept a small blade on him during his runaway days knives were easy to come by easy to hide hed only had to use it once just to show a tough kid in a richmond alley who wanted his money and then hed run like hell it was clear he had been in the house damp shower his clothes and his shackles in the trash the stove warm he stepped back into the walkin pantry left the door cracked he couldnt hide and hope they just left hed have to make a stand a mans hand emerged from under the gingham curtain on the back doors broken pane fumbled for the knob luke retreated to the kitchen the door opened the volume of the wind rose slightly then faded again as the door was shut no call of hello anyone here you might expect from a neighbor the intruder stood still as if listening for luke he opened his mouth to silence the rasp of his own breathing he heard the sound of a foot on floorboard approaching you must be scared to death mouser said from the hallway i sure would be people only have so much courage a pause and luke could imagine mouser swinging an open loaded gun into the first bedrooms doorway and i suspect youve burned through all yours all luke had to do was reach the back door on the other side of the kitchen and run in galoshes right mouser would put a bullet in him before he was down the driveway i just need to talk to you luke the shelves of the pantry pushed against his back mouser was silent luke felt the heavy weight of the cans thrown or bashing into a skull they would hurt they did not require the closeness of the knife it would give him two weapons and maybe mouser wouldnt think he had improvised more than one he thought of putting the knife in the back of his pants but there wasnt room in the pantry to reach he carefully stuck the knife up the sleeve of his longsleeve tshirt the blades tip barely hidden by the cuff then he reached carefully above his shoulder and closed his hand on a large can of corn so scared mouser said like he was cooing to a child holding onto that truck mustve exhausted you swimming in that hellhole of a river then mouser moved into view across the lit inch of open door one hand hovering over the stove testing its heat then mouser looked right at the nearly closed pantry door raised the gun and behind it he wore a smile i spy with my little eye a running boy that was a merry chase come on out with one hand luke pushed the door open mouser smiled now luke could see his face clearly he was bigger than luke a solid sixfootsix body knotted with muscle he had a boyish face cheeks ruddy from the rain and wind he wore a shirt streaked with dirt jeans crusted with mud from the chase his dark hair was cut in a burr and his brown eyes held a sick amusement but no warmth bags under his eyes showed exhaustion drop whatevers in your hand buddy mouser said luke dropped the heavy can of corn to the tiled floor it rolled to mousers feet mouser laughed at him corn is a lethal choice step out slowly hands on head so we can have a nice talk luke shook his head the steak knife parked in his sleeve felt looser than hed like as though it might just slip out of its hiding place the blade lay cool against his skin we need to have a nice calm talk the trucker was not planned mouser said as if contrition would erase the idea of murder my partner got overeager luke said nothing i want you to tell me who kidnapped you luke luke said nothing make him talk he thought make him tell you more i dont repeat myself mouser slapped him it was a hard vicious blow that felt like it would part the flesh from lukes cheekbones luke slammed against the refrigerator but steadied himself back onto his feet now luke spoke murders worse than kidnapping you were going to kill me were we i myself just wanted to talk to you now your stepfather wants you back in reasonably good condition dont make me pound the living hell out of you boy im sure henrys worried im going to kick his ass when i see him i hate family squabbles so back to facts he raised his hand for a second slap fingers wiggling in anticipation laughing when luke flinched who grabbed you i dont know his name just one guy yes mouser looked at him as though allowing himself to be kidnapped at gunpoint by a single assailant was a moral failing tell me what he looked like lets say i do what happens then then i dont beat your ass into the ground and i take you to your stepfather youll kill me you already tried i got shot at in the woods and that trucker got shot are you sure mouser put on a hurt little frown that was sure a noisy storm youre exhausted you dont know what you heard luke decided to give mouser enough to maybe get him to talk but not enough to make luke expendable he realized this was no different from the online prodding hed done with the extremists except he was facing a gun instead of a computer screen luke cleared his throat the guy grabbed me at the airport forced me to drive to houston he shot the homeless man he paused do you know who the homeless man was mouser said keep talking or ill break your nose with your can of corn first attempt deflected he made a phone call and we drove to the cabin he took a photo of me emailed it we found a woman chained to the bed he left me in place of her then he called my stepfather who stabbed me in the back yes im aware of your greek tragedy family dynamics what else hes not my dad my fathers dead i dont care everyone dies mouser slapped him again the pain throbbed up his jaw down his neck hed drawn close his breath sour against lukes nose now lets stay on topic he got a call earlier in the day from a british woman mouser frowned who is she luke decided to keep janes name to himself if he gave too much he might not be useful any more i dont know he never mentioned a name mouser tented his cheek with his tongue physical description of your kidnapper now mouser raised the gun he didnt aim it at luke but he inspected it as though admiring its steel luke took a deep breath eric was tall luke said he was medium height eric had dark hair luke said it was dirty blond and thinning eric had no accent so luke gave him a thick boston inflection i want to show you something mouser pushed him into a chair at the kitchen table he reached inside his jacket and handed luke a black and white picture printed from a computer it was eric mouser sat across from him now revisit your description think hard he look familiar to you no mouser smiled youre a psychologist right you know there are physical clues to lying a shift of the eye a twitch of the mouth especially apparent in the exhausted and overeducated now he aimed the gun straight at luke yes or no you see this guy yes he stared at the gun wondering if the answer was going to result in a bullet in his chest did he mention money just the insane amount of money he wanted from henry did he mention any names dates say anything about a road use the word hellfire this is where he decides to let you live or die luke realized luke bit his lip i i cant remember what all he said not with you pointing a gun at me im going to let you live luke trust me henrys eager to see you to explain trust me fat chance henry had said the same to him the last time hed seen him trust me we can change the world eric had said it too assuring him that hed be released if he cooperated trust was dead to him tell me did i find you on the internet for henry mouser studied him i dont waste much time on the web others yes not me now what names did he mention names yes but let me think for a minute he could feel the weight of the knife hidden in his sleeve concentrate youre supposed to be such a smart boy luke hunched over the table he dropped his arms and he fakeshivered and the knife began to work its way down into his hand below the tables edge he mentioned my stepfather he mentioned a night road but i didnt understand it was a name i made up for henry he did yeah he said something about hellfire is that a code name that was a lie but it worked tell me what he said the cool evaporated from mousers voice under the table the handle of the knife slid into his hand and for a moment fear stopped him you have a knife he has a gun seriously how do you think this is going to end can i have paper and pen to write down everything i remember he put a tired whine in his voice mouser stood and walked past luke toward the kitchen drawers and luke drove the knife hard into mousers leg the knife sliced through the denim the blade sliding into mousers flesh jesus mouser screamed as he doubled over in surprise his hand instinctively grappled at the knifes handle but as luke bolted past him mouser let go of the knife and got a steel hand on the back of lukes neck he worked his fingertips into a claw that pushed expertly against nerve juncture and artery the agony staggered luke he reached back and twisted the knifes handle and mouser released him with a mix of roar and shriek luke scrambled across the floor and he grabbed the heavy can of corn that hed dropped and he lobbed it straight and hard at mouser the can nailed mouser on the forehead as he tried to stand mouser collapsed to the floor again staring at the tiles as though he didnt quite comprehend the past minute luke wasnt about to risk getting close to the man again hed learned a hard lesson trying to fight snow he just thought run he ran out of the cottage no car which meant that snow might be driving up and down the river road hunting him same as mouser he ran into the thickness of the pines the waiting was pure hell for henry shawcross the police were gone and hed ignored the phone calls from the press after the brief statement hed had to make on his front porch after the reporter showed him the houston shooting footage he was badly shaken he hated to feel unprepared he wasnt going to speak to anyone unless it was mouser or luke or the kidnapper calling to arrange another deal hed watched the coverage of the disaster in ripley for five minutes with a coolness in his heart the crushing rains had scraped the chlorine from the sky but the damage was done the fuse of panic lit in the american heart politicians were demanding in gusting words to know that the cargo railways of rural america were safe that the chemical plants around the country where chlorine was stored were secure of course all they cared about was covering their asses he thought that was all any of those jerks cared about but they his clients and his soontobe clients all wanted to know what would happen next his dozen policy papers released in the past few weeks all outlined a variety of potential attacks some inspired by overseas trends in terror some inspired privately by the ambitions of the night road success was simple predict the attack then the attack happens and you have the ears of the most powerful people in washington that was the kind of power of respect he needed to wield his blistering uncannily accurate paper on a possible chlorine attack had made the rounds of the washington power brokers last month his voicemail was full of inquiries from potential thinktank clients from the government from private industry all wanting his insights all wanting his opinion on what the future would hold now where the terrorists would strike next it should have been his shining moment but lukes situation had tarnished it for him the same pols eager to hire him would be watching the coverage of the shooting involving luke perhaps holding back which meant he had to distance himself from luke and get his next papers out quickly so he would still be seen as the main most authoritative voice on the next stage of terrorism he would be respected again he would be close to the levers of power in washington luke on the news would fade the country would have much more to worry about in the days ahead henry remembered with a pang a magician his mother had hired to perform at his sixth birthday party i dont want a magician mom and her answer had cut him to the bone well henry honey it might make the kids want to come to your party shed said it without thought or malice she was possessed of a brutal honesty and a steady disregard of others pain henry had inherited only the latter from her so hed sat on the cool cut grass with neighborhood acquaintances who didnt much like him and who he didnt know how to make like him while the kids whod just come for the show and the squares of chocolate cake oohed and aahed henry had drilled his gaze on where the cheaprate teenage magician didnt want him to look the hand in the pocket the coin secreted between fingers the intact paper curled up the jacket sleeve hed seen there was no magic only distraction it etched a lesson on his brain now henry sat in his study in his arlington virginia home the chessboard luke had given him for christmas five years ago on the table the pieces locked in battle henry imagined luke slumped across from him sitting the way he always did when lost in the game leaning hard to the left on an elbow hand trapped in his brown thatch of hair tongue tenting his cheek while he thought humming some rock tune henry didnt know henry played black against white playing lukes side in aggressive style he moved his own pieces with the timidity of a mouse lukes bishops and knights closed in rapid conquest his white queen shadowing henrys black king defeat three moves away exactly what you deserve henry thought to lose and to lose badly just like how you lost barbara youre going to lose luke you already have henry rose from the chessboard headed down the hall to get a cup of coffee steam danced above the mug he added a dollop of milk he took a fortifying sip mouser would find luke bring him to a safe place where henry could question him and then make him understand make him see that the night road was the key to a golden future for them both a road to respect to power to importance he stepped back into his study from his left a gloved hand raced a knife to his throat stopped the blade right above his adams apple hot coffee sloshing from his mug burned his hand henry froze and his gaze slid to the face of his attacker he stayed still because he knew this man would kill him without a moment for mercy hello shameless the man with the knife said henry hadnt heard that nickname in years the mans voice was southerninflected scraped from the bottom of an ashtray we need to talk henry forced his voice to remain calm drummond lets pour that hot coffee on the floor please i prefer you unarmed henry obeyed then dropped the cup it shattered on the hardwood good you could have rung the doorbell hes here because he knows henry thought he knows about the night road and hellfire convince him hes wrong or kill him put the knife down for gods sakes are you crazy when dealing with you i prefer the direct approach drummond said the doorbell would be direct hiding behind a knife is not goodness drummond said did you grow a pair in the last ten years shameless youre very steady ah wait now i see sweat making its debut on your forehead please put the knife down not yet im not here for a casual reunion the knife at the throat told me that your stepson killed one of our old friends henrys mind went as blank as unlined paper what the man who your stepson shot in houston was our old buddy allen clifford what henry didnt have to pretend shock it thrummed through his body in a wave straight from his chest thats not thats not possible you are going to tell me what you and your brat are up to drummond said if you lie you die we clear professor clear drummond drummond lowered the knife he spun henry around and shoved him toward the table sit down hands where i can see them at all times henry sat on one side of the chessboard drummond stood on the other the knife still in his grip drummond had always reminded henry of a fire hydrant short stocky thicknecked a flat bland face with a squarish nose drummond glanced around the room this used to be warrens study yes i remember when warren was working on a paper or a project he would have those walls covered with sheets of paper pictures postit notes like a blizzard of ideas i keep my thoughts in my head im sure thats a safer place for them drummond surveyed the walls henrys diplomas pictures from his travels framed medals from the alexandria pistol club you still shoot yes you were always a crack shot henry i give you that of course i taught you you teach luke how to shoot maybe how to shoot from a car at a running man warren taught him the basics drummond jerked his head toward the interrupted game on the chessboard are you still so friendless you have to play chess alone shameless the old undeserved nickname a cheap variant on shawcross made the blood surge into his face humiliation he hated drummond with a loathing that went to his marrow but he realized he needed him he needed to know why his past and present were intersecting so violently but he knew drummond was trying to keep him offbalance the drama of the knife at the throat then the offhand compliment about henrys aptitude with a gun standard interrogation techniques a constant shifting between threat and kindness henry kept a neutral expression on his face i could hear the click of the pieces on the board from the hallway drummond said playing took my mind off my son henry cleared his throat your stepson you mean drummond picked up one of the chess pieces lukes king and inspected it as though admiring the craftsmanship you always did like to play both sides henry crossed his arms you said allen clifford was the murdered man since when did he become a homeless street bum he wasnt he was pretending to be pretending allen clifford was meeting with a fellow who had ties to domestic extremists who wanted to sell some information information henry made his voice go weak yes theres a black market you know and allen clifford was posing as a bum at the request of the guy he was meeting seller wanted to meet in the open he wanted it to look like the meeting was just two totally harmless guys talking on the street very nervous i assume he was worried about being cornered in a room or tape recorded an extremist in houston selling information henry worried that the guy was going to sell his name but no the only ones in the night road who knew henrys name were snow and mouser and eric who could it be how do you know all this who was clifford working for whom are you working for whom oh ive missed you shameless clifford and i both freelance he talked to me about the operation before he went down there he was doing it alone he didnt want the guy spooked but clearly your stepson knew about this meeting i want to know what hes been doing with his life since he lost his dad and here drummond made a face got you as a replacement luke is harmless hes just a psychology student harmless the houston police disagree but i know even more than they do i got access to his internet records from his home account shameless stop calling me that you sound like youre in junior high but you sure are pushing yourself today arent you shameless as ever the amazing political seer the freud of the terrorist mind the guy who claims to know the terrorists better than they know themselves drummond kicked the table aside sending the chess pieces scattering across the floor he put the blade up under henrys jaw i call you exactly what i think you are your stepsons internet records indicate he has been visiting hundreds of websites frequented by people with radical viewpoints hes been corresponding with them through these sites using tons of different email addresses sending them some rather fiery messages of agreement why he was working on a paper about extremist psychology hes been fascinated by it ever since warren died that was true and henry stared hard into drummonds iceblue eyes they reminded him of the hard blue of the sky beyond a mountain peak so this reaching out to the fringes is for a research paper no i dont think so hes compiled an avalanche of data even for a masters degree i think hes one of them no not a paper a book hes working on a book the lie wriggled thick in his mouth he had to convince drummond or drummond would find luke and kill him of that henry had no doubt he told me have you read or seen this book no so he could have lied to you he moved the knife off henrys throat let it dance along henrys eyelashes henry bit his lip does he know about us henry you and me and clifford and his dad no i swear luke doesnt know about the book club i swear i never told him and even if i did he wouldnt go after allen clifford or you or me his voice trailed off hed probably think we were all heroes heroes drummond snorted god you did tell him just to make yourself look smarter no ive never told luke about the book club honestly drummond why would i bragging henry gave a choked laugh wasnt that our great failing drummond not telling the world what we knew in your mind shameless in your mind we both know that if wed been listened to the world would be a very different place today drummond i dont care to dissect history i care about dissecting the present you say luke doesnt know about our past but he knows about a meeting between clifford and an extremist that is coincidentally scheduled to take place on the same day of a bombing that scares the piss out of the country maybe this extremist is one of lukes online friends no henry said i saw the video luke wasnt alone in the car someone else was in the passenger seat maybe luke was forced to participate drummond shook his head hardly an acceptable theory a trap was set for clifford and your stepson was the getaway driver henry said assume youre right he could feed drummond a bit of a line see what drummond was willing to share what was clifford going to do with this extremist once he had him just how wide do your responsibilities range who was he going to turn the extremist over to drummond made a clicking noise frowned henry could see him deciding to give a bit of information in hope for henry doing the same clifford would have hauled his ass out to a cabin in east texas up near braintree questioned him with force if needed see how much hed spill henry blinked the cabin it had been originally intended for something other than lukes kidnapping an interrogation by clifford and the kidnapper had known that with clifford dead the cabin would be free to use for holding luke hostage luke would not willingly participate in any crimes henry said in an even tone clifford on the other hand was contemplating kidnapping of his source youre here because you were working with clifford youre still nothing more than hired muscle drummond paused your defense of luke is not convincing he shook his head his dad wouldnt be very proud of how his boys turned out you did a pisspoor job im not surprised get out of my house or im calling the police no youre not how will you explain me the silence stretched between them finally henry said if you tell me what you know about this meeting maybe i can figure out how luke is connected i might be able to find notes in his research to help you ill give you any information i find but you have to promise me you do not hurt luke i take your word as a fellow member of the book club that you will not harm him drummond considered the offer for ten long seconds all right the knife eased back who was the extremist whats his name jimmy bridger snows old boyfriend the one who had taken off a few days ago a racist nothing snow had talked and bridger had looked to sell the information henry kept his poker face in place he wanted to talk and then he wanted protection who are you and clifford working for that you could offer protection to an informant drummond didnt deny that he and clifford shared an employer a private employer a private employer that performs undercover operations that are clearly the purview of the fbi henry raised an eyebrow are you telling me the book club is back in business the book club died with warren dantry and the others on that plane henry now all thats left of the book club is you he tapped the end of the knife against henrys nose and me now that cliffords dead are you working for the state department i told you the book club doesnt exist any more okay henry thought so drummonds working for someone who wants to flush out terrorists and for some reason is off the books it could be the fbi it could be cia operating illicitly on american soil what he didnt know drummond and clifford had both been mercenaries at heart how did clifford find this seller of information wed been following extremist movements over here trying to apply pressure to people who want to leave the dark side drummond said bridger mentioned to clifford that he knew details on an impending attack codenamed hellfire the years of planning and waiting demanded that henry not blink not swallow not betray the jolt of heat that pounded through his body and brain this was not trust drummond sharing information it was a trial by fire he could feel drummond studying his face for the merest reaction he blinked once and hoped he had not betrayed himself hellfire sounds religious i dont think these are baptist terrorists henry if you know anything about this whatever lukes gotten involved in you and i can deal but nows the time i dont know anything the day after clifford gets killed a bomb goes off in ripley texas im sure you saw that on the news ripley was hellfire bridger made hellfire sound much bigger than a single bomb much bigger more than one city attacked i cant help you i know nothing except that luke is not a terrorist no luke has just consistently reached out to freaks and people who hate but hes not a terrorist no a smile flicked on drummonds face what did you make him into henry now warren he knew how to be a father i think you just know how to be a screwup you judging me where were you again when our friends died those rehab places all sound alike to me henry kept his gaze locked on drummonds eyes and to his satisfaction he saw hed scored a hit drummond lifted and inspected a photo of luke his mother and henry from the desk a happier time the photo taken at a vacation in hawaii a year before the car crash that killed barbara their smiles glowed he set the photo down if youre hiding him dont give him to me if hes innocent or hes been pulled into this against his will well help him and hell go home with a clean slate if hes guilty then we find out what this hellfire bullshit is and we stop it cold drummonds tactic was nothing but playing nice cop before he played bad cop again i do not know where he is the world you and your stepson are in is a little too small for my liking henry you and luke dantry and allen clifford all mixing it up years after we said our goodbyes sit there move and you get cut then drummond proceeded to search the study with a professionals keen efficiency henry sat calmly blanketing the rage inside him with a knowing halfsmile nothing to link him to the night road or to hellfire was here let drummond look when he was done drummond stood the frustration in his eyes was a knife that henry could twist youve kept cliffords name out of the paper henry said yes so you are with the government drummond didnt answer but he wanted to prove his power henry could see proving his power his superiority had always been drummonds weakness from his jacket drummond pulled out a photo and pushed it under henrys nose the photo appeared to be from a video camera mounted in a police car aimed out the front windshield it was a single shot an officer talking to two men sitting in a bmw a traffic stop the ticket luke had gotten in mirabeau henry realized he recognized the grainy profile of a man in the passenger seat eric lindoe if he finds eric drummond could find his connection to me henry thought keep the lies simple thats luke at the wheel i dont know who the other man is why hasnt this photo been released to the press drummond ignored the question and tapped the photo its not a good enough shot to id his face but well find out who he is i understand the last time you saw luke was at the austin airport well nab all the video feeds from there as well he knew then that whoever employed drummond and clifford would identify and find eric lindoe it might just be a matter of hours maybe a couple of days his world was unraveling this proves luke is innocent he must have been forced proves nothing innocent of pulling a trigger perhaps but luke drove the car someone destroyed the book club before someone seems to be trying again you and i shouldnt sleep too good maybe were next the plane flight they were collateral damage ace beere the private jet mechanic who had tampered with the planes flight system so everyone on the flight died from hypoxia he was trying to get revenge on his employer not the book club we werent the targets lucky that you and clifford and me couldnt make the trip i always thought so henry said drummond crossed his arms i need to understand luke then i can figure out what his next move might be henry saw that the questions drummond asked might reveal more than he intended he nodded what do you want to know ill tell you just to help luke you promise you wont hurt him i promise after his fathers death luke dantry vanished for seven weeks he ran away from home he walked and hitchhiked south his mother must have been frantic good thing you were there to comfort her drummond raised an eyebrow a dear friendship and a good marriage came out of lukes running henry said evenly luke went to cape hatteras it doesnt take seven weeks to walk or hitchhike from washington to cape hatteras where was he during those seven weeks mourning hiding from the world he was living on the streets he was only fourteen but warren had taught him to be rather independent when the police found him he was sitting on the beach at the cape staring out at sea where his fathers plane went down hed been sitting on the sand for two days watching the sea someone noticed him and called the police pining for the dead at this level doesnt sound quite normal henry loathed drummonds dismissive tone but he decided it might be a goad a prod to make him talk more than he should luke was extremely close to his to warren you know how much everyone loved warren didnt we all drummond tilted his head luke never called his mom to say he was safe no he should have luke had a tough time of it he ran out of cash hed only taken a hundred dollars with him his face was all over the virginia papers then people were looking for him he figured out how to blend in how to hide how to survive on the run i never thought of concealment as a genetic trait his father was good at staying under the radar too drummond rested the knife against his leg this kid spent seven weeks evading the police and the detectives that your wife hired to find him all without money or resources and now hes hiding again henrys mouth thinned a twist of pride in luke filled his chest if he doesnt want to be found you wont find him i will find him first he thought and then ill have mouser kill you with your own knife you insufferable bastard are you using this kid to settle old scores lets be honest you hated me you hated warren you hated everyone in the book club thats not true isnt it we all thought you hated us hardly i made the book club happen maybe but warren dantry made it succeed henry shook his head slowly the words and the truth couldnt hurt him any more the book club was dead and hed won some success a bunch of thinkers and thugs that no one paid much attention to in the first place and now your stepson hes my son henry snapped an awful silence descended between the two men drummonds lips curled in a sneer you really did step into warren dantrys life his career his wife his son my god i guess you got over your hatred for him how do warrens shoes fit you henry henry breathed slowly counted to ten etched a halfsmile on his face he had never wanted to kill anyone as badly as he wanted to kill drummond he quelled the rage you know if i knew i would tell you because then i could help you find luke thats all i want luke to be found and home safe drummond tented his fingers with the air of a man with a final card to play ill find him before the police do hes going to talk to me drummond stood it might be best henry if you allowed yourself to be placed under my protection if he was kept under watch the first wave of attacks might fail and then hellfire would not happen and no way he could find luke or eric lindoe or the fifty million some protection you with a knife at my throat drummond laughed yes but no one else would get a knife near you henry swallowed down the tickle of bile at the back of his throat i stay here if he comes here my son needs me a wave of dizziness flushed through his brain stay in touch henry i will drummond handed henry a plain white card with a manhattan address handwritten in black ink with a phone number below henry i dont want to see warrens kid hurt if hes innocent but if hes not if he killed clifford nothing you do can protect him we just want to know why i want to know why too and it was true henry this has just been great i love reunions he fixed a steely glare on henry if you decide theres a greater truth youre not telling me call me because im going to find this kid and im going to find out the truth of what hes been working on you dont want me pissed at you henry said nothing drummond left this time out the front door henry slammed it behind him he stayed at the front window until drummond had driven away drummond isnt going to let this go he thought he wondered who drummonds employer was a private concern hed said what did that mean henry dug out his cell phone and called the cabin rental number in braintree texas that hed gotten earlier from snow and mouser the number was posted on the gate to the road that led to the cabin if clifford had rented that cabin if it wasnt coincidence he had to find out who clifford was freelancing for good morning braintree park rentals a bright cheery voice answered the phone yes good morning a coworker of mine said he was renting cabin number three i believe and hes not been answering his cell phone and i wanted to know if he had shown up there mr clifford i saw him at the beginning of the week the very dead allen clifford had rented the cabin luke had been taken to but not since people come out here to escape the world the clerk said maybe he just turned his cell phone off did he charge the cabin to the corporate card yes sir but i cant give out details im not allowed henry didnt give up did he give a billing address yes in new york who is this oh was it this address he read off the address on the card drummond had given him yes sir thats it the clerks hesitancy vanished henry could almost imagine him smiling we have several firms under the umbrella so to speak which company did he charge it to quicksilver risk thank you so much did you want to leave a message for mr clifford i can go up to the cabin no thats fine hes not supposed to be using a corporate card for his vacation but its not a problem we know hell reimburse us thanks so much henry hung up quicksilver risk henry glided back onto the web and found the companys website it was chromecolored and discreet in the manner of the most expensive consultants only a mission statement and a trio of principals allen clifford hired muscle for the book club was one the other two were former professors but with business backgrounds in risk assessment they hadnt been part of the book club no listing of clients no listing of fees no mention of ties to the government it said that theyd helped fortune companies assess the risk of providing relief after the boxing day tsunami after katrina after the chaos in a few african countries that had contested elections he tried the phone number he got the voicemail left a message for allen clifford hey allen he said to the dead mans machine its henry shawcross havent talked to you in a while id like to catch up see what youre up to give me a call he left a number hopefully someone at the firm would start returning cliffords calls and he could ask more questions what dirty work were you up to he said to allen cliffords photo the doorbell rang at his feet lay an overnight package flat in a large thick plastic envelope lukes condo was the return address he weighed the package in his hand listened to every side of it light no ticking sound although that meant nothing with digital detonators he carefully opened the box inside was another package it had been sent first to the american transport company for delivery in the united states but had originated in france paris an address he didnt recognize without opening the inner package he googled the paris address it was a postal shop in the saint germain district the kind where you might rent a mailbox inside was a cell phone plain cheap the prepaid kind a card attached to it read for henrys ear only he turned the phone on he very badly wanted a shot of whiskey he was afraid what news the phone would bring he was afraid of how the day could darken but the phone had to be a positive yes it must be the kidnapper reaching out to him the phone was a blessing if drummond was monitoring his calls he had to assume they were drummond knew how to tap lines bug rooms hed done it for years when henry worked with him he put the phone into his pocket and went to get his whiskey his mind blazing with confusion things that should not be intersecting were the book club luke hellfire the long and still hot hatred for lukes father a hatred he had worked hard to mask every day when he was around barbara and luke it had been hard keeping his acid loathing bottled up warren goddamned dantry warren was a knowitall and a knownothing all at once even now the thought of warren dantry made henry quake with fury with disgust warren made the book club work drummond had said a lie a complete lie i brought him in i brought you all in henry said to the empty kitchen his hand shook slightly as he poured and the glass tinkled he ran a finger along his neck convincing himself that drummond had left no mark he would have to call snow and mouser warn them that hellfire at the very least the code name had been leaked that if bridger was found snow was in danger of being exposed and that drummond was hunting eric and luke just as they were if they chose to withdraw he could do nothing to compel them but then he would have to start the night road all over again the ripley operations advantage of distraction would be lost rendered to nothing like the chlorine in the rain or else hed have no choice but to run from the princes throatcutting wrath since his fifty million was either locked in an inaccessible account had been moved to switzerland or had vanished into the ether then he heard a quiet trill he opened the phone henry shawcross it was a british woman yes you may call me jane for the purposes of our discussion i thought given time to miss your stepson you might reconsider my offer this woman was the mastermind the boss relief flooded him now he could strike a deal i want to know where luke is shame on you shoveling the blame on poor luke i suspected you were a truly despicable person and my god you didnt disappoint she laughed laughed at him a teasing giggle you have made enemies with the wrong people young woman have i its more that you have made the wrong friends that nasty billionaire who played dressup in the london park and offered fifty million to you while the pigeons danced for the crumbs at his feet i heard your every word she laughed again silvery and a cold fist closed on henrys heart what do you want transfer the fifty million to a numbered account and youll get luke back she didnt know that the passwords to the accounts had been changed and he couldnt access the millions otherwise she wouldnt have bothered with the call i want to speak to luke i dont give the goodies without the cash you can let him yell at you after the funds are delivered no now jane might be desperately bluffing to get him to release the money that he couldnt touch nausea and rage swept through him why did you have eric kill allen clifford oh so many questions so little time jane said i dont have to answer anything love thats what power is never having to explain yourself now the money for luke do i need to spell it out with pictures youll kill luke anyway an ache suffused his entire body actually we wont well let him go hell be your problem wont he and jane gave the cruelest laugh hed ever heard how exactly will you explain your refusal to help him what you are what youve done should we tell him to ask about what happened to his sweet mother the unexpected words delivered with a twist of steel froze him barbara died in an accident anything else is a lie she did she did a welltimed accident it was an accident it was but now he wont believe you henry youre the nowhere man always on the fringes always laughing a bit late at every joke who has to practice his smile you finally get a family after years of being alone one too good for you and you toss it all away i doubt barbara dantry and luke ever quite recognized the stray dog they let in their house was a wolf every word was a piledriving fist through bone and brain henry sucked in a harsh breath ill give you the money please i want you to understand that if you dont transfer the money within thirty minutes luke is dead oh god god no he thought eric has the code for the accounts not me he said please dont hurt luke ill find the money eric doesnt have the money jane he does hes lied to you and they would kill luke now he was useless to them no no no thats why i couldnt give you the money before please believe me please jane hung up he fumbled on the phone there was no call log it had been disabled no way to call back henry drank the whiskey very slowly the shaking in his hands stopped he drank another neat then he poured the rest of the bottle down the sink she might be killing luke right now right now while you stand crying over a sink whiskey on your breath and you have caused the death of the one remaining person in the world that you care about henry thought the phone rang the phone he used only with mouser mousers voice sounded raspy hard tinged with fury luke identified eric lindoe as his kidnapper is luke okay tell me you have him oh ill get him back for you he stabbed me in the leg and he ran why did he stab you i told you not to hurt him he knows we came from you henry and youre on his shit list watch your back your boy is pissed and apparently able to fight the warning coasted over henrys ears luke was alive and out of janes clutches or maybe she had recaptured him after he escaped mouser you sure someone else didnt grab him not sure but he was free as a bird last time i saw him then jane was bluffing he had to fight back he had to find this woman find out who she was and destroy her i dont understand why would eric lindoe turn against us and target luke luke says some brit bitch named jane used him as ransom for erics woman this jane thought you could deliver the fifty million but eric must have already hidden it if he hasnt given it to her then eric has it we have to find him henry wiped sweat from his jaw eric lied to us all including this jane she made him kidnap luke to force my hand and he did it to cover up that he had taken the money she must have asked him for it originally and he convinced her he didnt have the access that i did oh christ lukes life destroyed by a single lie eric hasnt given jane the money she just called me thinking i could get it for her henry sank to the couch i dont understand luke stabbed you luke fighting two nutcase extremists with experience in murder and combat he could not picture the scene i wonder henry how well you know luke he seems far more capable than you gave him credit for i i dont understand its simple hes loose he is a danger to us no i can take care of him henry thought quickly im going to put tracers on every friend luke has anyone he might turn to for help the police will do the same but we must be smarter than the police and faster we have to find eric and we have to find luke i can make luke understand that i doubt i can henry raised an eyebrow and if hes been as smart as you say he might be very useful to us listen im sorry he stabbed you are you all right yes but im not happy find where hes at and ill bring him back to you maybe in one piece luke running with mouser and snow and now that bastard drummond all after him what would he do come here no washington was too far and he wouldnt trust henry now and he might believe the police were watching henry waiting for luke to show how else would he try to clear his name eric eric if forced to confess could clear lukes name of murder hell go after eric just like he chased after his fathers ghost all the way down to cape hatteras we find eric we find luke henry felt charged with the fire of battle he could win he called a night road hacker ordered him to find any records in the airlines or credit card databases that indicated where eric lindoe or luke dantry had gone over time he had found hackers with backdoors into such valuable databases if they were not motivated by night roadstyle ideology they were motivated by money his hunters either on the ground or electronic would find luke and faster than drummond could he did not need to worry about warrants and permission he did not want to think about luke not believing him and what awful sacrifice he might have to suffer all he had to worry about was telling and selling the greatest lie of his life for twenty minutes luke ran walked ran again through the woods he crossed open fields cleared for cattle or horses and he felt vulnerable and alone in the open the pine trees when he could stay in their dense growth were like having a shield he stumbled out onto a road close to a bridge on the river he had no idea where he was and he kept glancing over his shoulder he saw a teenage boy in a yellow slicker then trudging up from the swollen riverbanks hi the boy said which search team were you with oh luke said i got separated from my search team im a friend of the olmsteads staying at their place on the river for a few days he tried not to talk too fast or let his nervousness seep into his words just thought id help but im useless i dont know the country around here well i can give you a lift back to the search base thank you he followed the kid along the thin stretch of paved road thinking if this kids been involved in the search for the trucker then maybe he hasnt seen the rest of the news with my face on it he couldnt dwell overmuch on the trucker if he did the guilt would overwhelm him and hed make a mistake and be caught or dead he could not bring the trucker back to life if he hadnt made it out of the river but he could be sure that mouser and snow paid for what they did a red truck sat at the edge of the road the kid offered his hand and said my names dumont hi dumont im warren luke lied using his dads name felt easy and right he shook the kids hand they got into the truck i feel bad for this gentlemans family wondering when were going to find him dumont wheeled the truck south away from the house where luke had hidden he tried not to sag against the door in relief you look exhausted man dumont said didnt sleep well the storm kept me up he stared out the window mouser was out of play for maybe just a few minutes unless luke had hurt him worse than he thought but where was snow and how on earth was he going to find eric they turned onto a main road that headed toward the town of braintree and a mercedes shot by them he could see snowwhite hair at the wheel and thought she might notice if he ducked suddenly so he stayed put and rubbed his face with his hand you sure you okay dumont asked he sounded as though he were doubting his decision to offer this odd stranger a ride in the rearview he watched the mercedes vanish over a rise in the road no glow of brake lights no indication shed spotted him yes im fine just tired he had to get out of this area now he needed to know where eric and aubrey had gone there had to be a clue in something eric and aubrey had said or done something hed seen he began to blink past his exhaustion and tried to replay every nuance when eric spoke from the beginning the truck pulled into a parking lot of a small motel filled with police cars police his face had been all over the news and there was probably an apb out on him to one side stood a news crew associated with a houston station a single reporter a cameraman interviewing rescuers the media was more of a threat they for sure would have seen his face on broadcasts thanks dumont luke said i appreciate the lift he opened dumonts truck door and stepped out into the rain the reporter forty feet away wiped rain from her face and raised a hand hey yall just get back in from the search oh god luke thought he turned and walked away toward a tent set up for the search parties how the hell was he supposed to get out of here steal a car he had no idea how to and while breaking into a cottage for warmth and food after being starved for a day and surviving a cold river seemed forgivable grand theft auto did not warren hey man he glanced over his shoulder and saw dumont standing with the reporter gesturing at him to join them luke forced a smile mimed a shiver and drinking coffee he waved and kept his hand up by his face then he turned pulling the jackets hood halfway over his face he ducked into the tent coffee bottled water breakfast tacos and doughnuts were being served on a short table he snagged a cup of coffee steaming and black and collected his thoughts nowhere to go and no way to get there he watched a police officer speaking into a walkietalkie just turn yourself in he thought with a sudden and deep ache of resignation of surrender find eric find the answers dont you dare give up braintree wasnt a big town and he walked down to the main street he had no money no way out of town he checked his watch a rolex that his mother had given him when he graduated from college that would be a source of cash but hed rather pawn it in a town where he wouldnt be remembered so easily and he hated to give up a gift she had given him but these were desperate times the library was open it was just past ten in the morning he walked inside wandered the maze of the stacks the smell and sight of books gave him a sudden comfort they had been his friends after his fathers death after his mothers accident and a library was a place he knew how to use he went to an array of public computers nodding at a tall blonde woman who was working at the main desk he opened a web browser and jumped to the houston chronicle web page the chlorine bombing in ripley still dominated the headlines the rains had removed the immediate threat and the ruptured tanks had been sealed forty confirmed dead chemical plants around the country were on a massively increased state of alert the homeless mans murder was a secondtier story but the report offered no picture of the victim and no name except that the homeless in the area didnt seem to know much about the man several said he was a stranger that wasnt a mystery he could solve here he had to find eric and aubrey luke googled aubrey kidnapped he found references to a soap opera character snatched as part of a storyline a chilean activist whod been missing since the pinochet terrors the sad detailing of a girl stolen in oregon by her father five years ago but nothing recent maybe aubrey hadnt been reported as kidnapped either eric had gotten her home before anyone realized she was missing but missing wasnt the same as kidnapped he searched on aubrey missing three results down he found it a personal blog called graceamatic written by a young freelance designer named grace in chicago my friend aubrey i designed the logo for her exportimport business is missing shes not returning phone calls shes not at home shes not at her office shes not updating her social networking pages and no one has seen her i called the police and they were useless they said i have to wait twentyfour hours to file a missing persons report thats insane her boyfriend well they just broke up a couple of weeks ago but he said he doesnt know where she is i dont know what to do omg im a little freaked out that the cops really do make you wait twentyfour hours then two entries later update on my missing friend aubrey is no longer missing and apparently wasnt she called me this morning to say she took a few days to deal with some personal issues and shes fine thank god and to please not blog about her life and i feel like fricking chicken little for panicking the cops were right chicago he went to graces portfolio and found the one logo shed done for an exportimport company perrault imports specializing in artistic imports from south america europe and asia modest pottery and wall hangings sold in turn to retail outlets the contact name was aubrey perrault who then was eric he risked signing onto the social networking site he had an account there as well as did most of his generation and found a profile linked to aubreys ah sweet hello eric one of her top friends eric lindoe he jumped to erics profile thirtyfive working at a private bank called gold maroft in chicago he googled eric lindoe found a few news stories mostly tied to press releases from his employer about promotions he had gone to the university of illinois on full scholarship he had started in bank operations and moved rapidly up into overseas banking for construction projects in saudi arabia britain switzerland dubai and qatar a man with so much to lose committing kidnapping and murder there had to be a reason he did another google search tying erics name with henry shawcross no results he had to get to chicago he had no money no resources and he couldnt turn to his few school friends he couldnt put them in danger but he had people who wanted to be his friends in the night road he remembered the other night showing henry postings from the one who called himself chicagochris he went to his email account through a website that allowed you to surf the web anonymously hed learned about it in one of the discussion groups chris had sent him a phone number in one of his emails to luke he found it in an email from two weeks ago and wrote it down then he surfed to twitter the web service that allowed you to send short updates and messages to all your friends in your network his network included all his grad school friends a few college and high school buddies people he cared about he sent a message to everyone on his twitter list im innocent in case he didnt make it out of this mess alive he wanted to make that gesture to give his friends reason to believe him then he erased the browsers history and logged off the internet he glanced up at the librarian who sat frowning at a computer screen he saw two volunteers murmuring over a book cart sorting volumes one laughed softly the librarian stood and vanished into an office the two women stepped toward the back of the library luke could smell coffee hazelnut on the air luke looked over the counter and saw a purse he peered inside and found a cell phone he grabbed it and hurried to the back of the stacks no one noticed he called chicagochriss number hello a young smokers rasp sounding tired i hope this is chicagochris this is lookout from tearthewallsdown discussion group hey man hey how are you chris sounded happy to hear from him but it was the overabundant enthusiasm of someone who spent far too much time alone and not happily i hope its cool to call you sent your number sure glad to finally talk chicagochris painted himself online as a badass a man who wanted to right the wrongs of the world by redistributing wealth on an extreme basis a prescription for saving the world from overindustrialization but he sounded like a giddy schoolboy you in chicago hardly luke said but i need to get to chicago and i need help im getting hassled big time chris clicked his tongue in his mouth waited i wrote some truth on a board i shouldnt have and the fbis looking for me you shouldnt say fbi in a phone conversation the government picks up and records any conversation in the fifty states that mentions the fbi and it gets played back to the fbi so if you say fuck the fbi they know you said it they open a file on you sorry luke said chicagochris hung up luke dialed again chris answered you have to be more careful you dont want to trigger their monitoring software with a keyword luke thought in chriss paranoid world monitoring software was probably a keyword but he didnt want chris to hang up again all right i know you dont know me but were brothers in the struggle arent we chris was silent again maybe i need to get to chicago i need your help but i cant travel on a charge card and i dont have money you want me to send you money he sounded slightly incredulous i swear im good for it most people would hang up help a friend you only knew from online not likely but he was gambling on two things chris had sent him the contact information to begin with because he liked lukes postings to the group and because chris seemed needy for friendship and the communities even being online still had the feel of closeness of a bonded brotherhood these people were so alone in their hatreds they needed each other to reinforce their certainty about the worlds wrongs it was a key to terrorist psychology violence was a group decision he had to play on that sense that they were partners brother i just need enough to cover a bus ticket to chicago and a bit for food where are you the library in braintree texas he fashioned a halflie one chris couldnt resist i got information on that chlorine accident in texas that the government was involved what exactly do you have well get me to chicago and ill share the info with you if the youknowwhat with three letters doesnt grab me first whats the info worth send the money and ill bring it to you you could also be a cop trying to trick me the cops would love to get hold of me im not i cant email you because im being followed ive got to stay off the grid as much as i can im making the call on a cell phone i stole from a ladys purse so make your choice help me or dont silence again theres a bus station in braintree luke said you can buy a ticket online for me do you need cash i have zero chris so yes please he heard the background clatter of typing ill find a western union close to the braintree library address send you cash for food if you dont pay me back he clicked his tongue ill find you and ill destroy you he sounded different from mouser erratic not cool and focused no worry im good for it and thanks man thanks so much youre gonna pay me back chicagochris said and he hung up luke erased the call from the phones log the volunteers had not returned from the stacks he dropped the womans phone back into her purse and walked out of the library snow and mouser knew luke would be on the road and all roads led to braintree luke tried not to let the fever of paranoia build in his heart he walked a halfmile and found the western union agent at a priceright chain store chris sent him if hed sent a thousand luke would have had to show id it said so on a sign behind the clerks head luke couldnt believe the guy was actually doing it and being smart lost my id luke said as the customer service agent counted out the money lost my wallet that sucks the agent said not caring in the priceright store luke bought a bottle of hair color blond he thought when youve decided to color your hair thats when you know youre in serious freaking trouble he bought a baseball cap and sunglasses a small backpack peanut butter crackers bottled water and apples toiletries sturdy sneakers underwear socks and jeans it was just like what hed packed when he ran away from home all those years ago and luke missed his mom and dad with a pain that cut to his spine he threw the stolen galoshes and the oversized jeans hed stolen from the cottage in the trash after he left the store he walked to a wireless dealer at the other end of the shopping center and bought a prepaid cell phone he hurried to the bus station his online ticket courtesy of chris had not been processed he ate an apple and all the crackers fidgeting waiting for mouser and snow to walk through the doors as they shut off every route of escape out of braintree a nervewracking hour later his ticket was ready and twenty minutes after that the northbound greyhound pulled out of braintree five miles out of town luke dantry fell into a deep desperate sleep the phone call came as henry stepped out of the shower he felt sick from lack of sleep and worry please be good news he thought it was the night road hacker you wanted me to find eric lindoe he and his girlfriend were on the passenger manifest for a flight from dallasfort worth to thailand yesterday he fed henry the details thailand of course eric could run far hed taken the night roads money it would be most difficult for luke to follow eric there without cash without a passport without help what about breaking into erics bank henry asked it was their chance without eric to find where the fifty million had been moved i think your eric screwed us and his own bank i hacked into the banks audit trail the history of every transaction thats taken place this month someone inside looped the audit trail onto itself theres dozens of gigabytes of transaction data more than there should be its a complete information overload its entirely disrupted the audit trail destroyed its integrity i expect theres a lot of upset people at erics bank right now no ones going to be able to find what money went where for several days even their backups are corrupted eric knew exactly what he was doing disaster the arab prince had given eric to henry as a contact but henry could hardly go to the prince and say lost the fifty million somewhere in that bank could you lean on the bankers to cough it up admitting failure would be a death sentence and the bankers if eric had sabotaged their internal auditing system would hardly be eager to admit they had a rogue employee it would destroy their reputations no henry would have to find the money without letting the prince know it had gone missing i dont think i can risk a further hack at the bank i set off intrusion alarms as it was henry thanked the hacker and hung up then henrys office phone rang he hurried down the hallway wrapped in his towel to answer it yes a flat cold voice he didnt recognize said you want your stepson back not mouser not the british woman not drummond who is this you want your stepson back now he realized hed heard this vaguely whiny voice before where he couldnt remember yes henry said yes i do ill call you back when i have him and well make a trade then the caller hung up henry checked the call log the phones number was not one he recognized but the area code was for chicago eric lindoes hometown seventeen critical displays stood in the braintree priceright store considered vital because the priceright buyers wanted to measure customer response to price and product combinations twentyfour security cameras watched the store six of the cameras above the displays had been doubly purposed not only for security but to observe customer behavior what path through the store did a customer whod paused to look at the display take did they go first to clothing then to toiletries or electronics what facial expressions did customers show at displays smiles frowns shaking of heads curiosity how long did each customer study the display did they pick up and examine items and for how long tens of thousands of faces were captured at the priceright displays in thirtynine states every day the video feed went instantaneously to the corporate headquarters in little rock arkansas there it would be run through a preliminary computer analysis to provide the companys marketers with initial data to help them refine pricing and stock strategies but for the past several hours the film was also being siphoned off to another server in the companys special projects division this was done by a very quiet request from outside priceright there every face that had been captured at one of the monitored store displays was compared to a photo a young man in his midtwenties light brown hair blue eyes with a defined and analyzed set of facial proportions rendered into mathematical equations the length of his mouth the distance from lower lip to jawline the angle of cheekbones the distance between his eyes the length and width of ear every face caught at the displays was compared to the young mans photo comparison number found the closest match by far a photo snapped when a young man bought a pair of shoes in braintree texas the server automatically sent an anonymous email alert snaking through the world and masking its traces arriving on a screen in paris france the man who received the message studied luke dantrys face for a long time then he picked up a phone to order a search of all cellular calls coming in and out of the small town of braintree texas monitoring all communications all financial transfers all transportation records the man stared at the photo on the screen and thought they will kill you when they find you mouser had disinfected and bound the stab wound no way he was going to let snow know hed been hurt hed explain the knifes rip in his jeans as a tear from running through the piney woods he had called her to come pick him up at the cottage but jesus the pain was a hot bolt and the bandage didnt seem to be adhering well the little bastard hed cut lukes throat after he told them what they needed to know snow was fooled for all of five seconds as he walked toward her car youre hurt she turned him back into the cottage and sat him on the edge of the bathroom tub she undid his zipper and slid down his pants he didnt protest and then she went and got a medical kit from her cars trunk she tended to the wound with a brisk professionalism that startled him disinfecting and then suturing the wound i learned to bind wounds at an early age she said had to same as your daddy teaching you to build bombs uh huh she said that must have been quite a summer camp he sent you to camp life she said tough life i was a child of the lamb she said he was silent in deference to her past the children of the lamb had been a religious group sheltering themselves away in a compound in wyoming the beast had sent its army to flush them out there had been lies about weapons being massed and tax evasion and child rape on the altars and similar silky untruths that unfurled on the beasts forked tongue after a twoweek siege the feds had laid waste to the compound killing thirty leaving a dozen survivors it had been ten years ago i see he said quietly with respect one of the four kids who survived the siege she said i was fifteen it explained the burn scars your parents dead burned up daddy shoved me out the window his hair was on fire i ran but the agents caught me wrestled me to the ground i watched our temple burn i saw my people rise in the smoke to god she focused on his bandage im sorry he said im not snow answered now she looked up at him it made me who i am and i like myself just fine he put a hand on her shoulder were gonna beat the beast together well find luke hellfire will happen yes she said he picked up his phone rang henry talked listened he hung up snow still sat on the tile floor looking at him seeing a rising mix of judgment and anger in his eyes your old boyfriend bridger he tried to talk he told some group called quicksilver about hellfire at least its names but he was holding out on the details for money but we got to move fast how much does the bastard know im sorry she said i never told bridger a word maybe he heard me mention the word on the phone when i spoke to henry about how to make all the bombs but i never told him but i cant guarantee he didnt spy on me does he know where the bombs are does he know our targets she didnt answer right away and he could see was flipping through the pages of her memory she did this with care and he believed her now completely instead of reaching for her neck to strangle her he barely touched her hair with his fingertips no he doesnt know where theyre stored he doesnt know the targets about that i never told him never wrote anything down he could find she spoke with such calmness there was no room in her words or her breath for a selfserving lie but she ducked her head if he wanted to kill her he could and he realized she would accept her fate like a soldier he felt his heart shift in his chest he pulled his hands away from her head folded them back in his lap okay he said his voice was hoarse where will bridger hide his familys from alabama he might go there or he might stay in houston hes not real bright well get the night road looking for him well find him and he can tell us who these quicksilver assholes are now she looked up at him why do you hate the government i just do i told you my reasons tell me yours she leaned toward him their faces an inch apart please mouser for a moment the words hanging in the wet air between them were more intimate than a kiss i prefer not he said she leaned back and closed the medical kit thank you for tending me he said you could have been a doctor or a nurse no i dont much like people any more he knew how she felt what now she asked luke might be in the town nearby or hitchhiking up the highway he seems to like trucks then we better get resources on our side hes going to stick his head up and we need to be ready hows the pain tolerable mouser said shed given him a woozy shot of relief from her medical bag lets see whats tolerable the wound was low on his leg above the knee she reached out to touch it but her hand slid up past the bandage to his underwear she reached inside the opening of his boxers closed her hand on him what he said in utter shock its a lonely life isnt it mouser she said it had been four years he had the mission he did not need women but his hands didnt rise to push her away and her mouth was a warm buzz against his lips the pain seemed to fade for him when she slid his jeans off all the way there on the cool bathroom floor an hour later they left the cottage and he thought damn you dont let feelings get in the way of fighting the beast should have been chasing him not chasing her he was ashamed of himself when he called henry again he got a surprise i want you two to go to chicago henry said i have reason to believe luke is heading there the hand shook luke awake and his first thought was theyve found me he opened his eyes to see the kind face of an elderly woman who had been sitting across the aisle from him working a pencil patiently through the pages of a crossword puzzle book texarkana honey we got a dinner stop and layover here if youre going further he blinked and thanked her in a broken mumble she stepped back with an uncertain smile and waddled down the aisle luke stumbled off the bus the air was cool and humid the rain past he started to walk down the street in search of food a fourhour layover before his ticket took him onward to little rock memphis and then chicago he devoured a double hamburger at a fastfood chain careful not to meet anyones gaze he walked down a couple of blocks to a bar slipped inside its welcoming darkness and ordered a coke the television was on the early news reporting that the demolishing rains that had moved up from the gulf had begun to subside confirmation from a reporter outside ripley that the rail yard disaster had been a bomb not an accident the bar hushed as the reporter described how the fbi was trying to determine if this was a jihadist attack or a domestic enemy the screen went to a commercial and the conversation of the beer drinkers resumed although subdued luke sipped his soda the news came back on covering the bizarre shooting of the homeless man again henry speaking on camera once more the betrayal repeating itself lukes face was on the screen the few early drinkers were lost in their conversations studying their beers or clicking billiard balls luke kept his sunglasses on but now there were new reports luke saw a shot of a friends cell phone with the message luke had sent to all his friends on twitter im innocent and one of his grad school friends rising to his defense blinking into the camera said if luke dantry says hes innocent i believe he is what motive does he have to kill a homeless stranger none but then the reporter went back to lukes past a runaway a couple of runins with the law as a kid enough to confirm to the casual viewer that luke was trouble reinforced by his stepfathers pleas to surrender the barkeep let two more stories play out on the news and as a steady stream of customers began to enter the bar he clicked over to espn for the dallas mavericks game luke left a dollar tip and walked a halfmile until he came to a larger gas station one with a sizeable convenience store attached he bought a pair of nail scissors and went to the bathroom locked himself in a stall and read the hair dye directions he faced the mirror applied the hair dye quickly and a little sloppily he returned to the stall sat waited while a few customers came and went after thirty minutes he rinsed the gunk from his hair quickly in the sink dried it with a paper towel then he took the scissors clipped his hair close to his head messy but now blond and he covered most of his new hair with his baseball cap he tried chris with his prepaid phone but got no answer he felt tense restless he walked back to the bus terminal and kept his back to the passengers he heard the call for the bus servicing little rock memphis and chicago he boarded the bus was more crowded than he expected not good but it was easy to be as anonymous as you wanted on a bus especially at night luke settled into a rear seat kept his sunglasses on his cap low he dozed on and off and as the bus made its stops and brief layovers in little rock and memphis and a dotting of towns in between the long evening and his clear lack of interest in chatting kept him in a cocoon when he didnt sleep he thought about henry he didnt truly know the man who had helped raise him since his fathers death the man who had barely survived the crash that had killed his mother the realization sent a twisting chill down his spine after his own dad died henry had been a constant rock in his life strong when luke was weak focused when luke drifted he was the one who always believed in luke the gentle man whod married late in life and seemed both surprised and grateful to fate for giving him a special friend and son in luke had it all every sign of support every gesture of kindness every encouragement simply been the cruelest and most calculated of lies what kind of monster was henry im going to uncover the truth about you luke thought every awful truth no matter what it would take no matter what he would have to do the next day he arrived in chicago at three in the afternoon the bus had been delayed extra hours in memphis luke felt exhausted and grimy the bus station near downtown chicago was busier than luke expected he saw young mothers soldiers older couples single men he could vanish into the crowd get his bearings then figure out a way to find eric and to see if he could learn anything useful from chicagochris his nerves felt taut as violin string now he would be playing someone he knew to be dangerous maybe even homicidal possibly someone who was part of the night road this could be a lions den it could be a trap he felt almost like bouncing on the balls of his feet getting into a fighters stance trying to cut past the fatigue to force himself to be smart luke headed toward the doors on harrison street navigating through the crowds of people arriving and departing and a hand closed around his arm he jerked away nearly falling over the man who held his arm was young head shaved bald an intense glare burning behind his clunky glasses youre lookout he steered luke out into the bright sunshine of the street chicagochris was shorter than luke with a brow furrowed as if in constant worry or anxiousness or anger pale lips and eyes of light hazel gave his face an unfinished look his teeth shone tilelike in his tense grin and luke thought i bet you got teased about that grill he wore a black leather jacket and a black tshirt with a raised fist in gaudy red you made it um yes luke had not expected him to show up at the bus station but why shouldnt the guy hed paid the ticket he knew the itinerary hed been promised information in return im glad my money was helpful ill pay you back as soon as i can your face is all over the news luke you cant be out here lets go he knows youre luke dantry luke didnt want to go he wanted to find eric and aubreys trail his reluctance must have shown on his face because chris unveiled a harder diamond smile and said of course i could scream out to all these nice people that i found you the cops would be here in no time thats not necessary luke said glad we agree lets go ive got an art studio over in wicker park we can talk there wicker park he had heard of it very hip right if this guy had a highend address and money to risk sending to online friends he must be a successful artist so why would he be spending his time posting hate and anarchy and revolution what was he so angry about wickers so ancient now chris said its all going corporate feeling like he had no choice luke followed chris to a car a polished new porsche they pulled away from the bus terminal and headed north past downtown luke stayed low in the seat wondering if chris was the only extremist hed found who drove a rich mans car the texarkana barkeep finally said to his wife over cigarettes and coffee before going in for his next evenings shift that young man on tv the one who shot the homeless guy down in houston who she did not follow the news much she found it depressing and the recent chlorine attack in ripley only confirmed her pessimism he told her what he had seen on the news and that one of his customers from a day ago sure looked like that young man he wore sunglasses inside weird unless youre blind maybe he was blind its preying on my mind i should call the police the barkeep said i seriously doubt you saw a fugitive the wife said her practicality was a gift to the marriage i mean all the bars in the world and he comes into yours while theres a news story on about him please hes got to be somewhere when the news is on i cant quit dwelling on it he had a knapsack we get business when the buses come in the late afternoon a fugitive on a bus i thought they always stole cars thats the movies do i call the police or the fbi the fbi she said if you saw him hes already crossed a state line no one runs to texarkana and stops she lit another cigarette watched him stand before the phone as though deciding on a vote she gave him a gentle nudge for the sake of family peace what harm would a phone call do if youre right and they catch him youll be on cnn this week of course theyll be no living with you then she loved him a lot and she smiled the idea pleased the barkeep but he just made a grunt and he picked up the phone and opened the phone book ill call the cops first out of respect cops come into the bar and ive never seen an fbi agent there the wife shrugged went back to proofing their teenage daughters essay on alice in wonderland for her english class only halflistening to her husband start to explain his silly overwrought suspicions chris worked near the heart of wicker park not far from the damen train station in an old building converted into retail on the first floor and office and loft space above the exquisite metal carved sign mounted on the brickwork read bennington gallery next door stood an openair coffee shop with idlers on laptops soaking up the nice sunny day on the other side was a highend martial arts center that looked like a japanese spa behind the building chris eased the porsche into a reserved parking spot below an old iron fire escape as they walked inside a nervous doe of a woman hurried toward them she was in her forties dressed all in black skinny as a teenager with an elfin face that looked like a kinder version of chriss stony stare hi chris sweetheart she said is this a friend of yours she gave luke an uncertain smile that seemed to beg luke to be chriss friend but almost like she wasnt sure she wanted to meet any friend of chriss a conflict of emotions swirled on her face chriss eyes hardened at the word sweetheart and he said yeah hes a friend and fuck the hell off mom luke froze he had fought plenty with his mother through the years but he never would have dreamed about speaking to her that way chriss mothers smile wavered and then withered but didnt entirely vanish chris gave his own little smile as if to say just what i expected im sorry luke said he didnt know why he was apologizing but he felt someone must im warren its nice to meet you he gave his fathers name again nice to meet you the woman said and hurried off toward a wall of multicolored smears of abstract art no customers were waiting she simply retreated from her sons ugliness shes useless chris said come on my studios up here this is your moms place yeah chris said grudgingly the irony that she was providing chris studio space above her gallery when it could probably command a substantial rent was not lost on luke the whole interchange had the feel of a high schooler mouthing off to his mom trying to look cool in front of a new friend and revealing that he was simply an insecure jerk but luke said nothing chris had five locks on the door and it took him a minute to work all the keys five locks luke thought what are you up to that you need five locks inside the studio which doubled as a living space with an unmade bed shoved in a corner smelled of paint of stale coffee and weed of unwashed shirts exposed brick walls and clean skylights were the best features it was expansive room for a big talent to spread its wings but the art chris painted was very bad angry smears of red and black a brown earth hanging above a closing red hand penciled figures of suburbanites running from flowering napalm fires ugly luke thought another painting showed an array of fists connected with a spiders web of lines flame arcing along the threads a graffiti swirl of paint spelling an obscenity in cheerful rainbow colors in a font favored for childrens books a final one two teenagers scowling fire erupting from their heads as though they were volcanoes the two painted faces looked vaguely familiar but he couldnt place them nice luke didnt know what else to say and he was afraid to make no comment at all on the art how did one compliment death did this crap sell nice its not at all supposed to be nice chriss face reddened im sorry i meant to say it looks accomplished insightful compelling forgive my exhaustion chris took a deep breath as if drinking in the praise through a straw im influenced by the photojournalism of war and i transpose that on an american setting im sure they must sell well luke lied hell no theyll never sell theyll be recognized as great art one day but not while our diseased culture remains how do you pay the bills my dad builds homes thousands of them chris smirked you cant believe the waste you see in the modern suburban home the sheer extravagance of it all money that could feed half the world he shook his head well but people need houses luke said a light flared in chriss stare build large apartment buildings much more convenient much less ecological impact burn the cities to the ground man and stack the apartments high much less waste thats grim luke said you would have been a good architect in the soviet union he wandered past the paintings and as he turned back to chris chris was less than a foot away a devils curling smile on his face after i help you chris hissed are you laughing at me no not at all im sorry hed made a misstep chris didnt carry the singleminded stare that hed seen in snow and mouser the light in his eyes was something entirely different in its heat he had to make chris tell him what he needed to know but carefully im really surprised you trusted me with the money you dont know me i know your words thats the same to me chris lit a cigarette offered the pack to luke who shook his head his anger seemed gone quick as a snap of fingers so whats the information you have about the wreck in ripley it was a bomb old news next he smiled i bet you know who put it there yes luke lied the government he thought this story was exactly the kind of meat that chris liked to chew ah and you have proof of this in exchange for my many kindnesses to you i think i can find the proof if i had the right kind of help help i need to know if youre part of a group that can help me group the night road you want to know if im part of the night road he looked to lukes astonishment as if he might laugh yes thats a really good lie chris said better than i expected im not lying i i want in in what in whatever group youre a part of is it called the night road i like it kind of a twist on the shining path the peruvian terror group theyve lasted a good long time luke blinked hed made another misstep im not part of any group i thought your group could help me i dont care for liars you know what i mean the group your stepfather is putting together luke crossed his arms you know him oh god what if hed contacted henry told him luke was coming here yeah chris exhaled a stream of smoke i joined the online groups because no one believed as i did none of my family none of the people i tried to be friends with he caught himself and said none of my friends but you dont really belong to anything in this world the people in the internet groups theyre nothing but talk sound and fury signifying very little indeed he pointed out the painting of the fists connected by lines of fire thats what the online communities should be fire and action and burning this dirty nasty world to ash so we the right and noble people can start again but they arent now he turned his gaze to luke and lukes blood chilled this guy he realized wasnt just angry he was clinically crazy the triumph in chriss eyes was bent wrong ugly the new group youre in youre shutting me out now that just wont do the smile slid back onto the white mouth i told you im not part of any group he was suddenly more scared of this guy than he had been in the cottage kitchen with mouser chriss soft false grin was a mask for a different twisted darkness your stepfather contacted me luke a month ago wanted to meet me for coffee near the airport i recognized him from cnn yesterday talking about you a thrum of horror touched lukes chest did he say why he wanted to meet you this was it proof that henry had taken lukes research and personally reached out to the extremists and hed pissed this one off he found me through the ip address i used to post from he said he admired the beauty and logic of my arguments my passion its not the kind of invite i get every day i went and i had coffee with him he wore a heavy cap and different glasses and he spoke with a southern accent he seems to have lost when on television but its him but it didnt go well i can see judgment in eyes of lesser people im a threat to folks their sense of security because im smarter and more talented mother tells me everyones jealous it explains a lot but i wasnt good enough for him the awkward happiness hed shown earlier was gone replaced by a simmering fury can you imagine he was a threat because he was crazy luke realized not focused not disciplined like mouser or snow the army doesnt want the crazies neither does the night road crazies are a risk chris had not been invited to the party luke looked past chriss shoulder searching for a weapon a way to defend himself his gaze fell again on the paintings the fists bound in a web the two sullen teens with a wrench of his gut he recognized their faces the columbine gunmen maybe my stepfather didnt properly assess your potential contribution he wanted to know if id ever thought of turning my words to action did i have computer skills was i able to get money easily did i have contacts in the drug world please i dont cloud my head with drugs im a decent guy whos just sick of hypocrisy and i guess being a painter just isnt enough the sneer deepened i never heard from him again if he was contacting me about worldchanging work it stands to reason he was contacting others people hed found on the discussion boards who can make a difference so so youre valuable to him youre my invitation into his private club luke took a step backward youre wrong dead wrong you beg me for help and now you wont help me story of my life his anger turned into a pleading whine i could be of real value to you guys i can help you change the world i could finally he stopped and in lukes head he heard the sad simple truth i could have friends what was it like when even the fringes rejected you he saw an abyss in chriss anguished stare i am really really tired of being told im not good enough i caught you when no one else could so lets you and me call your stepfather and see what we can work out luke closed the three steps and he slammed his fist into chriss jaw it surprised them both chris crumpled and the pain from the blow rocketed up lukes arm did you tell my stepdad i was coming here luke yelled chris fingered blood from the corner of his mouth you hit me you cant hit me he sounded like a firstgrader outraged by a breach of playground etiquette answer me yeah i sold your ass i give you back i get in the night road i get to show how i can shine he glanced at his watch they should be here for you soon i just wanted you to know im much smarter than you much smarter than they are youre insane slowly chris got to his feet as though feeling his arms and legs for the first time the martial arts studio next door they teach krav maga you know the beauty of krav maga now youre raving he gave a disgusted huff krav maga is israeli selfdefense i joined because when the war comes i wanted to be ready people said i fought like i enjoyed it too much they kicked me out he rolled his eyes at this bit of insanity but i learned enough to break your bones youre not going anywhere and he rushed at luke the first series of precise blows sent luke reeling across the scattered sketches on chriss table his face already bruised from mousers blows hurt bonedeep he was going to get the snot beaten out of him by this freak no quarter is given in krav maga chris said with the calm of a lecturer he paused to pick luke up hammer his chest and face with a flurry of fists and shove him hard toward the scrawled paintings luke crashed into the bad art and a table of paint supplies he blinked past the pain in his jaw and his chest and saw chris sauntering toward him snapping fingers dancing on the balls of his feet lukes hands fumbled for an improvised weapons his fingertips roamed across brushes spilled water bottles a dried dirty palette his hand closed on a metal canister a spray paint can im necessary chris said to be given a high place in the emerging order everyone then will know my name know my art know my lukes back was to chris and as chris lifted a foot to hammer a kick into luke luke spun and fired a jet of red a scarlet mist caught chris in the face he howled and lurched back crimson frosted his eyeglasses and luke slammed a chair into his chest twice hard chris fell theyll know luke spat you dont know when to shut the hell up he ran for the door with five locks he pulled on the knob but it held fast he had to get out of here this guy was nuts and maybe mouser and snow were on their way looking at the garish paintings he hadnt noticed chris lock the door behind him he flipped the deadbolts still the door was locked it required a key youre not leaving chris staggered to his feet bleeding hard from his nose like luke was smiling through blood and red paint not when youre my ticket to glory man give me the keys luke said chris fell against a table and luke could see a huge shard from the chair lodged near his ear creating a bloody mess luke charged toward him chris yanked a drawer open luke thought it would be a gun chris wouldnt rely on fists now that hed been hurt luke saw the fire escape on the other side of the window and ran for it a trio of shots shattered the window seconds after he stepped out onto the fire escape and slid down the stairs glass hit his hair the sound was loud bright in the afternoon air cutting through the hubbub of traffic sounds of wicker park he clattered down the fire escape and dropped onto the hood of chriss porsche denting it with his weight he heard chris howl above him like a wounded creature luke bolted out into a wide street stumbling into the path of a taxicab which berated him with a long drawn honk of the horn he broke into a hard run he had to get off the street before chris saw him he ran behind another squat building decorated with garish neon into a web of alleyways turn right turn left he came up behind a bakery that gave off a motherly scent of chocolate and almonds and a corner bar open early for happy hour at the end of the alley was a construction fence luke scrambled over it and he heard the wail of a siren police fear opened like a fist in his chest someone had called probably reporting chriss shots he ran through a passageway that backed a blocks worth of restaurants and storefronts he thought of hiding inside a dumpster but hiding might mean capture he had to get free and clear of the neighborhood at the end of the alley fronting onto a quiet street a police patrol car wheeled past luke ducked behind a dumpster peered around its edge the police car was gone he ran from the dumpsters shadow and tried a doorknob locked he ran down to another door tested it it opened onto a small kitchen way two men short latino glanced up from scraping a grille hamburger scented the air and he heard a radio playing a murmur of spanish music sorry sorry he said sidling past them and one of the cooks said what the hell this isnt the front door in rapid spanish luke ignored him and hurried out onto the dining room floor the restaurant was a small spotless diner a few tables a chalkboard announcing burgers sandwiches a lunch special of meat loaf and garlic mashed potatoes a few late lunchers sat huddled at the tables including most of the wait staff a waitress was erasing the boards to write the dinner specials luke ran past her and the smells of comfort food and out onto a street this avenue was busier filled with cafes a scattering of funky clothing shops an irish pub the police car turned back onto the street toward him he stepped into the nearest business a small flower shop the air was thick with the smell of blossoms and clean water no one stood at the counter but the doors attached bells jingled his arrival he saw a heavy plastic curtain behind it were large plastic containers of cut flowers he moved past the curtain headed toward the back door the front door jangled behind him hi officer can i help you he heard a voice say on the other side of the curtain then silence the police had seen him come in they were looking for him or his movements had incurred suspicion he reached the back door eased it open closed it behind him through a small window he saw the officer move into position on the other side of the window he stumbled into the alley it was already shadowed the afternoon light dying in the narrow passage officers chris practically screamed in his ear here he is his face was red with the slash of paint he closed arms around luke he shot up my studio hes nuts chris screeched through his painted clowns grin police stop the cop hurried out into the alley luke froze help me he said this guy tried to shoot me the officer took a measured look at lukes face seemed to study the hair the bruises luke jameson dantry on the ground now the officer barked his orders luke obeyed im unarmed he said he fired the shots sir not me just like a criminal chris said hes lying i caught him you on the ground too the cop ordered chris obeyed luke felt the officer patting him down heard the clink of cuffs being removed from a belt it took it back to the horrors of the bed in the cabin no i dont want to be handcuffed please please dont im not the bad guy here his voice rose into a yell he yanked one hand away buried it under his chest the officer fought to regain control of lukes arms stop resisting are you luke jameson dantry the officer yelled yes sir and i have information on a dangerous group of people please dont please dont cuff me please the officer started yelling into his shoulder mike still trying to slap the cuffs on luke while luke bucked and kicked luke turned his head and he saw a figure at the end of the alley snow smiling at him luke screamed officer look out her hand came up and luke didnt see the gun but the short sharp thweet s were loud in the shadowed alley the cop dropped midsentence two holes painting his face the blood hit lukes hands and he retreated behind the trashcans done a snap of the fingers luke could hear her walking toward him the click of her boots on the pavement not rushing because she didnt know if chris was armed he felt he could read her mind understand her approach youre chris right he heard snow say as she came forward friendliness in the tone yes i am chris stood with ugly triumph his genius had finally been recognized are you here to help me baby i am snow said and she shot him chris collapsed against the dumpster as he died the surprise faded from his eyes replaced by the blankness of a world without anger come on schoolboy time to go home she said as she approached luke saw the policemans service piece still holstered and yanked the gun free he fired a blast at snow wide then fired again as she took cover behind a pile of discarded pallets the second bullet caught her he saw her shoulder jerk saw a stain on her jacket she didnt scream she gritted teeth like hed only dealt her a wasps sting and aimed again he fired and turned and ran down the alley he vaulted a fence to the other side of the street her bullets powered into the fence a bare inch from his hands as he went over the top he fell onto the wooden fences other side and ran he kept running for six more blocks no sign of her hed wounded her so badly she couldnt give chase sirens pierced the air in a deserted alley luke threw the policemans gun in a trashcan if he got caught holding a dead cops gun he found a discarded newspaper and he wiped the blood from his hands and his face he could hear the rumble of an elevated train chicagos answer to the subway and he ran until he saw the damen station he fed money into a machine it spit a card pass at him my god she killed a cop i hope i killed her the realization cut past the pain from the shrapnel the officer radioed they had me knew my name and now hes dead luke stumbled onto a blue line train headed toward the loop insanity the officer was just doing his job the entire citys police force would be hunting luke with an intensity he could barely imagine he could not long evade their search he sat down and studied the trains map his hands shook and he thought he might vomit when the train braked and then lurched back into motion he tried not to look at anyone no one seemed interested in him he looked a little rough and grimy and no one wanted trouble making eye contact with him what now he had one choice and he had to get there before snow and mouser eric lindoe he had to find him luke did not know chicago well and he was unsure how to reach erics bank he got off at a station downtown he wandered into a bookstore and used the coffee bars internet connection to find erics business address at the private bank it was on lasalle avenue in the financial district ten minutes later he stood outside erics office in the fading sunlight a news vendor nearby had a radio playing and luke drifted close enough to hear a report of a police shooting an officer and a civilian down only two chris was for sure dead which meant that he had only winged snow and she had slipped away every inch of his skin went cold he kept seeing the officers face a man just doing his job and now dead for it he pulled out the cheap cell phone hed bought in braintree called gave the operator a brief precise description of snow and mouser as the shooters then he dismantled the phone dropping its guts into the trash ill make them pay for you officer luke thought lukes stomach rumbled he bought a mustardsmeared hot dog and an apple juice from a street vendor and he ate the food without tasting it three bites into the dog eric lindoe kidnapper and murderer hurried out of the highwindowed glass lobby of the skyscraper glanced at his watch and walked away he wore a long coat a cap pulled low over his face dark glasses and a look of utter guilt luke followed him eric lindoe stepped onto the third car of a brown line train staying well back luke stepped onto the fourth car nestled close to the doors he hoped that at each stop he could step out to see if eric disembarked the first stop luke eased out a foot onto the platform pretending to make way for departing passengers holding the door he got a couple of thankyous which was more attention than he liked eric stayed on the car so did luke more stops the train headed north he felt like the doorman the woman next to him had a smartphone she was reading cnns news feed on it luke glanced at it over her shoulder all bad news but worse than usual an explosion in canada had ruptured and shut down an oil pipeline a recall of a million pounds of ground beef from a plant in tennessee after several people in twelve states got sick yesterday with e coli a note sent to the local paper claimed the poisoning had been on purpose an attack on the american food system authorities said they had no proof yet of malicious intent a young actress of note was in rehab the houston hobo shooting with its unexpected tie to a washington power players son remained unsolved a chicago police officer and a bystander had been shot and killed an hour ago in wicker park his story the woman kept her back to him but she sensed his uncomfortable closeness and he saw her back stiffen he moved away locked his gaze to the floor the police would dig into chriss mess of a life and find that chris sent money to buy a bus ticket and the authorities would figure out the recipient was luke chriss mother would not remember her sons cruelties but rather lukes face and chris and the officer lay dead together in an alley he could not let eric slip through his fingers he had to force him to tell the truth because luke knew his life was gone destroyed mangled in a way that could not be set right again if he had selfdestructed turned away from a woman he loved become a drunk lost himself in work and neglected the rest of his life then the fracturing of his life would have been easier to accept but this he had no idea why he had been destroyed no idea why a man who called him son had used him and betrayed him so deeply he had no trail to follow except eric if he lost eric now in the crowd or because someone recognized him and grabbed him he was finished the train stopped at the armitage station eric rushed out surrounded by a pool of other commuters from the third car he would have to walk past luke to reach the ground exit luke hung back and followed letting eric storm a good ten feet ahead of him the flock of commuters marched from the elevated platform to a metal stairway eric headed down and luke risked drawing closer only five people separating him from his kidnapper if eric glanced over his shoulder he would see luke eric reached armitage avenue went through the exit gate luke stopped behind a pillar and waited watched eric hesitate and then eric crossed the street under the elevated rails dismissing the jeer of annoyed car honks with a polite gentlemanly wave of his hand luke followed staying on the opposite side of armitage trying to keep him in view trying not to be noticed thin trees stood on his side of the street and he tried to stay close to them not be noticed feeling vulnerable as he tracked eric lincoln park banners on the streetlights announced the neighborhoods name was a wellheeled neighborhood high on charm factor storefronts nice retail and restaurants with apartments and offices on the higher floors eric turned into a small candy shop luke fought the urge to stop he walked on risking a single glance back no eric luke stopped at the end of the block he felt horribly conspicuous just standing there five minutes passed he walked back another halfblock toward the candy store paused to study the posted menu on an italian bistro when he dared a glance over his shoulder he saw eric six steps out from the candy store thank god i didnt cross the street luke thought heading on his original course a bag of candies in his hand eric walked glancing down at his phone tapping out a number with his thumb luke let him pass his position careful to keep his back turned toward eric when luke turned back eric was gone as though the street had swallowed him whole panic clutched lukes chest he scanned the street again eric was tall he couldnt have vanished off the street luke scanned the storefronts a wine store a small bookshop womens clothing boutiques a fancy kids clothing store eric could have gone into any of them he could be watching luke from any of them luke retreated into the doorway of a small bar he could hear the thrum of music he checked his watch two men moved past luke laughing and opened the bar door letting a blast of sound a jangle of folksy guitars and laughter rise from inside eric stepped out of the wine shop a neat paper bag in his hands he didnt glance over at luke he was fifteen feet ahead of him and across the street candy and wine luke wondered if eric was going to spend an evening with aubrey had he just stepped back into his normal life after murder and kidnapping luke walked slowly trying to keep a few cars in the diagonal angle between him and eric he crossed the street dodging traffic he gained on eric hurrying now not running he got up five feet behind him but he couldnt grab him on the street people would notice and maybe he still had the gun he kept at lukes throat and ribs eric spoke into his phone yeah a large vegetarian thin crust yeah for crosby grace grace crosby luke remembered the name the young blogger who had raised the alarm that aubrey was missing it was the clue that had led him to chicago eric turned into a side street and luke dropped back let eric walk ahead he had gotten too close a gaggle of young women early twenties loud laughing stylish and they knew it walked between him and eric and he used them as camouflage crossing the street the women peeled away heading down armitage toward an italian restaurant eric walked up a stone flight of stairs into a condo building luke followed eric vanished into the entryway luke hurried to the bottom of the stairs and counted to ten he walked up slowly he couldnt see into the buildings entryway the glass was leaded and shaded an array of buttons announced the residents last names crosby was listed he could buzz in twenty minutes pretend to be the pizza guy but if he timed it wrong if the pizza guy arrived while he was heading up the stairs or trying to find the right condo he considered he might not have enough time to make it then eric would be on guard better to wait not get caught in a time trap the pizza guy came up the side street twenty minutes later indian looking harried snuffling like he was losing a battle against a cold the pizza guy hurried up the steps and luke took a chance you got a pie for crosby uh yeah luke flashed a twenty and a ten its mine the pizza guy looked again at the slip you dont look like a grace im a greg they keyed my name in wrong and theyve never fixed it how much im supposed to deliver it to the door well then you can follow me on up i called it in on my way home got scared youd beat me here youre talking too much luke thought he stuck the money out the pizza guy took it started digging for change you can keep it luke said and tell them its greg not grace sure sir thanks luke made a show of opening the box inspecting the pie a waft of fragrant steam stroked his face and he breathed in the scent of mushrooms olives and garlic the slip read crosby grace apt he glanced over his shoulder made sure the delivery guy was hurrying back to his car and was out of earshot he pressed crosby on the callboard long silence and then aubreys voice burned into his brain the voice that had begged eric lindoe to spare his life yes he glanced at the slip romanos pizza maam come on up she sounded tired the door buzzed and he pushed his weight against it the foyer was tiny and tiled and the only sound was the huff of his own breathing he ignored the small elevator and headed up the stairs considering his plan of attack his hair was a different color he wore sunglasses through a peephole expecting to see a pizza deliveryman would she recognize him he thought of holding the pizza box at such an angle that it masked part of his face but that would look suspicious and if eric came to the door hed recognize luke no doubt theyd spent far too much time together he kept up the stairs reaching the fourth and top floor the hallway bent in regular ninetydegree angles the walls boasted new paint but the carpet appeared worn from behind the door of the apartment closest to the stairway he heard a low thump then a womans voice saying turn it off boys dinners ready he found he crept up to the door and listened he heard the soft murmur of the television turned to local news no sound of conversation it was one of two apartments tucked into the corner of the hallway the irregular grouping of doors suggested some apartments were larger than others it gave him an idea the closest apartment to was and he tiptoed toward the door he pressed his ear against the wood and listened hard no sound of television music or movement he knocked lightly hopeful that neither eric nor aubrey would hear no answer he risked a louder knock no answer he stationed himself leaning against the wall back toward slouching a bit pizza held aloft pizza he announced with a louder knock pizza hello no answer but he heard the door to ten feet behind him creak open hey thats ours eric he sounded tired pizza luke repeated keeping his back to eric slouching against the doorframe he cussed softly in garbled words hoping he sounded vaguely russian or serbian he wanted eric to think he was a confused immigrant new to making deliveries he heard the whisper of feet on carpet youre at the wrong door dude thats our pizza eric said luke turned and let the surprise dawn onto erics face then he powered his fist into erics gut hard eric bent stumbled onto the dropped pizza box and luke hit him again square in the jaw pain bit into his fist eric staggered back and aimed his own fist at lukes face hit lukes jaw luke fell against the wall heard shattering glass he reached into the broken fire extinguisher holder he pulled out the extinguisher and slammed it into erics face heard the crunch eric fell back blood gushing from nose and mouth moaning luke seized him by the throat and bumrushed him into aubreys apartment he kicked the door closed the condo was small and neat most of it had a minimalist sleek feel clean woods and chrome a geometric rug on the floor blotchy modern art on the walls a framed photo on the mantle of a couple not aubrey and eric across the living room was a small kitchen and aubrey stepped into the doorway a glass of red wine in her hand she dropped the glass it shattered at her feet with a plum spray you scream or run and i swear to god ill bash his head in luke still had the fire extinguisher and he hoisted it to club eric dont hurt him she said please fright whitened her cheeks what the hell are you doing here who else is here luke asked no one aubrey answered she looked tired but lovely the grime of her ordeal gone she wore jeans and a black sweater and her dark hair was pulled back into a ponytail wheres grace crosby with her husband hes a lawyer at a conference in detroit gone through the weekend we decided to hide here hide wheres erics gun she glanced at eric her voice had a warm rasp to it chicago river i made him get rid of it please eric said please just leave us alone you have to be kidding me leave you alone luke forced eric against the wall frisked him under the suit jacket no gun eric tried to jerk away luke swung the extinguisher and it caromed hard off erics head into the wall and back against his skull eric fell into a crunch clutching his head luke glanced up aubrey was gone he bolted through the dining room and saw the bedroom door starting to slam he kicked it open the wood splintered above the knob but she didnt fold pushing the door back toward him he squeezed through grabbed the back of her sweater as she lunged for the phone he clamped a hand over her mouth to keep her scream locked in her jaws eric kidnapped me he hissed in her ear as he hauled her kicking back down the hall she was wirystrong determined and she knocked him against the wall twice before he got the leverage to muscle her down the hallway eric still was in the apartment he could have run and he hadnt not without aubrey luke saw eric stood on unsteady feet and raised a bloody hand dont hurt her i dont want to hurt anyone aubrey luke yelled shed nearly wrenched loose from his grasp stop it you know he kidnapped me to rescue you i was your ransom now she grew still you know what else he did eric wiped his face with the sleeve of his suit aubrey hes a liar i told you what kind of guy he is you know how much i risked to save you he grabbed me at the austin airport he threatened to shoot a family if i yelled for help forced me to drive to houston and he shot a helpless man dead in the street shot him in cold blood aubrey moaned into the cup of his hand started struggling against him and then he got a phone call telling him where you were and you know he left me in your place aubrey went still aubrey dont listen i did it all for you erics words cracked like falling china yes he did he did it all every rotten thing ive described you know what he is aubrey tell me what am i aubrey lukes palm was just above her mouth and the feather of her breath tickled his skin i dont know anything he didnt tell me anything please just leave us alone i know you think he saved you luke said fine hes your hero i dont care but he has to tell the police about what he did eric started shaking his head fury and hate in his face you have to we go to the police together we tell them everything about the night road ive been running like hell since i got away from that cabin and im done this is the only way to save us both eric were going to the police together no no luke glanced at aubrey did he tell you why you were kidnapped aubrey nodded a woman wanted access to money from accounts he controls but he doesnt control the money your stepfather does money fifty million dollars that belongs to some very very bad people theyre tied to an extremist network that might be responsible for the train bombing down in texas he he aubrey blinked glanced at eric its okay baby eric put his bloodied face in his hands dont call me baby she said and luke saw her words sliced into his heart luke knelt by eric this jane woman who is she how does she know about you and my stepfather i dont know obviously or i would have called the police she said aubrey would be killed if i didnt do what she said and id do anything for aubrey anything he shoved his whole world into that word anything aubrey stiffened under the grip of lukes arm she looked confused eric had lied to her to protect himself as her rescuing knight and luke was going to have to destroy the illusion aubrey luke made his voice quiet i dont want to hurt you or even him just leave aubrey out of this ill go to the cops with you ill talk just leave her out of this all the threat the bravado seemed gone from eric as though given the time to contemplate his crimes shame had found a home but that didnt mean he wasnt still going to run especially if hed tapped into that fifty million he would have the resources to vanish and luke might never find him again dont be fooled luke thought he is a dangerous guy and now youve cornered him no shes a witness she talks too otherwise were the two assholes in a beamer who killed a defenseless street person and no one can corroborate our story would you please let me tend to him she said no talk first he answers my questions before we go to the cops eric got up from the floor sat on the sofa took off his suit coat he folded the fabric carefully put it against the blood welling from his face although the flow had stopped ill buy your friend a new couch aubrey if i get blood on this one for gods sakes eric luke heard a resignation and a soft quiet grief in her voice an impatience that he didnt understand just tell him what he wants to know for my sake eric blinked how are you and my stepfather connected i got a call by a friend of mine to provide private banking services to move some money in from overseas i had no idea it was connected to anything criminal luke wasnt sure he believed that but eric wasnt about to damn himself further in aubreys eyes eric was watching her reactions as closely as he was watching lukes your father was the contact but you disguised your voice i was ordered to do so the voice modulator came with the phone jane sent me after aubrey was kidnapped why would it matter that henry not recognize erics voice the reasonable answer was that there was an advantage for jane if eric was not identified as his kidnapper why would jane care if eric was known to be the kidnapper was jane now somehow protecting eric who was this bizarre mysterious woman aubrey who grabbed you luke asked aubrey sat next to eric put an arm around his shoulder i never saw a face i was leaving my office working late on my own and suddenly a burlap sack it reeked of onions its all i really remember yanked over my head and i felt a needle go into my arm i woke up tied up in the trunk of a car blindfolded i think i had been unconscious for a very long time the car stopped she hesitated touched fingertips to temples as though in pain someone dragged me inside that cabin down in texas chained me to the bed the kidnapper left without saying a word i managed to get the hood off my face i lay there for i dont know maybe a day and a half before you and eric came it felt like forever was the kidnapper a woman maybe jane might have done her own dirty work aubrey glanced at eric maybe i dont know are you two married aubrey shook her head wed been dating for several months we broke up late last week but i guess the kidnappers didnt get the memo were back together eric started eric the word short and sharp was like a closing door i never wanted you hurt or involved eric said i never really knew you aubrey said thats the worst i never knew what you were capable of you proved your love and lost it all at once luke realized that perhaps the same trap had been intended for henry the kidnapping had exposed henrys crimes to luke destroyed his vision of his stepfather as a decent man the ugliness of the truth hed spoken hung in the air between them dont whine aubrey said you can still have my respect if youll just be honest please tell him about this night road eric frowned letting the weight of the world settle on his shoulders i dont know exactly what they are a group of people scattered around the country a client at the bank ordered me to set up several bank accounts for them at different banks around the country i did so but jane wanted all those accounts closed that was the first part of the ransom close the accounts second was killing the man in houston third and last was grabbing you he was lying luke was sure jane didnt ask you for the money i didnt have the money yet your stepfather controlled it thats why jane asked him for it not me eric turned the knife you heard him say no luke he put the fifty million ahead of you luke ignored the jab whos this client who had you set up these bank accounts a company called travport theyre a cargo aviation firm they fly all over the world entirely respectable where are they based dubai but owned by saudis fifty million dollars for the night road to create chaos and further their agendas through violence through fear through their little wars and wars needed money like the body needed blood for attacks like ripley how much terror could fifty million dollars buy hed sent henry six thousand names from his online research if henry recruited fifty dedicated radicals for the night road they could each receive a million dollars how many guns how many payoffs how many weapons and explosives could all that buy terrorism was relatively cheap a million could fund a huge string of attacks and added all together fifty million horror swept up him like a flame if you were getting accounts ready to put this fifty million in you must know where the cash is coming from he was suddenly sure of it what had henry said first i will not pay not can not i will not you convinced jane you didnt have the access that my stepfather did henrys the big dog im just hired help wheres the money eric wheres it coming from who would just give fifty million dollars to a bunch of american extremists if i know then thats my insurance isnt it no one can touch the money but me eric lifted his chin in defiance you have the money luke said slowly yes i have it we can hide anywhere in the world ill give you a slice luke well all hide well all have a real life again oh god eric aubrey put her face back in her hands just tell us where it is the one thing the money wont protect you from is a murder charge luke said i can testify you killed that man under duress eric shifted in his seat im not going to tell you where the money is you dont need to know luke tried another tact who was the man in houston you killed his name is allen clifford i dont know anything else about him i was just told where he would be what he would look like jane emailed me a picture allen clifford the name meant nothing to luke he tried to think how jane could have entered this picture an extremist network created by henry funded by erics mysterious corporate client with the money handed out by eric jane was ruining the night roads plans but who was she who else would know about the existence of the night road except people like chris whod been approached and rejected who was jane luke asked give me the phone jane sent you luke held out his hand eric hesitated give it to him aubrey said please hes smart hes gotten this far maybe he can figure out whos after us eric tossed it to him luke caught it i want to know why you havent already run and hid with this fifty million luke said you could buy a lot of protection with it you could cut one of those deals you loved to mention luke stopped maybe you already have eric stared at him an answer starting to form on his lips the lights went out it took three phone calls for mouser to find the right kind of doctor for snow he called henry and screamed into his voicemail while snow bled in the back seat snow kept laughing i never saw one die she said bombs put a distance between me and them but the gun jesus that was cool i saw it happen then she would scream and laugh and clutch at her shoulder she never complained quickly henry called back steered him to a doctor on the western edge of downtown chicago the doctors medical license was long suspended because shed burned through too many prescription pads in a year and once paroled she was a resource for the gangbangers and the mob when they needed needles and sutures the doctor worked at a shoddy sandwich joint on a narrow street her apartment was above the shop he carried snow up the stairs and the doctor met him at the door still with a hair net on her head and hands bright with vinegar and oil but her demeanor was brisk and efficient and the apartment was spotlessly clean the doctor helped him get snow into a small bedroom stuffed with medical gear outside the doctor ordered its gonna be okay he said to snow im going to kill him for you no ill kill schoolboy for me she whispered i dont wish to hear these promises the doctor said outside please sir he realized that he could care about snow it was unsettling he sat on the couch in the apartment and an hour later the doctor emerged he had been watching the news accounts of the shooting no mention of snow or him or anyone fitting their descriptions fleeing the scene the doctor dropped a bullet in his hand since you seem sentimental about revenge she asked you to keep this for her ill bet she did mouser closed his fist around the bullet she needs rest but she will be fine bullet in the meat of the shoulder didnt hit anything major but shes going to be sore for several days ill give you a couple of bottles of painkillers and gear to tend the wound you know how to change a dressing yes maam i gave her blood i keep a stash rest will set her straight good luck can she stay here while she recovers let me suggest a motel nearby you can recover in privacy and im close enough to come tend to her if needed he felt a surge of gratitude this was why he was glad to be part of the night road it had gotten him this doctor without the night road he would have had nowhere to turn can i see her yeah ill get your goods ready then i will look at your leg change the dressing she told me you needed care as well snow lay in the bed she seemed smaller she stared at the ceiling the room smelled of blood and chemicals and wet paper he took her hand she pulled free from his fingers which surprised him more dont be mad he said schoolboys gotten away from us three times now its embarrassing hes a nothing he crossed his arms did you have to kill the cop and the little freak her eyes halflidded opened widely yes the cop was the greater threat the little freak would have been stuck on us like a flea on a dog wanting to be our new best friend according to what henry said she put the flat of her hand over her eyes the nerve of that bastard shooting me the doctor came in clucked over mousers stab wound she changed the bandage and told snow shed done a good job tending to mouser snow thanked her they left and got settled into a cheap motel the room was clean smelled of disinfectant and the cable tv worked he tucked snow into bed gently she watched him dont get all sweet on me she said sleepy from the medications i dont do sweet she gave out a soft growl of a laugh she touched the back of his hand tenderly he didnt know what to say his phone buzzed mouser henry asked me to call you we have a lead on your targets one of henrys friends another member of the night road he thought the voice was dry southern a lead on eric lindoe and his girl theyre in thailand according to henry no they were ticketed on the flight but they were not repeat not on the arrival manifest they didnt get on the plane no charges on their cards in thailand no records of their passports going through thai customs we cracked the relevant databases fifteen minutes ago where are they they might still be in chicago no ones looking for them there oh yes please he thought where in chicago they have not used credit cards they could be staying with a friend we checked aubreys phone records and several of her calls are placed to a woman named grace crosby i did a crosscheck and grace crosbys credit card was charged in detroit today so crosby might have let them stay in her apartment while shes gone where is this apartment the voice fed him an address in lincoln park i can be there in twenty minutes call me when you get there i can give you a gift what i can cut the power to the building another friend gave us a tap into the power grid i can kill the power in the whole neighborhood we mastered how to do this in preparation for hellfire make the overall situation during the attack worse you know he thanked his fellow night roader and hung up wow work as a team effort hope stirred in his chest this would all be resolved soon the loose ends tied into neat knots the money in the right pockets again mouser leaned close to snow she was fast asleep he risked the slightest kiss on her forehead she didnt stir he headed for his car the warmth of her still on his lips luke froze in the darkness silence hung between the three of them and then eric said this isnt coincidence no way you were followed me no i followed you i wasnt you dont know what these people are capable of eric said youve just killed us all they found us we had them tricked into believing wed gone to thailand its just a blackout it had to be the night road couldnt control the power to a city utility youre an idiot you found these scumbags for henry and now youre going to underestimate them theyve put major plans into place for a massive attack screwing with the power grid is entirely possible for them terror wrenched his words into a halfscream aubrey said we have to get out of here now steel calm coated her voice luke went to the window they cant have killed the power to the whole neighborhood but he could only see light in a distant gleam several streets away holy god his surprise was eclipsed by an immediate sense of danger in the hallway they could hear rumbling voices calling out to each other neighbors hailing neighbors they could be waiting for us in the hallway luke said theres not a fire escape aubrey said the ledge is wide enough maybe eric started are you insane luke grabbed his arm were not climbing the outside of the building you dont know what were up against these people theyre brutal lets go please panic now creeping into aubreys voice take her with you eric said he went into the kitchen rummaged in a drawer and produced a flashlight they want me they want the money take her with you let them chase me no you come with us aubrey said im not leaving you she sounded outraged at the suggestion i cant ill stay here make a deal with the night road the money was key to the night roads survival luke realized it had to be funds for a cataclysm far bigger than the train bombing in texas it couldnt fall into their hands so eric had to come with them forget it eric were sticking together luke opened the door most of the neighbors huddled in the hallway a few with flashlights luke heard laughter the pop of a beer can opening people making the convivial best of the blackout not wanting to sit alone in the dark luke grabbed aubreys arm she was the only way he could ensure eric stayed with them she didnt pull her arm away as they winded through the hallway the stairways ahead to your left aubrey said his circle of light found the door he eased the door open the stairway was pitchdark luke had to assume the worst where will they strike the stairways and hallways were crowded right now and mouser and snow would want privacy to kill him the staircase would spit them out into the foyer he pictured the small lobby in his mind the staircase on the far left side the oldstyle tile flooring the dimensions of the room if you wanted to ambush someone it was close to a front exit in the confusion snow and mouser could be out in the street and gone in seconds he stopped and aubrey ran into his back stop at the second floor were not going out into the lobby they went down the stairs and opened the second floor door and the hallway was empty is there an exit to the back only through the lobby not from the residential floors stop eric said luke pulled the light toward his face and eric blinked im going to talk to whoevers after us ill make a deal eric sounded confident again they wont stop to talk they will with me im calling the shots luke im sorry talk later move now please aubrey said then she gave a gasp and in the disc of the flashlights glow luke saw the pistol in erics hand waiting in the lobby for his targets to emerge mouser had not foreseen a big problem people with flashlights in a darkened building tend to shine the circle of light square in the faces of people nearby they expect to see neighbors and maintenance men and they have a sudden bright suspicion of people they dont know mouser edged back toward a column two older women were standing in the lobby miffed at the inconvenience of ruined dinners and one kept pointing a light in his direction im sorry she finally said do you live in the building no maam my friend does and she asked me to wait in the lobby whos your friend grace crosby the answer seemed to satisfy the woman well they better get the power back on we got halfcooked pork chops sitting in a skillet told you we should have baked them the other woman said oven would have finished the job kept em hot the first woman growled in annoyance and agreement but she performed a valuable service for mouser she flashed her light toward every entrant into the lobby from the stairwell as regular as a sentry so he would see aubrey and eric before they saw him and they would be blinded for a second or two his hand in his coat pocket held a glock he could kill the woman immediately hustle eric to a place where he could be questioned and find the missing money if the two elderly women got in the way too bad darkness and chaos would give him cover enough to escape with eric then the job would be done and he could take snow someplace safe they would have their reward they could start to reshape the world make hellfire happen and begin to truly kill the beast sooner or later his targets would come ten minutes went by and they hadnt appeared the stair door clanged again and the old woman shone light against unfamiliar faces and he knew hed worried too much about extracting eric quickly onto the street wrong approach in the blackout he headed for the stairwell when eric got the flashlight luke realized aubrey had a gun hidden in the apartment and eric grabbed the gun when he got the flashlight aubrey come here eric said aubrey stayed put this is insane eric just stop it hes going to force my hand im not going to the police neither are you if hes gone were free free luke said theyre not here for us theyre here for him bull theyre here for eric and their fifty million bucks and he knows it luke said thats why he offered to go talk to them unless that was just his way of abandoning you aubrey and he was going to run for his own sorry life once he hit the front door thats a lie eric snapped eric stop it aubrey said dont you switch sides on me aubrey not after all i did for you luke shone the light on her face and her expression had turned angry youre an asshole she told eric i should have broken up with you ages ago you are not a hero stop this we need each other luke said spare me the idiotic lets work together sentiment eric said aubrey move away from him and go where aubrey stayed at lukes side where are we supposed to hide how are we supposed to live that way theres no rock quite big enough for us to set up housekeeping i could have left you to die aubrey all the warmth bled out of erics voice but it wasnt replaced by anger luke heard anguish and bitterness i gave up everything for you even after you dumped me eric its not too late i killed a man for you jesus you dont get a doover i killed him under coercion under stress aubreys voice went soft cajoling you could get everything back but this is not the way to save our lives give me the gun luke said i know youre a good man at heart eric aubrey said i know youre scared i know what you wanted for you and me but this isnt the way luke moved the light towards erics face thinking he could blind him break his resolve we have to get out of here assume they want to flush you out of hiding force you to tell them where the money is that means they might be waiting down in the lobby or the street it wasnt so different he thought when he stole food in his runaway days if you had to hide you did not hide in an obvious place we need another way out we need to hide where they wont expect us to be i have an idea aubrey said mouser hurried up the stairs and as he hit the door the lights surged back into life the power company had overridden the darkness hed been promised no matter he reached the crosby apartment tested the knob unlocked he opened it scanned the room with his glock moved from room to room a shattered glass a gush of red wine a fire extinguisher blots of blood on the carpet the apartment was empty they had not exited through the lobby hed have seen them in the windows as he approached they must still be in the building so where would they hide a neighbors unlikely this wasnt aubrey and erics real home they wouldnt know the neighbors so they had to be on the roof or in the basement the roof would be a dead end the basement would offer service exits maybe onto a back entrance or alley mouser hurried down to the lobby then across it till he found the basement entrance and headed down the stairs a faint red glow from the emergency lights led downward the red gleam like a mockery of hell trust me i can cut a deal eric said i can reason with them ive been planning on it of course he was because he was treating the money like a bulletproof shield luke thought they dont want to negotiate theyll force you to hand over the money and theyll kill you luke pushed him along into the depths of the basement part of the floor was being renovated into groundlevel units but an open stretch of space at the back contained electrical equipment a nesting of pipes and a set of industrial water heaters the disorder created a maze of construction junk halfwalls and maintenance equipment the power surged back on maybe hes gone aubrey said luke reached to the switch and killed the lights again lets see if we can wait him out eric give me the gun luke said no if this is the same guy whos after me if he sees you with a gun hell just shoot you no time for a deal luke said i know what im doing im keeping the gun im not going to let them hurt aubrey luke heard a door open above they hid in the labyrinth of pipes kneeling to the cool concrete floor in their hiding place aubrey was further back then luke then eric close to the front luke raised a finger to his lips luke listened hard a footstep another in the trickle of the light he peered between the pipes and a black form passed between the far wall and a table of tools stopped listened in the thin red light eric stood and came out from the hiding place and walked toward the figure luke went still if he yelled he would betray himself and aubrey but eric was already betraying them hey eric said quietly night road the shadow gave no answer luke stifled the urge to run in blind panic eric was either going to save them or hand them over to this enemy im eric lindoe i know who you are it was mouser ive been carrying your picture in my pocket i thought i was gonna get a nice vacation in thailand chasing you down how you doing his tone was relaxed friendly you look beat up aubrey closed her hand over lukes arm im okay eric answered wheres your girlfriend mr lindoe mouser asked shes someplace safe you dont need to worry about her shell stay quiet about this mess but luke dantrys gone excuse me theres an alley exit for maintenance delivery on the other side of the basement he went out the door luke dantry was here yes how long ago mouser was already turning to run five minutes i doubt youll catch him silence again lukes heartbeat rattled like wind in a chimney mouser said you have a lot of explaining to do you have our money yes but ive kept it safe for you thats a pisspoor interpretation of the situation mouser said i know where the moneys hidden id like to trade that information fine trade it for your continued breathing wheres our money eric made no answer there was only the creaking of the building its bones settling and stirring the outside hum of traffic the distant murmur of voices luke could feel aubreys breath against his shoulder lets make a deal eric said after a deep breath if i give you the money then you let me walk away because im done with the night road i want out mousers voice devolved into a low hiss were not negotiating you tell me where the money is or you die five four three okay heres the deal immunity for me and my girlfriend from henry from the night road all i did was cause a hiccup in the plan just to get my girlfriend back i give you the money we walk away from each other i just want out free and clear except i need more than the money what this british woman this jane shes the night roads enemy mouser said we need to find her find out how she knows about us because thats the ticket aint nobody supposed to know about us about what were planning about hellfire i have no idea who she is all i can give you is the money and then the knife twisted luke dantry knows hes figured out youre the people he found for his stepfather he wont stay quiet well call henry well talk to him on the phone together between the pipes luke saw eric sag in relief except the word hung in the air like a sword ready to slash i would like to know a couple of details what you and your lady friend were on a flight manifest to thailand now how the hell did that happen if you didnt get on the plane eric was silent you buy a ticket yes but we didnt use the tickets but you dont get on the manifest unless you use the ticket how did you get on that list i dont know clerical error what does it matter a panicky edge touched erics voice it matters somebodys trying very hard to protect you eric somebody with the rather impressive power to alter a flight manifest tell me whos protecting you eric the silence from eric told luke that mouser had hit a nerve had seen the key in erics deceptions finally eric said hoarse no ones trying to protect me you cut a deal with someone else maybe with someone powerful whod hide you if you betrayed the night road whispered all our secrets in their ear maybe let you keep a chunk of our fifty million no but eric pushed to the limit sounded as though he were about to cry did that same someone powerful offer a deal to luke dantry does luke know where the money is no i want a name eric who is protecting you no one luke peered through the pipes and saw mouser toss an object to eric eric caught it deftly in one hand whats this eric asked pda with internet capability im assuming you arent hauling around fifty million in tens and twenties youve got the money parked in an account somewhere prove it to me that youve got it show me the account balance online and we can deal show me the money bud eric held the phone looked at the screen i i what are you waiting for im not going to show it to you i need proof that youve still got the whole fifty million eric didnt look over toward luke but he raised his head with a slow dignity a decision made he tossed the phone back to mouser who caught it onehanded ive got it all but im not showing you the accounts i have no reason to lie the sound of the shot was a hard slap in the close air of the basement under his hand clamping over her mouth luke felt aubrey choke down a scream not any more mouser said as a soft eulogy luke did not risk peering through the pipes he tried to breathe silently through his mouth mouser had killed eric just ten feet away from them he heard footsteps a clanking of metal the unused basement door the cool night crept into the basement aubrey pressed her face into her elbow curled on the concrete the door clanged shut mouser was in the alley the gun eric still had his gun in his jacket luke moved from the web of pipes and didnt even glance behind at aubrey eric lay dead on his back a rorschach of blood on his forehead slackening astonishment on his face luke glanced at the door it began to push open again too soon to be anyone but mouser luke ran and shoved the door hard kicking his heels against the concrete floor a bullet tore through the thin metal ricocheting into the air an inch from lukes scalp he slammed the door fully shut slid the deadbolt luke was running now yelling for aubrey she crouched shivering over erics body her mouth trembling her skin pale as moonlight he knelt grabbed the gun from the jacket a sheaf of papers a key ring and cell phone from the pocket a miniature basketball on the key ring bounced against his palm luke grabbed it all put the gun under his own coat luke and aubrey ran up the stairs into the small crowd in the lobby out into the cool of the windblown street they took a hard left and ran onto the busy sidewalk cars zoomed past headlights painting them in whites it would only be a minute before mouser was on the street people crammed the sidewalks thronging from the restaurants and stores luke and aubrey ran and he looked ahead and to the left at the upcoming intersection and he saw mouser scanning the street suddenly raising his hand running after them they dashed out onto armitage avenue mouser closed fast on them in the street they were caught in a wash of lights a roaring peal of brakes a chicago transit authority bus honked veering to avoid luke and aubrey he saw the lighted windows of the bus commuters standing and sitting just wanting to get home to their safe cocoons frightened and gripping the seats and each other as the bus driver hammered its brakes spun crunched into cars parked along the avenue for a moment luke thought the bus would either topple on them in its skid or simply run straight over them but they ran out of its path luke glancing back seeing mouser vanishing as the bus blocked lukes view a car rammed into the side of the bus they ran luke heard the squealing of brakes from a truck trying to avoid them aubrey grabbed his arm and they ran down a side street luke glanced back didnt see mouser in the chaos of the braked cars didnt hear another crack of gunshot they ran back toward the elevated train station they fed their cards into the ticket reader and hurried up the staircase they stood at the end of the platform waiting for the rumble of the rails aubrey leaned against him panting if mouser made it up the steps go he said go to the police she looked at him and a toughness in her that he had not seen before settled in her eyes im not sure the police can protect me from people who can kill the power grid you took his keys yes a train bound for the loop rumbled into the armitage station lets go she said they stepped onto the train the crowd mixed doing the dodgeyoufirst dance jockeying for seats and stands near the door the train was less crowded than he thought it would be businessmen rough looking kids a group of women chattering in spanish luke and aubrey sat down as far from everyone else as they could aubrey huddled close to him and shivered i might be sick awkwardly he put a calming hand on her back she breathed hard oh god oh god he did it to save us to save you he was definitely not trying to save me he painted a goddamn target on my back she looked up at him her eyes were wet but she blinked hard as though unwilling to risk a trickle of tears he saw the strength in her face he was wrong to do that luke watched the train speed past the lit buildings a mist starting to fall the light smeared and dreamy this money was the key to stopping the night road and perhaps finding out who jane was the architect of his destruction they had to find where eric had hidden it wheres erics apartment near downtown river west area the train huffed into the station people shuffled on and off a trio of homeless men boarded along with an elderly man in a neat suit with a frown on his face and a newspaper tucked under his arm how many more stations luke did not like sitting still where someone could study and remember his face from television where should we get off the homeless men laughed at a private joke among themselves the elderly man sitting across from luke and aubrey inspected them as though measuring them on a finely tuned secret balance he opened and began to read a newspaper luke saw his own face the image captured on the atm camera on the front page a headline read suspect in bizarre killing marked by tragedy probably an account of his fathers death in a bizarre plane crash and his mothers death in a car crash the twin blots of sorrow in his life aubrey saw the headline and touched lukes hand she pulled on his sleeve and he stood getting away from the newspaper following her toward the homeless guys who had staked out the center of the car as a temporary turf the rest of the passengers gave the trio plenty of space luke and aubrey stood near the door luke kept his face toward the window the great city lay beyond the glass he wished he could enjoy the view he glanced back at the man the elderly man had turned to the first page of the paper it lay folded on his lap lukes picture above the crease mouser watched the train arrive to sweep them away no way he could reach them in time so he stopped running eric had lied he was sure theyd been the ones to lock him out of the basement which meant eric died shielding them so they must know where the money is it was the only reasonable explanation he turned and headed back to his car parked at a pay slot a slow heat warmed his skin his phone rang as soon as he reached the car did you get them snow sounded tired not all just eric luke is with erics woman i think erics told them where the money is he wanted to save that girl something fierce i can help where are you going now dont you worry ill be back at the motel soon its going to be okay i can meet you i have a car you have a car i did not like that doctor i borrowed her car when she came over to check on me then a hint of crossness in her voice she shouldnt have tried to stop me what did you do its not like she was a real doctor he did not feel a shudder or coldness to her announcement of murder just a disappointment you dont treat assets that way shed seen our faces he didnt want to argue with her just find a motel check in rest call me later do not hurt anyone else we got to stick together help me by doing what im asking i will find them please meet me somewhere he couldnt have her wandering chicago so he told her to meet him at navy pier on lake michigan it was an easy landmark for her to find with its giant ferris wheel he hung up he was annoyed and it did not occur to him that being wounded she might be frightened and afraid of being alone he thought only of the mission the phone rang again it was henry how is snow shell be okay erics dead luke got away i am going to put some hurt on him dont tell me not to he deserves it you know it i know it henry heaved a long broken sigh do you have the money no what about erics girlfriend shes with luke i believe they might have the information on where the moneys hidden a misery crept into his flesh his mouth odd eric would offer help since he kidnapped luke they must have made an alliance mouser tell me why i shouldnt unleash the night road against you for failing i have a long list here of people who might do a better job than you in finding our funds because admitting failure shows you dont have control of this situation of their money which might make them all quite nervous about you running the show you could be replaced he knew from the silence that hed scored a hit let me and snow finish they have to still be in chicago the only sound mouser could hear through the phone was a ticking of clocks henry said you arent just failing me but failing the entire night road mouser didnt care much about what other people wanted but the rest of the night road could be useful to him if they will help me i wont fail them he decided this was the most diplomatic thing he could say then the night road will help you as long as we dont give them details on the current difficulties i dont want the rest of the network to panic or to decide to leave us henry was offering a truce between them they would not alert the rest of the network to the problems they faced i agree mouser said the first step is to find a way to track aubrey perrault maybe her car has gps they took off on the train but she must have a car and we need an eye inside erics bank trace where he moved the money because he had to have stashed it where he could get it quickly a pause luke he was all right i saw him running he appeared fine he shot snow he wanted to say who cares how he is you didnt hurt him no only because i didnt get the chance he thought henrys concern for luke enraged him the mission the mission one could not be distracted from the mission henry was becoming a liability but he remained silent oh how was that doctor for snow henry asked fine just fine mouser said the elderly man stared right at luke luke glanced at the grime on the window out of the corner of his eye he saw the old man unfold a cell phone from a pocket dial it and speak into it his calm his certainty was somehow more frightening than if he had produced a gun or a knife were almost to the next station aubrey whispered in lukes ear he kept his face neutral calm seemingly uninterested in what the elderly man was doing hes the kid in the paper the man announced to the train he closed the cell phone the houston kid who killed the homeless guy he tapped the paper youre nuts aubrey said leave my brother alone she was a quick liar i called the police a smugness filled his voice killed a homeless guy he said to the trio of street guys one of the homeless men gaunt fortyish reached out and grabbed lukes arm aubrey pulled the homeless mans arm from luke i said to leave him alone dont let them get away the elderly man raised the folded paper like an accusing finger they all swayed as the train braked to a stop and suddenly two of the homeless men hammered luke into the wall they smelled of wine and of sweat fermenting too long in wool and as the doors whooshed open aubrey and luke fell out onto the platform in a tackle of legs and arms luke threw a hard punch drove into the matted beard of one of the men his fist scraped dirty teeth and rubbery lip aubrey grabbed the other mans greasy hair with a twisting yank started to scream for help the other men grabbed lukes arms hauled him and slammed him into a concrete column stop it aubrey yelled and now the crowd moved three young men rallying to their defense grabbing at the ragtag accusers aubrey seized luke and they ran they stopped running at the bottom of the stairs as a policeman hurried past them they vanished into the mist where would he have hidden the money luke and aubrey walked the streets of a quiet neighborhood north of downtown aubrey kept glancing over her shoulder keep moving luke thought he worked for a bank wherever he put the money he was willing to die to keep it a secret which means he could have hidden it anywhere she said but im guessing he stashed it in another account probably another bank that wouldnt be so obviously tied to him her voice broke and he could sense her drawing away from him i know you cared about him im sorry im really sorry are you she studied the sidewalk hes the reason youre in this mess no he was a pawn just like me just like you even the people chasing us arent much more than pawns the king on the chessboard is my stepfather the queen is this jane bitch she has to be crazy trying to extort money from terrorists i dont like chess and i dont like being a pawn she raised her head looked at him with a mix of defiance and grief it makes me mad mad is good mad might help us stay alive she started to walk again and he fell in step with her i cant believe hes dead he was just so desperate to convince me he was on the side of right he just kept talking about all hed done for me risked for me he was leveraging your kidnapping to bring you back to him she nodded in shame it sounds horrible but he wanted us back together she glanced over her shoulder again im really not so special i dont know why he couldnt let me go luke thought of her calm her brave pleading with eric not to leave luke chained to the bed her resourcefulness in the elevated train in fending off the mob he knew exactly why eric would not let a woman like her go easily how did you meet him at his bank i set up my company accounts there he handled them he remembered aubreys exportimport business now from her friends blog i bought an import company a few months back from a friend pottery from south america african decor and jewelry crafts and furniture from mexico and eastern europe not expensive stuff but you have to watch your expenditure deal with making payments overseas receiving payments from overseas its a hassle eric helped me sort it all out then he asked me out to dinner i thought he was a good guy i dont often choose well did he have a chance to win you back after he saved you i dont know i was furious with him and grateful all at once but once i saw the footage on tv i recognized you i knew he was involved in killing that man to save me it was going to bind me to him forever and i was very afraid whoevers after him isnt going to give up they passed a nearly empty diner and she glanced at the menu in the window are you hungry he asked he realized he was starving but suggesting dinner seemed bizarre we never got to eat our pizza aubrey rubbed her temples im horrible to even think of food right now her stomach growled its okay were in survival mode weird and everything else seems so ordinary she crossed her arms were different the world isnt she was right warm light filled the diner and the few customers laughed over coffee and sandwiches and daily specials they went inside lukes skin prickling at the thought of sitting still in public they took turns going to the bathroom and washing faces and hands and luke thought she might bolt but when he came back to the booth she sat waiting they ordered scrambled eggs bacon toast and hot coffee which sent a welcome jolt of heat through their bodies she stared at the mug i should be a mess but its a luxury isnt it to be a mess in the worst of times you just have to forge ahead she was right they had to keep moving and they had to find the money quickly the luxury we dont have is time what do you mean these people expect this money soon its tied to a bigger attack even bigger than the bombing in texas mouser referred to it as hellfire we have to find out what it is and im guessing from mousers tone that the attack is very soon within a couple of days aubrey said nothing for thirty seconds frowning in thought she waited for the waitress to refill their coffees and to leave their corner it wont take the police long to find eric no and theyll look for me yes and whoever this mouser man works for theyll be looking for me too yes if the police find me then mouser finds me well they killed the power luke theyre more capable than i ever imagined he sipped coffee if you talk to the police you can clear my name what will clear your name is finding this money prove the motive eric had to kidnap you then you give the money and all the information on the night road to the fbi give it all to the fbi the fifty million and his traitorous stepfather he didnt want henry in jail he realized with shameful anger that he wanted henry dead for the hell hed created for luke no he put his face in his hands let the wave of hate pass you dont have any idea what youre signing up for aubrey i cant tell the police anything more than i told you i think we should stick together the sense of responsibility weighed on him he had barely survived his encounters with the night road she had no idea of the brutality they would face but he saw the resolution in her face and he decided not to argue with her she wanted to hide he didnt blame her she wanted to help him for erics sake so the two kidnapping victims are stuck with each other yes she said quietly i dont know how to fight i dont know how to run but im not going to let these people get away with what theyve done to me or to eric or to you her resolve strengthened him what i dont understand is why didnt eric just hide with the money why not go to thailand take the money run with it he asked he said tonight that he had made a deal that would save us right before you got there we were having a glass of wine to celebrate but he hadnt told me the details yet a deal a deal where someone powerful would protect us just like that mouser man said before he shot eric she cleared her throat rubbed at her eyes i was furious with eric for getting me involved in this mess i wanted out and he was trying to convince me i didnt have a way out except through him who was going to protect him maybe they could protect us maybe she said but he called it a deal he had to be giving something in exchange the fifty million luke said he remembered the pages hed pulled from erics jacket when hed gone for the gun he removed the papers from his back pocket and smoothed them out on the table what is that aubrey asked papers eric had in his pocket each separate page was a printout confirming the opening of an account at a bank the banks were scattered across america tennessee new york california two in texas minnesota washington state missouri he didnt recognize the bank names they all appeared to be regional banks not large chains these must be the accounts he set up for the night road how would we check to see if theyre empty or not he looked up at her you think he stashed the money in them it would make sense maybe he opens the accounts deposits the money but he hasnt given the account information yet to the night road that way he can still reach the money even if they cant we cant go to them theyre all over the country he said you have to have a password to access information online or over the phone then step one is finding where eric hid those passwords she said mightve just been in his head that many accounts no he was the kind of guy who wrote everything down two policemen walked into the diner the two officers gave the restaurant a cursory glance luke had his back to them he sensed the momentary weight of their stare aubrey and luke studied their coffee cups waiting for the policemen to slide into a booth on the opposite side of the diner and to lose themselves in the study of the menu we need to go now luke said sweat coated his back he unfolded money for the bill and they got up and left aubrey leaned on him hard rubbing his back her pretended affection camouflage he didnt look like a cop killer on the solitary run luke was careful not to look toward the officers when they were out of the diner she stepped away from him crossing her arms they walked for three blocks found a bus stop figured out the route to get back to lincoln park where aubreys car sat parked on a side street the car was a latemodel volvo and he checked its underside do you know what youre looking for she asked not really he said a gadget that could track you like im going to recognize that he risked a grin and she smiled barely back or blow us up arent i mary sunshine exhaustion cramped her voice luke slid out from under the car i dont see anything there that looks totally foreign all right they got in she drove into the dark street where to some place we can plan i need sleep lukes fatigue was overwhelming his body had no adrenaline left he felt like he had been running forever someplace cheap she said someplace cheap he agreed eric lied about his whole life she said unexpectedly and tears spilled from her eyes but not sobs the tears were steady and controlled and she wiped them off her cheek with the back of her hand she kept driving and luke didnt know what to do until he put his hand over her hand on the steering wheel just for comfort neither of them noticed the traffic camera perched on the closest intersection watching them with its uncaring eye as they pulled away from the curb and drove into the darkness snow slept in the motel bed exhausted from her mending shoulder and her illadvised murder mouser opened his laptop and took a walk along the night road he felt lonely much of the time but signing onto the night roads private website was like slipping into a warm bath happiness comfort knowing you belonged it was a rare sensation for him it was not a single website but rather a fortress of several linked sites hosted on a russian server the sites appeared innocuous even boring until you entered a password and their delights opened up to your eyes you could not get a password without being cleared by henry shawcross very few in the night road could name by true identity another member he glanced at snow he still didnt know her real name it was better that way he sighed with relief and pleasure he read the fresh postings on the site encoded in night road parlance celebrations and congratulations on the oil pipeline explosion in canada disguising it as an accident a night road member had managed to inflict millions in economic damage to both canada and the united states for the tiny investment of five thousand dollars for plastique and transportation costs electronic versions of high fives floated in the postings the e coli meat poisoning scare from the tennessee food plant was also mentioned as a triumph the combined work of two members who hadnt known each other before being introduced via the night road and had pooled resources and knowledge to infect the processing plant and send a wave of panic across american tables low cost high impact a select few proven the most capable would take part in hellfire he moved past the accolades someone in alabama wanted training in explosives and wanted a new source for firearms a man in los angeles was looking for other groups to network with to disrupt highway traffic on the th of july another poster in belgium had lifted a large number of credit card account numbers from a us army depot and was selling them mouser paused at one posting a british hacker had dispersed a trojan horse via a porn site out of st petersburg and the trojan had begun a rapid propagation around the world the hacker announced he was ensnaring a thousand unsuspecting pcs a day the trojan malware would serve up all passwords and credit card information stored on the infected computers blocks of one hundred systems were available for sale bidding was intensifying mouser considered hed funded his last three operations against the beast ammunition travel and lodging by buying a block of infected systems it was like buying a mutual fund some hijacked systems could deliver hugely profitable information others usually owned by teenage boys would produce slim to none but nice clean identity and account information was valuable and given how badly the past couple of days had gone he and snow might need clean names to step into for a short while until the dust settled and if the payments hed been promised fell through then he could use the financial info to resell down the chain he knew of serbian crime rings and one everdesperate muslim terror cell in france who would buy nearly anything mouser put in a bid on two blocks of machines and then posted his own request need access to creeps fullblowns for p only gps in night road parlance he was asking for access to all credit card databases for charges paid in the past twentyfour hours for two names and gps information for one car aubreys he waited five minutes later a voice elsewhere in the world replied might can do offer mouser responded can trade skills in us skills was a code word for kills he was offering to kill someone in exchange for the data he needed the reply not in us sorry good luck then another offer appeared i can help post details at skeechnetter net this email address was an established blind clicking on it took you to a legitimate computer website a discussion group for american movies and tv shows owned by one of the same holding companies that owned travport air cargo the discussion group was in malaysia and the postings ranged from fluent english to malay to badly broken english perfect for shorthand cues the site was again hosted out of russia and when needed postings by night road members were automatically purged from the system it was not perfect anonymity but it was close he slipped into the forum created a new user id and signed on he posted a new topic asking in broken english about an upcoming dvd release with the word skills in it a moment later another poster responded with a long answer written in a motley textmessage style shorthand they chatted continuing the camouflaged dance until the respondent gave an encoded answer that contained a phone number with an area code in new mexico mouser called the number it was answered on the third ring im your new friend mouser said i can get your information the voice was baritone spanishflecked tobaccohoarse but it will take a few hours i need it now your need is irrelevant it will still take a few hours mouser sighed and you can guarantee continuous reading of the cars location until my path into the database is discovered no guarantees but you should get a solid read on where your target is who do you want handled as payment you take out a cop and were square you mean just any cop at random mouser considered police officers were servants of the beast it was strangely thrilling to know a police officer was going about life unaware that he or she would soon die so mouser could buy information all right whats your car registrants name aubrey perrault she drives a volvo license plate ftjr illinois tonight she would have been parked in lincoln park off armitage i have a friend who has a back door into most of the major metropolitan traffic camera feeds i can see if shes popped up anywhere in chicago in the past few hours it would help narrow the search and contact you via the site they would not use these phones again with each other they were prepaids to be destroyed and disposed of when their business concluded mouser thanked him and clicked off the phone he signed off the malaysian site and returned to the night road site so many people each with their own agenda their own skills their own cause trading their brilliance and their resources ready to strike against the far wider world an army hidden in the shadows and waging a war that would change the world a night road built by henry shawcross out of the bricks given to him by luke dantry a scary and a beautiful creature a beast of justice was being born with hellfire as its birth announcement out of his window mouser looked up into the starry sky and wondered if he could see the gps satellite far above which would tell his new buddy exactly where aubrey and luke were he wanted to blow the distant eye a kiss luke and aubrey drove to a small chain motel on the outskirts of chicago on interstate toward st louis and checked in one room two beds aubrey paid cash eric had given her money that afternoon since they couldnt use credit cards exhaustion threatened to swamp lukes brain but he sat on the bed and studied the list of states banks and accounts he didnt know where to start there were no names on the accounts no passwords no identifiers beyond erics notes any other information he needed had died with eric and if these were the closed accounts they were useless unless they could give him hints about which night road member each account was intended for presumably these people were scattered around the country like snow and mouser the bank with their night road funds would have to be close to them it might help find them aubrey showered behind the closed door and he kept his back to the bathroom he lay down and fell asleep almost instantly in his sleep he stood and he was back on his fathers flight the man who had sabotaged the plane was gone but he could see from behind his fathers body slumped by a window dad he called his fathers hand lay on the frosted window the silver saint michaels medal dangling between his fingertips he touched his fathers shoulder turning standing the dead man was not warren dantry but henry his face blue his lips gray reaching for lukes throat luke sat up mouth dry skin clammy with sweat aubrey fully dressed again hair wet sat watching him from the other bed she had turned on the television and as he looked at the screen he saw the pictures of the two men killed in the alley chris and the poor officer he reached for the remote turned up the volume no arrests in the double shooting no suspects as of yet ill be back he walked down four streets and at a busy intersection found an ancient pay phone in front of a convenience store but it was too close he took a bus a few miles away found another convenience store with a pay phone he fed it quarters and dialed the police said quickly and clearly i called in earlier the tip on the murdered officer the two people responsible for shooting him may also have a connection to the train bombing in texas and they are working on a bigger attack called hellfire but i dont know what it is he hung up he could have said something about henry he hadnt why he owed henry no loyalty but his mouth had not been able to form the words to say what he believed about henry as an absolute truth he picked up the phone to dial it again then slowly hung up he knew the awful truth he wanted to deal with henry himself he wanted henry weak and vulnerable in front of him to be forced to admit he used and betrayed luke accountable for only a few moments to luke for taking lukes wellintentioned work and building an obscenity from it it was a disquieting realization and it gnawed at his heart during the trip back to the motel when he got back to the motel room aubrey had turned to another news channel authorities in alaska were reporting that a trio of seattle men had been arrested trying to sabotage an oil pipeline near sitka they had been caught with a few homemade bombs devices powerful enough to have torn an expensive hole in the pipe and shut down delivery capacity for days the men were allegedly ecological extremists but the stock market had reacted to this lateafternoon news with a feeling of havoc narrowly averted especially after the weeks earlier pipeline blast in canada oil prices soared to new records and the rest of the market cratered for the day millions vanished on paper seattle luke said i found some extremist environmentalists in seattle that i handed over to henry this could be them or not i cant hear about an attack or a political crime and not think its connected to the night road right now my god i gave him so many names even if there were only fifty or so that were serious thats a million per terrorist life has a soft underbelly aubrey said i mean if just a few people wanted to wreck the economy they could with surgical precision just by hitting us where were vulnerable our energy our food our communications she looked at him sadness in her eyes if they scare enough people they will change how we live yes he said look at what a few people can do with so little nineteen guys the whole operation cost a halfmillion these guys could cause so much more suffering with so much more money not just one big attack maybe a whole long series an onslaught of terror then the next story was about eric but they did not mention erics name the screen showed police tape cordoning off the condo building on armitage no witnesses no description of a shooter except three people a man and a woman pursued by another man had run into traffic nearly causing a major bus crash the anchor said were told the power across the lincoln park area had failed due to a computer glitch although no problems elsewhere in the power grid have been reported and comed is investigating the situation she smoothed her damp hair back from her head you sort of stink luke you might want to shower he hadnt gotten clean since the cottage near the flooded river he ducked into the bathroom stood under the stinging spray lathered his body with soap a warm gratitude dawned in his chest that she was sticking with him he didnt want to be alone he didnt like putting his grimy clothes back on but he had no choice hed lost his knapsack with his clothes at chriss studio aubrey lay curled under the sheets dozing he moved to his own bed and doused the light he realized hed left the bathroom light on he got up switched off the light and walking in the darkness back to his own bed he inadvertently hit his shin against her mattress she sat up with an abbreviated scream sorry he said sorry aubrey im okay i thought i dreamed i was back in that cabin its okay he sat on his bed i had a bad dream earlier he could hear in the dark the rustling of the sheets on her bed as she eased back down on the mattress she said i was sure when i was chained to that bed no one was ever going to find me i was going to starve to death or die of thirst an ugly death alone i dont even like to eat lunch alone he laughed very softly and she sighed and then she cried for eric for the life hed stolen from her luke watched the moonlight that came in the room from the barely parted curtains he looked over at aubrey and for a moment he didnt realize that she was holding a hand out toward him he took her hand just for now she said he knew he understood i thought i was going to die in that cabin too he said he closed his hand around hers his breath seemed to pause she drew him to the bed they nestled together both hungry for warmth both exhausted hearts and minds tattered by crisis then her mouth turned to his needy hungry a kiss that said im just so thankful to be alive he covered his mouth with hers slowed the kiss broke it her lips tasted of coffee bad idea he said i dont care ive been living a bad idea for days i didnt love him any more hes ruined my life i cant i just need he knew the need to feel alive to not be deadened by the horror she withdrew from the kiss almost shy and then he touched the hem of her tshirt felt her lift her arms wanting to be free from the fear he tugged the shirt off her head and eased off her bra he pulled off his own shirt and leaned in close to kiss her again the silver of the saint michaels medal touched her naked breasts whats this she fingered the medal the angels wings saint michael my dad gave it to me before he died hes supposed to keep me safe he said aubrey studied the medal in the cold bar of moonlight from the window cupping it in her palm then she ran the medal along the silver chain and put the angel on lukes back it tickles me she said okay she closed her eyes and luke felt her fingertips begin to push his boxers from his hips the lovemaking was gentle and comforting and good and they both slipped into warm sleep in the deep of the night luke awoke at the sound of a door shutting down the hall he thought he should stay awake stay on guard in case mouser and snow worked more sick magic to find them but he knew they couldnt that he and aubrey were safe they were invisible but he stayed awake for a long hour thinking not of the woman curled in the shelter of his arms sleeping in abject relief of momentary safety but of henry thinking of what he would do when he saw henry the king of lies the false face the betrayer the serpent who could say trust me and turn the words to poison luke was steeling himself he realized for murder they both slept until late in the morning the sunshine crafting through the windows luke awoke and she lay next to him watching him shouldnt have she said but she offered a shy smile he saw what he thought was regret in her eyes she blinked it away as if she knew it lingered and gave him a warm kiss on the mouth followed by a chaste kiss on the forehead she kept her hand on his flat stomach but im not sorry that we did shouldnt couldnt wouldnt he said i have no regrets either youre a good guy so are you not a guy but good he had never been deft at the morningafter chatter and he saw he wasnt improving now he felt a pang of regret because this was going to change or complicate an already tough situation between them he couldnt deal with another problem but if he was going into battle he wanted her a smart and brave partner are you all right she asked yes you im sad for eric i cant help but feel that way he said nothing but we we can get out of this mess she said get our lives back if we find who he made the deal with where he hid the money where do we start we start with his cell phone he opened up the phone hed taken from erics pocket searched the call log aubrey leaned over his shoulder there was only one number listed on the log an international number i know that international code is france aubrey said eric and i went to paris a couple of months back he had business and id never been business he said what kind banking stuff i dont know luke pressed the callback option under the number um is that smart lets see luke said four rings and then hello he recognized the british womans voice hello jane luke said she didnt seem shocked at the use of her name this isnt who i was expecting no eric lindoes dead sad i thought hed make it through the weekend at least let me guess luke dantry running man why did you want me kidnapped why have you involved innocent people nothing personal darling she said bitch its personal luke said why did you do it what did i or aubrey ever do to you nothing hence not personal her voice was cool crisp as breeze caught in linen youre not going to find me you cant hurt me i have a question for you you knew about the fifty million so who the hells giving it to the night road wheres this money coming from some secrets sweetheart go to the grave my lips are sealed this fifty million you want so badly im going to find it before you do that darling i seriously doubt then he heard a click jane hanging up he tried the number again no response why would a british woman in paris be using us as pawns insulting her wasnt exactly productive aubrey this woman isnt going to negotiate with us not until we find where he hid the money only then could we maybe lure her into the light he shook his head i want to know where this money is coming from aubrey bit her lip i do have a thought about a potential hiding place for the money where erics childhood home we stopped there on the way into chicago after we ditched your car in dallas eric was getting his stepfathers gun the house is empty erics stepfather died recently and he hasnt sold it she swallowed maybe he did more than get the gun maybe he left something behind the house was a few blocks off cicero not far from midway airport in a neighborhood that looked like its better days were more myth than memory narrow brick houses were jammed close together as if sharing secrets some of the houses were maintained with pride and care some were not people idled in yards on corners bored laughing arguing they drove past a trio of teenage boys who looked at them with a mix of calculation and studied disinterest luke parked in front of the old lindoe house the small yard needed a mow every window was darkened the lindoe house looked like the shy child on the block eric paid off the house for his parents when he made real money she said luke thought if he made serious money hed have bought his parents a nicer place but who knew the calculus of relationships in the lindoe family maybe this had once been a happy home one worth staying in for memories alone why would a wealthy successful guy keep this house sentiment or maybe because he was involved in dirty dealings after six months had the will even been probated the property would still be in his stepfathers name it was a perfect place to hide they used a key on erics ring to get inside the house the house smelled slightly musty hes not here much luke said yeah his mom died of cancer two years back his stepdad passed about six months ago heart attack not long after we met eric said his stepdad didnt want to live without erics mom yeah my own stepfather said the same thing after my mom died im sorry luke how car accident she was driving rainy night they hit a skid went through a guardrail tumbled down an incline she died he lived aubrey opened her mouth and closed it the silence grew heavy but because of what you know about your stepdad now i wonder if it was really an accident he shook his head henry nearly died it took him a long while to recover i dont know i thought he adored my mom but hes the king of lies maybe ill never know aubrey took his hand gave it a kind squeeze he switched on the kitchen lights he made me hot tea and told me to sit here and wait i was still so rattled by what had happened and what we were facing i dont know what he did while i waited for him where did he go in the back they walked to the end of the hallway and found a master bedroom the cheap furniture shrouded in plastic as if trapping memories in a clear amber dust covered the plastic they backed up to the next bedroom erics bedroom a flickingon of the light showed a room little changed from when eric had taken his scholarship money and headed off to the university of illinois clippings of his achievements dotted the wall from high school through college and then after a shrine of proud parental hopes a son whod made nothing but good choices and then made a very bad one luke studied the clippings he was president of an honor society and he ends up a killer and kidnapper and a money man for extremists he ran a finger along the frames erics first letter offering him a banking job in the operations division of a national bank eric in the sands of the middle east at a construction site shaking hands with an older elegant arab businessman in london standing stiffly with other bankers on a windswept beach a borderline between desert and sea watching the skeleton of a resort take hold he really did spend a lot of time overseas did he ever talk about it no she paused for a moment looking at the smiling eric beaming in the desert sun at my import company i bought these really unusual pots from papua new guinea theres a face on each side like a totem eric thought they were cool maybe he liked them because they were twofaced just like him hes like henry in some ways henry loves his photos of himself at work surrounded by powerful people i dont understand why eric and henry got involved in this why why risk it all some men can never have enough money pride power aubrey said name your poison and it will have an addict he peered inside the closet help me look what are we looking for what shouldnt be here she found the laptop three minutes later tucked behind a stack of worn paperbacks on the top shelf an old cheap subnotebook paired with a power cord luke plugged in the system started it up it presented a password prompt any ideas luke asked aubrey rubbed a finger against her lip let me try she sat and tapped words on the keyboard ill try words that meant something in his life luke continued searching the room he found two guns glocks with ammunition the serial numbers had been filed away both were hidden in a box under the bed camouflaged by a scattering of old hardy boys paperbacks and money five thousand in cash not fifty million which would take up a considerable amount of room luke put the money and the weapons on the bed nothing is working she said stop and think for a minute you said he set up your bank accounts did he set up your passwords at first i kept the passwords he used she said they were more secure than what i would have conjured up i would have used my name or my phone number or my first cats name he came up with passwords you could remember but that were hard to break how well he always said to use words with letters you could easily replace with numbers and it would look kind of the same in your head like a word with es replace the es with s or ls replace with s he said it was much more secure than the word itself and still easy to remember what did you choose for your passwords aubrey but with a replacing the e and another one for an account he set up for me after we got back from paris was paris but with a instead of the s where did you go in france mostly around paris montmartre saint germain the louvre all the tourist spots we also went to versailles and we went to strasbourg for a couple of days did you go on any other trips with him no lets write down every shared interest you had every place you went together just because he gave me passwords that meant something to him doesnt mean his passwords will also tie back to me maybe not he said but you were his priority he put everything on the line for you aubrey i am willing to bet you were in the forefront of his mind when he was hiding this money it was a ticket for the both of you he found a piece of paper and wrote down all the various neighborhoods and sites they had seen all the common threads she could think of their gentle rivalry of cubs and white sox his obsession with bulls basketball his few favorite music groups and tv shows and movies their preferred restaurants a wine they drank on special occasions the places theyd traveled together luke felt as if they were conducting an autopsy on the happier moments in erics life then they started playing with the words replacing letters with numbers in erics style turning es and bs to s ls into s gs into s ss and ps into s the list grew into dozens of permutations he became conscious as he scribbled with the pencil that time was passing maybe a neighbor would knock on the door wondering who was parked in front of the empty house maybe the police would come looking for evidence as to why eric was murdered sweat formed along his lip he pushed a piece of paper at her start entering these please she typed fingers pistoning on the keyboard working through each possibility no no no after the tenth no he said youre being negative she hit it on the fortysecond try this laptop aubrey said is officially our pet bitch she turned the screen toward him unlocked it showed a normal desktop which word it was versailles except with s instead of ls i should have guessed we had a really nice day in versailles he wondered aloud if you could get married there an awkward silence filled the room and luke broke it thank god for the consistency of bankers she got up and he leaned over the laptop he started to search through its files a few text files an email program and a web browser nothing else installed luke opened one of the text files inside were listed the same accounts on the piece of paper beside each account was a regional bank and a password and a business name the companies carried names that spoke of vague occupations lionhead consulting three brothers partners jester inc nothing that hinted at what exactly they did he counted a dozen of them he established a bunch of accounts for different companies try them see if the fifty million is in those accounts he could hear the urgency in her voice luke surfed to each regional banks website entered in the account info and the password he could hear aubrey holding her breath her mouth close to his ear but each account only held a hundred dollars probably the minimum to stay open these must be accounts he set up for the night road she said for them to access money her sigh tickled his shoulder he hid the money somewhere else he could have tucked it into an idle account at marolt gold changed passwords opened up new accounts under false names he started in bank operations i saw it on his bio which means hes technically adept we may never find it a wave of despair washed across him luke did online searches for the various company names they did not have web pages these are all dummy corporations another dead end luke we have to find this money frustration filled her voice lets see where else he went the last time he was online luke looked in the browsers history window which told him every site eric visited aside from the banking pages eric had visited only one other place on the internet a website about tv shows thats odd he clicked to the website a password page opened for him to log in why would you need a login aubrey asked i dont know was he a big tv fan sports mostly the bulls games luke remembered the toy basketball on erics key ring with the bulls logo in the middle of hiding millions from killers he goes to a foreignbased television fan site its like getting a haircut in the middle of a funeral it makes no sense log on see what happens aubrey suggested he tried the versaies password but it didnt work he pulled the password worksheet close to him and began to work through the possibilities again none of them worked i cant take another dead end if its not a password that connects to his life with you what else in his life well his secret life the night road he entered the term plain it failed he entered in variants using the same numberreplacement key as before the first few variants didnt work then he tried nihtroad the password was accepted the dark world opened before him he scanned the newly loaded page and saw a long list of postings some of the posters used the same login names they had used on the websites where he had found them weeks ago their postings inside the night road were calmer offers for advice on cleaning funds through cheap insurance policies requests for help on how to use automatic rifles suggestions on how shrapnel could make a real difference in civilian deaths trade in murder in secrets in stolen identities and credit cards celebrations over the bombing of the rail yard in texas the pipeline in canada the e coli food scare that had spread from tennessee across the nation a bazaar for violence a marketplace for twisted ideas horror braided his guts he had found these people given them to henry as abstract bits of psychological profiling and now they were a community worse a secret army readying for battle at home oh my god aubrey said he did a search on the discussion forum for henry shawcross for mouser for snow nothing then on hellfire nothing theyre celebrating the recent attacks but theyre not talking about this hellfire thing he said hellfire must be separate and distinct from the current attacks maybe they canceled hellfire if they dont have the money they dont seem like the cancelling type or maybe the whole groups not involved only a few luke logged out from the discussion group why did you do that they could have software recording every account that enters every address every password i dont want them to know that im here he wiped his mouth i read about another community like this set up in the mideast by a weapons dealer to move explosives around the region they could shut down move their database and server and the authorities couldnt find them again so take it to the cops i will when we know where to find a member who will talk otherwise theyll just vanish into smoke he opened the email program everything had been cleaned out except one email it read your kind offer is accepted and protection is extended meet lap rd at pm for your getaway drummond do you know this drummond he asked the message had been sent from a common online email provider the kind of account you could set up in thirty seconds the twentythird was today the rendezvous was in two hours no she said protection is extended this is the deal he told you about for protection to save you two luke said we have to find out who this drummond is so we can make the same deal absolutely i would very much like some protection now maybe drummond can help us we figure out who or what lap is and get there in the next two hours luke accessed the internet searched on lap chicago he found references to a lawyers assistance program lap dancers and a lakefront air park a private air park for general aviation luke said this is the answer hes meeting someone at an air park if he made the deal part one is an escape route lets go she got up touched the photos of eric lindoe the brighteyed boy with a wide smile and brilliant future awaiting him she kissed her fingertips pressed them to the photo and then turned away they took the laptop the money and the guns and headed north toward lake michigan the lakefront air parks office was small low and sleek the chrome and glass gleamed theyd had to drive through long stretches of chicago rush hour traffic and the setting sun burned the sky orange the light reflected hard off the mirrored glasses theyd parked aubreys car in the small adjacent lot this is certifiably insane aubrey said as they walked toward the building the wind which had been cooling all afternoon bellowed and they drew closer together without thought youre right he said so no one will be expecting it the air parks offices were dim and surprisingly slightly shabby as though all the money had gone into the architecture and design and there had only been stray pennies left for the furnishings at one desk a man in his thirties sat peering at a computer screen he was of asian descent compactly built a thin scar marring the corner of his mouth he frowned at the screen which luke could not see as though puzzling over bad news luke took the lead hey im eric lindoe i had a flight chartered for today with who the man cranked a crooked smile first roadblock mr drummond hi mr lindoe im your ride he offered his hand frankie wu luke shook what he hoped was a dry hand with wus this is your other passenger aubrey perrault hi wu shook hands with aubrey youre shivering ms perrault you scared of flying dont be terrified aubrey said with a glance at luke you and my wife actually shes more scared when im driving youre in excellent hands aubrey offered a smile i feel better already were fueled up and ready to go mr lindoe where the hell are we going he wanted to know but he could hardly ask you dont have more bags wu asked glancing at their cheap knapsacks theyd stopped and bought a couple of changes of clothes and nothing more luke had the gun and the laptop and the money theyd taken from erics house in his pack erics key ring jangling in his pocket we travel light aubrey said please explain that virtue to my wife wu shut off the computer scribbled a note on the clipboard i only hope i brought the right clothes aubrey said good luke thought the weather in new york should be fine paris might be rainy by tomorrow new york paris not one destination but two was someone joining them in new york to go on to france luke felt a surge of panic neither he nor aubrey had passports paris wasnt going to happen paris where jane was the mastermind behind their kidnappings he glanced at aubrey she gave the slightest of nods as he aubrey and wu walked outside across the tarmac to the waiting plane he thought dont do this turn and run aubreys right its crazy he kept walking toward the plane if he turned and ran he would never know why the man he thought of as a father betrayed him hed never know who was after him hed be forced to live a halflife always afraid branded a murderer no more turning or dodging this lavish expensive plane that was a dead mans escape route was going to take him straight into the heart of the matter his throat tightened as he looked at the plane a private jet much like the one his father died in a swirl of painful memories churned in his head the rainy night in washington hugging his father goodbye and breathing in the old spice scent of him finding his mother redeyed at the breakfast table the next morning bearing her grief alone because she wanted luke to sleep through the night the letters pouring in from the universities where he had been a guest lecturer cairo bonn london the news footage of the salvage ship off the north carolina coast hauling the wreckage aboard out of the gray depths a week after the crash the eulogies about what a wonderful teacher his father had been listening to them his mother holding his hand so tight he could feel the skip and beat of her pulse under her skin and henry introducing himself to luke at the reception a plate of chicken and salad in his hand offering the other cool palm to luke to shake saying how much he had admired his father how much he would miss him as if anyone could miss him more than luke and his mom he wondered with a jolt how life would have been different if he had not run away three days after the service he had given henry an easy sympathetic key to wriggle his way into the family if he had stayed home maybe his mother would never have become friends with henry shawcross they followed frankie wu onto the plane the learjet was larger than luke had expected with a private cabin and cockpit the cabin seated ten a small galley was at the front of the aircraft aubrey sat down and he sat next to her his heart thrumming in his chest wu completed his final inspections walking around the plane aubrey and luke waited in silence wu walked a cell phone pressed to his ear he said a few words then listened while he completed the inspection hes letting someone know weve checked in aubrey said maybe luke said he wasnt sure what he would say if wu asked for lindoes id say hed lost it a bead of sweat trickled past his ear whats wrong my dad died in the crash of a plane like this a mechanic named ace beere worked for the charter service he had extremist views he shared at work he found out he was going to be fired he sabotaged my dads flight him and several of his professor friends they were flying down to cape hatteras for a retreat and some fishing id wanted to go he said no beere damaged the planes systems so it lost pressure midflight everyone on board suffocated died from hypoxia the plane kept flying far past the coast until it slammed into the atlantic he glanced around yeah this planes real similar his throat tightened oh my god im sorry are you going to be all right im okay he gripped the seat suddenly his father was like a physical presence in his chest youre pale ill be fine tell me about your dad what made him cool she put her hand on his knee he savored the strength in her grip he always listened to me he always had time for me he was gone a lot teaching overseas and we didnt always get to travel with him but when he came home i felt like the most important person in the world like he breathed in every word i said he took me fishing shooting old school stuff that dads dont do much with their kids any more he always expected the best from me that was a kindness not a cruelty he stopped embarrassed closing a hand around the saint michaels medal on his neck hidden under his shirt the man that killed him i always wanted to understand why how do you just snuff out innocent lives how do you justify that decision he committed suicide so i could never know but that shaped my life my career if i hadnt been interested in the psychology of violence i never would have been able to put together the night road for henry it all comes back to my dads death its everything that has made me shaped me wu stepped back aboard he flexed the smile back on looks like all the masking tape and glue is in place ha ha aubrey said did you check the baling wire luke asked sealed it with spit frankie wu said well depart in just a couple of minutes he vanished into the cockpit and shut the door luke leaned into aubreys ear and whispered he may be able to hear us over an intercom aubrey nodded she said in a clear voice eric hold my hand mr wu might not have checked all the masking tape luke took her hand it felt strange and right all at once he was eric lindoe at least for the next few hours until he met his kidnappers benefactor ten minutes later they arrowed into the sky and blasted toward the east she slept and luke watched her he wanted to sink into the warmth of sleep but he couldnt new york paris he looked out the window past the thin haze of clouds over the glow of heartland light as illinois became indiana the diamond towns and the clouded black spreading beyond to ohio and kentucky the low hum of the plane lullabied him he went to the cockpit and opened it frankie wu was speaking softly into a radio and stopped turned with a smile luke asked can i use my cell phone on this flight i didnt know if the rules were different for private jets theres a phone in the cabin you can use yes but not mine no im surprised youd be wanting to call anyone eric like he knew eric was running eric was in trouble luke said i need to tell someone goodbye frankie wu turned back to the controls without comment luke shut the door he had no intention of using the cabin phone it could be monitored and he didnt want wu overhearing this call he sat at the back of the cabin and opened the phone hed taken from eric the lifeline to jane and dialed henrys number hello henry sounded exhausted the reception was spotty for a moment he couldnt speak he listened to the sound of henrys breathing hello henry repeated he sounded nervous you sorry ass excuse for a human being luke thank god thank god youre alive i am never ever going to forgive you for what youve done to me luke listen to me i can help you im your best hope your sorry bastard you knew i had been kidnapped you listened to me beg you for help and you hung up the goddamned phone i saw you on tv my clients theyre not who i thought they were they used us both and they wouldnt let me do anything but damn you to the public but meet me well figure out how we can both get out of this mess mess this is beyond a mess you sent mouser and snow after me like dogs to hunt me down they tried to kill me theyve killed people trying to kill me his voice broke well i shot one of your dogs and stabbed the other and im going to do the same to you dont cut me out dont tell me where youre at ill send you money ill send you whatever you need to hide mouser was only supposed to find you and bring you to me so i could make you understand understand what that you used me to knit together a terrorist network are you kidding me what do you think im supposed to understand i can deal with mouser and snow and anyone like them who bothers you but there is another man whos hunting you drummond stay the hell away from him from anyone connected to him or a group called quicksilver the breath gelled in lukes chest i i dont believe you listen carefully to me the cabin where you were held it was paid for by a company called quicksilver risk stay away from them i am begging you to listen to me i know i screwed up but i never wanted you hurt ever i hope you die henry and i hope im there to see it for gods sakes luke henrys voice rose i have been your father for ten years youre not fit to say the word father luke said henry forged ahead as though lukes contempt was mist i am not trying to get you killed im trying to save you im trying to find out whos attacking us whos using us quicksilver is behind your kidnapping stay away from them then a pause while lukes head spun the man in houston who was killed his name was allen clifford i knew him so did your dad we once worked together on a special project for the government everyone who died on your fathers plane they were part of the project it was called the book club what do you mean worked for the government the air left lukes lungs he was a history professor for gods sakes henrys words burned as unrelenting as a fuse after the accident there were only three members of the book club left me allen clifford and drummond he was a teacher a scholar just more lies from you every word is truth henry thundered drummond thinks youre part of the night road he blames you for his friends death he came to me threatened me if i didnt turn you over to him he has significant resources to find you and i know this man when he finds you you will vanish forever you cant tell me all this and expect me to believe it he stood went to the back of the plane fought down the scream that wanted to roar up from his lungs im trying to show you im on your side son please dont you call me son im not your son i never was if you were on my side you never would have gotten me involved i was your needle and thread stitching together a whole bunch of killers and freaks and fringers for you i met your buddy chris you actually went and shook hands with these guys who think an american alqaedas a great idea met them with open arms planned to give them money he leaned his head against the planes wall you are funding terrorists to the tune of fifty million dollars you are such a piece of shit i didnt lie to you my clients lied to me they are using the research in ways i didnt consider i need you to meet me no henry he heard a long intake of breath i love you like you were my own child i didnt at first because you were such a pain spoiled contrary too smart for your own good but i grew to love you as much as your own father did luke i have only tried to protect you to do right by you meet me at a place of your choosing and well work out a plan to get your name clear and you safe together you werent brave enough to help me you could have gone to the police to the fbi and you didnt you left me to die i am trying to save us prove it hellfire henry what is it silence tell me what it is give me your greatest secret and ill believe you want to help me i know its separate from the attacks that are happening now its bigger isnt it what is it bombs airplanes bioweapons god help me is it a nuke a silence again a stillness heavy enough to crush a heart to flatten a family then i dont know that term hellfire i swear to god i dont know goodbye henry he took the phone and he broke it apart scattering its components on the floor he saw no point in talking to henry again no value in talking to jane what was he going to do beg them for his life back screw pleading and begging a rage and a despair he had never felt filled him he imagined what it would be like to kill his stepfather but the image of henrys face distorted in fear and remorse the thunder of lukes own heartbeat in his head vanished in a snap you cant kill him because then youre him he stood over the broken phone and the rage changed to a hardness in his heart a welcome toughness he sat on the floor in the back of the plane while aubrey slept knees drawn up to his chin wondering what darkness he was flying into salvation or death for a moment his hand closed on the saint michaels medal strength the ability to face and overcome evil of the basest sort he had to find his courage fan its flame keep going he slipped the medal back under his shirt the hum of the plane worked through his exhaustion and he closed his eyes to ponder his next move the night road was cutting its path through the heart of america as luke headed toward new york the high school football game in suburban kansas city had been targeted because the attacker was a neonazi and the high school had been named for a soldier who died early in the war in iraq the soldier was jewish the neonazi hated seeing the jews name on the sign when he drove past every morning on his way to work the football game was a close one and the neonazi sighed in relief a rout might have led to more people leaving earlier instead the game he could hear the distant rumble of the announcer voice tense with excitement had been decided in the final three seconds by a field goal the target schools team had won the neonazi rubbed at the dark tattoo across his neck a highly stylized swastika gritted his teeth and thought and no one will remember that as the crowd spilled out into the lot waving flags banners girls laughing and clutching at boys arms he pressed the first button the trunk of the car hed parked in the middle of the lot popped open he saw a white girl holding onto the arm of a boy who looked mexican glance over at the popping hood the neonazi gritted his teeth again the world would go mongrel in two generations if people didnt realize they just couldnt do what they wanted he thought he waited until a bigger mass of people had spilled out into the lot but before many of them had gotten into the protective cocoons of their cars he pressed the second button the bomb was not big it had been built the month before by snow the neonazi who had picked it up from her the previous week packed her creation with nails bolts and screws chaos a flash that burned his eyeballs screams and a distant heat and he imagined the whistle of thousands of flying blades whittling through flesh and bone and then he heard the screams much worse than even he had dreamed they would be a glimpse of hell he got into his car and drove away careful to stick to back roads the emergency responders would be creating a traffic headache he drove south and dialed a phone number mine is done with success he said by answer i get to be in hellfire henry shawcross but the neonazi did not know him by this name said there has been a change in plans is hellfire canceled no check the following email account henry gave him a gmail account name and password it will contain the name of a city drive there call on a fresh prepaid phone when you arrive and await further instructions when do i get my money follow instructions he hung up the neonazi bit his lip not even a word of congratulations his contact sounded like hed lost the stomach for this battle the neonazi did not like that answer but what could he do complain the mission first that had been driven into his brain ever since he met the man with glasses and the rumpled gray suit at a coffee shop hed spent so much time complaining about the damned jews and various other groups and their plots to eviscerate america on websites it felt good to meet with someone who recognized his unique potential and with the first wave of attacks nearly done now they could truly hurt this hated world he drove for a while he felt the need to put distance between him and the school and stopped ten miles later at a suburban coffee shop that offered free internet access he opened his laptop checked the account the email accounts one message simply said chicago he checked the news websites the bombing was of course the lead news story a smile a bubble of laughter rose from his chest and heat traveled along his skin it felt good to make a fist for justice and throw a hard savage punch and hellfire was going to be so much more than a little punch he trembled with excitement with his promised cut of the money he could recruit new adherents buy automatic weapons buy better material for bombs higherquality explosives and much more of it he could set up operations throughout the midwest he could be somebody who shaped the world he was tempted to go onto the night road site but no not now not here there were a few patrons lingering over their lattes and the barista she looked jewish to him and she kept trying to see what the sharpedged tattoo on his neck was he suddenly didnt want her looking at him he got back in his car and drove north toward chicago the screams playing in his head like a symphony hed written himself a masterpiece the second attack took place in los angeles california outside a small restaurant off sunset boulevard it had unusually been a stormy day in southern california rain fell in broken windblown curtains and the wind hissed like steam and the young man in the car waited on a side street he had never killed before and his hands shook with fright at the thought of what he was about to do he opened the file folder next to him although he had studied it for hours in the past several days when he wasnt praying at the mosque or trying to hide his activities from his mother and his father who would disapprove the targets picture was drawn from his books which outlined how the war against islam must be waged and sold in the hundreds of thousands to the unbelievers his advice was being cited in washington he had the ear of powerful people who might act contrary to allahs will he was a history professor at ucla a specialist in terrorism and the middle east an educated man who apparently knew nothing his words could not be allowed to continue and he had been talking and writing more and more about the possibility of american muslims being seduced into violence as had happened in france germany and britain becoming homegrown carriers of terror then the young man saw the professor walking with his wife and his teenage daughter hurrying huddled under an umbrella the rain had eased in the past fifteen minutes allah smiling on his mission the young man lowered his window fifteen feet away the gun was ready in his hand ten feet away he had to do this he had to keep his nerve so he could qualify himself for a much greater battle he raised his firearm asked allah to guide his aim and fired the modified semiautomatic at the family hoping the drizzling rain would not badly deflect his bullets the wife and the daughter strolling in the front fell screaming he could see that the girl was dead in an instant a bright cloud of blood settling on her skull the wife shrieked badly wounded the professor he who must die stumbled trying to catch his family a dawning horror on his face the gunman fired again another spurt of fire bullets drumming through tender flesh and mortal bone the three of them lay sprawled in the blood and the cleansing rain he had just killed an entire family and for a moment the realization cut to his heart then he thought good well done they had dropped in front of a wine bar and a man ran out a woman stumbling behind him trying to help the family stupid or brave the gunman thought it did not matter the gunman shot them both biting his lip again not caring now he didnt want to be seen didnt want his license plate noticed he revved onto sunset boulevard drove fast blasted through two red lights turned onto side streets he had stolen it earlier that morning changed the plates with a car at the airport now he drove the car to orange county parking in the shadow of a mosque his breathing returning in even tides he had committed a most brazen mass killing in full daylight and escaped now he could be part of hellfire his worth proven he made the phone call he was told there was a change in plans that he would not go to houston that he must check an email account that he had never seen before he went to a computer at a public library and opened the account the message read chicago he had been chosen not just by allah but by his brothers in arms his fellow warriors whoever they were he lowered the window as he drove east letting the damp air refresh his skin and nourish him for the battle and the glory that lay ahead bridger lay bound and tied in the car trunk henry looked at him with a gaze free of pity snows ex had been turned in by a night road member he knew one that bridger had run to in alabama begging for money and a place to hide per henrys orders the man drove bridger in the trunk up to a rural field in northern virginia standing under the gleam of the stars henry wanted a cigarette for the first time in several years the conversation with luke had unnerved him badly he had thought before that luke would at least be willing to hear him out if he could simply get a word in he was sure he could make luke understand barbara kept crowding into his thoughts her final words to him much like lukes i know what you are she had said them right before the crash when hed only grabbed the steering wheel to get her to pull over so he could work his magic convince her that she was wrong if shed only listened the car wouldnt have plowed through the guardrail somersaulted down the hill he had kept his eyes open during the whole crash screaming barbaras name watching her die if only luke would listen a certain tragedy would be avoided barbara had only found a phone in his desk a cell phone he kept for contacts in the middle east the balance sheet for the thinktank had grown thin and he spent long hours rereading his papers wondering when i saw coming why did no one believe me he would ignore that he had failed to include so many vital details that actually happened in the attack his anger at being overlooked would heat like a fever and he would think like a bullied child ill show them all he would sip his whiskey grow morose he knew many people in the middle east some of them with loose connections to the terrorists hed interviewed and psychologically dissected he had sent out feelers calling them asking for meetings trying to find a solution to his problem how he could predict terrorist attacks with greater accuracy how he could win wider acclaim grow his business be seen as a power player hed finally realized hed needed someone that could help him make his vision work shed found the phone and shed listened to a voicemail hed forgotten to erase from an associate of the arab billionaire stupid of him but he had been listening to it when she interrupted him and hed just switched off the phone but she knew it wasnt the phone he normally used what had possessed her to pry to listen to the voicemail had she been afraid he was unfaithful that the phone was used for contact with a mistress he worshipped barbara he knew how lucky he was and she had waited until they were in the car a day later to confront him he should have denied it all while they were driving but he was too rattled he would not make such a mistake again it had cost him barbara it would not cost him his son he had driven to the deserted field from his alexandria home careful that drummond or someone else was not following him there was no sign of a shadow then he reminded himself that if drummond was still part of the government then they could simply train a satellite on him and follow him youre not that important he told himself and that is your strength if theyd realized you were important maybe youd still be with state maybe youd be where you started on the side of the angels then the little stinger of his conscience if you had been treated as important then none of this would have happened i need to speak with him alone ill take a walk said the young alabama man whod delivered bridger he strolled off into the darkness henry dragged bridger out of the trunk propped him against the cars bumper he still wore the leather jacket with its emblazoned eagle ive had a very bad day henry said you know in my business i have to email out position papers on policy and theory to some of the most powerful people in the world bridger stared ive warned my clients about all sorts of impending attacks today a followup on the chlorine bombing an assault on our fuel supplies a rise in neonazi hatred everything ive predicted is coming true bridger moaned behind the gag ive had violence on my mind bridger and you know thinking about violence can make one more violent thats unlucky for you bridgers eyes widened with terror henry unwrapped the gag let the fabric fall from bridgers mouth and he screamed for help no one can hear you henry said god that feels good to say that youre the best part of my day bridger bridger to henrys disgust started to cry your mouth is whats gotten you in trouble i didnt do nothing honest you didnt do anything because your quicksilver contact got killed before you could sell us out no i dont know what youre talking about youre on the houston traffic intersection tape we accessed son it aint me it aint me he was not a brave man in any sense of the word and his stark fear shuddered off him in waves as though it had its own energy his skin could not contain its you even if we hadnt pulled your face off the tape your extremely badass leather jacket with the embroidered eagle on the back is too tasteful and refined to belong to anyone but you bridger bridger hung his head youve broken snows heart she you dont need to hurt her i dont blame her for your betrayal plus shes useful shes already found a guy to fill your shoes and to warm her bed henrys smile shifted when you dont amount to much its easy to replace you he smiled to himself he knew this truth warren dantry hadnt been much of a father or husband in henrys eyes and hed slipped into warrens life with an astonishing ease now we can be friends again and the night road can forgive you henry squatted on the cool grass next to him if you tell me who quicksilver is i dont know that name the man you were meeting works for a company called quicksilver who are they i dont know they said and bridger stopped as though searching for words henry reached over to him found a finger and broke it with a clean snap drummond had taught him the technique years ago for selfdefense bridger howled kicked a muddy trench in the grass knocked his shoulders and head hard against the bumper when he could speak coherent words again he begged dont dont no you have nine more one minute to change your mind and i crack another he let the pain sink in let the horror rise in bridger bridger clenched his teeth i mean do you think quicksilvers going to charge through the woods and rescue you i think not im your only hope for mercy and kindness bridger we can forgive you we can hide you but not if you dont help us the minute passed the only sound bridgers clenched moans he was nothing more than a loser a guy whod drifted from one racist extremist group to another across the south usually doing no more than building their websites and waving a placard during poorly attended demonstrations hed met snow five months ago and theyd moved in together he had an interest in learning how to build bombs but no skill and hed been demoted to solely being the guy in charge of fetching her supplies gently henry reached for the next finger caressed it from nail to joint and before he could break it a desperate spill of words came from bridgers throat i got a call on my cell phone from this man what was his name he didnt give it he said real blunt that he knew i had acquired bomb gear for snow that if i didnt want to go to prison for the rest of my life i needed to cooperate bridger swallowed but how had allen clifford known about snow in the first place henry wondered and the answer was clear we have a spy inside the night road the guy said theyd pay me theyd hide me make sure i didnt go to prison if i just gave everything i knew to him hed come meet me in houston how did you know about what snow was working on i heard snow talking to you he shook his head in shame you were spying on her i knew she made a few simple bombs for people to pick up and use a guy from minnesota a guy from missouri a bunch of hippies from seattle but then she was working on a huge number of bombs for days and days bridger bit his lip so i thought ill go meet this dude then i was gonna capture him and bring him back to you so we could know who the enemy was you know im on your side we youre not part of us youre not smart enough to be one of us henry broke another finger and bridger vomited onto his own lap thats for lying and not even being good at it bridger howled and cried and spat a green rope of spit onto the floor i thought id prove i was useful to you his voice sank into a quicksand of pathetic whining i aint a traitor then prove it tell me everything and ill let you call snow and you can apologize to her so i agreed the guy said hed meet me in downtown houston i wanted it on the streets in case it was a trap so i could run as though a trap couldnt be sprung on bridger in the streets of houston as it clearly had been and one of janes own design told him he had to dress like a homeless man throw me a hand signal that all was clear and the point of this meeting id tell him everything i knew about snow and the bombs i knew about the website she goes on to talk to folks around the world you know people like us how to access the website what snow was planning give em any names i only knew yours and snows and clifford thats the mans name by the way would give you what protection a fresh start overseas i thought id go to sweden or iceland or one of those countries thats nearly all white folks thats just what i told him of course my plan was to capture him bring him back to snow so yall could question him of course did he know about hellfire about the members of the night road for a second it looked like bridger was giving the matter serious thought as much as his lax brain could summon then he shook his head he knew something big might be coming he didnt know what specifically i dont think thank you bridger id like to know if clifford mentioned my name no did he mention luke dantry no did he ever suggest that he was part of a police or government agency no did he use the word quicksilver no how did clifford assure you he could protect you he said they could hide me better than the feds or the police could because there would be no record no paperwork no trail for me to be found no paperwork then quicksilver didnt play by government rules henry rubbed his temples a throbbing headache blossomed in his brain bridgers claims only deepened the mystery but he had to act before either jane or quicksilver could derail hellfire apparently quicksilver didnt know about the first wave of attacks nothing had interfered with the execution of those operations but they suspected the first wave were just a prelude to something bigger he patted bridgers cheek okay let me get your fingers fixed up and well get you on your way really really henry nodded at the pathetic desire to believe really he went to his own car pulled out a video recorder and a tripod mounted a nightvision lens to capture the images and turned it on whats that for discouragement his back was to the camera but he still lowered a black balaclava drawn from his jacket over his face to hide it bridger started to whimper but you promised you promised henry could edit the words out later he broke the remaining eight fingers by the fourth one bridger was unconscious from the pain he kicked bridger in the testicles to waken him bridgers eyes jerked open with numbed fear long enough to be open while henry cut his throat with a straight razor one swift move he put his hand on bridgers shoulder felt the life and the pain seeping out of him and said this is what happens when you attempt to betray the night road the video clip would be put up on the groups website in short order and that should take care of any loyalty issues ten minutes later the boy from alabama returned from his stroll he stared down at bridgers body and henry heard the click of his swallow well get rid of him for me please make sure hes not found dig deep then go home youll receive extra money or extra training at our expense your choice the alabamian nodded his face pale i want to learn how to make bombs ill see that you do henry drove home to alexandria he sat down at his computer quicksilver he needed to know who they were and they would have to be eliminated if they were a new incarnation of the book club a group working outside government constraints then their activities could be mapped followed discovered among the clients of the shawcross group thinktank were leading telecommunications companies concerned about infrastructure attacks transportation companies worried that they themselves could be terrorist targets and financial services companies always knowing that a wave of terrorism could slash their profits in the event of a massive financial collapse he would use his clients resources to find quicksilver he crafted his email carefully then sent it to his highest most discreet contact in each client as one of my key clients i urgently require your help i have been requested by a high government official to test how quickly both government and private databases can unearth covert operatives working on american soil as well as seeing how consistent the information is i suspect lucrative contracts may be at the basis of his decision i have created two false identities allen clifford and kevin drummond please use your databases in communications financial transportation credit security and so on to find them i have given them an association with a legitimate firm called quicksilver risk management please forward any results timestamped on these two identities or this firm thank you and please know that our confidentiality agreement applies henry suspected he wouldnt have long to wait and this would give him the best opportunity to find out about his enemy afterwards he sent out another private email to his clients the first line of the email read forthcoming from shawcross group research a new series of papers outlining the most likely infrastructure attacks against the united states hellfire was going to make him look like a very smart man luke woke up from his doze leaning against the airplanes back wall frankie wu stood over him lukes head throbbed thick with sleep he blinked himself to full wakefulness whats wrong nothing mr lindoe i just wanted to be sure you were all right youre not in your seat sorry i sat to have a think and i thought too much he stood awkwardly frankie wu watched him arms crossed shouldnt you be flying the airplane luke said he went back to his seat his knapsack lay tilted on its side and he wondered if that was the position it was in when he dozed off had wu searched it autopilot just wanted to see if either of you needed anything mr lindoe the use of the false name again the barest emphasis he knows but hes not calling you on it not yet he doesnt want trouble in the air when do we land in new york forty minutes luke glanced at aubrey she was asleep he wasnt surprised not even at his own heavy slumber sleep was escape hunger was a sudden sharp fist of pain wu turned without a word and went back to the cockpit closed the door luke opened the knapsack the gun was still there he checked it unloaded the clip was gone and nowhere in the backpack the gun was now useless the cash hed taken from erics stash was still there though the laptop from erics was there too cool to the touch it hadnt been fired up wu had searched the bag luke went to the tiny galley quietly he checked the drawers in one he found a flight manifest for the food and drinks on the flight the charges paid for by quicksilver risk with a new york city address quicksilver his stomach sank to his toes he picked up the phone in the galley he called information for braintree he remembered the name of the property company of the cabin from its sign near the gate he got the number and called if they rented cabins there ought to be an emergency number in case the renters had a problem after hours he got an answering machine that fed him such a number he redialed yes hello my father has gone missing and he may have rented a cabin from you cabin number three at the edge of the property was it rented by a company called quicksilver i sure am getting calls about this rental the clerk sounded huffy please allen clifford hes missing well he left the cabin a mess destroyed the bedroom furniture and we charged his card again for damages how did he pay ill make sure youre compensated charge card company card quicksilver risk management thank you luke hung up jesus they had paid for the cabin henry was right that didnt mean he could trust henry but it sure didnt mean he could trust these people either he took a calming breath he tore the page with the address from the manifest erics escape route was a trap he found sandwiches in the galley and he ate one the city that never sleeps looked like a creamy miniature galaxy below he guessed they would be landing in new jersey right across the river he shook aubrey she blinked at him awake and ready he handed her a sandwich and mouthed the words the pilot knows we have to run her eyes widened in fear and she mouthed back whats the plan he wished theyd had this discussion back in her car but they hadnt known theyd be able to con their way onto erics flight theyd have to improvise he whispered into her ear a company called quicksilver paid for the cabin we were held in and for this flight her eyes widened in fright who are they she mouthed he shook his head follow my lead he mouthed and she nodded he took her hand and they waited to land the plane taxied toward the small terminal at the private airfield wu asked through the intercom for them to remain in their seats luke disobeyed he got up went to the door popped the lever the door swung open and an alarm brayed into the cold night air aubrey was at his back and they jumped to the tarmac aubrey landed next to him and they ran cutting through the roar of the engines he heard frankie wus oncefriendly voice yelling in rage the airports runway was between them and a fence and another commuter jet was preparing to take off now that wus plane was clear luke and aubrey ran to the edge of the runway then he heard voices bellowing his name luke luke dantry stop he glanced back causing aubrey to collide into him and saw two men running past where frankie wu had screeched his jet to a stop wu was in the doorway pointing at them closing fast quicksilvers welcoming party he thought if he and aubrey stayed put theyd be dead the other commuter jet approached we can make it he thought aubreys hand clenched in his they ran across the runway the departing jet catching them in its lights rising knocking them in a battering wash of engine both stumbling to their knees from the wake he looked back one of the quicksilver men held a collapsible rifle and was unslinging it from a knapsack on his back aubrey run he yelled they bolted back to their feet running nearly in a headlong dive both intent on reaching the fence forty feet beyond the mesh lay a parking lot a scattering of cars a stream of light beckoned beyond the hazy glow of a highway the grass erupted in front of his feet shots spewing green bits of lawn they kept running they hit the fence he slowed to help her but aubrey was quicker and more nimble clambering up the chain link with an assured grace she reached the concertina wire and paused pulling her coat free she balled it over her head in a tight dome and wiggled through the slicing spiral i dont want to get caught again she screamed and he knew to his bones her fear that helpless thisisnothappeningtome terror hed felt it when eric lindoe had stuck the gun into his ribcage steered him out of normalcy into the rapids of nightmare he knew shed felt it when that burlap bag went over her head as she left her office she was through on the ground pants torn along the leg where the razor wire scored he ripped off his own coat following her lead yelling at her to keep running dont look back he covered his head with the cheap windbreaker just as he heard the voices closing in one saying no way then thumps against the fence the boom of the rifle the lined windbreaker made a fragile cocoon the curling wire cut past his defenses he felt a slash along his scalp his back his butt then gravity superseded fear yanking him through the last curve the concertina cutting at his suddenly bare stomach he hit the ground panicked rolling free of the tattered windbreaker running for the lot aubrey was gone it wasnt that big a parking lot and she wasnt moving through the moonlight where was she shes hiding he thought and then he saw a car racing away from the lot far faster than normal traffic and in a blur her face struggling at the window aubrey he yelled he glanced back the quicksilver men whod dogged him to the fence ran yelling into cell phones not in such a hurry of course not they had friends waiting to catch aubrey and him maybe a team for each a car powered up raced straight toward him as he ran off the curb luke ran not deeper into the parking lot where he knew the mercedes sedan could corner him as their partners had caught aubrey nor back toward the razortipped fence where the two men had corralled him he ran toward the highway the grass funneled out into a short expanse maybe sixty feet across and then a service road and then the torrent of cars traffic still brisk at a late hour people returning from manhattan behind him the quicksilver mercedes vroomed off the asphalt lot onto the dry grass blood coursed down his calves where the wire had bit he did not dare glance behind him he did not want to see it was worse than being pursued by mouser and snow because this was teams coordinated an inexorable fist closing around him luke hit the service road and a minivan laid on its horn nearly veering off the road trying to avoid him the van revved past him leaving a wake of burnt stench and a scream of you crazy asshole as he ran the pursuing mercedes lurched across the grass closing the distance fast and now he glanced back saw a rear window powering down he measured his options in one glance he could go to the right where the service road curved toward a distant intersection and the mercedes could run him down or scoop him up or he could go left where hed be running headlong into oneway traffic but to the left was an entrance ramp onto the highway bordered by a crash barrier so the mercedes would have both to go against the oneway traffic and make a degree sharpasnails turn to follow him onto the highway he headed for the ramp two cars hurtled at him both screaming with their horns and he ran between them feet snapping on the white line he ran like a machine the wind carrying him trying to urge every bit of speed from his tired muscles a screech yowled behind him metal sliding skimming hard against other metal he turned as he sprinted along the highway entrance ramp another car zooming past him in a blur luke stormed up the ramp and he glanced back the mercedes began a sharp turn to navigate the entrance smoke misting the wheels five lanes of traffic a median wall and then five more lanes they would catch him if he hugged the shoulder and ran in the direction of the traffic or smear him like jam along the concrete but a stream of traffic coursed by and he couldnt get across the lanes in time it would be a violent waltz where one wrong step or one veering driver would kill him no time to hesitate he saw the approaching cars and their headlights and he had to dodge them a belching semi rocketed past him and he ran the first lane in its wake seeing a station wagon in the second the wagon slammed brakes and he jumped and ran around it clearing it and the third lane as the station wagon resumed speed the mercedes powered fast onto the highway he froze no choice five zooming sedans powering past him he was trapped the mercedes approaching trying to navigate to his lane the mercedes aimed dead on for him as the fifth car blasted by and he ran brakes screeching a crunch as a car swerved over into another lane its side crumpling against another sedan the mercedes cut around the cars heading straight for luke he could see the triumph on the drivers face then the mercedes was rearended by a brakeslamming truck luke turned and ran through the final lane and vaulted the concrete wall the slowing of traffic had already started due to the inexorable human urge to rubberneck and while the new yorkbound traffic didnt slam to standstill he managed a short brutal dash to the opposite side a truck barreled past him on the exit ramp clearing him by inches and he fell on the concrete and saw the tires just miss his outstretched fingertips he looked up and the truck was past him slowing at the end of the ramp brake lights brightening he cleared the ramp by hurtling himself over its edge dropping fifteen feet to soft dirt he went to one knee weary with the cold shaking and the adrenaline turning on him burning like poison in his veins he staggered back to his feet and caught his breath the quavering in his legs finally easing he ran down the service road the weight of the knapsack heavy on him they got aubrey he had to get her back he ran to the intersection where an allnight mart sat in a puddle of streetlight he walked in and heard the soft sounds of indian sitar music drifting above the shelves a few minutes ago hed been dodging cars now he was shopping he wondered if he looked shellshocked he bought a firstaid kit and a hot coffee and a bottle of water he went to the bathroom and inspected his cuts a thin shallow one marked his stomach the concertina wire had nipped him where his shirt had been hiked and twisted another cut had sliced through the back of his jeans a scoring across his calf and lower back that stung even more when he saw them he smeared on disinfectant gel applied adhesive bandages to the worst of the cuts and swallowed aspirin he downed the cold water in four long gulps he drank the stillwarm coffee and the heat began to seep into his blood under his skin luke left the minimart and walked away from the highway he had to keep moving but it was late and they would not stop hunting him he did not feel panic rather the calm of resolution he was going to take the war back to these people first things first he was still entirely too close to the air park and the highway and the quicksilver team might have friends he found a taxi letting off passengers close to a bus station he showed the cabbie the address for quicksilver hed stolen from the food manifest that address you know what part of the city that is that is near nyu in greenwich village the cabbie said after consulting a detailed map lets go the cabbie informed him of everything wrong about new york a city luke had always enjoyed visiting luke sat in the back seat and listened only enough to make agreeing grunts when required for politeness when they reached washington square luke asked the cabbie to let him out at the entrance to the park luke walked through the darkened paths and sat down on a bench he surveyed the immediate area for trouble and police and saw only a drunk reclining on a bench thirty feet away staring at the grass as though it held the secrets of the universe what will they do with aubrey he imagined the worst for a long while and when the drunk approached and asked if he had five bucks he got up and walked out of the park he did not walk to the quicksilver address he found a small hotel that catered to new york university visitors and paid cash for a minuscule room he registered under a fake name brian blue because a weird abstract blue painting hung in the lobby and brian was the name of the annoying neighbor whod badmouthed him on the television news he sprawled on the lumpy bed he wanted to curl into the cocoon of sleep but he couldnt they had aubrey she had been kidnapped again and the thought of what she must be enduring burned being kidnapped at gunpoint he knew was not something you got accustomed to even with practise he had thought he was taking them to safety he wished he had talked her into going to the police now shed be safe and he would be able to give up this fight just vanish run find a nice big rock to hide under he stared out the window running was no life hiding was no life he couldnt give up not yet he had never felt so alone even chained in the cabin there escape had been the only option he could pursue but now he could try to save aubrey or go to the police and surrender or try and fight the night road and henry he unpacked the knapsack the useless gun the laptop that hed already picked clean he pulled erics key ring from his pocket the chicago bulls toy basketball on the end of the ring caught on the pockets inside lining he yanked it free there was a slight catch on the edge of the toy ball under the bulls logo he hadnt noticed it before he worked his thumb on the catch the ball popped open inside was a usb plug the kind that slid into a computer port the other half of the basketball was solid it was a hidden thumb drive a portable way to carry computer files oh my god luke said in the silence of the room he powered up the laptop and logged in then he slid the secret thumb drive into the laptop the thumb drive appeared on the screen holding his breath biting his lip he clicked on it inside was a single file he tried to click it open but all he got was a dance of gobbledygook glowing random numbers and letters across his screen the file was encrypted eric had started his career in bank operations he would know about encryption luke knew then this must be the file that contained the whereabouts of the fifty million dollars nothing else could be so important the thumb drive was erics insurance in the face of certain death from the night road his bargaining chip for quicksilver hed simply carried it in his pocket this was the information on where the fifty million was hidden and the key he knew to stopping henry and the night road but he had no idea how he could access the information the encryption key needed to be on the computer and it wasnt on this laptop he tucked the gun under his pillow even empty it reassured him and he put the key ring under the pillow as well luke closed his eyes and the weight of what he knew he must do pressed him into fitful exhaustion as the darkness pressed against the windows the eyes of the night road and quicksilver kept watch scanning every credit charge every hotel database looking for lukes name erics name any sign any mistake that would signal his location and while the thousand electronic eyes watched he slept the day had nearly driven mouser mad snow made a poor patient she slept fitfully waking often to worry if hellfire would be canceled mouser kept waiting on the night road hacker to pierce the gps database and hand him aubrey and luke hed paced tracks in the already questionable carpet of the south chicago motel room snow alternated between uncomfortable sleep and watching him fret you had him in the basement she said finally is that whats preying on your mind baby because i had him in the woods and he got away from me im not happy with how weve done we can do better come here she said lie down next to me and see if you cant calm down he swallowed thinking he shouldnt i hate this waiting i need a little more warmth than the blanket she said he lay down next to her certain she couldnt want him not after being shot in the shoulder but she did he was conscious of her bandages and was very gentle with her the whole time her small mouth was a hard little o and he wasnt sure if she was happy or angry until the savoring smile broke across her face at the end afterwards he watched the ceiling and thought god sent her to me to be my helper against the beast ive had bad luck with catching luke but that all changes now hes running out of rope he cant go to the police he cant go much anywhere where the night road cant find him you know why i hate the government why do you her breath warmed his shoulder he didnt intend to answer but then her fingers began a slow meander across his stomach i knew tim mcveigh he said oh im not bragging we werent buddies but wed met at a couple of meetings of folks who didnt like the government infringing on peoples rights i had some acquaintances who decided they would emulate mcveigh by bombing a big shopping mall i didnt know about the plot but i got hit with a jail sentence because theyd called me and asked me about acquiring explosives and i didnt turn them in they blabbed about me i hadnt done anything wrong and yet i went to prison for five years snow was silent so in there i met a guy henry interviewing socalled domestic terrorists delving into our heads trying to figure out if i hated my dad was dominated by my mother psychobabble crap he thinks terrorists hate their dads some of them he said it was a consistent pattern i got a friend outside to send me one of his books i would have died for my dad snow said softly i know what loyalty is he and i kept talking i liked talking with henry i got out and i sort of bummed around did mechanics work when i could find it and kept thinking about how i could make the beast pay for taking five years of my life he felt her fingers grope along his chest skirt the tattoos that read glory and death that spread across his muscles move down across the flat of his belly we lost a lot from the government she said you more than me your family i remember the rage i felt after waco after ruby ridge after what happened to your compound in wyoming show me she whispered closing her hand around him show me that rage he made rougher love to her in answer not caring about her injured shoulder she gasped and writhed gritting her teeth when they were done she put his head on her stomach and rubbed his hair gently he felt he could have stayed there forever safe against her skin wrong feeling the mission was more important the mission trumped all just before ten pm his cell phone rang mouser scooped it up yes the night road hacker said i found your target where i got a lead on them from a traffic camera last evening that gave me a starting point for searching the gps database and getting a read on them aubrey perraults car is now at lakefront air park private aviation field north of the city he fed mouser the address thank you when you kill the cop for me send me the news clipping the hacker hung up mouser got off the bed and climbed into his clothes a private air park first erics name forged on a passenger manifest now a private jet to whisk them out of chicago he and snow and henry were clearly up against someone with serious resources get up he said sharper than he intended snow sat up let the sheets pool at her waist i need my bandage changed get up now theyre at an airport theyre leaving the city we got to go now all gentleness in him was gone nothing else mattered mouser parked the small airpark appeared closed he spotted a security guard older africanamerican heavyset walking along the sidewalk in front of the terminal building they surprised him with their guns hurried him into the building using his electronic pass key the guard was afraid for his life he kept telling mouser he had a wife two daughters three grandsons he kept repeating their names a threadbare litany like invoking saints who would protect him snow studied the computers database it had not been locked two people logged as taking a flight to new jerseys ridgcliff air park pilot frankie wu passengers eric lindoe and aubrey perrault that smart bastard mouser shook his head snow raised an eyebrow i strongly suggest you lose that slight tone of admiration nita shawnelle latika joy trevor david shawn the guard said eyes on the floor as though he could see the faces of the loved ones in the texture of the carpet hold them in your thoughts mouser said may i ask you a question the guard in his sixties looked up his face crumpling with grief i guess you dont get any more ready to die even when youre old mouser thought before you worked here what did you do im retired from the police department thank you mouser said and paid his bill to the hacker with one quick shot snow watched then returned her gaze to the screen on the computer who paid for the flight mouser asked quicksilver risk management get us tickets on a redeye to new york he smiled he had not even smiled when theyd made love im glad to finally know who our enemy is at first aubrey thought she was dead darkness surrounded her she blinked and awareness slowly warmed her her hand lay stretched above her head tingling from lack of circulation and she thought for one surprising second that she lay back on the narrow hard bed in the east texas cabin waiting for eric to come save her the poor gallant fool of course she wasnt and she gave a halflaugh halfcough she moved stretched let her fear subside and let herself drink in her surroundings her hand lay bound above her head and her desertdry mouth tasted of chemical gunk thirst crushed her throat she moaned the flight to new york had gone so wrong why had she gotten involved in this madness the plan hadnt worked she remembered the men closing in on her manhandling her into the back seat of a car trying to fight screaming a needle piercing her flesh then an awful sodden blackness that smothered her vague notions of a buzzing noise darkness the hum of machinery she felt as though shed slept for days years everything had gone wrong luke did they get luke a faint light switched on and aubrey could see she lay in a narrow bedroom she tried to blink past the medicinal haze that fogged her thoughts and focus on the mans face that appeared above hers a mans face familiar maybe but then she closed her eyes she opened them again and the haze cleared and she didnt know this man aubrey her lips formed an answer where am i where is a good start tell me where luke dantry will go i dont know the voice she kept her eyes closed because she did not want to look at him again did not respond fingertips moved hair from her eyes am i to believe that two kidnapping victims who have endured as much as you and luke dantry made no contingency plan if you were separated no we slept on the plane a soft low patient laugh yes you like to sleep on planes she risked opening her eyes again i almost believe you when you say you dont know where luke will run but i dont im telling you the truth a long pause lets talk about eric he was going to give us information information tell me about this night road she wasnt sure what to say eric just told me the name extremists a bunch of different causes he kept it all secret from me we broke up she added she felt woozy the bed gave a slight lurch and she became aware that the heavy droning noise wasnt a rattling in her head waking up from a drugaddled daze the white noise sounded like jet engines she blinked again at the unadorned curved metal ceiling and she thought this is a plane i am on a plane again where are they taking me wise of you he stared at her in the dim glow she could see the ice in his gaze a person stripped of every decent feeling she thought she tried to remember if he had been one of the men in new york who grabbed her she thought not he stood he wore black slacks a navy shirt and she saw a bit of silver chain peeking out from under the shirt youre going to help me find luke dantry i dont know where he is or where hell go lets call him and let him know youre still alive oh god please dont kill me dont hurt me she hated the begging in her voice but the fear surged and her heart swelled in her chest as though the muscle would explode were going to call luke tell him that youre alive he unfolded a cell phone dialed and then listened after what seemed like a century he closed the phone didnt he have erics phone he broke it without another word the man turned and walked away from her cot she raised her head it looked like she was in a cargo plane or transport of some sort at the other end of the cabin she could see the man issuing orders to a younger man who sat at a desk a set of computer screens before him the young man answered in a french accent she could barely make out the boss and the frenchman she named them in her head the frenchman glanced back at her and she saw an ugly halfcircle scar on his cheek french paris were they taking her to paris as frankie wu had mentioned back in chicago it didnt make sense why were they were taking her and leaving luke behind why she said why she wanted to know she held her breath the boss glanced back at her came back to the bed how much do you mean to him i dont know will he try and find you or keep running i dont know why did he run i dont know he said he had to run aubrey didnt want to say that they knew quicksilver had funded the cabin where they were held she was afraid of what would happen the boss looked at her for the longest ten seconds of her life get some sleep he said youre safe now aubrey didnt believe him she didnt believe him at all but she closed her eyes and she pretended to sleep and she tried to listen to every sound every word anything that would help her figure out where she was and how she could escape the address for quicksilver risk was a twelve story building a few blocks from washington square the tower glittered glass and chrome more modern than its surrounding fellows it did not carry the purple flag of nyu like other structures in the area and luke did not see students gathered around its entrance in the fifteen minutes hed stood sentinel he did not see anyone leave or arrive hed checked in the phone book no listing for quicksilver risk a company that didnt bother to be in the phone book in a building that no one entered or left luke stood on a corner down from the building he slowly read a times hed salvaged from the trash glancing now and then at his watch so now what saunter in and see what happened to him he could be walking into a trap if frankie wu noticed the charge manifest was missing from the galley or if theyd made aubrey talk theyd know luke learned this address theyd be waiting for him maybe aubrey was here inside in trouble but he needed help he needed a way to break into that encrypted file if quicksilver wanted this fifty million from the terrorists hed strike a deal with them trade them the file for aubrey of course there was nothing to prevent them from just taking the drive from him and killing him and aubrey luke made his decision the lions den had to be braved luke folded the paper and walked toward the building at the front door luke could see a doorman through the heavy glass he was an imposing sort barrelchested thick hands peeking from the cuffs of the navy wool uniform everything about him was hard and he looked like he could deck luke into a hospital bed with one punch was he one of the men at the airport luke didnt recognize him luke tapped at the glass thicker than normal glass he noticed good day sir the doorman said he stood beyond the locked door hands behind his back but he didnt open it who are you here to see not just a doorman a guard mr drummond he remembered the name from the email to eric about the flight from chicago and mentioned by henry im luke dantry hes expecting me the doorman stepped inside after holding the door for luke the entryway was cool tiled with a massive desk with a large raised counter around it the kind that concealed monitors no building directory no tenants the lobby was small with two doors behind the desk both were heavy steel no decor the air felt very still the soft hum in the walls seemed to be made by machinery not people moving and talking in offices beyond luke had the oddest sense of entering a bunker a hideaway like an old comic book heros lair the doorman kept a polite gaze on luke as he keyed in a message onto a keyboard apparently phones werent good enough or he didnt want luke to hear the message he was communicating luke glanced up at the camera perched in the corner let it read his face mr drummond will see you the doorman moved his hand to another part of the desk the locks on the front door engaged with a soft click he was locked in follow me please the doorman said apparently the front door was not to be left unattended a fortress in manhattan an elevator door slid open and the doorman gestured luke inside they rose in stately silence it was the quietest elevator that luke had ever ridden the car stopped suddenly with a soft shrill whistle the doorman pulled out a huge gun from under his jacket and pressed it against lukes skull you have weapons on you spare us both the indignity of a search a gun in the back of my pants but its unloaded he tried a provocation your buddy frankie wu took my ammo clip the doorman stripped the gun from his back at least frankie did something right before he flew back to chicago luke glanced up at the elevator ceiling metal detector nothing so primitive the doorman entered in a key on a pad and the elevator resumed its ascent the doorman lowered the gun away from lukes face and luke remembered to breathe again this building is um unusual prime real estate but unoccupied mr drummond can explain it to you if he chooses a soft ping as they reached the top floor the doors slid open onto a hallway it had a spare wooden floor and an elegant persian rug running down its stretch a doorway stood at the end they stepped into the hallway and the far door opened he had a weapon sir the scans show him now as clear the doorman said at the end of the hall stood a man in a dark turtleneck and jeans saltandpepper hair broad shoulders not tall but heavily muscled he had a pugnacious face that looked like it had been battered over the years his eyes were slightly pinched it made luke think of a reader who spent a great deal of time peering through books he found disagreeable a weapon i blush with pride hello luke he didnt smile hi mr drummond luke said he wondered if drummond knew eric was dead he must know this man looks like he knows everything may we talk i have dreamed of the day drummond raised an eyebrow he seemed to survey lukes face as though it were a map hed seen once before but that had been redrawn over time the doorman turned and left drummond watched him a slight smile crept onto his face luke decided to play his card is aubrey perrault here no do you know where she is yes i do and shes safe i doubt that your people shot at us last night rubber bullets they hurt but they dont kill unless you dont know what youre doing he remembered the bullets spraying up the grass at their feet they could have shot him and aubrey in the legs but they didnt you gave everyone a fright running into traffic you could have gotten yourself killed luke you look at me like you think you know me i know who you were luke im more interested drummond said in who youre going to be the apartment had the most disturbing walls luke had ever seen giant photos covered them like wallpaper one image per wall each a massive enlargement one picture was a young girl huddling in the bombed ruins of a stone cabin her face looked like a surprised ghost another photo showed people in a middle eastern bazaar expressions contorted in naked fear as they looked over their shoulders at an unbidden and dawning threat a gunman a car bomb who knew the terror and the resignation on their faces was a timeless stamp another photo of a man luke recognized a former senator clearly staggered by loss leaning against a porch railing that senator his son died i remember it in the papers shot to death by a terrorist in japan while studying abroad luke said you have odd decor i am an odd man drummond said after all i am welcoming you into my office and you had a hand in my friends death you kidnapped my friend last night your friend is perfectly safe my friend is dead i had nothing to do with allen cliffords death i was kidnapped forced to drive at gunpoint then chained up in a cabin your company paid for drummond raised an eyebrow we financed a cabin you being taken there was not our doing but you killed allen clifford i didnt kill allen clifford i know who did who eric lindoe operating under orders from a british woman named jane who kidnapped erics girlfriend kidnapping me and killing your friend was janes ransom demand for aubreys safety convenient to blame him since hes not here to defend himself hes dead back in chicago he kidnapped me in austin to force information from my stepfather he thought it would be better to hold off on mentioning the fifty million it would take over the conversation and he wanted to know more first tell me everything drummond said i think to get to the truth we must trust each other weve been pitted against each other luke and we should not be enemies you must think the same or you wouldnt have come here after running from us drummond gestured at a large glass table sit luke sat down and drummond sat across from him drummonds faint smile inched wider went crooked like eric you wish to make a deal tell me everything and ill give you something in exchange i ask then you ask we can hammer out a deal all right you first youre the guest drummond said ill judge whether or not to trust you further by the intelligence you show in what you ask if he failed if he asked the wrong questions he might never learn the truth or drummond could be playing him he wasnt ready to offer the encrypted file yet he wanted to see what he could learn first drummond studied him a cat easing on its haunches before the mouse hole first question is quicksilver behind my kidnapping no the cabin had been rented in advance to be used by clifford for an interrogation of a suspect the man he was meeting a loser named bridger who ran when you and eric approached was selling information on a domestic terrorist network to clifford i suspect that he was killed and the cabin used to make your stepfather and the night road aware of quicksilvers existence since clifford and the cabin point back to quicksilver someone wanted the night road to know quicksilver is chasing them to put us in each others sights you know about the night road i didnt know the name until eric mentioned it two days ago we know its a loose affiliation of extremist groups turning toward violence working together to share resources tactics and information and i suspect the roads hand in the ripley attack and the attacks over the past week attacks e coli infecting a food plant in tennessee pipeline bomb in canada attempted bombing of a pipeline in alaska and last night a bombing at a high school football game in kansas city eight dead a hundred injured and one of our leading thinkers in counterterrorism was slaughtered with his family while leaving a restaurant in los angeles oh god no you should know i found these people you found all these people for who henry when he said henrys name his mouth made a curl of distaste under the false pretense of doing psychological profiling for his thinktank i gave him thousands of names he whittled it down to the most committed and dangerous my role is a pawn who got played henry used you and youre a pawn whos pissed off about it drummond said yes what is quicksilver it was as if drummond did not hear the question i can offer you what i offered eric get you out of the country hide you under another name youll be safe you give me all the information you have on the night road thats the deal no i dont want to be stashed away i want my life back my good name i want to be cleared of cliffords death and the officer in chicago and i want to help stop the night road noble of you but unnecessary drummond said my offer is what it is youre not part of this battle luke and i think it best you hide until the dangers passed know that youre helping us by telling us everything about the night road thats your contribution its not enough please i helped build that network i want to help destroy it i cant just sit someplace safe while henry runs a terror cell drummond studied him why did henry use you i dont know i was handy i guess what is quicksilver are you cia fbi a black ops group what he took a breath are you like the book club how did you know about the book club henry he was desperate that i not see you oh ill bet he was did you know my dad did you work with him in the government what did he do i said no more on quicksilver they stared at each other luke tried a different tack drummond wouldnt answer his questions but oddly he seemed to want to hear what luke wanted to ask what are all these pictures my many failures luke turned away from the portraits of suffering what you screwed over all these people yourself consider them salt in the wound i failed in these instances so these people suffered i remember them every day i have no choice the book club tried to help people mostly succeeding but not always good doesnt always win out you could take the pictures down i would still see their faces its easier to see them on the walls than in my dreams i dont understand why you would help eric get out of chicago when he killed your friend because stopping the night road is more important than revenge eric made a bad choice under tremendous pressure and then when it all unraveled he was ready to betray the night road i didnt like him but i do whats necessary to save lives i will trade everything i know for aubreys release and information about quicksilver otherwise we have no deal you assume that we would hurt aubrey we wont were the good guys drummond said then please tell me what i need to know i cant i need you to trust me entirely i need you to tell me everything luke and to please please ask me no questions i need you for the sake of your country to cooperate fully and to let me hide you some place where youll be safe why should i trust you when you wont trust me luke said drummond sighed he reached under his turtleneck and lifted up a piece of silver from under the sweaters black weight a saint michaels medal an exact duplicate of the one that luke wore the archangel stood tall sword in one hand shield in the other wings of steel spread lukes eyes widened where did you get that an old friend gave it to me a few weeks before he died an old friend luke echoed your father one of my closest friends now knowing that will you trust me luke studied drummonds face i will seeing the twin of his own medal around drummonds neck filled his head with a hundred questions my dad would order you to listen to me and to do as i say please for your own safety i cannot explain more now help me the only way you can tell me everything about the night road i guess i should start with the most important part the fifty million dollars drummond raised an eyebrow luke could see he hated to be surprised but he was the fifty million what drummond asked henry shawcross leaned forward across the table and said quicksilver has my son we are going to get him back mouser and snow glanced at each other a thin haze of smoke from mousers cigarette hung above the hotel room table they sat at a window but snow insisted the curtains be kept drawn she said satellites could spy on them henry thought she might be right he studied their faces they looked haggard tired they could not be he needed them sharp there was a police incident report filed shots fired near the air park where lukes plane landed a man running into traffic causing a couple of accidents quicksilver grabbed them hed driven up from washington late last night when the news came from mouser that luke was headed for new york who the hell are these quicksilver clowns mouser asked henry waved the smoke away from his face i gave some of my thinktank clients a security exercise to perform to find every record affecting quicksilver risk and my old friend drummond and clifford who are not much more than hired guns quicksilver is a small risk management consulting group but im sure its just a front but they have also bought sometimes through front companies buildings around the us europe asia and the middle east they have accounts in banks around the world again under a set of holding company names are they cia drummond used to be state department i dont think its state but im not sure why the cia or fbi would go to this trouble to hide unless theyre simply breaking the law and avoiding congressional oversight you want us to attack a building snow said i live for this mouser said its not a typical building there are no tenants they will have a skeleton staff all you have to do is get luke back kill everyone else i dont care and this is to save luke you know were just going to have to kill him henry face facts hes not coming over to your side i want to talk with him hustle him into a van and bring him to me face facts mouser repeated youre deluded i am in command here mouser not you mouser said for the moment henry ignored him quicksilver knows of us thanks to bridger so we have to decapitate them before they can act just the two of us and you snow said i have some important hellfire work to do ive arranged for some night road help for the two of you he looked at snow and snow we need to move your bombs i need to know you didnt leave booby traps around your storage space in houston why youre not there to handle the distribution ive gotten a night road team to go to houston to transport the bombs to a new location where are you taking the bombs snow asked thats need to know youre about to go on a job where you could be captured no traps snow said after a moment take good care of my babies youre running this show mouser said but its your fault were in the hole were in your continued failure to capture luke is our hole henry said but ive gotten you some more muscle sweet bird was not a man who enjoyed waiting for other people but impatience got you killed these days mr shawcross had offered him enough arms to eliminate every rival gang in queens and new jersey the albanians the leftover italians the mean russians and the asian tongs he couldnt say no to such a deal even if the risk was high his grandmother who never lived to see him become a leading kingpin and had hoped he would become a physician had drilled that lesson into his head by soft cajole and hard belt take your opportunities dont waste them so when shawcross called him early that morning hed listened to the delicious sound of a rare chance to make a powerful friend i may need you to assault a building a building youre kidding me i dont like the sound of hesitation aint hesitating im listening you probably dont like the sound of some idiot leaping before he looks you do this youll be one of the most powerful men in new york by the end of the day i have a lot of work for you mr shawcrosss voice had carried a low gleam over the phone and mr shawcross always delivered in the past two months hed sent sweet bird real nice belgian rifles to use trained his men helped them take down rival drug lords and a bothersome da given him armyquality grenades to eliminate a couple of informants right in their cars no need to bother with unreliable handmade pipe bombs and from the night road website handed him a couple of small insurance agencies that sold cheap policies made it easy to shine and polish and legitimize the cocaine money he was waiting for shawcrosss two people at a back room at one of the agencies a few blocks from greenwich village he waited with five of his regular guys one who was sweet birds cousin a violent gangster wannabe luke had found two months before on a board discussing urban warfare the others hardened street fighters he watched as they doublechecked their weapons he had one of the nice belgian rifles and he ran his hands over the cool fine metal he had modified a raincoat so he could carry the rifle in it unseen in the background cnn played talking about the spate of attacks across america a rapid rising of violence that was undercutting americans confidence to simply go about their lives two minutes later there was a knock on the door and he opened it to find a lean muscled guy with a crew cut and a pretty but scowling woman who had a scary mop of white hair they gave the right password mouser snow pleased to make your acquaintance i aint never met anyone from night road face to face you understand the plan as presented mouser said and you understand im in charge its not rocket science sweet bird said lets go get it done they left in two cars mouser drove snow said did you tell that guy you want luke dantry dead if hes there no mouser said you and i will handle it i dont trust anyone else hes night road hes okay nobodys okay i thought henry was hes distracted by his affection for his stepson its become a problem if lukes at this building he stops being a problem for us you dont know about the fifty million dollars luke said you have to be kidding drummond measured his expression looking for a sign of bluff no i dont his head tilted slightly as though listening to the soft hiss of the air conditioner he flicked his glance at the kitchen corner for the barest of moments if luke had not been watching him so closely for his reaction he wouldnt have noticed luke glanced at the corner as well he saw a pinpoint hole in the ceiling a camera maybe he had the sudden sense they were being watched maybe his imagination but the past few days had taught him to trust his instincts a man as desperate as eric would have mentioned every asset to win his safety luke put his gaze back on drummonds face he wouldnt forget to mention fifty million offering us information on the night road would have won him ample protection he didnt have to mention money for the first time drummond looked shaken we were working on iding him from the airport garage video and the speeding ticket video he contacted me wait how did eric know how to find you that was a mystery but he knew quicksilver was more than a risk company he wanted protection and he gave me enough info on night road for me to know it was legit i hadnt even met him face to face yet luke realized drummond had no reason to lie then eric was going to keep the money for himself you pick his brain you hide him away where the night road cant kill him and then he vanishes with fifty million stashed away and waiting for him and neither the night road nor quicksilver gets the cash youre too busy waging war against each other to care what he does it was a simple but brilliant plan where is this money drummond said i thought you said it didnt matter money is lifeblood for terrorism where is it luke weve got to secure that money before the night road uses it tell me who quicksilver is and ill give you the fifty million drummond paused as though holding in his anger and then luke saw it a minuscule earpiece in drummonds ear okay drummond said you give me the location of the money and ill answer your questions i go first luke watched the corner of the kitchen where drummond had seemed to pause are we being watched or listened to does it matter which to luke meant yes he took a deep breath and then asked again i want to know what the connection is between you and my stepfather and my dad why do you have a saint michael medal like mine drummond tented fingers under his chin frowned that connection is the key to why i was targeted youre on one side of this fight henry on another and youre both part of my fathers past drummond was silent for ten long seconds seeing you brings back a lot of memories i carried you once on my shoulders i remember when you were a small kid i saw you a few times at your parents house there were three of us at the beginning me your stepfather and your father the words unnerved luke his father had led an entirely secret life and the foundation of what luke had always believed about his dad seemed to shift under his feet a wave of dizziness hit him and passed the beginning you said beginning of this book club book club was a joke name because it was mostly professors and writers but it stuck the state department recruited your stepdad then your dad and your father found several others including me to work with a secret group unofficial to approach and solve the worlds problems in new and fresh ways what do you do if theres a foreign leader who becomes an enemy you cant assassinate him thats always a temporary solution but maybe the book club would say we find an unsuspected way to erode the guys power among his base perhaps involving subtle economic changes that hurt his biggest backers or political pressure that he doesnt see as coming from the west its more effective than assassination but it takes imagination and then some muscle and wellapplied armtwisting to make the situation happen thats just an example the professors were the thinkers me and clifford and sometimes the professors carried out the missions we had a few successes sometimes subtlety is greater than force he gestured at the photos we had a few failures subtlety doesnt always work im having trouble picturing this luke shook his head my dad was a history professor tweed jackets and obscure books crammed in every space and chalk dusting his fingers now you say he was some sort of counterterrorist one of the best you dont realize how good they were luke sat back down it felt like the air had vanished from the room thats why he had so many visiting professorships europe asia africa it wasnt about being a teacher or research it was about spying yes did my mother know i dont know dont lie did she know no drummond said after a moment most of us werent married only your dad was he kept it from her orders orders his father had been an operative for a secret group how many secrets had been hidden behind warren dantrys smile tears pricked lukes eyes and he blinked them back and my stepfather the same he glanced around the room trying to see where the other cameras might be it was strange how claustrophobic you could feel in a room full of windows yes but of course when your father and everyone on the plane died the book club died hed wanted to start a new group in the weeks before the book club had problems your father and your stepfather disagreed fairly often henry wanted to lobby for more money more attention inside state your dad wanted to keep a low profile just get the work done and quicksilver is the heir apparent to the book club drummond rubbed his face yes we started quicksilver your father died before he could see it take shape quicksilver grew out of our earlier work a new way to fight the bad guys to stop terrorism before it starts to bring new strategies to the problem a new way he wondered where the money came from for this building for the security for the private jet for all the resources that quicksilver had are you still part of the state department he gave a jagged laugh shook his head we started quicksilver and in a wonderful symmetry you helped start the night road sweat was on drummonds face as though the silent listeners would be measuring him watching him the phone began to ring a soft repetitive warble drummond didnt move im not going to answer it drummond said because im going to tell you why i want to keep you safe your father saved me once and im repaying the karma best way i can im going to get you out of the way of a war war there is a war beginning a secret war the silence hung between them like a mist you cant fight a war in secret people tend to notice armies and bullets and missiles luke shook his head that sort of war is dying this war started a long time ago skirmishes and in both cases each side used governments as their proxies their pawns influence was their currency and then there were only two sides not a thousand like now and each was able to say that their concerns matched those of their governments that these interests were aligned and the governments believed it drummond sounded for a moment like he couldnt continue the phones buzzing began again but the governments they didnt stop or the bali or madrid or london or jordan bombings do you know how much they cost thousands of lives yes of course and thats incalculable but think how much they cost the economic damage who suffers economic damage well everyone everyone drummonds voice oozed contempt the phone stopped ringing okay then i guess governments and big companies lost the most then it trickles down then it trickles down luke yes and after those attacks we are simply supposed to trust that government will do its job protect us that the various governments of the world and their multitude of agencies with their wellintentioned but million moving parts handcuffed by rules and bureaucracy will shift into efficiency and suddenly develop all the human capital and infrastructure to he paused fight and eliminate every shadow and nutcase every asshole with a laptop and an agenda you know what kind of people you found for the night road how they can vanish like smoke how badly they can hurt the world with a small investment and their own fanaticism the playing field must be even the glare in his eyes grew cold now i am here to protect you but you give me this fifty million luke you tell me everything you know about hellfire i dont even know what kind of attack hellfire is it frightened him that drummond knew the name the thought flooded him what did the saint michaels medal prove nothing medals could be copied to win trust lies could be told there was nothing to prove what drummond had said was the truth think its coming out of the night road all those thousands of postings you made you must know what they would target if they made a big hit what would be their dream attack one they could actually execute theyre already executing attacks luke paused but i think these attacks theyre not hellfire hellfire is bigger on their website they are chattering about the attacks but theres no word on hellfire hellfire has got to be something distinct from this group of small attacks its much more tied to this money they want its not unusual in terrorist psychology to consider smaller jobs as dry runs or as qualifiers for more dangerous work youre right as awful as they are these attacks are too small too localized drummond frowned maybe they need that fifty million to finance a huge new series of operations and you not giving it to us is leaving open the chance that the night road will get their hands on the money if someone else is listening to or watching us luke shouted at the ceiling if they have aubrey i want to talk to them please drummond made a choked laugh youre a smart kid you figured it out we were under a camera im pleased the phone began to ring again drummond answered it he listened and then said for gods sakes he gives us what he knows first then we decide drummond turned away to go into the other room as if to finish his discussion luke stood and picked up the chair and the voice on the phone must have warned him because drummond turned luke swung the chair with all his might and it crashed and splintered into drummonds head he didnt pause he hit him again and drummond went down drummond groaned the back of his head bloodied his eyelids at halfmast the phone lay on the floor luke picked it up hello did you see drummonds taking a nap silence the line was dead he dropped the phone and looked up again where he thought the hidden cameras might be im not playing your game all right he yelled to the air i want aubrey back ill give you all the information on the night road the accounts everything i know but you give me aubrey and you tell me who you people are do you hear me drummond groaned im sorry luke said he dragged drummond into the walkin pantry slammed the door and jammed the other kitchen chair under the knob leaving drummond with the cake mixes and the bottles of beer he turned back toward where the cameras might be hidden hey why are you hiding behind an old man luke taunted the phone rang he answered it let drummond out of the pantry it was aubrey they have me you have to let him out aubrey are you okay im all right they havent hurt me luke i think these are the good guys let me talk to whoevers in charge a few moments passed for a moment the silence made luke think theyd been disconnected a mans voice came on the line one he didnt recognize release mr drummond you must get out of the building now the accent was french slight but noticeable whats happening get out of the building now its under attack by who he opened the closet door and dragged drummond out he was groggy bleeding from the ear and the temple luke put the phone back to his ear who the hell are you people get out luke get out of there now he hung up the phone and started to search the apartment for a weapon he found a bedroom a small office next to it inside the desk drawers he found a manila file folder crammed in crookedly as though it had been put away in haste in it were papers the first was a news account of his fathers death the plane that had gone down with several noted professors aboard a file on ace beere the man who had confessed to sabotaging the plane before he blew his brains out a large sticky note said check airport surveillance photos from last book club flight compare with night road suspect ask photo archive for facial comparison and confirmation under the note was an old photo of mouser then a new photo that looked like it had been taken from a security camera stamped lakefront air park mouser and snow heading toward an entrance another image of mouser taken from what might have been a traffic camera on armitage during the chase from erics shooting the photo was grainier but it still looked like mouser lukes stomach felt a dark pang mouser was he connected to his fathers death and how could quicksilver access these surveillance cameras the final document was attached to a photo of the man who died in houston the photo was grainy slightly hazed by sunlight it looked like it had been taken in a desert setting a long stretch of sand lay behind the man in the photo his father stood next to the man hands on shoulders they were dressed in military garb guns at their sides next to his father stood drummond smiling an arm around his fathers shoulders attached to the photo was a readout a service record from the state department of a man named allen clifford he had retired from the state department two weeks after lukes dad died he hurried back to the kitchen drummond sat up from laying curled on the floor holding his head drummond what a harsh hiss low and pained im really sorry your friends say we have to get out of here now were under attack he focused his gaze on a blinking red light on the kitchen wall someones trying to get past the security systems he rose unsteadily to his feet we have unwanted company luke the night road must have tracked you here i hope youre ready for a fight ten minutes earlier snow knocked at the door of the quicksilver building the doorman stood up peered at her both on the camera that monitored the street and through the bulletproof glass yes im here to see mr drummond at quicksilver risk management snow said with a coy slightly crooked smile the doorman did not seem at all impressed with her smile he gave her a hard measured stare no sales calls he said through the intercom im not a sales person i represent a software company that has already registered the trademark of quicksilver risk management in the state of new york and ive been trying every way i can to get in contact with quicksilver at this address and nothing has worked she tapped her foot on the pavement and ran a hand through her snowwhite hair were not interested well you might be interested that my client is planning to sue you for use of a registered trademark and if you dont let me in to speak with someone in charge then i shall simply have to summon the police and the press here and say that you are refusing to accept legal papers the doorman was not privy to the name of the buildings owner and he privately thought the police wouldnt care less but the woman was making a fuss and one of the overriding descriptions of his job was to keep the building out of public and police notice she stepped inside as he deactivated the electronic locks on the door she reached into her purse and pulled out a thick envelope honestly how do your clients get a hold of you the doorman reached for the package and the end of it exploded the bullet tore through his flesh like it was paper and he toppled toward the granite counter she thought of the uniformed men who had swarmed the burning compound the only home shed ever known and she was glad the man was dead she walked to the front door and admitted mouser she propped the door open with a metal wedge they dragged the doormans body out of sight they hurried toward the elevator she swiped an electronic code scanner card connected to a modified handheld computer that sweet bird had given them to unlock the elevator it tested thousands of combinations within thirty seconds scored the right one and the doors closed she pressed the button for the top floor the elevator began to rise at floor five it jolted to a hard stop sweet bird listened to a call in his earpiece understood he said he turned to his birdies the showoffs got themselves trapped he did not want to spend his day playing soldier he did not like putting himself or his people in unwarranted danger but he had no choice he and his five birdies got out of the van their guns hidden under their coats the driver moved the van along into traffic to start his ongoing orbit of the building until needed the front door was propped open but sweet bird kicked the prop loose and the door shut itself again get on the computer system he told one of the birdies see if theres an override for the elevator or if we got stairs to take suddenly two uniformed men barreled in from a door at the end of the small lobby guns drawn the gunfire erupted just as sweet bird dove for the cover of the counter look for an override button snow spoke into her mike the distant sound of gunfire five floors below stopped abruptly a long quiet filled the elevator while she waited for an answer hoping that sweet bird and his flock were still on their feet got it sweet bird said suddenly the elevator lurched into life began its ascent toward the top floor if luke or these assholes have our money we kill them as soon as weve got our hands on it i get schoolboy snow said he hurt me worse than he hurt you a bullet beats a blade do you know who killed my dad was it mouser not now luke for gods sakes here take this gun were getting the hell out of here tell your friends on the other side of the camera to call the police if were in danger theyre far away they cant help us wheres far away europe why are they taking aubrey to europe then he remembered frankie wus words back in chicago discussing their itinerary new york paris can you shoot this drummond pulled a glock from a kitchen cabinet pressed it into lukes hand if i have lots of time to aim dont be a perfectionist they turned the corner into the entryway the elevator doors were already open and mouser leveled his semiautomatic and opened fire rounds exploded into the walnut paneling near lukes head drummond shoved him back around the corner returning fire they retreated toward the kitchen the finery of the living room the cleanly upholstered sofas the glass table tops the vivid photos of misspent suffering on the walls all were splintered and dusted in the gunfire drummond and luke went over the kitchen counter a few more bullets thrummed into the granitetopped island then silence drummond pointed at the doorway at the end of the kitchen gestured that it meant the roof it would be a run of a dozen feet uncovered luke shook his head schoolboy luke heard snow call to him you left marks on my throat with those chains and a hole in my shoulder and then she went silent luke knew what would happen to him if she got those pale tender hands on him she would pay him back with agony he stared at drummond and listened for the shuffle of feet on broken glass but there was only silence the quiet filled his chest with a crushing dread the silence stretched no neighbors to call for help mr drummond mouser called this is one empty building we got people going floor to floor and nobodys home how can you afford that in new york family money drummond reached into a drawer and yanked out a large knife luke how you doing mouser called better than snow luke said did you kill my dad he wanted to ask the question but the words wouldnt form in his mouth youre a nothing punk to me mouser said you cooperate you get to go home to stepdaddy you dont im giving you to my girl and its not going to be sunshine and lollipops now shut up and let the big boys talk mr drummond what asshole tell me whos trying to screw the night road drummond said nothing you help me i help you mousers voice grew closer fine heres the deal drummond said you leave and i wont kill you snow was silent luke thought she might be drawing close grinning at him under her bottlewhite hair he risked a glance around the counters edge but didnt see her ill leave but with luke you get to live drummond said eric stole your money not us and i walk out with luke youre outgunned i got street gangbangers in the lobby were over a dozen stories up you got no place to fly except into my arms snow sounded like she was just on the other side of the counter mouser continued his negotiation eric hid the goods and you were gonna fly his ass out here i think eric gave luke and aubrey our money you want to know what eric did with your money luke said i know exactly where he stashed it you kill us youll never ever find it they had nothing left but a bluff lukes fear rose in a tide inside his heart but he would not let it control him drummond gestured again at the stairs no way luke thought no way but they had no choice luke arent you tired of running mouser said luke held up a hand to drummond five fingers spread and then pointed at the escape route to the rooftop garden he opened his hands again to five then four fingers a countdown luke wanted to shoot mouser he could feel the hate the rage swelling in his chest three two luke dont you want to see your stepdad again you two got lots to discuss mouser said no luke said you talk to him youre both traitors one finger upraised holding drummond mouthed you just run there was no arguing with him luke couldnt look back go drummond mouthed he had the knife in one hand the gun in the other youre the one whos a traitor mouser said in a snarl and luke bolted for the stairs he expected the rip of bullets he ducked low hiking fast up the stairs and he heard gunfire a cry of fury from mouser and a scream from snow the roof he ran through the door and drummond was seconds behind him his shoulder bloodied luke slammed the door closed and engaged the bolt weird that there was a lock on the outside of the door it meant that this really was drummonds escape route we have nowhere to go wrong down drummond gritted his teeth against the pain its suicide bullets began to pan hard against the metal of the door around the lock drummond grabbed luke shoved him away from the door over the pounding of blows against the reinforced door luke could hear hundreds of feet below the hum of traffic the whisper of endless shuffles of feet against the pavement never let yourself get cornered drummond said we are cornered drummond kicked the layer of gravel away near the slightly raised box of metal that looked like a maintenance access point it was secured by a digital keypad lock we have only a window of fifteen seconds what the hell are we doing if they have gunmen below you are going to have to shoot you can be scared but dont think about it its time to be your fathers son the hatchway opened and drummond gestured to luke to crawl inside behind them the roof door began to creak free from its hinges be quiet not a sound luke wriggled into the darkness the narrow crawlway led into the elevator housing below him eight feet or so he could see the top of the elevator car with a hatch drummond mustve intended to go through the elevator and attack snow and mouser from behind theyd surprise them with bullets in the back but as soon as mouser and snow broke through the door and saw the roof was empty in a matter of seconds then mouser would figure theyd reentered the building and then he would alert the other gunmen inside drummond closed the access hatch behind him and raised a grimy finger to his lips in the dim light given off by the controls and from the glow of the elevator cabin below luke thought drummond looked like a tired old lion blood soaked his shoulder theyd shot him luke had to get him to a doctor wincing with pain drummond punched in a key command on the elevators roof and the soft click sounded of a lock released he punched other buttons presumably disabling the weapons scanner so it wouldnt refuse to lower the car they slid open the hatch to the elevator but only an inch luke started to shift the hatch open more and drummond stopped him with a firm grip on his arm drummond pointed in the narrow gap looking down into the elevator luke saw a handheld computer dangling from a card feeder at the bottom of the elevator keys luke guessed snow and mouser had used a digital lock pick to bypass the security in the elevator he heard the roof door at the top of the stairs smash open mouser warning snow to stay back luke slid the rest of the hatch open eased himself down into the elevator if they heard him snow and mouser were soon going to see the roof was empty and figure out they were back inside within seconds they would charge back into the building and head for the elevator luke pressed the ground floor button nothing happened the doors stayed open the elevator did not move in the distance he could hear mouser calling an allclear to snow he jabbed at the button again nothing he slid the electronic passkey from the card reader tested the button nothing an elevator that wouldnt move theyd reset the code for the elevator to keep drummond and luke trapped there was no escape route luke studied the card reader he spent way too much time on computers cobbling together the night road research couldnt he figure out this one if the passcard had broken the original code he slid the passkey back into the card reader the pda tied to the card by a thin strip of plastic blinked to life a series of numbers raced across the screen he heard the sound of footsteps returning down the stairs fevered breathing combinations of numbers flashed across the readout luke put himself flat against the door out of sight from the hallway they couldnt see him and he couldnt see them he heard voices barely ten feet away not over the roof goddamn it no broken windows nothing to lower themselves mouser said as if speaking to someone not there so theyre back in sweet bird the elevator gave a soft traitorous ping and the doors began to slide slowly closed he heard running footsteps and then the end of a gun jammed into the closing door the door began like an obliging devil to open the only thought that seared into lukes head was that hesitation meant death he seized the guns barrel before it could pivot the rest of the way toward him snow stumbled into the elevator she swung toward him trying to wrench back control of the gun and aim it into his stomach over her bloodied shoulder in the gunfiresprayed hallways mouser ran toward them full sprint gun up snow was crazystrong and she sank her teeth into lukes wrist still trying to turn the gun into his flesh she crouched between luke and mouser mouser running fulltilt down the hall gun raised screamed at snow move out of the way luke kicked the buttons as he fought with snow hitting the doorclose button the doors whooshed shut and the car began to descend luke tangled with snow her mouth smeared with his blood he saw her gun swing free of his grip she pivoted the gun toward him no place to retreat he pushed her away yanking the gun back from her stumbling falling into a corner of the elevator then a sudden stop a screech of metal against metal snow collapsed onto him her hands clawing for the gun and he barely felt the soft phut of the guns discharge she doubled over spat blood onto his foot he couldnt tell if it was his or hers her eyes widened as she sank to her knees drummond dropped through the opening and went to one knee luke could see the fear in her eyes and her hand went to her shot chest fist clenched as though she could hold her life in with her fingers she spat in his face as he leaned close and she died i i luke could hardly speak she would have killed you and laughed about it later drummond said let it go lets see what floor were on above he heard mouser screaming snows name it took mouser only seconds to reason it out the two bastards the old man and the ninelives punk had entered the elevator shaft from the roof he forced the doors open with a mighty shove it took all his strength but he peered down into the darkness of the elevator shaft he heard the crack of a shot saw drummond sliding from the roof of the cabin sliding into its interior the hatch clanged shut snow he screamed down the shaft it made an echo no no he could see the support rails inside the shaft he leapt inside landed on metal and grabbed hold he began a mad spidery scramble downwards seventh floor they ran for the stairwell the floor was a huge empty open space soft light made squares on the concrete floor there was no place to take cover they moved quietly but quickly down the stairs several floors below them they heard the clang of a door hell drummond whispered leaning against luke the injuries to his head and his shoulder made his voice thick his walk shaky dont let your heart guide you stay cool remote always shut up with the advice luke said by the way my gun is empty i have the one you gave me they reached the third floor storage space empty of tenants crates and boxes everywhere plasticwrapped office furniture chairs desks drummond listened i hear them coming i think theyre in the stairwell then we go out the window luke hurried along the windows peering down one side of the building was scarce of foot traffic he stripped plastic from a heavy desk he braided the fire hose through the drawers opening and he rammed the desk through the window glass exploded and the desk plummeted unfurling the heavy hose the desk stopped ten feet above the pavement dangling like a broken pendulum against the building come on luke yelled on my back no time for them both to climb down the rope luke felt drummonds solid weight go on his back and he threw himself out onto the makeshift rope the cameras in drummonds kitchen had been destroyed in the hail of snow and mousers gunfire so the watchers the boss the scarred frenchman and aubrey had to settle for a satellite view of the quicksilver building theyd seen luke and drummond retreat to the roof vanish into the hatch then saw mouser and snow come onto the roof and disappear back into the building moments later aubrey made a horrified noise in her throat the computer screens were set up in a corner of the hold and aubrey could hardly hear what was said over the drone of the engines theyd given her drugs first to make her sleep then to make her talk or so she suspected shed been laying on a cot staring at the gray ceiling when the boss had come and pulled her up and made her speak to luke on the phone luke was alive but the boss told her what to say and she said it then she saw and heard the tattattat of the bullets in the kitchen then nothing the boss pushed aubrey away from the black screen you have to help luke she said please she felt hazy from the drugs the boss ignored her response from the security team none the scarred frenchman said we have to assume the ground floor gunmen killed them drummond not answering i imagine hes busy access the buildings computer systems wipe everything clean what can you install in its place to soften the police inquiry we have a backup story the building is a prototype being built to test security technologies for sale we will wipe and then reinstall data to that effect fine keep it simple the frenchman began his work thats not helping them aubrey yelled the boss looked at her i know go back and lay down well be landing soon the old cargo plane creaked and aubrey looked past the mans shoulder on the satellite feed that monitored the building glass shimmered as a large desk burst through a thirdstory window luke aubrey said the hose held the desk dangling a good ten feet above the pavement luke held hard to the fabric of the hose slid down to the desks surface drummond was wiry all muscle and he weighed a ton luke looked up and saw a sparrowthin man staring down at them from the broken window the thin man raised a sleek rifle aimed it with confidence in his eyes he let five seconds pass saying you made it easy now against his back drummond twisted the weight of lukes gun jammed in the back of his pants came free and a thundering boom went off near lukes head the thin man ducked back or fell dead luke didnt know he lost his grip on the hose and he and drummond hit the canted desk slid hit air again he felt drummonds arms wrapping around him to cocoon him to drink the impact of the concrete and it hurt luke felt all the air drive out of him drummond lay beneath him breathing in short sharp pants lukes vision swam he saw the desk swinging above him move luke scrambled to his feet muscles feeling like theyd been pulled from his body and hastily stuffed back inside his skin and tried to lift drummond from the sidewalk cant leg broken go his voice was a hiss no way he was leaving drummond behind luke hiked the older man up supported him on his shoulders the hard shrill knife of a police siren sliced the afternoon cutting through the manhattan hum he pulled drummond into his arms and carried him heading for the cross street he wanted to put buildings between him and the killers my keys drummond patted at his pocket you have a car my keys he repeated and then the shot rang out piercing him in the back near where lukes hand held him the bullet tumbled through spine and organs and the impact nearly knocked him loose from lukes grip the crowd that had been starting to close around them scattered a woman shrieking students bolting but luke did not stop a tea shop was a few yards away and he stumbled through its door as the proprietor opened it to see what fresh hell had erupted in the village at tables people with laptops looked up from their webinduced isolation and gasped the counter person erupted with a series of short screams call luke said please drummond opened his eyes with visible effort my keys run no police his eyes focused on lukes face he clutched at lukes saint michael medal which dangled above his face as luke knelt by him then his hand went to his pocket and he died oh god luke thought in the pocket he found a ring of car keys with a bottle opener he grabbed the keys and snows gun still nestled in drummonds hand when he grabbed the gun everyone in the tea shop scrambled backwards he paused then he tore the saint michael medal from drummonds throat cupped it in his hand he hurried past a counter and ran into a small side alley of brick it was closed to the main streets by an iron gate keys a car drummond must have a car a rental garages address was printed on the back of the bottle opener four blocks away luke climbed over the iron gate dropped to the next street and ran the final bullet of drummonds long career had caught sweet bird under the jaw and hed fallen back with an astonished look on his thin face mouser had picked up the rifle next to sweet birds body hed gotten a single shot off nailed drummond missed luke he squeezed the trigger again no ammo left chaos was about to descend on this building he had to get out there was no time to say goodbye to snow hed left her behind in the elevator cab one kiss goodbye he blinked away the hot feeling behind his eyes as he bolted out the back of the building avoiding the arrival of the police blending in with the crowd sweet birds crew was either dead or had fled luke and drummond had killed her the vengeance against drummond had come quickly but luke still walked and breathed he felt the cold bloodthirstiness from snow begin to fill him as though her spirit was settling in his bones seeping into this skin a stirring in his chest took its final breath and shriveled he had not even known her real name he turned into the tea shops back door hed seen where luke ran drummonds body still lay sprawled on the tiles he frisked the body nothing no cops yet outside a woman in a baristas apron spoke with the police in the street pointing toward her store he retreated out the back door the alleyway remained empty which way had luke gone and where would he go he remembered the manifest for erics charter hed seen it at the air park in chicago had said new york then paris he ran down the alley toward the iron gate fury for luke filling him and fury for henry who had sent him on this fools errand the garage was four stories tall and luke hurried along the row testing the remote until the lights on a plain ford sedan beeped he opened the trunk and found a briefcase and a packed bag he took the briefcase and set it on the front passenger seat the car still smelled new the miles on the car were fewer than a hundred luke rifled through the glove compartment the car had been sold to james morgan the charter pilot frankie wu had mentioned flying on to paris there had to be a reason that eric would have stopped in new york perhaps to meet drummond and seal a deal on information and then fly on to paris for what a final meeting drummond said the people watching their interview were headed to paris he steered into traffic heading away from the chaos at drummonds building watching his rearview mirror for mouser his mind kept replaying the bullet hed put into snow intent didnt matter he had killed her he had ended another human life but she had brought on her own fate with her choices at a stoplight he snapped open the briefcase two canadian passports one for drummond one for him in the names of james morgan and for luke in the name of tom morgan the passport photo was a modified version of his license drivers photo cleverly expanded to fit the passport parameters they were stamped with entry for the us and the bahamas they looked real to him he counted the cash around two thousand dollars he found credit cards in the name of tom morgan the promise to hide him was real and would have been immediate and two tickets the seats together on the redeye to paris for tonight in the same false names the car had a gps system and at the next light he plugged in a request for directions to jfk airport aubrey lay on the cot and she heard the scarred frenchman say to the boss we have a live signal from drummonds car he got out the boss asked the satellite picture of the street had indicated drummond might have been hit a pause i wonder where theyll go the frenchman said track the car and find where henry shawcross is i want to know if hes on a plane a train where he is do we still send a cleanup team aubrey closed her eyes and pretended to be asleep they might speak a little louder over the rumble of the plane if they thought she was asleep again no if anyones still alive theyre on their own the boss said and she could hear the awful bitterness under his words sometimes you have to leave people behind we could just call the car the frenchman said if its luke alone hes probably scared to death we clearly have to build trust with young mr dantry the boss said you play it out you talk to him aubrey felt a shadow over her she opened her eyes the boss staring down wore a frown on his hard face how is luke doing it what escaping these people finding us being so clever was he trained by shawcross trained hes a grad student in psychology and you people have scared the crap out of him a smart person whos scared can be dangerous you better tell me the truth aubrey i am i am she licked at her dry lips he and i we just want out we just want our old lives back please the man leaned close to her you get to go home when you help us this fifty million luke mentioned to drummond where is it i dont know i want nothing to do with that money i want to go home home the boss said i hope you can henry wanted to be present for lukes capture or at least in the van that would be taking him away from the quicksilver building but an absolutely critical component of hellfire required his attention he especially wanted to be there to kill drummond personally if drummond was at the address but priorities were priorities he could not delegate this task the storefront in a quiet street in queens read readyable services a recent change in ownership was not reflected in the storefront the company which was headquartered in new york and had branches in fourteen major metropolitan markets contracted out cleaning and maintenance services to government and corporations the workers were bonded and underwent background checks the company was twenty years old successful and privately held the inside man had been hired inserted at henrys suggestion four months ago he cleared the background check because he had no record he had never been caught he took a salary cut for the job at readyable and his boss thought the company lucky to have landed such a smart hard worker henry went inside and gave a false name the inside man with the rank of supervisor was expecting him the two of them walked past the other supervisors and employees and headed for a storeroom at the back of the facility in the storeroom the supervisor opened the box you can see he began in arabic english henry said i dont wish to be overheard yes well the supervisor said in lightly accented english as you asked twenty surgical masks its not uncommon for the employees to wear these no cleaning can be a nasty job they go with the uniforms i have provided twenty in the sizes you asked for henry looked at the uniforms the pocket here is big enough to hold a gun yes a variety of models i tested it myself and the access passes activated that took a bit of fiddling with the master database you cannot have substitutions of personnel though i cannot issue new picture ids at this late date i understand henry carefully inspected all twenty passes they looked entirely genuine because they were readyable had just added twenty employees that had not been hired or interviewed hidden inside an access pass database that held information about two thousand employees around the country the database audit was completed yesterday i added the new records immediately afterwards we should be good for two or three days i hope your operation takes place by then not your concern the company will be seen as a common element of the attacks targets when hellfire is completed you will be extracted and sent wherever you like go to the airport go to the travport cargo office they will smuggle you out of the country understood the supervisor and henry resealed the boxes and loaded them into henrys van henry drove to a travport satellite office and shipped the boxes to an address in chicago this was the next to last stage before hellfire could be launched if only he had luke under his thumb then all would be well henrys phone rang and he opened it sure that it would be good news the cars phone rang as luke pulled into airport parking he hit the talk button hello is this luke a mans frenchaccented voice the same one from drummonds phone yes are you all right yes but drummond is dead im sorry i couldnt save him he saved me we mourn him more than you know i can tell you he had a rewarding life i have the fifty million the night road wants i will trade it to you for information on my fathers past and for you to set up aubrey someplace where she is safe i do not understand your fathers past drummond was investigating one of our attackers a man known as mouser i want to know if mouser is suspected of killing my dad and what about you a surprising certainty filled him i want to keep fighting these people i want to join you a pause and then this is not your fight luke it is entirely my fight i dont want to hide under a name somewhere and hope you defeat night road i am in this fight luke you fought hard for someone who was cast as simply a pawn are you in paris because i found tickets for todays flight drummond was supposed to bring me to paris wasnt he yes if we agreed it was best but then ill see you soon he switched off the phone the redeye to paris was close to full lukes tongue felt like a rock in his mouth when he had to present his false passport but the airlines scans did not raise an alarm drummond had bought tickets in business class the seats were plush in a plastic and steel halfshell that let you recline without intruding on the space of the passenger behind you he had the window seat and he kept his sunglasses in place a cap pulled low on his head drummonds seat next to him remained empty he gave a sigh of relief he pulled drummonds medal from his pocket and studied it next to his own exact duplicates in every detail this will keep you safe his father had said what exactly had that meant luke had taken it to mean a metaphysical safety in the terms of a moral compass but now he thought his father might have meant a more concrete promise he put drummonds medal back in his pocket he ate the dinner of salad lamb couscous and ice cream sundae he pulled a blanket up to his chin and fell into a heavy sleep he awoke hours later as the breakfast service was being completed and first he saw out the window the spill of clouds over the french countryside then he sat up rubbing his eyes under the dark glasses and mouser said you slept well i didnt luke blinked it couldnt be but mouser was sitting right next to him and then he gave luke a twitch of a smile the kind the devil might flex somehow that quasigrin was worse than the thrust of a blade if you make a scene youll ruin the flight for everyone else in the worst way luke spoke past the rock in his throat how did you we both needed to get to paris theres not an infinite number of flights luke let his gaze dart past mousers aisle seat the middle row was occupied by an older couple who looked like vacationers behind him were two businessmen one asleep the other immersed in a laptop everyone in their own cocoon im not going to hurt you mouser said in a soft whisper liar he thought of drummond bleeding his life out his fathers face boarding that plane did you kill my father why are you a suspect years later the thoughts blazed through his mind as if blasted from a flamethrower his hands clenched into fists in his pocket was the secret thumb drive hidden in the little basketball the key to the money why are you going to paris luke mouser sipped coffee from a cup that sat on his foldout tray i guess you need a vacation after all your adventures luke gave no answer he had to get away the pilot announced that theyd be landing in twenty minutes do tell me because if i alert the attendants to the fact you happen to be traveling on a false passport mine is legit by the way this was a giant risk for you what would be worth such a risk i wonder i can only think that its the money eric wanted to go to paris too youre following that dogs trail i have to incapacitate him luke thought fight him here and get away without getting caught you give me the money mouser said and you walk our battle is over i wont on either count i dont blame you for new york i blame snow she rushed where she shouldnt have his gaze was steady on lukes face but i do blame you for drummond and he stopped and what mouser hissed did you ever he waited as the flight attendant walked past did you sabotage a private plane heading from dc to north carolina ten years ago the silence hung between him luke staring at him the twitchy smile stayed on mousers face no i dont know anything about planes or their systems luke watched him he didnt believe him terrorist psychology showed extremists did not like to admit a shortcoming in knowledge it was a consistent thread they were knowitalls a simple no would have sufficed luke had said nothing about the systems of the plane being involved his tongue felt locked to the top of his mouth if mouser was curious about the north carolina question he didnt ask ive answered your question you answer mine where is the money he told his first lie eric hid the money in a bunch of accounts give me the account numbers luke tapped his temple i dont believe you memorized a bunch of bank account numbers theyre long i was highly motivated if you kill me youll never get them mouser looked at him youre giving the info to someone in paris to get aubrey back yes and to keep the money away from the night road he had no intention of funding terrorism but he wondered could he turn this meeting into a trap for mouser a way to give him to quicksilver the outline of a plan began to take shape in his mind you barely know that woman now mouser looked straight ahead i barely knew snow sometimes barely is all you need he paused a college kid like you you dont want this kind of life give me the info on the accounts and youre free tires hit pavement as the airliner coasted onto the runway what had henry told him a lifetime ago back in austin about his work youre good at baiting the hook im meeting quicksilver they have the capability to do a lot more damage to you and the night road than i ever could luke said the captain was announcing to the passengers that the plane would first taxi to the bus that would take them to the terminal you cut a deal with them no luke lied they only want the money so i have a suggestion what come with me to the meeting you can grab one of their people find out what quicksilver really is but me and aubrey walk you get the money you get your enemies why would you help me because i just want to be left alone by you by quicksilver the fight is between you two luke knew if he made a scene to get mouser arrested in the airport hed be arrested too and he wouldnt ever find out the truth quicksilver would be watching their every move they have the resources theyll see mouser coming well ahead and theyll kill him luke thought me help you save your woman after you killed mine mousers whisper was so soft that as the plane parked and everyone stood to gather their belongings luke could barely hear him i feel like im making a deal with the devil me too luke thought paris luke had not been there since he was an undergraduate he had accompanied his stepfather and his mother to paris for a conference at nineteen he had wandered the streets in blissful freedom bookstores bars the expansive parks the old student quarter near notre dame he had loved the city but it had been a brief affair and he had not been back since but he hoped his brief familiarity with paris would save him mouser had given no signs of even a basic comprehension of french beyond oui or non and that might be his salvation neither had a suitcase other than their carryons and after a desultory check of their documents at passport control he and mouser walked out into the dull gray morning toward the taxi line he checked his cell phone as they walked outside and retrieved a text message meet at the eiffel tower for aubrey one hour after your plane lands mouser grabbed the phone read the message luke yanked the phone back but they dont know im here mouser said no but considering quicksilvers reach it would not surprise him but let mouser be surprised the eiffel tower how touristy mouser muttered in a low growl ill take your phone why i dont want you calling them and letting them know im with you hed thought of trying to text just the word mouser or help to the number that had just called him to warn quicksilver he hesitated i will kill you the second you pull a fast one on me mouser said give me the phone luke gave it to him mouser put a steel grip on his shoulder come on i have a ride for us the car sat in the parking garage in a back corner mouser found keys in a container locked under the bumper it was a mercedes sedan gleaming highend he opened the trunk inside were bags and cases some were long and narrow marked with the logo of a british golf club manufacturer luke figured they were not golf clubs weapons someone had given this man an armory and driven it to the airport for him so mouser had allies in france the night road was bigger than a mere group inside america he had only researched american extremists but if those domestic terrorists were linked to cooperating with other extremists around the world the thought was frightening get in the car mouser said luke obeyed mouser didnt slide behind the wheel rather he seemed to be studying the phone as though hed gotten an email he turned his back to luke thirty seconds later he slid into the car an angry look on his face mouser roared out of the garage mouser had taken one of the long cases from the cars trunk he slipped an earpiece into lukes ear saying ill be able to hear your every word dump this and youre dead where will you be watching dont screw this up or ill shoot you accounts or not you play nice you and aubrey walk no luke thought youre the one whos going down but he turned and walked toward the tower when he glanced back mouser was gone he had not counted on mouser being able to eavesdrop on his conversation this made his plan much harder and if he dumped the earpiece he had no doubt mouser would shoot him and aubrey he had to think of another way to warn quicksilver the base of the eiffel tower was broader and the plaza wider than luke remembered he saw french soldiers with assault rifles wandering the sprawling grounds scanning faces in the scattered crowd of hundreds of tourists and sightseers watching for the unusual or the threatening a kiss of sunshine came through the late spring clouds his phone rang he answered it it was aubreys voice scared luke are you all right yes im going to give you your directions now she steadied her voice walk away from the river away from the tower go toward the halfcircle where the tour buses stop youll see me he could see in the distance past the walkways and the low shrubberies a wide loop of street a doubledecker bus parked tourists not bothering to get off the bus but snapping photos of the grand tower all right in his other ear he heard the whisper of mousers voice if you warn them ill shoot first and learn to live without the money yes he said as if to both aubrey and mouser so much for his brilliant trap he had brought this maniac to the meeting and he could only hope that the quicksilver people had spotted his uninvited guest if they hadnt then he was going to have to talk through the meeting without handing over the encrypted thumb drive get aubrey and figure out a way to get the quicksilver people and aubrey to safety he walked past a beggar woman with outstretched hands who said speak english past a fellow wearing a belt of cheap eiffel tower replicas that jingled he glanced around to see if he could spot where mouser had gone to his right was another pathway that led to a shuttered gazebo and a playground that was unoccupied beyond that was a large wide walking and jogging trail and beyond that was a cluster of grand mansions one of which he remembered from strolling around here before was the czech embassy he didnt think mouser could hide there so he cast his gaze toward the halfcircle looking for the spot where mouser would be and trying to spot aubrey in the dozens of faces mouser had walked down the broad jogging path in the shadow of the tower allee leon bourgeois after sending luke on his way to the rendezvous the allee was not busy a few joggers ipods insulating them from the world he scanned the area looking for the best point to make his stand to his right shaded trees bordered the allee with an empty playground and a shuttered gazebo that sold treats on warmer days he walked with complete purpose which was always the most convincing camouflage he went to the back of the gazebo stepped onto an electrical unit and climbed onto its green roof he would not be concealed for long anyone on the allee who looked up would see him sprawled on the roof but the joggers were absorbed in their solitary orbits thats the problem with everyone today mouser thought theyre all in their own world oblivious to civilization around them descending into hell he slid the rifle free from the golf bag just a matter of seconds and his work would be done he put the crosshairs on lukes head luke tried not to panic so where was she a flock of tourists herded and moved between him and the bus which pulled out to be replaced by another brightred bus speak english another woman asked him he ignored her and pushed past a small group of japanese visitors and saw aubrey several yards away on the edge of the walkway aubrey wore a raincoat a heavy hat on her head her face pale and gaunt and standing next to her was a man who turned and met his gaze his dead father luke froze blinked no the man was bald his dad had a full head of graying hair but the eyes the mouth set in a nervous frown the nose straight as iron he stared at luke luke felt as though the crowded acreage of the tower contracted the mass of people around him fading to a misty blur the hum and rumble of paris devolving to a giant whitenoise hiss mouser said something in his earpiece and luke could not register a single word the air left his chest his knees buckled he kept standing through sheer force of will this could not be but it was his father did not smile at him but he closed his eyes as though conscious of lukes pain as though it were a wave he could feel or hear or taste ten years ten years of grieving and missing his father feeling his absence like a raggedy gap in his chest and clutching a piece of silver as his fathers last gift of presence in his life his fathers words on their last parting ill miss you every moment they rang and echoed in his head it had all been a lie the kind of monumental lie that did not just sting feelings but cut down to heart and bone a lie that undid lives his father was alive he was here the shock suffocated him until his chest began to ache heat burned the back of his eyes he took two steps to start running toward his father but then he remembered where he was not just in the gray light of the paris morning he was in the crosshairs of a terrorists gun every plan and stratagem vanished from his mind a tremble took his body dad he said more gasp than word no it was too much to ask he couldnt do this any more but he had to what mouser asked in lukes ear he couldnt let mouser close his trap he had to think past the maelstrom of emotion i said damn i dont see her luke blinked he felt tears on his face before he realized hed shed them theyre not here we should go ill just give you the money please lets go he turned to walk away i see her the woman you were with in chicago straight ahead of you standing with some bald guy what the hells the matter mouser said in a low growl of menace thats not her he could think of nothing else to say luke dont you fuck with me maybe he wont recognize dad he thought maybe he doesnt remember everyone he kills a man he didnt know stopped in passing grabbed his arm luke its okay he recognized the voice as that of the frenchman whod spoken to him on the phone luke tried to shake his head get them out of here please get them out of here what sniper run scatter luke bolted toward his father and aubrey aubrey dad run run dad mouser hissed into his earpiece what the hell game you and then he stopped as words no longer mattered the crack of the bullet hummed through the air the dirt kicking up at lukes feet he stopped nearly fell a second shot boomed in the air and now panic rippled through the crowd approaching the tower sniper luke screamed another shot and people scattered screaming knocking into each other as they fled he looked back at the frenchman he was racing across the grass toward where the shots came from a weapon drawn and then he was cut down a bullet slicing through his throat luke got knocked off his feet by a line of tourists scrambling back toward their bus at the sound of the gunfire his sunglasses fell from his face feet trampled him and agony rushed up from his hand boots landed on his scalp his cheek he fought to his feet he saw his father and aubrey surrounded by three men in black guns jammed to the back of their heads being shoved through the chaos of the crowd this was a trap the night road had wanted to flush out their enemy and now they had luke had handed quicksilver to mouserwho wasnt working alone dad luke yelled luke saw the group headed rapidly toward the bus dropoff borne along by the rest of the fleeing crowd luke struggled to catch up with them he broke free of the main crowd and saw his father and aubrey being shoved into the back of a van the van was marked with a logo of a cake and read trois petits gateaux three little cakes the doors slammed and the van peeled out onto the road luke cut across the grassland and ran out onto the broad treelined walking trail trying to keep the van in sight on the street but suddenly the van wheeled hard and zoomed right along the allee heading directly toward him the driver was pointing at him coming back for him luke turned and ran back toward the tower he shot a panicked glance over his shoulder and he could see the drivers face frowning in concentration teeth gritted intent on running him down he had nowhere to hide the van veered past him a rifle butt from the window slamming him knocking him over the van skidded to a stop he heard the shrill high cry of the police sirens booming across the air through the trees closer to the tower the armed guards clearing out the people hunting for the unseen source of the shots no more shooting mouser was gone of course his buddies could finish the work help me luke yelled aidezmoi but in the panic no one heard him one of the blacksuited men jumped out of the van raced toward luke gun drawn screaming at him in english to get in the van he saw in a flash aubrey and his father facedown on the van floor make the creep come to you luke realized the thought came with shimmering clarity the past few days had awakened a brutal longdrowsing instinct in him as though the bookish websurfer who had never thought about the reality of danger had been whittled away seeing his father alive changed him changed everything he was not going to lose him again luke went flat on the ground the gunman ran up to him and luke timed it to the second spun and scissorkicked hard it was awkward but forceful enough and the gunman stumbled luke delivered a piledriver kick into the gunmans groin the guy grunted in agony and folded and luke kicked him in the head without hesitation and wrenched the gun from him he ran toward the van gun raised one of the gunmen inside the van leveled a pistol at him then he saw aubrey launch herself from the floor claw at the gunmans arm the doors slammed and he heard the sound of a shot fired inside the van he fired at the vans tires hitting too high nailing the bumper then a swarm of people fleeing ran between him and the van and he couldnt risk another shot he rammed his way through the crowd trying to get close enough to shred a tire but the van revved and accelerated knocking through the thinning crowd theyd run out of time to execute the grab on him with french police swarming around the grounds the van blasted onto avenue charles floquet and was gone luke tucked the stolen gun under his jacket and ran his mind raced mouser mouser would know where they would be taken the sniper fire had ended as far as he could tell which meant it was too risky for mouser to stay in place mouser would have to run and wouldnt he run to the mercedes if he couldnt rendezvous with the night road team in the van after using luke as bait he would have to make a fast escape in the chaos but with the immediately snarling traffic as pedestrians and every bus in the area fled and police shutting down roads the sedan theyd driven to the tower would offer a difficult solution for escape no sniper wanted to be caught in the mother of all traffic jams but the paris subway the metro was close by he could be wrong but mouser would want safety more than retrieving an asset like a car it was the terrorist way he headed for the sign indicating the metro luke followed part of the fleeing mass of people and ran to the champ de mars metro station across the street from the tower hurried down into the tunnel the lines to buy a ticket were long and he jumped the turnstile apologizing to the man in front of him no one seemed to care about his lack of a ticket in the rush to get away from the shooting it was a big station different colored signs pointing to different lines and then he caught an edge of what looked like mousers burr haircut making a turn he followed cutting through the crowd mouser for sure he headed for a station with a yellow line an rer station with the large trains that traveled the lines running parallel to the seine the crowd dozens thick pressed forward as a large doubledecker train pulled into the station children cried people talked in a hubbub panic steamed the air no one looked at luke even glanced at him he was the cause of it all and he felt as small and anonymous as an ant he lost sight of mouser he pressed the earpiece mouser had put in his ear but heard nothing mouser had killed the connection luke threw it on the floor he didnt want mouser reactivating it and hearing him luke went on tiptoe and surveyed the dozens of faces stretching away from him in a jostling human quilt damn it then he saw mouser thirty feet away and to his left scanning the crowd himself his head slowly turning toward lukes position the sunglasses that helped camouflage luke on the plane were gone lost in the scuffles luke ducked crowding a young woman who spat a volley of outraged french that questioned lukes basic intelligence her hair was a spike of black dye her boyfriend next to her had shaved off his hair a pair of sunglasses sat on his head the roar of an approaching train sounded the crowd eased forward bare centimeters are you trying to kiss asses luke thought he heard the boyfriend say luke ignored the comment and stayed kneeling on the floor the doubledecker train stopped and the doors slid open the human tide surged forward luke grabbed a fistful of drummonds dollars from his pocket handed them to the boyfriend and said in bad french i would like to buy then continued in english your sunglasses pantomiming the shades what is wrong with you the boyfriend said no i dont want your dollars but the girlfriend laughed and pulled the shades from his head stuck them on lukes face she grabbed the money there you go i bought them cheap for him on the street now i can buy a dozen more in ugly matching colors her english was good she gave luke a thoughtful measuring stare as though trying to guess his motives for the bizarre offer from behind the dark lenses luke watched mouser moving toward a seat on the ground car luke knew if he stayed on the ground car mouser would see him sunglasses or not so he went up the steps following the girlfriend and the boyfriend his heart a piston in his throat mouser could get off at any station and he would lose him he couldnt easily monitor who got off and on the ground car he stood near the stairs it was his only hope if mouser came to the stairs and glanced up hed see luke then luke was dead if i lose him how will i ever find aubrey and my dad my dad the words were like two muffled explosions in his chest the entire past ten years of his life had been a charade his father was alive now that he had time to think a hard bite of anger closed on his heart why why would his father pretend to leave his wife and child why would he abandon them to a man like henry shawcross why would he let his wife and child suffer through a devastating grief why would he hide behind the deaths of his friends luke had thought he didnt know the real henry he clearly didnt know his father either the realization felt like a punch in the stomach he shook his head as though physically clearing the thoughts from his mind no if he pondered this now emotion would drown him grief and bewilderment could wait the train jolted forward people crowding on the stairs are you still enjoying my sunglasses crazy man the boyfriend said in serviceable english he had apparently decided to indulge his girlfriends whim you want to buy a shirt next nice pants the girlfriend giggled no but i need help luke said you heard the shooting the boyfriend rolled his eyes we walk out of the station everyone running this way we head back inside he shrugged crazy the tower will be there tomorrow for us to see how do you need help the girlfriend said luke saw she was the power in the relationship my girlfriend she is a student here shes seeing a guy whos not me the train jostled them slightly as it picked up speed ah the girlfriend said the boyfriend frowned he was going to meet her at the tower today she didnt show and now im following him ah the shooting was you shooting at him the boyfriend joked revenge is sweet yes ah no and this man knows your face the girlfriend guessed she had a picture of us on the bedside table im sure hes seen me the lying was easy because a real sense of betrayal swelled in his chest his father had been the greatest liar of them all but hes dangerous a little crazy i want to find out where he lives but hes below on the ground car and i dont want him to see me the girlfriend raised an eyebrow in amusement and he will be convinced by a disguise of cheap sunglasses she muttered in french unzipped the boyfriends backpack pulled out a knit cap cover your hair with this thats not what you say hygienic the boyfriend complained he spoke in a flood of french your head is clean she yanked the cap onto lukes head tucked his light hair under its rainbow folds then she pulled out a scarf to match both were pink and green i make these for him he never wears them he will not wear them either the boyfriend said i will luke said he pushed some more cash into her hand her kindness overwhelmed him the girlfriends finger lingered against his palm but she made a point of putting the hand shed touched luke with firmly against her boyfriends cheek and you my sweet you will get a new hat a cowboy hat the boyfriend said the girlfriend laughed where is the next stop luke asked rubbing his arms he couldnt keep still pont de lalma the boyfriend said les invalides the next one is more of a hub for more lines people around them were chattering mostly in french and english about the shootings the girlfriend kept a look locked on luke and he thought she saw the deception beneath the surface of his smile you must love this girl a lot to forgive her she said her i love luke said him i dont the boyfriend laughed the train slowed as it approached the station people pushed past them eager to get down the few steps to the exit are you getting off here he asked them they shook their heads after a shared glance luke risked a few steps down to the ground car inching for position he had wanted to ask them to see if they could spot if mouser had got off the train but too many people jammed the car he couldnt take the risk that they would miss him he peered down scanned the crowd he could see the back of mousers head it looked like he was textmessaging on a phone furiously but not rising to leave the train stopped and the doors hissed open a number of people left but many stayed put few climbed on mouser remained in his seat his back to luke the gun hidden along his side covered by his jacket pressed like an iron weight the rer train pulled out of pont de lalma mouser stood began to move past the other seated passengers he had a smile on his face luke retreated up the stairs hes getting off at the next station thank you for your help youre welcome thanks for the money the boyfriend shook lukes hand and then luke saw that the girlfriend had noticed his gun her mouth narrowed and her eyes widened they knew there had been shots fired at the tower and now here was a man asking for glasses and hat for an instant disguise with a gun tucked in the side of his pants under his jacket the fear in her eyes churned his heart she could scream she could go to the first policeman in the next station please he said im not the bad guy im not he didnt know what else to say she seemed unsure of what step to take next and the boyfriend looked at her aware of a strained communication passing between her and luke and misreading it suddenly not happy about it he eased the girlfriend away from luke down the steps toward the door she looked at luke with stark terror her mouth trembled im not the bad guy he mouthed again les invalides the train stopped much more of the crowd poured out for this station but luke tried to hang back until the last second to see if mouser exited and this time he did passing within fifteen feet of luke hurrying he stepped off last mouser a good twenty feet ahead of him the boyfriend and girlfriend between him and luke luke considered ducking behind the garish orange pillars but decided he had to risk staying close he kept following the couple the girlfriend pulled a phone from her purse and started talking into it at the top of the stairs mouser shot a glance across the crowd behind him his gaze raked across where luke walked but he did not notice him wearing dark glasses heavy cap and an ugly scarf across his chin and mouth mouser turned back toward the front luke hurried up the stairs halfexpecting to see mouser waiting for him but he wasnt mouser stood on a long moving sidewalk feeding past abstract art and mouser returned his attention to the phone texting eyes close to the screen an angry expression colored his face luke realized that the girl and her boyfriend were gone vanished maybe theyd tucked into another line mouser reached the end of the moving sidewalk and stepped off without a backward glance then luke looked back at the end of the conveyor belt spotted the couple from the train talking to a policeman he had to hurry if the cops stopped him before he stopped mouser the panic tore through his chest hed put his father and aubrey in this danger he had to save them from it he hurried toward the stations exit and took an escalator up ahead of him across a stretch of parkland was les invalides the goldendomed complex of museums and monuments to french military history to his right was the musee dorsay the more recent jewel of parisian museums around him was a stretch of grass a playground people walking in lazy surrender to the brightening day fifty feet ahead of him a black bmw stopped the back door opened and mouser slid into the back seat luke pivoted he couldnt risk mouser seeing him and now the car was headed toward him he heard the purr of the approaching motor and the air felt sealed in his lungs as he headed back toward the escalator that led down to les invalides station the policeman came out of the station looking straight at him trapped between the cop and mouser in the bmw he took the risk and stopped the sedan shot past not braking luke crossed the street in the wake of the bmws passage in the back seat he saw the burr of mousers head then the driver turned full to speak to mouser henry shawcross his stepfather oh you bastard he thought finally to see the betrayal with his own eyes mouser and henry together no way he could let them escape no way lukes eyes darted everywhere no taxi stand in sight no way to follow them he ran across the street now in a fullblown sprint toward the musee dorsay he glanced back the policeman was running now too chasing him the girlfriend had sold him out he reached the taxi stand at the museum and one of the cabs cut hard to the front of the line earning a squeal of honks from the other drivers luke got in the back seat thank you go vite fast eiffel tower the driver a young man about his age nodded and roared down the street past the winded policeman who had stopped running the tower very hectic too much traffic the cabbie said a shooting his english was okay okay luke said he didnt care where they went the black bmw was gone how was he going to find his dad or aubrey now then the police station the cabbie kept watching him in the mirror you run from a policeman and now you want to go to the police he mistook me for someone else the cabbie did not seem to understand wait drummond had said that he and henry and his dad had all worked for the state department if quicksilver was the replacement for the book club then he should turn to state for help take me to the american embassy please i must call for address he flipped open a phone spoke a flurry of what sounded like russian into it luke fell against the back of the seat the cabbie made turn after turn speaking into the phone he reached for a radio and turned it off how far to the embassy the cabbie clicked off the phone and took a hard turn into a quiet street he slammed on the brakes and twisted in the seat he raised a small gun from the seat and aimed it at luke a pop sound and luke felt a thump hit the crocheted wool of the ugly scarf and a slight weight lodge in the fabric he grabbed at the gun his head scraping the ceiling he turned the little gun back toward the cabbie and it fired again the dart pierced the cabbies throat and he sagged against the steering wheel the car lurched forward crumpling into a parked van luke yanked a dart from the scarf it had gotten stuck in the thick knitting the girlfriends impulsive gift had saved him jesus luke thought he was waiting for me cut ahead of the line to make sure i was his fare he knew i was at that subway station how the cabbie kept breathing in shallow panting gasps drugged luke fumbled with the dart at the guys throat his fingertip touched a leather string he pulled on the cord and a small medal of an armed angel crept out of the cabbies shirt saint michael like his like drummonds was the angel a sign of quicksilver drummond had the medal and was clearly a member but if the cabbie was from quicksilver why would he attack him luke picked up the dart gun and the cell phone the guy had used he grabbed the cabbies wallet he got out of the cab and ran three streets over he opened the cell phone and looked in the call log the number was one he recognized one seared in his memory jane the kidnapping mastermind never mind quicksilver never mind the night road never mind the fifty million jane was the woman who had orchestrated all the chaos the woman responsible for the hellish chessboard his life had turned into she had sent this cabbie after him if the cabbie was part of quicksilver then he must be a traitor working with jane that was going to be her mistake luke thought because shed just given him a way to track her down pawn takes queen he thought as he ran away from the cab luke knew he needed to avoid any place with security cameras maybe the surveillance in the metro had helped the cabbie find him at les invalides he thought and so he ran until he found a library but even the library had a camera near the door he ducked his head averted his gaze from its unblinking view he opened the cabbies wallet a wad of euros a drivers license a gray blank card like an electronic passkey now he just needed to find an address to match the passkey he sat at a computer terminal he entered in the web address hed seen on erics laptop in the old house the night roads online meeting room he got to the television fan site entered erics password it still worked someone at the night road was being sloppy not eliminating his account yet or maybe they were just busy getting ready for hellfire whatever horror it was and the thought chilled him he signed in as eric and he started a new discussion with a request for help i have a cell phone that i need to track immediately help please and he typed in janes cell phone number he waited he clicked on a posting about a video link and to his horror the video started with a closeup of a guy he recognized as the man in houston whod been standing at the intersection waiting for allen clifford the cheap jacket the scarred cheeks luke remembered him running away in the dim streetlight in houston his eyes were wide and a razor began a slow draw across his throat luke turned off the video before anyone around him could see the execution he felt sick thats what theyll do to you if they catch you thats what theyll do to aubrey and dad he jumped to an englishlanguage news site and the shooting at the tower was the top story no suspects caught yet he went back to the night road site hoping against hope a reply waited for him i have your phone info what do you have to trade inspiration struck and he wrote the kind of lie he thought would appeal i have a nice set of bank accounts established ready for cleaned money he waited it took an hour and he fought his impatience fine the answer came in a private message to erics account the phone was registered to a jane mornay she had a paris address near saint germain on a street called rue de labbegregoire he signed off without posting the promised set of accounts betraying the guy whod traced the phone probably meant his password would be invalidated and he couldnt use the site again but it didnt matter he would have the woman behind all his misery the woman who had stolen his life and he would be closer to the truth about his father his life hellfire he thought jane was at the nexus of all these events an unseen hand one he was about to drag into the sunlight he walked out the door shielding his face again at the librarys doors he was afraid every camera was an eye watching him mouser kicked aubrey and warren dantry out of the back of the van sending them sprawling at henry shawcrosss feet the packed dirt of the old vast barn smelled of horse of hay aubrey blinked shafts of light made yellow bars on the brown of the floor she saw a bmw parked behind henry she tried to make herself small curling into a ball one of the men had hit her after shed spoiled his shot at luke kept a gun on her head to force warren dantry to sit still she looked up at mouser henry the two remaining thugs she realized no one was looking at her they were all looking at her fellow prisoner warren dantry rolled onto his back and henry stared mouser said you recognize and henry raised a hand to silence him you were on the plane you died henry said hello asshole warren said mouser saw henrys hands start to tremble clenching into fists luke is gone mouser said no way hes an amateur i think hes been working for his dad this whole time youve been played for the biggest effing fool on the planet henry no henry said no no not possible no to what warren said no that im here or no to luke having handed you your ass on a plate leave us henry said i want to talk to the walking dead alone no mouser said youre blinded henry youre blinded by your affection for your stepson it ends now you are incapable of calling the shots youve put our money our whole network and hellfire at risk im in command now henry slid him a look of utter poison no youre not jesus henry you really cant run anything warren dantry said even when youre supposedly the smartest guy in the room shut up shut up shut up youre dead steel coated his tone but underneath everyone could see a murderous rage academics must take the evidence before their eyes into account warren said henry seized the bound warren and halfdragged him into an unused room off the main barn floor he slammed the door closed he shoved warren to the floor what is quicksilver henry said its your death warren said unlike mine yours will be for real henry studied warrens face whoever they are they must have paid you a fortune to abandon your wife and child i would have enjoyed your funeral except i could see the agony barbara and luke suffered i dont think you gave them a moments thought he knelt close to him you think ive lost you lost you heartless bastard you lost the last ten years you had to take over my life because you never could have built one for yourself i loved being married to barbara loved being lukes father and i was better at it than you were please you destroyed it all barbara knew what you were what you were becoming henry staggered on his feet im guessing she confronted you about your illicit activities while you were on your drive that day i knew her better than anyone else she wouldnt have been able to contain her outrage she called you out didnt she i know what you are henry you cant lie it away her words coated with venom him trying to explain convince her she was wrong grabbing at the wheel begging her to pull over i want you out of the house henry out of our lives gone forever the car wheeling loose the guardrail suddenly crunching and giving way the car tumbling through air and you killed her it was an accident just a stupid accident there are no accidents around you henry youre the black death in a bad suit henry kicked warren in the stomach hard shut up then he kicked him in the face blood burst from warrens mouth a chip of tooth pebbled across the packed dirt then henry leaned down grabbed warrens head and started pounding it against the ground youre dead youre dead im going to make you dead again henry screamed let him go mouser stood in the doorway holding aubrey he held a gun aimed at henrys head i told you to leave us alone henry said we need him alive mouser guided aubrey to a corner chair for information or for ransom no he has to die now go back to being dead mouser pushed the gun against henrys skin between the nose and the upper lip listen to yourself we need him henry slapped the gun away why i can tell you what quicksilver is if this bastards behind it its a group of eggheads with a bit of muscle thrown in to evaluate threats and fight them off the books just like the book club he took it over from me he stole all the credit quicksilver is far more than the book club ever was just like luke is far more of a man than youll ever be warren spat out another sliver of tooth and blood you mouser said to warren how much do you know about us specifics warren hesitated and mouser aimed his gun at aubreys head talk or she dies youre going to kill us anyway warren looked at aubrey sadness in his eyes im sorry aubrey but its true i know aubrey closed her eyes as if waiting for the bullet to end the nightmare but i think if you want this money youre after so bad you wont shoot her luke might still be willing to make an exchange mouser weighed his words oh i want to shoot her badly just because luke killed my woman mouser twisted one of aubreys breasts until she gasped in pain he gave her a rough angry kiss on the cheek as she tried to wrench her face away but then he turned the gun back toward warren you work for the beast right the beast the united states government i dont work for the government not any more warren raised an eyebrow i mean henry takes the governments money at his thinktank i dont he said this like it was a sign of moral superiority how did you survive mouser said dont you have other things to worry about warren said answer me you should have died on the book club flight i missed my plane mouser licked his upper lip those two guys outside they used to commit gang rapes in bosnia when they wouldnt get answers from pissant villagers theyd love a few hours with aubrey warren said i didnt get on the plane at the last minute why i got a phone call before the flight took off i got a job offer i had to give immediate and private consideration i told my friends id fly down later and meet them and when the plane crashed i knew it wasnt an accident my new employers thought it best to hide me for me and for my family so they wouldnt be targets youre a cold bastard aubrey said luke worshipped you you dont deserve his love my enemies thinking i was dead protected luke until now warren stared at henry you tried to make him into you you failed shush mouser said you say youre not part of the beast only the beast can mount a group thats so well funded night road is an army but isnt part of any government either warren said were opposite sides of the same coin mouser frowned youre nonstate so are we warren said welcome to the future of warfare what youre a bunch of wellheeled international vigilantes please we dont have to follow the laws same as you scary for you a level playing field shut up warren henry seemed calmer collected he turned to mouser he wont tell us specifics maybe if luke were threatened but he wont talk but he might break if tortured mouser leaned down into warrens face and shouted what do you know about hellfire youre not going to be able to pull your big attack off warren said you didnt answer my question warren closed his mouth youre a lot like your son mouser said thank you warren said by that i mean you are too stupid to know when you are in deep trouble hes had luck yours has run out if you kill him you wont get the money you see that was wishful thinking on henrys part i think we get a man inside erics bank we hack our way in and we track where he hid the money thats a hell of a lot simpler than trying to find luke who may or may not know where the money is luke doesnt know aubrey practically spat the words at mouser you might as well not spend your time chasing him eric was too smart for you you killed him in cold blood but he made sure youre not ever going to get that money he hid it too well mouser kicked her in the chest and she went down gasping he turned back to warren where will your son go his only option is the police i dont think he will mouser said i think hell look for quicksilver to help him we are interested in them and in one other person a british woman who calls herself jane i dont know a jane warren said i think you must mouser said shes pitted us against each other shes responsible for the deaths of your man in houston and shes tried to steal our money we have a common enemy in her warren stared silently his lips pressed into a tight line you dont know her mouser said no no idea who she is i think you dont know her by the name jane but maybe by another name maybe janes just her kidnappers name i think maybe shes screwed you over mouser said warren remained silent but aubrey could see a flash of painful realization on his face is your son working for you was he a spy for quicksilver mouser asked warren measured the tension in the air he watched aubrey staring at him yes yes luke works for quicksilver goddamn it hes lying to make me look bad henry said youre doing that perfectly well yourself mouser said im not blind to the fact this man wants to see you stripped of your power i want to see him stripped of his life warren said but im not blind to the one fact you both ignore the catalyst to this entire situation is luke he is the one and only person with a personal link to both quicksilver and to the night road this jane bitch knew it shes not part of the night road so i think she must know about quicksilver mouser crossed his arms henry and warren glared at each other mouser went to the desk opened the laptop i left erics account alive on the night road website to see if they would come back it was accessed once after eric was dead and i figured it had to be luke or aubrey someone using erics account just posted a request to trace a phone lukes looking for someone henry said where is he can you find where he logged in from mouser studied the screen hes gotten a promise to respond from a member call the member henry tell him to give us the information on whos registered to that phone but well before he passes it to luke i want to know where they are and who owns that property i think luke will go there you want to set a trap henry said let me go let me talk to him no much more than a trap this ends now henry there are other ways to get our money back mouser glanced at aubrey she was his woman she can get us inside that bank she knows erics friends there his coworkers we can get inside we can track where he moved the money the answer from the hacker came quickly mouser read it off the screen registered to a jane mornay at this address on rue de labbegregoire send me if luke is there i can talk to him grow up you cannot have it both ways didnt your mama ever teach you that mouser clicked open his phone began to dial ive got friends here beyond you henry people ive traded information with before its time for a very big gun then we go back home and we launch hellfire henry now the money is not more important than the mission we can get more money to fund the night road we cant you dont know who our financiers are theyll kill us for losing the fifty million not us you henry stared i do know whos sending us the fifty million did you think i wouldnt check you out when you approached me about the night road you idiot i have my own contacts henry when i explain your incompetence your lack of focus the prince will give us fresh cash he has plenty and hell pay plenty to fund us for years to come and if you argue with me i will shoot you to death im taking command fight me and ill kill you what the hell are you planning henrys voice rose two birds mouser said one stone rue du labbegregoire was a quiet street and luke used the cabbies passkey to open the groundlevel door of the building he walked in the lions den the truth behind his kidnapping the truth behind his past it was tomb quiet he walked up a narrow stairway he had the cabbies passkey still in one hand and the gun hed taken from the night road thug at the tower in his other hand the cabbie could have regained consciousness called in and warned jane launcelot consulting read the sign on the doorway he tested the knob locked he tried the passkey on the electronic pad next to it it didnt work tried again still didnt work an idea struck him he took his saint michaels medal and pressed it against the pad the door opened his breath felt frozen in his chest because here was a threat far scarier than kidnapping or bullets or the unmoored violence of a snow or a mouser because here might be the truth about his father his stepfather the shadows that had lain quiet close to his life waiting to waken and now dominated him he raised the gun ahead of him and he stepped into the empty reception area he closed the door behind him and he heard the lock take hold dead quiet he moved through the rest of the office suite the passkey opened every door but one he saw cots a table with guns a small kitchen it smelled like a small camp cabin a lingering air of food of cigarettes of sweat in one of the rooms the corner held a single cot long dark strands of hair threaded the pillow aubreys rings her watch lay on a bedside table aubrey they had kept her here he went into the next room paper covered the walls clippings photos writings of mouser and snow and the thin black guy whod nearly killed luke and drummond in new york it reminded him of his fathers study his dad liked to post index cards and notes on a blank wall scraps of history economics and politics to find the common links that would help him delve into a past mystery or outline a scholarly article or book the sight of the collage of paper struck him his fathers thoughts put up on the wall he looked at the clippings and photos the word hellfire was written on a piece of paper in the center in his fathers handwriting the wall looked like a project interrupted as quicksilver his dad tried to piece together the evidence about the night road luke recognized the first photo as that of the man whod been at the houston rendezvous with allen clifford recently shown executed on the night roads site he had small eyes a weak mouth nice hair his drivers license was next to him his name was bridger a list of former addresses was posted next to his picture but the photo next to him was a face seared into lukes brain that of allen clifford alive and then the press photos of him dead after eric shot him luke read the handwritten notes beneath the pictures subject that clifford is meeting with wishes to sell information on an impending multicity terrorist attack a date four days ago scrawled in subject meeting with clifford demands that they meet in open will not meet indoors extreme paranoia insists on meeting at corner near episcopal shelter on mccoy street near downtown pm clifford to dress as homeless man at subjects request mousers real name was dwayne york a blow up of his texas drivers license hung on the wall he was a freelance web designer in dallas exmilitary dishonorable discharge his friends called him mouser because he got written up for shooting mice on the base he had progressed to cats and dogs a long history of loose ties to paramilitary groups he had been implicated and spent time in prison for a loose connection to a radical group that tried to bomb a government building a picture dated on the day his fathers plane went down it was a security photo a man in a maintenance suit walking past a camera head ducked slightly it could be mouser the bastard did it luke thought he sabotaged my dads plane he killed my dads friends the son of a bitch snow her real name was roanna snowden one of the few survivors of the children of the lamb religious cult he remembered the feds besieging their compound they had been massing weapons he had just been a kid then and so had snow shed gotten a chemistry degree and then dropped out of sight to make bombs apparently the thin guy from new york david byrd nicknamed sweet bird a long list of crimes a web of names with his at the center prisons and terms served many of the names on the list were tied back to another network a mosque in queens one with links to wahhabi radicalists in saudi arabia stories of unsolved crimes where he had fallen under suspicion including the murder of an assistant da were chronicled below his picture financial accounts that showed one of his associates had signed for cargo shipments carried by travport luke remembered the name travport was the company that had bank accounts with eric then a long list of recent attacks small ones against the citys infrastructure power stations traffic lights small acts of sabotage knife swipes at the soft tissue of everyday life there were photos all overlaid on a map of a shooting in los angeles a bombing in kansas city a ruptured pipeline in canada the chlorine attack in texas as if whoever had assembled this collage his father was trying to piece together the people and the attacks find the common links looking at the map a thought rose to his mind the scattered bank accounts eric had set up california minnesota missouri texas the locales of or very close to the attacks even the one failed attack in alaska where the extremists had been arrested he remembered the news account said the men were from seattle washington state had been on the bank account list as well he stepped over to an array of computer screens one screen showed a feed from the station at les invalides in the screens corner was a frozen photo of himself stepping onto the train at champ de mars the cabbie must have gotten radioed reports driven fast to each stop another photo of him on the automated walkway at les invalides he could not believe that the place was empty but then he considered his father was a captive of the night road the frenchman was dead at the tower and the cabbie was unconscious in the taxi maybe quicksilvers numbers in paris were few but where was jane mornay and if she was part of quicksilver part of his fathers organization why had she done this why had she put lukes life at risk he tried the one door that the passkey denied again locked he tore down a curtain and wrapped it around the gun he fired into the lock it took twenty minutes of intense arguing and haggling but mouser struck the unholiest of deals the islamic terror cell knew and trusted mouser he had previously sold them stolen credit card data from hijacked pcs the cells leader listened to mouser as he outlined his difficult request he needed a bomb and he needed it right now the cells next martyr had planned to execute its paris operation three weeks from now during a visit by the israeli prime minister everything was prepared the martyr wanted to do his work mouser said the cells leader needed to strike an office of the israeli intelligence service hidden in a quiet neighborhood but they had to strike immediately an attack on it would be a great blow before the zionists visit and mouser could guarantee a strike in payment on zionist targets inside the united states as well mouser told the handlers what corporate stocks would be most affected in a massive planned american attack he referred to as hellfire in the next couple of days they could sell and buy accordingly and realize a nice profit the cells leader was convinced sacrificing a martyr now could build a useful alliance ten minutes after mousers call the martyrs prayers were completed and he was on his way driving with deliberate care through the busy streets of paris behind the locked door was a small room luke saw a scattering of paper files printouts a large shredder sat in the corner file cabinets filled a wall he tested one it slid open easily it was empty another also empty but he could see flicks of paper left in the bottom like forgotten snow standing its ground in shadow the third cabinet was locked he shot out the lock his hands trembled inside were paper files but only a few a file on his stepfather thick and some of the papers torn free they were old memos written by henry on state department letterhead with sticky notes attached most of the memos touched on the rising challenge of cheap terrorism how radicalist groups could gut a nation on the cheap with attacks on its infrastructure apparently this was henrys favorite topic during his earliest thinktank days scribbled handwritten notes clipped to the various reports validated henrys longago musings cost a halfmillion dollars inflicted billion bali bombings billion in damage for a investment the madrid bombings billion in damage for around in marijuana ecstasy and money the london bombings billion in damage inflicted for in expenditures as though these horrors had merely been the first act of what the night road might unleash on america and its allies how high could they aim with fifty million dollars at their disposal they could create a wave of s an endless chain of attacks and horror stretching over months over years and if the enemy was already inside the borders working together across ideologies for their common goal how much more dangerous could they be luke stuffed the file back into the cabinet he was past feeling sickened now he only felt a steady rage at how he had been used files on eric lots of notes about his bank marolt gold which seemed to specialize in nice wealthy americans and a few people of dubious integrity the notes suggested the bank had been under quicksilvers eye for the past several months due to its connection to a certain arab billionaire who was suspected of funding terrorism a photo of eric and aubrey taken in happier times big sunglasses hiding most of aubreys face but not her happy smile photos of the two of them walking through versailles he remembered that aubrey had particularly wanted to go there and that a variant of versailles had been used as a password on erics laptop good god he thought how long had quicksilver been watching eric a file on luke the words do not contact were stamped in red on a photo of himself a fairly recent one leaving henrys house in washington last christmas christmas back in his ordinary life and his father was watching him how many holidays had he mourned his fathers passing felt it most acutely with the taste of egg nog and the smell of pine and his father had been watching him watching him mourn watching him live his life unless it hadnt been his father watching him what if it had been jane instead janes phone was registered to this address how did she connect to his father a file on his mother the word eliminated and the date of her death stamped on the file he sank to his knees eliminated the question mark made it worse had henry killed her even though he himself had nearly died in the accident he rifled through the file but nothing announced a brutal truth photos of her and henry taken under surveillance a history of her personal life photos of the wrecked car mom he said and then he couldnt speak couldnt think his chest ached what truth about her had been hidden from him had she known his father was alive it was inconceivable she could have kept such a secret from him and she had gone from being married to a man luke considered a hero to a man luke knew was a contemptible snake the basest traitor he gathered the papers tucked them into his knapsack sealed it shut the other files were on people he did not know dozens of people whose names meant nothing to him except one a file on aubrey perrault with the word lindoe alongside in parentheses he opened it empty all the papers whatever had been here were gone as though aubrey had been erased he heard the whisper of the door open and turned and a young woman stood there gun in hand leveled at him dont raise your gun drop it her accent was british he obeyed she didnt lower her gun youre a bit too late for the reunion she said hello luke dantry hello jane kick the weapon over to me she sounded like a teacher gently issuing an order to a preschooler he did she kicked the gun under a table if she was surprised by his use of her name she didnt show it she looked as calm as if shed just sauntered into a good restaurant to enjoy a glass of wine with friends but she still didnt lower the gun her voice sounded like ice chipping falling onto cold steel she flexed a smile she might have been pretty once but a hardness cast into her face made her unattractive well thank god youre safe yes thank god im safe luke said because im the key to all this arent i key to your plan your scheme scheme sounds so vicious i couldnt figure it out at first my stepfather thought quicksilver was behind my kidnapping it wasnt them it was you you alone youre part of quicksilver but you were working on your own you betrayed quicksilver you had eric kill allen clifford to get quicksilvers attention to set them off after the night road you were the quicksilver agent assigned to watch henry to watch me after my mom died and you discovered the night road and that henry was getting all this money you started a war between the two groups just so you could grab the night roads money and let quicksilver take the blame for it very good i watched your stepfather and a thoroughly nasty billionaire finalize a deal in a london park thats why i knew i could steal the money she flexed that awful superior smile again one can hardly be a traitor to a private company i prefer the term free agent drummond and the rest of quicksilver didnt know about the fifty million only you did you kept the information from my dad and the others a waste really she said you might be smarter than both your fathers and i was the perfect pawn for you to use i had a father in quicksilver a stepfather in the night road i get involved and both sides heat up the war this is the secret war that drummond referred to its not going to be fought in the open its like the new cia vs kgb her smile flickered luke said and that war gives you ample smoke and fire to make a getaway drop out of sight you could be presumed dead or captured by the night road you brought eric to drummonds attention promised him you could hide him from the wrath of the night road he could trade information on the night road mouser my stepfather for his new life but the fifty million was a secret between the two of you youve let your own friends be murdered and captured just for dirty money money isnt bad moneys joy security a life free from worry rather different from a job with quicksilver the benefits package i found lacking she raised the gun ever so slightly better to hit him between the eyes you offered quicksilver the accounts where the moneys been hidden for aubrey yes i have the file with the account information i have the encryption key two halves of the puzzle held by the queen and the pawn i despise chess she said frowning give me the account numbers luke now the martyr watched the target building he was nervous he had not expected to go to paradise for weeks and now he had no time to comport his mind toward calm people strolled past it no one came in or out on the other side was a christian bookstore with apartments above it on the opposite side was an art supply store selling the tools to make godless images he told himself he tried not to think about the two pretty young women standing outside in the dank air finishing their gitanes laughing he smoked gitanes too he tried not to look at them but their lovely faces drew his gaze like a magnet he was weak and temptation was strong they laughed and the smoke wreathed their faces and he reminded himself they were devils nothing more paris was a city full of devils the virgins given in heaven would be far more desirable flashing eyes waterpearled thighs and smiles of rapture he drove past twice looking the part of the man seeking that simplest of urban pleasures a parking spot when he completed his orbit back in front of the target building he was glad the two girls had either left the street or gone back inside the art shop he didnt want to look at them again you can put the gun down jane can i lets discuss terms luke said the softening of her smile was an acknowledgment that they were moving toward the truth terms you give me the fifty million and you walk away and you hope the night road never finds you mouser might flay you alive if he gets his hands on you and he might not be the worst of it she gestured at the photos of mouser snow and sweet bird theyre insane but functional im sure they could take a very memorable vengeance against you two of the three are dead he said im not exactly scared of them the way i was id kill mouser if i were you he wont give up so i give you the money and i get nothing no way she would let him live she had nothing to gain from it ill offer the same deal i gave eric i promised i could buy a new life for him and aubrey you keep a quartermillion you vanish ill help you set up in a nice backwater youre just as bad as the night road you completely screwed up my life you bitch for what so you can have what you want and everyone else be damned and you dont give a shit about innocent people you make me sound so bad luke honestly its a days work were keeping cash away from terrorists after all im much less nasty than the night road now the file please i have the encryption key on the computer in the other room he stepped into the corridor he would only get this one chance she stepped away from the window the pistol focused on him finally a parking spot directly in front of the building opened up an elderly man eased his peugeot out of a slot and talking to himself drove down the rue de labbegregoire the martyr parked with care one had to be a good parallel parker to survive in paris and he was he did not weep but he thought of his father dead two years from a cancer his mother who would not understand the sky was milky with rain he wondered if there would be cool rain in paradise he could not remember if weather was mentioned it felt like someone else was operating his muscles as though they moved of a different accord than his own brain and heart he wished for his mothers touch he wished he had not seen the girls in the art shop he wished he had finished school but none of that would matter he was being weak the glory that awaited would surpass all wouldnt it the martyr lifted a device that had once been a game controller wires led to the gateway to paradise he was afraid a tiny voice inside him screamed do not do this he silenced the voice with a heaving sigh and pressed the button to the game controller jane had followed him into the room with the computer it sat on a desk in front of the window she went behind the desk gestured with the gun at him to make him stay put toss me the key ring he obeyed she opened the toy slid the thumb drive into the usb port with one hand she ran her fingers along the keyboard typing she kept the gun aimed at him with the other hand she would have to glance down if the account information appeared he could rush her then she would shoot him he was sure but if he didnt do something he was dead anyway she kept flicking her glance between the computer screen which he couldnt see but which gave off a dim glow in the darkened room that lit her face with an otherworldly blue and him she wouldnt kill him until she was sure she had what she wanted he tensed to jump at her there it is but janes voice so confident and snarky suddenly sounded shaken hidden in plain sight that little b the window and the world where jane stood vanished a flash like god opening an eye blinded luke there and gone only light and dust remaining he tumbled up and down and sideways through the air and grit where the walls had been and landed against a fist of stone rubble rained past him where jane had stood with her rotten gun and her smug smile junk hammered a hundred blows into him everything seemed pulverized his scream got lost in his throat and then it was done the sound and fury gone and then an enormous wrenching silence luke grew aware that he was still breathing since he was coughing and every hack pierced his ribcage with pain he tried to move and every muscle cried against the bones and flesh he could see part of a milkcolored sky above him the roof was gone half of it in the street the other half on top of him the front of the building was a memory a curtain of dust marked where the walls stood smoke filled his nose parts of the rooftop had fallen atop him in a wide scattering the wall had held shielding him from the heaviest of the rubble he blinked tried again he could move his feet his hands the floor sagged and a fearsome crack in the floor inched toward him beyond that the mist of dust he rose on hands and knees now testing the bones to see what was broken his face hurt his eyes were swollen blinking hard against the onslaught of grit and the bright sunsmashing flash of the blast he crawled away from the crack from the edge of the floor he remembered that he was six stories up what the hell what the hell what the hell he mumbled to himself he tried to get his bearings the building could collapse would collapse he had a horror of being trapped entombed alive with tons of rubble sealing him away succumbing to a slow lonely death the fear cut through the haze he crawled along hands and knees the stairs he had come up had to be gone now in the front of the building but there had to be back stairs the floor groaned sagged and he nearly fell below him he heard a rumble walls tumbling away the floor canted hard he could not see past the swirling dust he heard the shrill cry of a police siren help was coming he tried to remember the layout of the building stairs reception hallway offices on both sides he realized he was crawling the wrong way through the gritty fog he turned and hoped he didnt crawl off the edge he splayed fingers in front of him feeling reaching he found wall a door blown inward by the blast at a broken angle wrenched clean off the hinges he fumbled forward nothing but wall more wall a dead end no back stairs he crawled back out into the shattered hallway the building moaned he thought it might well have been built before the days of steel beams and might be straining to stay erect held together only by chance he found another door also caved in by the force he crawled under its twisted wreckage and the floor ended he reached a few inches below and found only space stuck out a leg and his toes found the rest of the shattered stairway he put his weight on a step and it held then both feet and he lowered himself down he sat down on his butt shivering then he eased down on his belly snaking along the stairs he slid down the top three stories at the next one the walls didnt look so cracked from the force of the roofs collapse and he got to his feet he tested the stairs with his feet behind him the stairway stood in a crazy dustchoked warp when he reached the bottom the stairway was slashed apart at the bottom floor what looked like large chunks of a smoldering car were wedged where the steps would have once been he jumped down from the stairs into broken glass burning rubber twisted hot metal rubble made a moonscape of the street the buildings on both sides were damaged as well their facades ripped away but their frames holding fire surged out the top of one of the buildings he stumbled through broken brick and scorched stone wreckage choked the street no sign of jane shed been vaporized in the blast but what the hell had happened bomb the night road was attacking quicksilver theyd found his fathers people maybe his father had talked or aubrey and theyd gone after quicksilver with a murderous rage theyd used bombs in the attacks at the high school and the chlorine train and now here he coughed and spat blood hands touched him he looked up a young woman spoke french to him in soothing tones he could start to hear her words over the hum in his ears she tried to help him walk he saw walking wounded stunned a woman clutching her broken arm an old man with a brutal gash across his bald pate luke touched his own face and probed a wet mask of blood the pain in his body turned savage like a beast awakening inside his bones the young woman kept talking soothingly in the lovely french supporting him and through the dust he saw the creamcolored sky he pulled away from her she wouldnt let him go and at the end of the road he could see police arriving ambulances with lights fire trucks non he said she spoke french he didnt understand and pulled at him no doubt she thought he was in shock no doubt she was right but the police no they would want to know who he was why he was there and they would find out he was wanted in the united states no he abandoned his kind savior with a thankyou shrugged free of her grasp he stumbled past the crowds that were gathering at one end of the street and people stopped him trying to help him sure that he was shaken he pulled away he staggered past a crowd that had spilled out of a restaurant he went inside to the bathroom and was sick he stood and studied himself in the mirror both his eyes were swollen blackening with bruising a tooth on the left side of his mouth was gone his lips were heavy like hed taken a punch a score of cuts along his forehead up into the hairline a bad one across his nose another one on his chin his whole body throbbed like a bruise his hair stood in spikes dusty his shirt was in shreds and he could see the red scraped skin underneath he felt the silver medal of saint michael covered in grit he washed the blood and gunk from his face he realized hed lost his gun in the dining area he saw an array of cutlery at a service station and selected a sharp knife he didnt want to be unarmed he put the knife in his waistband he went back out into the street and a man wearing an apron stopped him and in french said you should go to hospital sir do you need help the mans face was full of kindness of course it was luke thought most people in this world were decent good they did not turn a blind eye to the suffering they saw there is good in the world luke thought and the night road wants to stamp it out destroy it i am okay luke said thank you he headed down the crowded street the police cordoned off the avenues how many innocent people he thought how many buried in the rubble or killed outright nausea and anger shook him vied for control the ambulances were pulling away now loading the first evacuees to the hospital surrounded by the onlookers he felt marked alone as though he wandered among them like a ghost and then a block away in the milling crowd he saw him henry shawcross standing close to the cordon looking down rue de labbegregoire at the devastation his face might have been carved from stone he stood on tiptoes peering down the street firsthand witness to the carnage hed helped create henry turned away from the crowd started to walk toward the ambulances that remained where the injured were being loaded in hes looking for me to see if i survived luke thought he walked up to henry grabbed his shoulder and said are you here to leave flowers on my grave henry didnt move he just sucked in a breath of surprise im armed are you here alone henry nodded if you lie to me youll die ill kill you and i wont even blink start walking toward your car luke tables are turned asshole this is me kidnapping you henry obeyed luke kept a grip on his arm and under his hand henrys flesh trembled thank god youre alive henry started dont give me your crappy lies you sold me out you left me to die i did no such thing everything ive tried to do lukes hand slid down to henrys and gave the little finger a savage twist henry gasped and nearly stopped i am oddly enough not in the mood for one of your lectures about me or my life heard that done that they walked in the middle of the closed street away from the other pedestrians who might overhear lukes harsh whispers the night road did this yes or no luke said henry nodded misery on his face mouser ordered this done hes no longer following my orders i tried to stop him yeah i can really see you called the police luke please i was going to walk up and shoot the bomber before he could detonate i didnt get here in time i took an enormous risk in coming here spare me the heroic selfportrait they have aubrey and my father henry nodded again alive yes so all this to kill me and to wipe out quicksilver youve killed innocent people this is a war youre playing at war but this isnt a war look around you look at what youve been through luke war war of a different sort fought in secret but still a war and youre on the side of the bad guys luke said the good guys didnt want me any more he looked away from luke what this is my car henry stopped by a bmw sedan in drive henry obeyed when he got behind the wheel luke put the knife along his ribs i drove for four hours with a weapon in my side i hope you enjoy it more than i did luke let me explain you are going to take me to where my father and aubrey are do you understand yes i do whether or not i kill you when we get there depends on how well you act do you understand yes luke drive henry inched out into traffic headed toward the pont neuf crossed the seine luke couldnt take his gaze off henry it was like seeing something human but knowing that a devil dwelt under the skin hurt anger loathing all tore at him no explanation could satisfy but he still wanted to hear one in henrys words why luke asked there are so many whys a bit of the cool confidence inched back into henrys tone i hardly know where to start i want to know why youre a traitor silence for a long while luke stabbed him not deep but he drove the knife into the cotton of the shirt and into the soft fat underneath ahhh henry didnt scream but it was close a choking cry do you want me to crash henry slapped a palm against the steering wheel in pain the police might ask why im bloodied and why youre holding a knife did i stutter answer me why you owe me henry for years you pretended to be what you werent you acted like you cared about me and my mom i did why why why then the answer came the words as flat as the blade of the knife no one listened to me it was such a petty confession a small gripe by a small man on such a little wheel could turn betrayals of country of family of honor the confession left luke nearly speechless all the rage he felt toward henry turned into a confusion henry i always listened to you i trusted you you and your mother were better to me than anyone ever was luke you just dont know im listening now the book club was my first thinktank it was formed of a group of professors with international postings recruited by the state department we all worked secretly for the department doing analysis talking with other academics in the target countries and regions we studied we were much closer to the action than most analysts we would conceive of new ways to acquire intelligence to affect situations in foreign governments and our muscle drummond and clifford yes theyd carry the plans out i did some missions as well so did your father i did a lot of profiling of terrorists and extremists we would write papers but not for public release they were policy papers the deal was that we would never be named we were working for states own version of the cia the one theyre not supposed to have an illegal branch a secret branch none of us were formal spies although we were trained in tradecraft they were afraid we might get kidnapped they wanted us to be capable of protecting ourselves they called us thinkers and thugs but we mostly focused on keeping our ears to the ground in a way that tapped into broad social changes that other researchers were not doing he wiped at his lip we predicted the fall of the soviet union six years before it happened we were ignored just a bunch of state eggheads who were working in secret and didnt even acknowledge our own names we predicted the jihadists would arise after the fall of the soviets guys with guns in afghanistan would start hating america as much as they hated russia and decide to open terrorist training camps no one believed us his voice broke i predicted the use of jet liners as weapons the same selection of targets ten years before no one believed me no one took me seriously do you know what that felt like luke did not feel sympathy for him but it was hard not to feel a sickening pity you dont get a pass because your feelings got bruised no it was more than feeling hurt i started the book club but your father took it over every good idea i had he smothered i brought in the other professors gave them this one great opportunity but it was your father they wanted to follow they thought i was just a chalk jockey a book reader i wasnt a leader i wasnt as smart i had one good idea the book club itself and then i was useless so ignored and unloved you had mouser kill them and make it look like an accident henry opened his mouth shut it opened it like a fish looking for the cooling water but with a knife in his side he said yes no one was listening to us anyway after we were an embarrassment can you imagine the damage if my predictions saw the light of day the government wasnt willing to risk it ever so there was no successor formed to the book club and mouser framed an innocent man for sabotaging the plane and killed him too and you found mouser where henry coughed it was my job to profile terrorists see what we could learn from them i met him in prison i liked him he wasnt quite so extreme then hes gotten worse you tried to kill my father and then you have the gall to claim you care about me just because you were jealous of him youre just like him just like him i thought you were like your mother but i see youre just like warren luke let the silence build he thought he might kill henry right now even if it wrecked the car and killed them both did you kill my mom too henrys face broke with grief you know better i dont know anything about you it was an accident she was driving you know i nearly died it was an accident i feel youre leaving gaps then go ahead and kill me luke i am telling you that i would never have hurt your mother and you can believe me or not kill me if you have to you think i wont kill you do you really doubt me now i know you are fundamentally a decent person who will not kill a man who he loved as a father henry said we can help each other escape our problems ah having betrayed your friends your family and your country now youre going to betray the night road would you prefer i stay loyal to them or help you henry asked the traffic thickened and he laid on the horn fighting his way through a tangle of cars and buses at the place de la concorde help me how do i stop the night road you cant there are too many of them what is hellfire hellfire is the second phase the first wave was an audition what think it through luke like this was an intellectual exercise an audition luke repeated like a gang initiation a smaller crime before you get responsibility for the bigger crime is that what these recent attacks are the chlorine train in texas the e coli in tennessee the pipeline bombing the high school attack henry nodded proving grounds luke said pull them off and you get to play on a bigger stage which is hellfire yes the money luke said the fifty million you get a slice of that if you qualify more if you contribute to executing the hellfire attack yes wheres it coming from the funds had to be brought in and cleaned eric said from where henrys tongue played along his lip his breathing grew ragged i need to explain an audition he thought of the various terrorist wannabes on the night road site asking for and getting expertise the words theyd used its an investment someone overseas is investing in americanbased terrorists henry nodded your researches into terrorism you interviewed people overseas too now he put the knife close to henrys tender throat he didnt care if anyone else in a passing car saw who an elderly saudi prince hes backing the fifty million more to come if we succeed our connection with him is what gave mouser access to a suicide bomber here in paris he is funding networks all over europe in east africa in the philippines in australia luke lowered the knife he thought he knew how deep this betrayal went but this staggered him why i told you ive been warning people about this for years even with the new thinktank i write the papers not enough people listen but now they have to ive predicted everything thats going to happen all my papers over the past six months all the papers ive got coming out this week you predict the future and then you make it happen and now everyone will listen to you and pay you handsomely for your insights and think youre incredibly smart henry moved his mouth to say yes but no word issued from his breath his lips do you realize how utterly pathetic you are truly henry wiped at his mouth why i told you why me why involve me i thought i could just write the papers with you and then when our predictions came true wed be a success together i didnt know id have to run the show handle the money recruit the night road proper but it was all my idea so the prince wanted me involved i couldnt say no i thought it would just be us together in the thinktank not us together in the night road henry drove onto a highway that snaked through the northern suburbs of paris luke couldnt look at him it was as though hed glanced into a well and seen bodies piled and rotting in the water a sickening sight that would haunt him forever hellfire its bombs isnt it with snow involved snow made a lot of bombs theyve been planted in six cities planted where the cars phone rang mouser henry whispered tell him you saw me dead henry glanced at him i want him to think im dead henry answered the phone he kept it on speaker mouser sounded impatient well what happened you won mouser you won luke dead i saw it myself lying in the street his fathers people same excellent anything else no mouser hung up no goodbyes where are these bombs henry ill tell you if we can make a deal henry gave him a sidelong glance and if you kill me you wont get your dad or aubrey back whats the deal mouser resents my efforts to protect you hes going to kill me i feel sure and take control of the night road entirely i want immunity i want protection i cant really give that to you quicksilver is more than that office in paris or drummond in new york they can protect you i want protection all right it will be a wave of bombings a hundred and forty a hundred and forty bombs my god where what cities he thought of the map of the previous attacks would they strike the same areas or entirely different ones when im safe ill tell you not before henry glanced at his watch you better hurry mousers moving your father and aubrey in the next hour describe where theyre being held henry remained silent and it was only when luke shifted position to slice at him again that he said dont be an idiot if you want them out you need me i cant go in there bloodied theyll know something is wrong start using your brain luke he reached out grabbed lukes wrist squeezed released it you hate me fine were still stuck together in this mess you should tell me what you plan to do marching in with a knife on me buys you nothing true i need a gun glove compartment luke opened it fished out a small beretta he checked it was loaded he didnt say thank you tell me what the plan is henry said i just gave you a gun were going to go in and im killing mouser he has hired men with him you have no chance i want you alive luke look at me i raised you for gods sakes i dont see tears in your eyes i dont cry you know that thanks but ill handle it myself where are they the prince has a compound just outside paris i drove like the devil to get there in time to try and stop the bomber or to make sure his work was done you know thats not true if you believe i want you dead stab me right now do it kill me i need you breathing henry he thought of the words of chicagochris now luke was the one trying to earn admittance to the club youre my golden ticket a stone wall surrounded the compound the home beyond looked like a chateau grand but slightly shabby the landscaping had been ripped up around the house but not replaced giving the house the air of neglect three miles away was a former french air force base used as a hub by travport for its legitimate courier service the prince he owns travport through a series of limited partnerships and he put you in touch with eric luke remembered the photos in erics room at his parents house him posing with a businessman type in the shimmer of the desert yes henry paused eric did banking for him when he worked on overseas projects mouser will fly us back on a travport jet with the princes permission easier with prisoners youre an idiot to try this not asking your opinion luke said from the back seat henry had given him a basic layout of the compound in the center was the old small chateau that the princes money had renewed from ruin behind it was a large barn a guest house beyond that was another house and that was where warren dantry and aubrey perrault were now being held or so henry said but henry was the king of lies guards two remaining now that quicksilvers paris base is gone and presumably the remains of quicksilver scattered with it i suspect that the guards will not have further reinforcements im going to shoot the guards luke said if you give me away ill shoot you too is it liberating to order me about henry sounded almost amused the spine henry is where ill put the bullet if you survive a nurse will wipe your chin and change your diaper he knew henry well enough to know the merest thought of a lack of control would frighten him henry steered the car to an entrance the cameras on me he said dont talk i dont want them wondering who youre talking to henry shut up he entered an access code the tasteless baroque iron gates hinged back and swung open with a false grandeur he drove in what will be expected of you luke asked for me to drive to the back house the odds were bad four to one really because henry wasnt on his side henry was only on his own side luke leaned closer to the floor of the sedan keeping a tight grip on the gun fear prickled every bone in his body and then the fear shrank became smaller than himself the sedan stopped were at the house the doors will be locked luke peered over the edge of the back seat the back house was built of stone studded with a few windows do you have a key yes luke i do out henry got out of the car luke walked close behind him and kept the knife at his ribs henry unlocked the door luke pushed him used him as a shield and henry didnt complain they moved from the front door across a living room into a back kitchen the house was silent as a grave or maybe luke thought crazily a grave was louder for a hub of terrorist activity it was far too silent lukes skin tingled as though warmed by fire theyre gone henry said luke listened to the pressing silence of the house he heard a creak on the stairs henry was a liar luke kept his grip on henry but he moved the gun away from his neck kept it aimed over his shoulder he listened for the next creak heard nothing he kicked open a back door yanked henry away from the wash of cool air pulled him back into a corner five seconds later he saw the gun come into sight from around the open door the edge of the barrel then hand gripping the guard then arm luke aimed and fired twice in rapid succession the gun kicked more than he thought it would the first bullet scored the second missed the sleeve halfway up pulled and smoked and produced a bright flush of blood the thug fell against the door and raised the gun but luke threw henry into the thug henry tackled him closing arms around him they staggered into the wall sliding to the floor the thug screamed a babble of rage in his own language he punched henry hard henry went down but clawed at the thugs hair they grappled and luke looked for the shot just shoot them both he thought but he couldnt the thug shoved henry clear sending him crashing into and over a kitchen table the thug slid to the floor his arm bright with blood his hands empty where the hell was the guys gun gone henry that conniving bastard had grabbed it he glanced over at the corner of the kitchen where henry had landed gone luke pulled the trigger the gun jammed or the clip was now empty or he didnt know how to use it the gun was useless the thug launched himself at luke his fingers dug into lukes throat squeezed into the flesh luke gripped his hands tried to pry them free kicked his feet along the floor he was bigger and taller than his attacker but the guy had the advantage of strength and experience the guy slammed lukes head against the tile luke released his futile grip on the guys hands he pushed off the floor came close to the guys chest he threw one arm around in an embrace and as he did so searched along his own waist for the knife hed taken from the restaurant after the bombing luke slid the blade hard into the guys side felt it touch bone and the guy howled no second chance luke stabbed and pulled out again and the wash of blood was warm awful and he drove the blade upwards into the guys throat the guy toppled dying luke kicked out from under him hand slick with blood the breath frozen in his halfstrangled throat he looked up from the dying man and henry stood above him gun in hand no one else is here the house is empty i had to be sure henry said calmly luke stared at him kicked away from the dying terrorist the thug lay on the floor gasping out air and blood a froth on his lips his eyes stretched wide in fear in horror in pain luke couldnt look away it was all the ugliness of slow death laid bare he had killed snow but she had died within seconds it did not matter that the man deserved it luke felt something shift in his chest in his brain watching death unfold the dying man coughed and writhed and his eyes pleaded for a question he couldnt ask unlike the nearinstant deaths he had seen snow chris the poor officer in the chicago alleyway this dying took time they watched his pain for gods sakes put him out of his misery luke said henry glanced at the gun he held and remained motionless the thug coughed and gurgled blood clutching his wound and then he lay still my god that was messy you for sure killed him henry said lets get you washed luke tore his gaze away from the dead man and looked up at henry get me washed like i was a child caught playing in the mud henry held the gun but it wasnt aimed at him you could have shot him luke said you could have ended the fight so i didnt have to so you didnt have to do what was necessary you handled it henrys voice was flat i had to make sure no one else was here attacking our flank everyone else is gone our flank like they were a team the shock of killing had eroded the anger he felt toward henry but henry had the gun luke wondered if henry would shoot him he didnt really know henry he only knew the lie henry was you hung back to see if id win what are you trying to make me into you luke stood and the rage hed felt while stabbing the thug tingled hard in his hands you used me to build your terrorist network you made it so i cant go to the police that i can only turn to you were family he said quietly you involved me only to bind me to you you destroyed my options in life and left me with yours so i would join you it was the horrifying truth that lay between them you think that because you had me build the night road and hide from the police and now made me kill im somehow more like you he spat at henrys shoe we could not be more different youre all the family i have luke the only family ive ever had he mouthed the words with difficulty he tried an expression that was distantly related to a smile i wanted us together what in jail cells if you wanted to be my family you could have had your normal life and let me have mine you dont know what family is i know we dont turn on each other in a time of need henry wet a hand towel tossed it to luke as though cleaning the blood off his hands was as everyday for him as a gardener wiping dirt clearly since mouser and everyone else is gone and this man was waiting here to kill me im on the outs with mouser and the night road henry said you and i have to come to an agreement luke an opportunity confronts us this isnt like weve had a fight about a family issue luke said there is no agreement no opportunity you tell me where mouser took them i assume chicago on a travport plane he thinks he can find the fifty million by tracing erics activities at the private bank that eric worked for the money luke where is that money your soclever bomb destroyed the encrypted file that contained the account info jane decrypted it but i didnt see it and all the evidence was destroyed she said nothing about where it was no only her final words of anger hidden in plain sight that little b if you and i take the fifty million before they do well the night road is done it will fall apart without the promised money and the billionaire wont try and invest in terror again you and i can hide all is well not for my father and aubrey henrys lips thinned laughing but not wanting to show he was laughing because henry had the gun trying to save them is suicide theyll kill you he punched his stepfather hard fist to jaw henry sagged to the floor agony on his face he swung the gun back toward luke but he didnt fire henry said thickly im trying to save you quit lying just quit luke kicked his stepfather hard in the stomach he did it before he even realized it all the air went out of henrys lungs luke hit him again in the face and a great sorrow rose in him for this man whod cared for him been his friend tried to be his father it was all a most vicious damnable lie he could kill him but there were things worse than death tell me where these bombs will be placed or ill kill you theyll change their targets because mousers shut me out theyll be afraid ill cut a deal with the authorities humor me what are the original targets shopping centers striking at ordinary people easy to deploy henry turned his face to the floor but im telling you theyll abandon that plan because theyre under such pressure and so much has gone wrong mouser will think bigger hell make hellfire a memorial to snow he dragged henry into the kitchen he went into the bedroom off the hall a pair of abandoned handcuffs lay on the bed probably used for his father or aubrey he went back into the kitchen henry lay curled on the floor in a fetal position coughing luke dragged henry to the dead guard snapped the cuffs on henrys right wrist reached for the dead mans wrist please luke dont the cuff clicked home ill leave you with your friend you belong together more than you and i do dont i can help you tell me where in chicago mouser will take them youll really let me go yes henry tell me where they will be henry took a hard breath hes got the night road members who are carrying out the attack meeting at aubreys office for hellfire yes the final meeting before they launch the attack take me with you i can talk to them for you ill talk to them luke said youll need a password theyll kill you at first sight without a password henry called let me go and ill tell it to you tell me its determination luke turned and started to walk away you said youd let me go henrys whisper became a wail he raised his arm the dead mans arm went up as well as if in a final plea for mercy i lied he stared at his stepfather if i ever see you again i will kill you luke went upstairs and he washed his face his hair scrubbing the blood away luke in a closet he found a clean shirt and clean pants that nearly fit he dumped his bloody clothes on the floor luke please dont leave me he searched through a briefcase he recognized as henrys there was an electronic passkey on it labeled perrault imports aubreys company he held it up to henry when he reached the bottom of the stairs eric sent it so we would have access when the time came luke didnt speak a word he walked past henry shackled to the dead man and he never looked back at his stepfather luke luke please dont leave me like this luke shut the door behind him luke got into henrys car and drove to charles de gaulle airport when he got there he rebooked his flight on the return ticket he had in the system and changed it to chicago he had a while to wait he found a pay phone and called the police in broken french he told them where they could find one of the people responsible for the afternoons bombing in paris chained to a dead man then he hung up henry he thought would not do prison well on the long flight to chicago luke dantry sat with his battered bruised face behind dark glasses and made his plans filling a little notebook hed bought at the airport with scribblings and put it in his pocket things he wanted to tell his father ask his father if they made it alive through this horror but he also thought about how the night road might use its hundredplus bombs the plane to his horror was grounded in new york due to inclement weather in chicago they sat on the runway for an extra six hours luke felt sick with waiting finally the jet took off again it lost another hour orbiting chicago as the last of a violent storm cell cleared out from the city when he got off the plane into the dark chicago midnight he knew the danger would be after clearing customs after walking toward his rental car that the night road could be waiting for him he could not shake henry from his thoughts let him know abandonment let him feel what it was like to have your life taken from you and wadded up like trash he walked toward the rental car station he kept glancing over his shoulder because whether it was quicksilver or the night road they had known how to find him when he traveled to trap him not again he signed off the rental car paperwork using the false id and credit card drummond had left him he walked out into the parking garage and found his car on the top level the attendant had him inspect the car for preexisting damage and sign the form he barely looked at the rental a lincoln navigator suv and scrawled his false passport name on the paper the attendant said one second ill get you the keys he vanished into the office and when the door opened again it wasnt the attendant it was frankie wu the pilot who had flown him and aubrey to chicago for quicksilver luke froze glanced around all the attendants seemed to have disappeared are you all right frankie wu asked yes hes part of quicksilver hell help me luke thought luke wouldnt have to do this alone lets get in the car frankie said gently we can talk about your dad wu got behind the wheel the passenger seat was full of gear and wu didnt move it so luke sat in the back they got in the navigator drove out of the garage luke noticed that the guard at the exit simply waved frankie wu through no checking of the rental car papers and into the darkness my dad i have to go help my dad luke said you have to help me no luke wu said i have my orders we dont engage with the night road im sorry how did you find me luke asked his voice sounded small in the quiet of the car you traveled under the id drummond got for you we get a ping every time you use it especially after paris was charged with recovering you and the office got blown the hell up anger stormed wus voice then be mad at the night road they attacked your offices in new york and paris weve lost a lot of good people because of you because of a traitor inside quicksilver a british woman who called herself jane i dont know what her real name was but shes the one whos put the night road and quicksilver at each others throats she was behind my kidnapping killing allen clifford in houston trying to steal the night roads money what matters is us surviving another day to fight them theyve taken out two of our centers trying to kill you you matter to them so its my job and my only job to get you somewhere safe another team will arrive soon to help me frustration was a claw in lukes chest that will be too late you have to help me now theyre here theyre planning a massive bombing attack maybe on shopping centers maybe on some other target they have dozens of bombs ready we cant wait we have to act now wu looked at him in the rearview with a gaze cold as chrome i have my orders get you to a safe place where you can be protected and debriefed about the night road you dont understand they have my father they have my friend theyve brought them here i have my orders im sorry im just one guy wu steered onto a highway for gods sakes please arent you part of the cia or something you cant be just one guy left wu didnt answer listen to me he told wu how paris had gone wrong theyre here within our grasp theyve kept my dad alive to pick his brain about quicksilver and dont doubt for a second they will torture him within an inch of his life and theyre keeping aubrey alive to access erics accounts at the bank they think she can help them get inside the bank since shes a client if they find this fifty million they can fund terrorists all over america they can wreak a hell of a lot more havoc terrorism is cheap they can fund an endless chaos far more than weve ever seen before theyve got an arab billionaire investing in domestic terrorism dont you realize how dangerous they are the last thing i can do with quicksilver in tatters is to attack alone you have me you no youre not trained ive held my own it would be suicide then let me call the police luke said tell them tell them what i have information on a massive attack that the night road is planning theyre massing here in chicago to distribute dozens of bombs to their members but i dont know which cities theyll hit no evidence no certainty and you tell them about this you have to tell them about quicksilver im not authorized there could be thousands of lives at stake tens of thousands i dont care if you get exposed im not authorized im just one guy just one guy quicksilver what exactly is it frankie wu said quicksilver just an element just another name for the fleetfooted god mercury yeah you all are real fleet right now luke lifted his saint michaels medal from his shirt you wear one yeah wu said but he didnt take his hands off the wheel why saint michael when people in the roman empire stopped worshipping mercury a number of his temples were rededicated to saint michael a symbol of good overcoming evil his father must have been thinking about starting quicksilver before the book club was wiped out the successor to the book club thinking in new ways about how to fight threats except quicksilver is much more about the fight not the theory what ever you say my father belonged to a secret state department thinktank called the book club so did my stepfather and drummond and the guy who died in houston he waited for frankie wu to speak but wu just arched an eyebrow so the book club kept predicting with accuracy how the world was changing but kept getting ignored and pushed aside due to political concerns no one wanted to give credence to a bunch of eggheads who werent part of the power structure but someone knew about the book club and knew my dad was right maybe someone in state whod moved to cia dad got a better job offer and decided to play dead maybe to do what he was already doing concepting and identifying forthcoming threats the government finally decided to give him a real job one that no one could know about the cia isnt supposed to operate on american soil frankie wu shook his head youre wrong were not cia he thought of the papers hed seen in the paris apartment before the bomb blast incinerated everything the memos the reports all were old state department not new annotated to reflect new thoughts new threats the notes in the memo the relatively minor costs of attacks compared to their huge inflicted economic damage he remembered the account of the pipeline bombing a few days before in canada a few thousand for the explosives but millions in unrecoverable economic damage it was very cheap to wage highly effective war on the infrastructure of civilization what had drummond said quicksilver grew out of our earlier work a new way to fight the bad guys to stop terrorism before it starts to bring new thinking to the problem a new way and after those attacks we are simply supposed to trust that government will do its job protect us that the various governments of the world and their multitude of agencies with their wellintentioned but million moving parts handcuffed by law and order will shift into a hitherto unseen efficiency and suddenly develop all the human capital and infrastructure to fight and eliminate every shadow and nutcase every asshole with a laptop and an agenda uneasiness settled into lukes chest i get it quicksilver is funded by private industry not any government frankie wu met his gaze in the rearview should the worlds most powerful companies just sit and wait to get bloodied again trust law enforcement and the military and the government to win every battle in a shadowy war the good guys need help beyond political donations help not constrained by legal bureaucracy or political expediency that tries to fight global terrorism like its the west versus the soviets or the nazis again its not two armies battling each other its not even nations battling each other its networks of people battling each other wu leaned back which is basically the same as corporate warfare except this time with guns your father was a genius was like he was dead again he was the real brains behind the book club your stepfather was just a wannabe an opportunistic coattailer and while your father took his philosophy to help those who want peace and stability and trade your stepfather signed on with the opposite team henry thinks he predicted luke said and that no one listened to him wu snorted jesus and mary man do you think if anyone had written a detailed forecast of it would have been ignored i saw his paper drummond sent it to us all when this hell started breaking loose as part of a psych profile of henry shawcross it was vague in the extreme he only suggested the possibility that jetliners could be weapons and he never identified specific targets or groups that could carry it out henry shawcross convinced himself and only himself that he was the ignored prophet who could save the world and then got pissed when no one paid attention to him hes crazy wu shook his head with the bad guys is the only place a man like shawcross could be a star quicksilver a private cia for the worlds most powerful corporations luke could see it money funneled carefully into security initiatives or perhaps hidden inside fat corporate contracts or research it would be comparatively cheap insurance fund and field a group of operatives who worked beyond the law to fight terrorists the operations cost might well be less than the economic damage they would suffer in another cataclysmic attack you could hide just enough financing spread out among enough of the companies most sensitive to terrorism and even if such a group couldnt be entirely invisible to governments would they turn a blind eye perhaps governments would even offer subtle or implicit support another army to fight the rising darkness one with its hands not tied so closely by bureaucracy could be a help or a disaster you all arent legal no but until now we get the job done until now luke said now youre all too scared to fight back what exactly were you planning to trade for your dad wu asked they werent just going to give him to you trade get real i was just going to kill them and get my dad and my friend back luke spoke with a matteroffactness that would have appalled him a week ago but he meant what he said are you suicidal no luke said quietly but i helped build the night road my stepfather tricked me but the night road exists as a network because of me i have to stop them we have to think big picture wu said big picture he remembered the words often in his fathers mouth hows this for a big picture they are launching a huge attack he checked his watch the planning meeting for the attack is taking place right now you can decapitate their organization but only if you act luke said his voice rising as you said you helped build the night road you can help us reconstruct whos involved where they might be we cant risk losing you in an illplanned attack on a terrorist cell well hide you find a way to put you to use you know them better than anyone youre a valuable resource which meant walking away from his life leaving it all behind he believed wu quicksilver was not bound by law he had no idea if they were bound by decency although he wanted to believe that any group his father had a hand in founding would be guided by good please please i need to help my dad you may never get another opportunity to take down mouser and thousands of lives are at stake orders say no screw your orders i thought you were supposed to be nimble and fast and responsive well im handing you these assholes on a plate and youre too afraid the stubbornness bureaucratic idiocy frustrated him he gave wu the details of the rendezvous at aubreys office it made no difference i wont tell you a thing i know about the night road unless you help my dad wu acted like he hadnt spoken what is wrong with you youre no better than the bureaucrats you claim to replace luke said at the least call the police or the fbi tell them that mouser and these bad guys will be there wu said that would expose us potentially but ill consider it luke heaved back in the seat in complete frustration he glanced at his watch im only one guy wu had said well so was luke and he had made it this far sometimes one person had to be enough to make a difference he lapsed into silence and conjured up a halfbaked plan drummond told him not to get cornered wu was a trained quicksilver operative and who knew what that meant excia or exfbi or maybe just a guy who wasnt afraid of trouble if he was paid enough he was trained to fight so luke would have to be smarter scare him in a way he wasnt expecting i have a confession he said wu glanced at him what im not going with you luke threw open the navigators door at sixty miles an hour what the hell wu yelled get the hell back in here luke stood in the open doorway firming a grip on the navigators roof wu wasnt slowing down luke hoisted himself onto the cars roof just as wu veered across the lanes of traffic horn blaring as he made for the highway exit are you crazy wu screamed he was forcing his hand at huge risk he could not fight wu without crashing the car and he needed the navigator he just needed wu lured out of it and he didnt have time to wait for wu to get him to a safe house he had to move now the car veered without slowing and wu swerved to avoid another car and the swerve nearly threw luke from the speeding navigator the navigator careened toward the shoulder which was all railing rushing by as the driver sped toward an exit they kissed the railing sparks showering from metal biting against metal erupting past luke the roaring of a honking semi tore within ten feet of them wu veered hard taking the next exit which was in downtown chicago the car peeled through a red light hes not slowing why because dummy he needs the speed to toss you off youve pissed him off and he needs you unable to fight wu aimed the careening navigator toward the parking lot of a convenience store and as he crossed into the lot he slammed hard on the brakes but luke timed wus approach toward the building and slid back in the car through the open window as wu jammed the brakes the brake slam threw luke into the front seats landing him on wus head and sending him crashing into the front windshield which buckled and cracked but the force of his body hammered wu into the steering wheel the car skidded to a stop luke dazed bleeding from the back of his head slid onto wu fumbled for the gun under the jacket his fingers found it and he yanked it free as wu struggled to grasp the weapon himself luke put the gun to wus temple wu went very still stop out leave the keys in the ignition luke ordered you wont shoot me wu said luke moved the gun to the side an inch and fired the bullet shattered the drivers window yes i will wu stepped out of the navigator youre a suicidal idiot yeah luke said im just one guy luke kept the gun aimed at him slid behind the wheel and roared off the wind hard in his face luke knew hed be a cop magnet driving with a shattered windshield but he had to risk it if a cop pulled him over he would tell everything he knew hed given wu information that could stop the attack even if he couldnt calling the police now would take too much time involve too much explanation they might not believe him he was wanted in connection with the death of a chicago cop and the night road could meet and vanish carrying their deadly cargoes to the target cities he had to act now im just one guy wus words but one guy could make a difference in fighting the worst impulses of humanity which was exactly what mouser and the rest of the night road represented take away choices take away security and replace it with a twisted bitter view of the world they thought best it was the common thread linking the ideologies of the various fringes in the night road they wanted the strength they would get that they could only get from creating a grave and constant terror that undermined everyday life he pulled back into the road and headed for aubreys exportimport business the meeting place for hellfire was a small sad decrepit strip mall south of downtown the night was cool and foggy and traffic was light the farther luke drove from the freeway he drove past the strip mall and saw a sign perrault imports aubreys company eric or henry had set up her office space as the departure point for the bombs it made sense an exportimport company would not raise eyes by having a number of vans arriving and departing at odd times frequent deliveries would be seen as a part of that kind of business by any curious neighbors it made him feel sick aubrey pulled into erics world and used this way even if eric had developed real regard for her he had hijacked her life into the darkness just as henry had hijacked his he parked the navigator behind a closed strip mall down the street few streetlights dotted the road he opened his door checked the clip in wus gun there was a silencer mounted on the end hed never fired a gun with one before he tucked the gun in the back of his pants he had the vaguest shape of a plan in his mind but it depended on whether his father and aubrey were being held at the office he thought they would be if they werent then he didnt have to worry about getting them out if they were he would face a choice a hard one hellfire had to be stopped no matter what no matter the cost he crossed the road aubreys import emporium was the anchor at one end of the mall the other stores belonged to an accountant and tax preparer a womens clothing store a nail and hair salon a liquor store everyday america he could see six small moving vans parked in front of perrault imports all from the same rental company he walked toward the vans and twenty feet away from the first one a shadow stepped out from between them a guard he was skinny and looked scared and wasnt much older than luke hi luke said im here to see mouser im late sorry the guard said password he prayed the password henry gave him hadnt been changed determination the guard nodded i got orders to come here and get a van luke said you walked i wanted to be sure cops werent here i look less suspicious walking than driving he stopped now five feet from the guard come here put your hands on the side of the van everybodys got to be frisked he stepped close to luke and luke thought thats the kind of mistake i would have made luke hit him hard once in the face and then pistolwhipped him with the gun the guard collapsed unconscious he didnt need to use a bullet luke searched the guards clothing he found keys with the van rental agency tag on it he tried the door of the nearest van locked he tried the one next to it the door opened the van was empty which meant that some of the bombs at least were still inside he pulled the guard into the van left him there luke figured either he would have won or would be dead by the time the guard was awake he tried the passkey hed taken from henry the door clicked open the first floor was the wholesale showroom and delivery area it was stuffed with decor a melange that showed just how small the world was getting he made his way through a maze of cheap reproductions of african masks and wooden fertility symbols chinese lanterns and asianinspired furniture stacks of china from eastern europe a stairway with a bright orange arrow reading more bargains upstairs he came to the bottom of the stairs and heard voices he thought the bombs would have been delivered here since snow could not distribute them from houston chicago was central but where would they be kept presumably the store had not been open with aubrey gone or she might have told her employees she was closing down if told to by eric aubrey had not mentioned a staff the bombs would have to be kept where they would not elicit surprise or alarm if found he headed toward the back storage area boxes were stacked high in the dim light he saw unopened boxes of chinese figurines knockoffs of swedish furniture a desk a scattering of papers on the bulletin board were photos of eric and aubrey at dinner on a boat walking along lake michigan where would they hide the bombs he started to open a box and thought no mousers here he would have checked them and plus he has to show them how to work the mechanisms whatever packaging the bombs were in theyve been opened he pulled one box open inside were gray uniforms and surgicalstyle masks folded neatly there were a stack of photo ids for a company called readyable at least twenty they were photo ids with bar codes for electronic access the first ones read nyc in small print he thumbed through the others washington atlanta dallas chicago boston each was keyed with the name of the mass transit system in the city dart for dallas marta for atlanta cta for chicago mbta for boston metro for washington mta for new york henry had lied it wasnt shopping centers it was the transit systems a hundredplus bombs for the rail and bus systems in six major cities separated by only a time zone so a simultaneous attack would be devastating thousands would die the sheer number of bombs would ensure a mindnumbing tally on a table across from the desk he saw a halfdozen boxes that had been opened in spanish they said on the side botiquin de primeros auxiolios his spanish wasnt good and he looked inside the box firstaid kits plain white with the red cross on them but larger ones than youd find at a store ones that you might find mounted in a public place like a shopping center or an airport or a school or a commuter rail train or a subway he opened one of the cases inside were nails and screws packed into thin plastic bags so they wouldnt rattle and in the middle was an orange brick like a clay a simple lacing of wires webbing to a cell phone a bomb armed with what he guessed was plastic explosive he set it down carefully and began to count the firstaid kits a dozen to a box and how many opened boxes a dozen he checked kits in each box each contained a bomb a hundred and fortyfour bombs henry had told him the truth about this at least the firstaid kits could be placed on the transit system walls by the uniformed cleaning crews who need only show up plant the bombs and leave the surgical masks used by real cleaning crews would hide their faces since they werent suicide bombers one hundred and fortyfour bombs divided among six cities multiple cars on multiple tracks targeting people simply going to work for the day just like or the madrid or london bombings a dirtcheap attack that would inflict millions even billions in damage to the economy and worse end thousands of innocent lives the thought chilled his blood the scale staggered him the cell phone it had to be the trigger but would the bomb be detonated by calling the cells number no there were far too many of them and he suspected the bombs were supposed to go off simultaneously or as near to it as possible so how then he saw the simple answer his throat went dry he had a choice he could detonate one of the bombs now killing himself but also the best of the night road and his father and aubrey if they were here theyd be dead the plan would be over or there was another possibility and he heard the front door open and shut decision made he didnt have much time what the hell he thought hed be dead in a few minutes anyway a minute later hello luke henry shawcross stepped into the storage room gun leveled at his stepson who knelt by an open file cabinet rifling through its papers luke stood they dont know youre here do they henry said very quietly no you killed the guard outside no hes just beaten up and dumped in a van youre nicer than i am you got out and got here he didnt need to answer henrys question the keys to the handcuffs were in the pocket of the man you killed your grand gesture backfired luke closed his eyes a stupid mistake that was going to cost him dearly i left quickly right after you i commandeered a travport plane directly here henry flicked a smile i knew youd be here playing the wellintentioned idiot what possessed you what were you looking for evidence of where eric hid the money the money why do you care i need it to hide luke put his gaze directly on henrys let henry think if only for a moment that luke was as mercenary as he was since hed hoped luke would become more like him what now henry shrugged hard choices the good things in my life are all gone luke youve betrayed me too you destroyed your life not me no warren destroyed my life it was hard enough to compete with a dead man its much harder when he turns up alive luke said nothing henry cast a gaze around the room as though checking that all was well then settled his stare back on luke youre armed yes turn around hands on the cabinet luke obeyed henry frisked him took his guns theyre upstairs luke said he had an idea if only he could fool henry my dad is up there i think then lets go give you a proper reunion henry said the hate thick in his voice they went up the stairs luke first henrys gun in the small of his back luke felt like he was walking up to a rickety gallows the second floor held import furnishings and mouser and six men sat around a patio table in an assortment of cheap chairs mouser saw luke and henry step inside and he stood what the hell he said a set of clocks stood above his head and luke glanced at them but they were set for a crazy quilt of times he glanced past the table his father and aubrey were bound to chairs aubrey had a black eye his father had been beaten dried blood caking beneath his nose and mouth they both met his gaze what the hell are you doing here mouser said im here to lead the meeting henry said quietly the light above the table was dim and luke thought of the disaffected minds hed studied in his psychology classes trying to decipher their passions the fire bloods of the french revolution plotting the incineration of a social order and the collateral deaths of thousands of innocents john wilkes booth plotting the murder of the singular man who changed the course of history by keeping the union together through a horrible trial by fire the bolsheviks planning their paradise who ended up with a discounted ruin built on the bones of millions you said he was dead mouser stared at luke i lied henry said youre not in command here i am not any more mouser raised a gun and aimed it squarely at henrys head gentlemen henry said you were promised a further and much greater investment in your causes if you accomplished your initial attacks mouser doesnt have your money i do he jerked his head at luke and he does kill us and all investment in the night road stops immediately no one of the men said he had a pinched face that reminded luke of a ferret a tattoo decorating the side of his neck you will give us our money now wrong henry smiled at mouser youre such a punk idiot you cant run this group no one runs us one of the other men said we do what we want we succeed we get funded that was the deal an investment scheme luke thought terrorism incorporated the dark opposite of an idea like quicksilver which was counterterrorism incorporated you wont get the money without us luke said glancing at henry as if saying okay ill play he had no doubt that henry now rejected and bitter would shoot him the moment his usefulness was done his father stared at him but luke couldnt look at him every second ticking by was a heartbeat closer to death but that was true of any ordinary day dont listen to this kid mouser said he and his friend killed our best bomb maker only because she tried to kill me funny how you can put your sorrow about snow aside when it suits you like in paris mousers face purpled his mouth worked were here about the money for a trade luke lied you didnt have the money mouser said eric did jane knew where it was she told me at this both warren and aubrey lifted their heads she used the quicksilver computers to break the encryption that showed where eric hid the fifty million right before genius boy here blew up their offices janes final words echoed in his brain hidden in plain sight that little b eric the bastard who had betrayed her he wished he knew what she meant the answer had to be close he was under enormous pressure where could he have stashed the money hidden in plain sight mousers gun swiveled toward warren and aubrey the money now or they die luke glanced at henry ill give up the money but only to henry that way hes in control my deal is with him he lets my father and aubrey go and i give him the cash we worked it out the lie was thick in his mouth he looked at the men at the table i found you all i pointed you to henry i made the night road happen you owe me at least this deal youre owed nothing the necktattooed man said you have nothing luke said what happens when the rest of the night road finds out that youve cut them off from potential millions to carry out their attacks he pointed at mouser youre responsible and your life will be worthless mousers face purpled in rage none of us are in this for money he all but spat out the last word no but the money makes pretending that youre badasses easier to buy your bomb materials to buy your guns to do your dirty work without it youre nothing but assholes posting bullshit on the internet pretending youre important mouser pointed at henry he wanted you caught dead now youre on his side i never wanted him dead that was your own mistake henry said go do what you have to do for hellfire mouser you stay here well work out the deal for the money they saw our faces mouser said no witnesses this is the only deal im offering luke said then he said the words that he knew would matter most why dont you put it to a vote did you really think i was going to negotiate with you mouser said nearly laughing luke saw sharp glances pass between the night roaders mouser had ignored the call for a vote and he knew that these men leaders of their own movements or cells did not relish taking orders they were used to giving them as captains of their own causes there is no vote i have the access to the funds you do as i say get going you have your instructions yes henry said the men nodded luke noticed they each had sheets of paper outlining the bombs operations schematics of what looked like train tracks photos and bios of train personnel at their target stations get in stash their bombs and get out go you know the plan am central am eastern day after tomorrow henry jerked his head go they had a day to return to the targets to set the bombs no mouser said im running the show do you have fifty million to reward and fund our friends here have you succeeded in anything ive asked you to do shut the hell up mouser henry cleared his throat get going now one of you will find the downstairs guard in your van sleeping off a punch the men filed past luke he could hear the shuffle of their footsteps on the stairs then from downstairs the sounds of them loading the boxes rushing them through the store out of the front door so mouser said it comes to this you left a man to kill me back in paris henry said i didnt he was supposed to keep you under wraps until hellfire was done youre a sorry liar mouser funny isnt it warren dantry said no one was expecting him to speak and they all glanced at him underneath his bruises a smile flickered the grin that luke remembered from fishing trips from sitting with his father on the back porch of their house his voice sounded the same as it had before a gentle baritone older wiser dad luke started a thousand things to say to know rushed through his mind then went blank funny warren dantry repeated you really cant work with anyone can you henry first the good guys now the bad you always screw it up he glanced up at mouser you know he thinks he honestly believes he predicted mouser glanced at henry but you did hardly he didnt warren snorted he would have risen to the highest posts in state or cia if he had instead hes hanging out with these nothings look at me dad luke thought but warren didnt shut up henry said he swiveled the gun back toward warren shut up luke is my son now not yours you gave him up shut the hell up luke you know hes a nothing a nothing warren now met his sons eyes he tried to kill me then your mother dies under questionable circumstances that was an accident henry screamed spittle flying from his mouth was it was it was it warren said in a low hypnotic mumble it was an accident and henry brayed the last word as though a critical string had broken in his voice lets make peace henry mouser said jesus weve come this far let me talk to this bastard pry every secret from quicksilver out of him he wont talk he just needs to die henry said luke look away no luke screamed he lunged toward henry and the world exploded five of the trucks never made it out of the empty lot luke had been busy hed opened each box of bombs picked one of the cellphone timers connected to the semtex explosive and reset it to detonate in fifteen minutes it had taken just enough time to load the trucks light cigarettes and gossip for a minute the suggestion of going back in and killing mouser and henry had been floated and shot down the trucks save one all went up at once in blossoms of fire within three seconds of each other scattering debris and flaming tires and peppering shrapnel the packed screws and twists of metal shredded the terrorists into raggedy men tatters of flesh and bone the truck closest to the store was spared rushed to reset the timers luke had unknowingly pulled the wires loose on the last two cell phones panicked to finish before he was caught and did not realize his mistake the cell phones alarm did not detonate the blasting cap the driver the hardest and oldest of the men the tattooed man responsible for the kansas city high school bombing stared at the wheeling masses of what had been his colleagues trucks he raised himself up from the truck seat his windows were blown out as were the storefronts of the mall one of the trucks crashed in the deserted street burning he could see what was left of one of his fellows halved and crisped twenty feet in front of him the bombs he thought somebody screwed with the bombs for the next ten seconds he waited knowing if his timers had been tampered with hed be dead and there was no point in running but the tampered bombs had all gone off at once none of his boxes had he realized with a certainty that he was safe he wheeled hard out of the lot pressing his foot against the accelerator thinking he would still get the job done the edge of the blasts blew in the curtained windows of the second floor showroom lifted luke off his feet and tossed him into henry luke tumbled over his stepfather and he didnt hear the guns discharge bright balls of aftershock fire blinded his eyes he blinked past the pain resetting the phones timers had worked luke scrambled to his feet he saw aubrey lying on her back still tied in her chair blood on her face his father lay next to her also knocked down by the explosions henry lay dazed the gun that had been in his hands was gone where was it and mouser luke felt heat in a wave flame flickered along the curtains blown in by fiery debris the displays of imports the african masks the wooden tables the bolts of asian cloth burst into flames throughout the room the building was ablaze he didnt see mouser suddenly hands from behind closed around lukes throat he felt a gun barrel jam up against his forehead luke hammered his head back and caught mouser in the face luke twisted and seized the gun in his hands and the fired bullet smashed into the concrete flooring luke nailed mousers jaw with a punch the hardest hed ever thrown he felt the bone crack under his fist felt his own fingers ache from the force of the blow mouser staggered back nearly tripping over henry who was struggling to his feet the flames showed wild hate in mousers eyes and with a howl of pure hatred and rage he launched himself again at luke mouser tackled luke and they skidded and rolled across the concrete toward the nowflaming wall of windows they fought arms grappling mousers face twisted in a naked and bitter hatred he seized lukes throat they bounced off the windows the burning curtains and then fell back onto the floor luke felt his hair his shirt ignite he dropped and rolled to douse the fire clutching mouser close to him mouser screamed as the flames jumped to his own shirt he yanked away both men rolled to the floor luke smothering the blazing patch on his shirt mouser did the same and as he looked up luke kicked him savagely in the face felt the mans nose and teeth break he seized mouser by the throat and belt and threw him toward the wall the pain scouring up his back mouser fell through the burning curtains and the shattered window arms wheeling flames catching him from head to toe slamming headfirst into the asphalt he lay still and through the flames luke could see his neck bent at an utterly impossible angle through the lick of fire and the smear of smoke luke could see five wrecked trucks burning ruptured five not six one got away he screamed and he turned and saw henry fleeing down the stairs no time to chase him luke pulled aubrey to her feet tore the ropes loose from her she helped him free his father dad dad luke screamed his father opened his eyes stared at luke in shock come on aubrey screamed they ran toward the back as the remaining windows exploded from the heat the flames jumping and dancing into the showroom one of them got away luke said no sign of henry in the parking lot they ran warren clutching him close aubrey holding his other hand we have to catch him we dont know which way he would go aubrey started hes going to head for a highway warren said then head west aubrey said closest one they could hear the police and fire sirens wailing cars in the street a few had stopped people staring at the devastation at the car warren embraced luke luke luke he cupped lukes face in his hands tears on his face shivering shaking dad okay were okay but we got to find this guy a thousand words he wanted to hear and say burst in his head his fathers explanations his fathers love his own anger to lash out at his dad for abandoning him but it had to wait the last bomber was running luke remembered his fathers false goodbye his words ill miss you every moment there had been years of missed moments as he stared at warren dantry his father stepped back im sorry im so sorry for what happened to you let that be a start luke got behind the wheel his father next to him aubrey in the back seat my god his dad said my god luke oh christ dad are you all right aubrey you okay yes fine were fine his voice was hoarse blood caked on his lips my god i cant believe you did that the timers yes surprise and pride colored his voice and he let out nearly a choking laugh luke aubrey touching his shoulder squeezing it in reassurance he looked back at her and she was wideeyed shaking rubbing her hands together as if for warmth im glad you came for us she said softly luke roared hard onto the street emergency vehicles were making their way down the road a fire truck police cars he shot past them the navigator was faster than the van the driver would have to be rattled maybe hed dumped the bombs in the lot afraid theyd been set for early explosion as well or maybe the guy had figured hed caught a lucky break and if he didnt blow up when everyone else did he wasnt going to or he didnt care terrorists loved their blazes of supposed glory he shot past the first group of responders and ran four red lights heading up to a hundred miles an hour it was one in the morning and the streets were empty he saw tail lights ahead the only set a small moving van hed caught up with the last bomber he steered with one hand the one with the broken fingers fished out the gun with his hand dad here youre the better shot my hands warren raised them and for the first time luke saw them misshapen several fingers had been broken what those bastards had done to his father he shoved down the accelerator caught up with the moving van dad get in the back his father obeyed sliding over the seat aubrey helping him luke raised his gun came even with the van the bomber leveled a gun fired luke felt the heat of the bullet pass in front of his face like a bolt and he steadied his arm and fired missed he fired again at the same time as the bomber the bombers bullet hammered into the navigators roof two inches from lukes head a black dot of blood appeared above the bombers ear his head jerked the van careened onto the sidewalk it crashed into the front of a closed laundromat sheets of windows shattering luke stopped ran to the van the bomber lolled eyes open dead luke get back here well call the bomb squad theyll know what to do warren called luke ran back to the navigator his father moved into the front seat staring at luke as though hed never seen him before as though looking for traces of the lost boy in the man dad oh god youre okay youre alive all the things luke wanted to say began to bubble up in his chest really alive i know you have a million questions no just one why okay i know but lets go before the police arrive now luke obeyed pulling out onto the road he set the gun down between him and his father he didnt want to touch one ever again he turned onto the highway that led back toward downtown chicago silence filled the space between the three of them a horrible uncomfortable quiet the adrenaline made luke eager to talk but he didnt know what to say aubrey started to speak luke could hear the catch of her breath and then she stopped luke kept his gaze on the black ribbon of the street he found his voice and it was calm so dad why why warren started to answer i know that there is no then he stopped i want to forgive you luke started i just need to understand why he couldnt go on his chest heavy with grief and shock his dad said nothing luke glanced at his father and saw the cool barrel of the gun against the back of his fathers head wheres the money luke aubreys mouth was close to his ear the tickle of her breath froze him what the hell are you doing warren dantry didnt move he glanced over at luke eyes wide in surprise the money id like to know where it is please aubrey sounded steady calm as she had been during the crisis in lincoln park on the jet to new york in urging them toward the car back at the store you and henry said you had it why do you and then he saw it the missing piece if jane had arranged for eric to grab him to ransom aubrey then she would have used a kidnapper to grab aubrey just a man aubrey had said but what if there was no kidnapper the realization fell into his mind all at once the burlap hood she said shed been covered with even after the kidnapper left it hadnt been on the floor or under the bed his wrists after being tied to the bed for several hours were raw he remembered the smoothness of aubreys skin when he unlocked her shackles no one could prove aubrey had ever actually been kidnapped except aubrey shed faked the kidnapping which meant she was in with jane it was you you alone hed said to jane but she hadnt been alone shed had a partner to keep an eye on the progress of the night road not a member but sleeping with a member how had jane ever found out about erics role in the night road in the first place dad did quicksilver suspect eric lindoe of criminal ties he remembered seeing reports about erics bank in his file in the paris office there have been a number of questionable accounts at that bank he said quietly yes weve been watching the bank for a while we sent the same agent to watch this arab prince who seemed interested in financing terrorists he swallowed i think you know her as jane luke glanced back he had to get her to see reason if he told her where he thought the money was shed just kill them both his tongue felt like concrete she said her voice torn with panic i want to know where the money is hidden in plain sight that little b jane had said henry lied he was bluffing you know where it is aubrey insisted you have to tell me her voice cracked what ive been through goddamn it i get the money i wont tell you unless you put the gun down tell me luke now dont pull over keep driving they raced down the highway luke dodging in and out among the scattering of cars you wont believe me luke said his father raised his mauled hands his eyes wide in pain as aubrey dug the barrel into the back of his head you just got your dad back aubrey said ill take him away tell me i thought eric was using you but you were using him luke said an exportimport business lots of overseas money coming in payments going out a perfect way for eric to stream in money using your accounts he thought he was using you to a degree at first but you wanted him to use you you thought he might be involved in money for the night road did he pillow talk you tell you what he was up to no jane and i figured it out on our own from her spying on the prince for quicksilver jane worked for us but aubrey doesnt warren said the navigator hit a bump and the gun jiggled against his fathers head we aimed me straight at eric she said her voice calmer i got into his bed i got into his head after i was kidnapped i told him that these quicksilver people might be willing to help us hide he bought it luke watched her in the rearview you were never kidnapped it was just a lure to make him act and to keep you clean and blameless and above suspicion she made a noise in her throat aubrey you dont have to hurt anyone yes i do the money jane and i worked on it for months where is it luke saw a sedan speeding up behind them fast i dont have it i dont know where he moved it youre lying tell me or your father dies luke looked up at his father his father shook his head dont tell her dont let these people win that little b jane hadnt meant eric shed meant aubrey jane thought aubrey had betrayed her the speeding car passed on the drivers side edging lukes navigator henry driving fast a gun in his hand oh jesus luke said slamming the navigator against henrys sedan the navigator rocked hard and warren spun in his seat grabbing at aubreys gun tell me where you put the money now she screamed dont shoot him luke screamed back eric hid it in plain sight in your accounts at his bank aubrey fired the bullet caught his father in the chest with a horrifying blast and he collapsed against the passenger door luke slammed on the brakes and the car slid into a long skid henrys car rode alongside them henry standing up through the sunroof as the cars spun on sheer momentum not bothering to steer aiming luke felt the warmth of aubreys barrel against his neck and then the blast was loud in the car the navigator skidded to a stop as the sedan hit its side luke realized he was still breathing he could see his father slumped in his seat eyelids fluttering his chest a wet wreckage of blood he wrenched around aubrey lay on the seat bleeding from the side of her throat eyes open mouth slack luke looked to his left and saw henry his car stopped parallel against lukes positioned just behind the drivers door henry still stood in the sunroof a gun in his hand now aimed at luke luke had no gun my last favor to you henry said do you know where the money is luke shook his head no he lied no they were the ten longest seconds of lukes life they stared into each others eyes the gun between them like a longhidden truth henry lowered the gun dont come after me luke could see for the first time in the scant light of the highway lights tears brimming in henrys eyes i will not treat you like family again henry slid down into the drivers seat roared his battered sedan off into the night and out of sight taking the first exit ramp luke felt for his fathers pulse weak erratic he saw a call button on the navigator and jabbed it instead of an emergency service he heard frankie wu say where the hell are you dad needs a doctor hes shot tell me where a hospital is we got a doctor hes been shot he needs surgery you cant take him to a hospital wu said too many questions i want you to do exactly as i say luke follow my directions and luke dantry no longer the most dangerous man in the world listened and drove off in the dark night holding his fathers hand begging him to not leave him again a week later northern michigan luke decided was one of the nicest places you could go quietly insane he sat on the porch watching the light dapple the waters of the lake and he folded the newspaper and tucked it where his father would not see it the story had dominated headlines but not in the way he had expected a group of suspected extremists had been found dead after a series of explosions two had been identified a dentist from milwaukee known for sending threatening letters to oil companies and a pharmacist from a small city in tennessee the same town where the e coli scare had grabbed headlines the previous week another man a known neonazi from kansas city had been found several blocks away with two dozen bombs hidden in first aid kits and a uniform and passes that would have given him access to the atlanta rail system a man who had been dishonorably discharged from the military lay dead on the pavement and recent information via anonymous phone calls tied him to an attack on an office building in new york fbi officials suggested the group had planned a bombing in atlanta and most likely in other cities as well but it had gone wrong theories as to why were as plentiful as the clouds in the sky editorials painted a grim picture of domestic groups of disaffection arming themselves with foreignbought weaponry no mention of fifty million dollars in terrorist seed money or a connection to the shooting deaths of a crazy artist a chicago police officer or eric lindoe and no mention of networks called the night road or quicksilver aubrey perrault found her rest in the quiet of an unmarked grave in this northern michigan enclave a quiet luke guessed she hadnt known in her life every move she had made urging eric to flee with them sticking close to luke as he trailed the money even as his father told them buying time for jane to find luke by insisting to mouser that luke didnt have the money all of it an attempt by her or jane to gain control of the funds the bombing investigators found fifty million wired into her accounts as part of the bombing investigation the fbi had seized the money aubrey was connected the investigators concluded with the terrorist attack now the forensic accountants were trying to trace the money back to its source anonymous tips kept pointing back to a prominent arab prince luke watched the dappled light play on the water how many names did aubrey have how many lies did she live luke wondered he had been smart enough to fight the night road and win but too blind to see she was no victim she had been one of the architects of this carnage it was strange to know she had stuck with him simply to help her find the money if hed found the hidden thumb drive in her presence back in chicago she would have killed him and taken the file to jane or if shed checked her account balances she would have seen the money and she could have taken it and run to jane they would have won luke watched frankie wu on the fishing pier reeling in an empty line the past few days had been spent fretting over his father recovering from surgery in a private clinic north of chicago one under quicksilver control that alone had made him realize the extent of this socalled loose network they had money they had resources but so did henry have you decided his father wheeled his chair close to the door pale gaunt but he would recover the doctors said on dinner i say steak we deserve a steak now that youre up and chewing sounds good but i thought more about what your future holds im still a missing person you dont have to be dont i i hardly imagine henry or the night road are going to let me walk back into my old life we can do a great deal for you now luke watched his father who was not looking at him instead studying his hands folded in his lap he felt a weird whirlpool of love and hate rise in his chest hed spent the past days watching his father sleep recover slowly regain his strength and had not yet heard an answer to his one question in gratitude for all youve done luke quicksilver can help you back into your old life is that how you make amends to me make all the trouble go away you brought a lot of the trouble on me dad this war has been building my whole life and i had no idea that i might be pulled into it other than you giving me a saint michaels medal and warning me i might one day have to fight were you assuming id simply follow in your footsteps thanks a lot warren studied his splinted fingers as though he hadnt heard the sharpness of lukes words erics already been identified as a money launderer since his murder he screwed around with the audit records trying to cover his transfers we can fake computer records make it look like you had previous but innocent contact with him that he thought you knew about his crimes and that he was pursuing you we can clear your name in every way that its been muddied given time make up a lie so i can live a truth my old life wasnt truth it was all in the service of henry because you left me behind you abandoned us now his father met his steady gaze i never would have picked this life for you luke it was why i left why you lied lets call it what it is anger that he couldnt control steamed up in him before he was shot they hadnt had enough time to talk only for his father to say he was sorry fine why i lied but i thought i was doing the best for you and your mom i didnt want anyone coming after me to come after you they killed everyone i worked with do you think they would have hesitated to kill my family they it was just henry dad he chased you off you let him and he slid into your life for gods sakes i didnt know it was henry behind the attempt on me i swear for the past week luke had danced around this truth unwilling to discuss it until his father was stronger what you said about mom that he killed her i will always believe he had a hand in her death your mother was a smart woman she could have found out what he was doing confronted him knowing what we know now he must have killed her but she would have never been in danger if youd had the guts to stick around if youd put us ahead of your work warren reached for his sons hand but luke stepped back a horrible silence settled between them for a long minute broken only by the hiss of the wind in the oaks do you want me to be dead luke warren asked i can be its what you know you never have to see me again you dont get off that easy dad you did this so you could go fight this secret war save people prove all your theories i have to matter as much as your work does i fought that war when you couldnt without any warning but the war has to be worth fighting for a personal reason i have to matter to you why didnt you stay in new york meet me there instead of relying on drummond to take care of me if id been willing to hide under a false name like drummond offered would you even have stepped forward to let me know you were alive it wouldnt have been necessary luke shook his head even when i was in danger you put quicksilvers interests first no not true warren paused as though he didnt know what words to use just say what you want to say dad i was afraid of your hate i could bear being away from you but i couldnt bear knowing you hated me the silence between them was thick for a long moment i dont hate you i dont know that i understand you yet i may never but i will try but im not sure what my next step is warren cleared his throat you can go back try to have a normal life again or i cant i can either hide or i can help i dont want to hide but i dont like the idea of being drafted into quicksilver and im not sure im ready to forgive you much less work with you i deserve every bit of anger you want to shove down my throat ill take it luke and never argue that i could have made a better choice but i want you to know what you accomplished the lives you saved you make me so proud luke watched the water he had wanted to delve into minds defined by destructive purpose he had but now he understood less about them than he had before no amount of study or theorizing had prepared him for henry or mouser or snow yet he had survived had he known at some level this wind of change was blowing had he sensed even as a boy that his father carried many secrets his search for his father his delving into the terrorist mind his surprising determination to carry the battle forward where did that come from inside him all of this horror had burned away the old luke and left a different man standing if he tried to go back to a normal life he would spend his life looking over his shoulder wars did not last forever what if quicksilver was the best hope of bringing this battle to a rapid conclusion be drafted do a tour of duty help his father stop henry and make him pay for what hed done knowing what we know now he must have killed her he must have luke thought of the time hed spent comforting henry reassuring him a cold anger ignited in his chest what would you have me do i think you could handle field assignments given time warren cleared his throat risked a smile but you would be brilliant as a terrorism profiler you sifted through thousands of people to find the night road you could find them again you could help us find the next wave of terrorists long before they strike identify them perhaps find ways to keep them from embracing violence or alienate them from groups like the night road henry had tried to make him believe in his old innocence that the world was not dangerous that the worlds most dangerous people were on the other side of the glass in their own distant wonderland and he knew now they were everywhere waiting hoping to strike and the world needed ordinary people like himself to stand and fight and to win that war to not be afraid to live for a while in the secret wilds of the world he didnt have to forgive his father right now that would come in time but he could take the anger he felt channel it into kicking down the right doors he could make a difference well find henry and the rest of the night road luke said you and me ill stay for a while and he sat with his father and he watched the sunset slide over the lake creating a pool of a thousand colors the first of the new memories the next day on the internet encoded welcome to the new site for the night road we have had a number of setbacks but our strength as a network is our ability to recover quickly and with great nimbleness despite the recent and unfortunate delays i have relocated overseas and i have acquired new funding to share based on appropriate projections of economic and mortal damage that you can inflict as well i have secured powerful friends around the world sympathetic to our cause i expect further funding from them so we can all pursue our plans know that we face a real danger the corporate titans the globalizer the powermongers the moneylenders of our enemies have formed their own version of the cia they are called quicksilver and they will be hunting us this is not the time to hide not the time to lose nerve this is a time to rise and fight like we have never fought before to join together in common cause to know our enemy the one who will engage us first even if in secret and to destroy him utterly i made a mistake that i must confess i placed my hopes in the wrong person this caused our network no permanent or troubling harm but it has reinforced to me that we must be careful in choosing our allies in recognizing each other in allowing no one to infiltrate us instructions on proposals to be sent to me will follow shortly those who accomplish their initial missions will qualify for further investment so think big people think very big
