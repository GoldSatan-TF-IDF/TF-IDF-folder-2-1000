sent the many sturdy souls of warriors to hades and left their bodies as spoil for all the dogs and birds of prey homer iliad it is well that war is so terrible or we should grow too fond of it robert e lee here at the dawn of the third millennium ce we dont like to think about actually fighting wars we hope weve outgrown them for more than half a century weve had the chance to wreck our civilization and we havent taken it this says something good about us as a species maybe even something surprisingly good perhapsjust perhapswe arent really so stupid as we often give signs of being mankind has always hated war and yet it has always fascinated us too as long as weve written weve written about it this is quite literally true the epic of gilgamesh goes back to the earliest days of our literacy and is among other things the story of warfare the iliad the foundation stone of all greek literature centers on the siege of troy and the great struggle between akhilleus and hektor the aeneid beowulf the norse sagas the chanson de rolandall stories of battle of warriors and were still writing fiction about war in and out of science fiction to this day why for the two cents its worth heres my answer fiction is about character under stress what we do when the heat is on reveals far more about us than how we behave in ordinary times what comes close to putting so much stress on the character fictional or otherwise as nearly getting killed as samuel johnson said when a man knows he is to be hanged in a fortnight it concentrates his mind wonderfully well i admit there is one other stress that does the same thing love and of course what passes between man and woman or less often between man and man or between woman and woman is the other enduringly popular theme of fiction and to this mix science fiction adds a couple of other interesting riffs gadgetry as interesting as the writer can come up with and sometimes alien beings also as interesting as the writer can likewise the granddaddy of stories of this type h g wellss the war of the worlds actually saw print in but since it set the stage for so much that came afterward i dont see how i can possibly neglect mentioning it here wells was far from the only author interested in the effects of the industrial revolution on warfare yet to come in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries there was in fact a small boom in what we would now call technothrillers stories examining nearfuture wars with emphasis on the newfangled machines that would make it different from anything that had gone before ancestors of tom clancy one might say a fair number of these tales are collected in a fascinating volume called the tale of the next great war edited by i f clarke in in his story the trenches a british army officer capt c e vickers foretold the invention of the tank his colleague major later major general sir ernest swintonalso a writer of such talesmust surely have seen this piece when world war i broke out he was one of the people who helped devise the actual armored fighting vehicle here fiction may well have influenced later fact others of that period who worked in this subgenre include sir arthur conan doyle jack london and a a milne who is better knownand deservedly sofor winniethepooh than for tales such as his story the secret of the army aeroplane drawing a hard and fast line between technothrillers and science fiction proper has never been easy and probably never will be the one id try to make is that technothrillers tend to be interested in gadgetry for its own sake while science fiction examines not only the machinery but its influence on the society thats invented it and if people are now lining up to tear me rhetorical limb from limb well so be it after the experience of world war i far fewer people were interested in predicting what a second world war might be like the short answerdreadfulseemed obvious to everyone and indeed everyone was right instead conflicts set in distant times and against strange aliens took pride of place for a while john w campbell later the tremendously influential editor of astounding and its later incarnation analog was one of the champions of this invent a weapon today mass produce it tomorrow and use it to beat the enemy the day after school of writing a writer who stuck closer to home and one whose influence on the entire field of science fiction was also incalculably large was robert a heinlein his novellas if this goes on and solution unsatisfactory and his novel sixth column all written before the american entry into world war ii sixth column springing in part from a campbell idea remain readableand in printtoday while so much of the fiction of two generations ago has fallen by the wayside solution unsatisfactory is an early and remarkably prescient attempt to define a problem that has plagued us ever since how do you deal with the specter of atomic weaponry the solutions we have worked out are as unsatisfactory as the one heinlein proposedbut as i said before so far weve been both smarter and luckier than we might have been as a graduate of the naval academy heinlein spoke with peculiar authority on matters military the brute fact of the atomic bomb hit popular consciousness hard after nuclear war and its aftermath became a common theme in science fiction two early examples were poul andersons stories later collected in the pasteup novel twilight world and those of henry kuttner collected as mutant anderson in particular would go on to have a long and amazingly successful career frequently revisiting military themes in a variety of contexts most often in his future history peopled by such swashbucklers as nicholas van rijn and dominic flandry another writer who did likewise was h beam piper till his unfortunate and premature death in the mid s his series of paratime stories of alternate history particularly his fine last work lord kalvan of otherwhen revolve around matters military so does the elaborate future history he built up including such novels as the cosmic computer and space viking which combines themes from medieval european warfare and the rise of hitler in a most striking way heinlein of course did not disappear after the war either in his juvenile novels what would now be known as yas such as between planets space cadet citizen of the galaxy and red planet military themes either dominate or play a strong subordinate role and in starship troopers he produced a novel of military fiction that remains intensely controversial more than forty years after its publication was made into an extraordinarily bad movie and spawned at least two fine novels of direct rebuttal gordon r dicksons soldier ask not and joe w haldemans the forever war no mean feat another work from about the same period that should not pass unmentioned is christopher anvils novella pandoras planet later expanded into a novel of the same name anvil most often published in astounding and analog took a contrarian sardonic and often very funny look at things and pandoras planet shows him at the top of his form with bumbling invading aliens trying to deal with humans who are both smarter than they are and except for lacking starships more technologically advanced too during the s and s no doubt under the influence of the vietnam war interest in military science fiction waned the military generally came under a cloud during those turbulent decades one interesting exception to the rule here is the rise in those same decades of fantasy series chronicling enormous wars most often against the power of evil the archetype of course is j r r tolkiens the lord of the rings i think such works became popular for a couple of reasons first who was good and who was not was very explicitly definedwhich was not always the case in either the real world or the more realistic forms of science fictionand second the stories were set in worlds so far removed from our own as to distance the readers from the everyday mundanities of life fred saberhagens berserker series of sciencefiction adventure tales solved the problem of good guys and bad guys by making the enemy a fleet of robot starships programmed to root out life wherever it might be encountered a theme also used earlier not long after the end of world war ii by theodore sturgeon in there is no defense in the men in the jungle norman spinrad solved it by not solving it as far as anyone can tell there are no heroes in the story only villains of one stripe or anotheragain a motif disturbingly close to real life there is a certain irony in the fact that in the s military science fiction revived not so much in book form but in the moviesirony because hollywood a traditionally liberal place has not always taken kindly to soldiers and their trade but blood and thunder have played very important roles in both the star wars and star trek sagas not least because matters military tend to create strong blacks and whites without shades of gray and also because they lend themselves to spectacular special effects written science fiction is often thoughtprovoking filmed scifi is more often jawdropping the two usually appeal to different audiences which aficionados of the written variety sometimes forget to their periland frustration the last two decades of the twentieth century saw a revival of written military science fiction jerry pournelle a korean war veteran has written a number of stirring novels with strong military themes both with larry niven notably in the mote in gods eye a firstcontact story and footfall a fine tale of alien invasion and by himself david drake who like joe w haldeman saw the elephant in vietnam has contributed a gritty realism to the field in his futurehistory stories such as hammers slammers and thanks to his strong background in ancient history and classics with tales such as ranks of bronze and birds of prey drake and s m stirling have also collaborated on a series of novels set in the far future but based on the career of the byzantine emperor justinians great marshal belisarius on his own hook stirling specializes in alternate histories with a strong military flavor the draka universe surely as unpleasant a dystopia as has burst from anyones word processor and the stories begun with island in the sea of time which drop the island of nantucket back to bce and involve the inhabitants in military affairs up to their necks lois mcmaster bujolds series of novels mostly based on the fragile both in ego and in corpus hero miles vorkosigan have deservedly attracted a large following miles subverts hierarchies and discipline but is remarkably effective in spite ofor because ofthat his adventures also have in them a strong humorous strain not often seen in military science fiction where drake and stirling have projected the career of an actual historical figure into the future david webers series of novels about honor harrington has many analogies to the fictional seafaring adventures of horatio hornblower set in napoleonic times many fans of military science fiction are also passionate aficionados of the tales penned by c s forester patrick obrian and others who work in the small crowded world of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries i dont precisely know why this should be so but that its so seems indisputable its an enthusiasm i share myself one of the advantages of writing an introduction such as this is that i can also subject my readers to a twoparagraph commercial for my own work as an escaped byzantine historian ive used byzantium as a base for my videssos universe with the time of troubles series being based on the eventful career of the emperor herakleios the tale of krispos on the reigns of basil the macedonian and john tzimiskes an advantage to fiction is that one can mix and match to suit oneself and the videssos cycle on the chaos surrounding the battle of manzikert switching from fantasy to science fiction ive imagined timetraveling south africans interfering in the american civil war in the guns of the south an alien invasion during world war ii in the worldwar series and the united states and confederate states on opposite sides of the european alliance system during the late nineteenth century and world war i in how few remain and the books of the great war series elizabeth moon is a former member of the marine corps who has made a name for herself with both militaryoriented fantasy and science fiction her worlds combine gritty realism and striking wit no one else currently working in the field has a similar voice the sten novels from the team of allan cole and chris bunch combine military affairs and political intrigue the teamunfortunately no longer working togetherhad a striking mix of talents bunch having served as a member of a longrange reconnaissance patrol in vietnam and cole being the son of a prominent cia official their hero named for a british submachine gun of world war ii vintage is every bit as deadly as his prototype and much less likely to go to pieces in action technothrillers are vulnerable to events in the world around them with the collapse of the soviet union truly worldshattering ones became much harder to write indeed the entire genre suffered something of a collapse however pleasant a muchreduced likelihood of armageddon may be for the world at large its not far from hell for those who made a living with stories about such catastrophes military science fiction seems less vulnerable to events in the world around it technothrillers by their very nature are limited to the near future while military science fiction can and does span all of space and time if the near future looks peaceful theres always the further future to exploreeither that or a twisted past in which things went differently from the way they turned out in real history one area where written military science fiction differs from what vast audiences see on the silver screen is that it demands more from those who pursue it poul anderson a winner of multiple hugo and nebula awards poul anderson has written dozens of novels and hundreds of short stories since his science fiction debut in his longrunning technic history saga a multibook chronicle of interstellar exploration and empire

fiction has been collected in several volumes notably the queen of air and darkness and other stories all one universe and the best of poul anderson poul anderson his excellency mkatze unduma ambassador of the terrestrial federation to the double kingdom was not accustomed to being kept waiting but as the minutes dragged into an hour anger faded before a chill deduction in this bleakly clockbound society a short delay was bad manners even if it were unintentional but if you kept a man of rank cooling his heels for an entire sixty minutes you offered him an unforgivable insult rusch was a barbarian but he was too canny to humiliate earths representative without reason which bore out everything that terrestrial intelligence had discovered from a drunken junior officer weeping in his cups because old earth civilization was going to be attacked and the campus where he had once learned and loved would be scorched to ruin by his fire gunsto the battle plans and annotations thereon which six men had died to smuggle out of the royal war collegeand now this degradation of the ambassador himselfeverything fitted the margrave of drakenstane had sold out civilization unduma shuddered beneath the iridescent cloak embroidered robe and ostrichplume headdress of his rank he swept the antechamber with the eyes of a trapped animal this castle was ancient dating back some eight hundred years to the first settlement of norstad the grim square massiveness of it fused stone piled into a turreted mountain was not much relieved by modern fittings tableservs loungers drapes jewel mosaics and biomurals only clashed with those fortress walls and ringing flagstones fluorosheets did not light up all the dark corners there was perpetual dusk up among the rafters where the old battle banners hung a dozen guards were posted around the room in breastplate and plumed helmet but with very modern blast rifles they were identical sevenfoot blonds and none of them moved at all you couldnt even see them breathe it was an unnerving sight for a civilized man unduma snubbed out his cigar swore miserably to himself and wished he had at least brought along a book the inner door opened on noiseless hinges and a shavepate officer emerged he clicked his heels and bowed at unduma his lordship will be honored to receive you now excellency the ambassador throttled his anger nodded and stood up he was a tall thin man the relatively light skin and sharp features of bantu stock predominant in him earths emissaries were normally chosen to approximate a local ideal of beautyhard to do for some of those weird little cultures scattered through the galaxyand norstadostarik had been settled by a rather extreme caucasoid type which had almost entirely emigrated from the home planet the aide showed him through the door and disappeared hans von thoma rusch margrave of drakenstane lawman of the western folkmote hereditary guardian of the white river gates et cetera et cetera et cetera sat waiting behind a desk at the end of an enormous blackandred tile floor he had a book in his hands and didnt close it till unduma sandals whispering on the great chessboard squares had come near then he stood up and made a short ironic bow how do you do your excellency he said i am sorry to be so late please sit such curtness was no apology at all and both of them knew it unduma lowered himself to a chair in front of the desk he would not show temper he thought he was here for a greater purpose his teeth clamped together thank you your lordship he said tonelessly i hope you will have time to talk with me in some detail i have come on a matter of grave importance ruschs right eyebrow tilted up so that the archaic monocle he affected beneath it seemed in danger of falling out he was a big man stiffly and solidly built yellow hair cropped to a wiry brush around the long skull a scar puckering his left cheek he wore army uniform the gray highcollared tunic and oldfashioned breeches and shiny boots of his planet the trident and suns of a primary general a sidearm its handle worn smooth from much use if ever the iron barbarian with the iron brain had an epitome thought unduma here he sat well your excellency murmured ruschthough the harsh norron language did not lend itself to murmursof course ill be glad to hear you out but after all ive no standing in the ministry except as unofficial advisor and please unduma lifted a hand must we keep up the fable you not only speak for all the landed warloadsand the norsamurai are still the most powerful single class in the double kingdombut you have the general staff in your pouch and ah you are well thought of by the royal family i think i can talk directly to you rusch did not smile but neither did he trouble to deny what everyone knew that he was the leader of the fighting aristocracy friend of the widowed queen regent virtual stepfather of her eightyearold son king hjalmarin a word that he was the dictator if he preferred to keep a small title and not have his name unnecessarily before the public what difference did that make ill be glad to pass on whatever you wish to say to the proper authorities he answered slowly pipe that was an order to his chair which produced a lit briar for him unduma felt appalled this series ofinformalitieswas like one savage blow after another till now in the threehundredyear history of relations between earth and the double kingdom the terrestrial ambassador had ranked everyone but god and the royal family no human planet no matter how long sundered from the main stream no matter what strange ways it had wandered failed to remember that earth was earth the home of man and the heart of civilization no human planethad norstadostarik then gone the way of kolresh biologically no thought unduma with an inward shudder nor culturallyyet but it shrieked at him from every insolent movement and twist of words that rusch had made a political deal well said the margrave unduma cleared his throat desperately and leaned forward your lordship he said my embassy cannot help taking notice of certain public statements as well as certain military preparations and other matters of common knowledge and items your spies have dug up drawled rusch unduma started my lord my good ambassador grinned rusch it was you who suggested a straightforward talk i know earth has spies here in any event its impossible to hide so large a business as the mobilization of two planets for war unduma felt sweat trickle down his ribs there isyouyour ministry has only announced it is aa defense measure he stammered i had hopedfrankly yes till the last minute i hoped youyour people might see fit to join us against kolresh there was a moments quiet so quiet thought unduma a redness crept up ruschs cheeks the scar stood livid and his pale eyes were the coldest thing unduma had ever seen then slowly the margrave got it out through his teeth for a number of centuries your excellency our people hoped earth might join them what do you mean unduma forgot all polished inanities rusch didnt seem to notice he stood up and went to the window come here he said let me show you something the window was a modern inset of clear invisible plastic a broad sheet high in the castles infamous witch tower it looked out on a black sky the sun was down and the glacial fortyhour darkness of northern norstad was crawling toward midnight stars glittered mercilessly keen in an emptiness which seemed like crystal which seemed about to ring thinly in contracting anguish under the cold ostarik the companion planet stood low to the south a gibbous moon of steely blue it never moved in that sky the two worlds forever faced each other the windy white peaks of one glaring at the warm lazy seas of the other northward a great curtain of aurora flapped halfway around the cragged horizon from this dizzy height unduma could see little of the town drakenstane a few highpeaked roofs and small glowing windows lamps lonesome above frozen streets there wasnt much to see anyhowno big cities on either planet only the small towns which had grown from scattered thorps each clustered humbly about the manor of its lord beyond lay winter fields climbing up the valley walls to the hard green blink of glaciers it must be blowing out there he saw snowdevils chase ghostly across the bluetinged desolation rusch spoke roughly not much of a planet weve got here is it out on the far end of nowhere a thousand lightyears from your precious earth and right in the middle of a glacial epoch have you ever wondered why we dont set up weathercontrol stations and give this world a decent climate well began unduma of course the exigencies of of war rusch sent his hand upward in a chopping motion to sweep around the alien constellations among them burned polaris less than thirty parsecs away huge and cruelly bright we never had a chance every time we thought we could begin there would be war usually with kolresh and the labor and materials would have to go for that once about two centuries back we did actually get stations established it was even beginning to warm up a little kolresh blasted them off the map norstad was settled eight hundred years ago for seven of those centuries weve had kolresh at our throats do you wonder if weve grown tired my lord ii can sympathize said unduma awkwardly i am not ignorant of your heroic history but it would seem to meafter all earth has also fought at a range of a thousand lightyears jeered rusch the forgotten war a few underpaid patrolmen in obsolete rustbucket ships to defend unimportant outposts from sporadic kolreshite raids we live on their borders it would certainly appear your lordship that kolresh is your natural enemy said unduma as indeed it is of all civilization of homo sapiens himself what i cannot credit are the ah the rumors of an er alliance and why shouldnt we snarled rusch for seven hundred years weve held them at bay while your precious socalled civilization grew fat behind a wall of our dead young men the temptation to recoup some of our losses by helping kolresh conquer earth is very strong you dont mean it the breath rushed from undumas lungs the other mans face was like carved bone dont jump to conclusions he answered i merely point out that from our side theres a good deal to be said for such a policy now if earth is prepared to make a different policy worth our whiledo you understand nothing is going to happen in the immediate future you have time to think about it i would have tocommunicate with my government whispered unduma of course said rusch his bootheels clacked on the floor as he went back to his desk ive had a memorandum prepared for you an unofficial informal sort of protocol points which his majestys government would like to make the basis of negotiations with the terrestrial federation ah here he picked up a bulky folio i suggest you take a leave of absence your excellency go home and show your superiors this ah ultimatum said unduma in a sick voice rusch shrugged call it what you will his tone was empty and remote as if he had already cut himself and his people out of civilization as he accepted the folio unduma noticed the book beside it the one rusch had been reading a local edition of schakspier badly printed on sleazy paper but in the original old anglic odd thing for a barbarian dictator to read but then rusch was a bit of an historical scholar as well as an enthusiastic kayak racer meteor polo player chess champion mountain climber andand allaround scoundrel norstad lay in the grip of a tenthousandyear winter while ostarik was a heaven of blue seas breaking on warm island sands nevertheless because ostarik harbored a peculiarly nasty plague virus it remained an unattainable paradise in the sky till a bare two hundred fifty years ago then a research team from earth got to work found an effective vaccine and saw a mountain carved into their likeness by the norron folk it was through such meansand the sheer weight of example the liberty and wealth and happiness of its peoplethat the civilization centered on earth had been propagating itself among colonies isolated for centuries there were none which lacked reverence for earth the mother earth the wise earth the kindly none but kolresh which had long ceased to be human ruschs private speedster whipped him from the icicle walls of festning drakenstane to the rose gardens of sorgenlos in an hour of hellbat haste across vacuum but it was several hours more until he and the queen could get away from their courtiers and be alone they walked through geometric beds of smoldering blooms under songbirds and fronded trees while the copper spires of the little palace reached up to the evening star and the hourslong sunset of ostarik blazed gold across great quiet waters the island was no more than a royal retreat but lately it had known agonies queen ingra stooped over a mutant rose tiger striped and a foot across she plucked the petals from it and said close to weeping but i liked unduma i dont want him to hate us hes not a bad sort agreed rusch he stood behind her in a black dress uniform with silver insignia like a formal version of death hes more than that hans he stands for decencynorstad froze our souls and ostarik hasnt thawed them i thought earth might her voice trailed off she was slender and dark still young and her folk came from the rainy dales of norstads equator a farm race with gentler ways than the miners and fishermen and hunters of the redhaired ice ape who had bred rusch in her throat the norron language softened to a burring music the drakenstane men spat their words out roughedged earth might what rusch turned a moody gaze to the west lavish more gifts on us we were always proud of paying our own way oh no said ingra wearily after all we could trade with them furs and minerals and so on if ninety per cent of our production didnt have to go into defense i only thought they might teach us how to be human i had assumed we were still classified homo sapiens said rusch in a parched tone oh you know what i mean she turned on him violet eyes suddenly aflare sometimes i wonder if youre human margrave hans von thoma rusch i mean free free to be something more than a robot free to raise children knowing they wont have their lungs shoved out their mouths when a kolreshite cruiser hulls one of our spaceships what is our whole culture hans a layer of brutalized farmhands and factory workersserfs a top crust of heelclattering aristocrats who live for nothing but war a little folk art folk music folk saga full of blood and treachery where are our symphonies novels cathedrals research laboratorieswhere are people who can say what they wish and make what they will of their lives and be happy rusch didnt answer for a moment he looked at her unblinking behind his monocle till she dropped her gaze and twisted her hands together then he said only you exaggerate perhaps its still the basic truth rebellion rode in her voice its what all the other worlds think of us even if the democratic assumptionthat the eternal verities can be discovered by counting enough noseswere true said rusch you cannot repeal eight hundred years of history by decree no but you could work toward it she said i think youre wrong in despising the common man hanswhen was he ever given a chance in this kingdom we could make a beginning now and earth could send psychotechnic advisors and in two or three generations what would kolresh be doing while we experimented with forms of government he laughed always kolresh her shoulders slim behind the burningred cloak slumped kolresh turned a hundred hopeful towns into radioactive craters and left the gnawed bones of children in the fields kolresh killed my husband like a score of kings before him kolresh blasted your family to ash hans and scarred your face and your soul she whirled back on him fists aloft and almost screamed do you want to make an ally of kolresh the margrave took out his pipe and began filling it the saffron sundown reflected off the ocean to his face gave him a metal look well he said weve been at peace with them for all of ten years now almost a record cant we find allies real ones im sick of being a figurehead id befriend ahuramazda new mars lagrangewe could raise a crusade against kolresh wipe every last filthy one of them out of the universe now whos a heelclattering aristocrat grinned rusch he lit his pipe and strolled toward the beach she stood for an angry moment then sighed and followed him do you think it hasnt been tried he said patiently for generations weve tried to build up a permanent alliance directed at kolresh what temporary ones we achieved have always fallen apart nobody loves us enoughand since weve always taken the heaviest blows nobody hates kolresh enough he found a bench on the glistening edge of the strand and sat down and looked across a steady march of surf turned to molten gold by the low sun and the incandescent western clouds ingra joined him i cant really blame the others for not liking us she said in a small voice we are overmechanized and undercultured arrogant tactless undemocratic hardboiledoh yes but their own selfinterest they dont imagine it can happen to them replied rusch contemptuously and there are even prokolresh elements here and there he raised his voice an octave oh my dear sir my dear margrave what are you saying why of course kolresh would never attack us they made a treaty never to attack us ingra sighed forlornly rusch laid an arm across her shoulders they sat for a while without speaking anyway said the man finally kolresh is too strong for any combination of powers in this part of the galaxy we and they are the only ones with a military strength worth mentioning even earth would have a hard time defeating them and earth of course will lean backward before undertaking a major war she has too much to lose its so much more comfortable to regard the kolreshite raids as mere piracies the skirmishes as police actions she just plain will not pay the stiff price of an army and a navy able to whip kolresh and occupy the kolreshite planets and so it is to be war again ingra looked out in desolation across the sea maybe not said rusch maybe a different kind of war at leastno more black ships coming out of our sky he blew smoke for a while as if gathering courage then spoke in a quick impersonal manner look here we norrons are not a naval power its not in our tradition our navy has always been inadequate and always will be but we can breed the toughest soldiers in the known galaxy in unlimited numbers we can condition them into fighting machines and equip them with the most lethal weapons living flesh can wield kolresh of course is just the opposite space nomads small population able to destroy anything their guns can reach but not able to dig in and hold it against us for seven hundred years we and they have been the elephant and the whale neither could ever win a real victory over the other war became the normal state of affairs peace a breathing spell because of the mutation there will always be war as long as one single kolreshite lives we cant kill them we cant befriend themall we can do is to be bled white to stop them a wind sighed over the slow thunder on the beach a line of sea birds crossed the sky thin and black against glowing bronze i know said ingra i know the history and i know what youre leading up to kolresh will furnish transportation and naval escort norstadostarik will furnish men between us we may be able to take earth we will said rusch flatly earth has grown plump and lazy she cant possibly rearm enough in a few months to stop such a combination and all the galaxy will spit on our name all the galaxy will lie open to conquest once earth has fallen how long do you think we would last riding the kolresh tiger i have no illusions about them my dear but neither can i see any way to break this eternal deadlock in a fluid situation such as the collapse of earth would produce we might be able to create a navy as good as theirs theyve never yet given us a chance to build one but perhaps perhaps not i doubt very much it was a meteor which wrecked my husbands ship five years ago i think kolresh knew of his hopes of the shipyard he wanted to start and murdered him its probable said rusch and you would league us with them ingra turned a colorless face on him im still the queen i forbid any further consideration of thisthis obscene alliance rusch sighed i was afraid of that your highness for a moment he looked gray tired you have a veto power of course but i dont think the ministry would continue in office a regent who used it against the best interests of she leaped to her feet you wouldnt oh youd not be harmed said rusch with a crooked smile not even deposed youd be in a protective custody shall we say of course his majesty your son would have to be educated elsewhere but if you wish her palm cracked on his face he made no motion iwont veto ingra shook her head then her back grew stiff your ship will be ready to take you home my lord i do not think we shall require your presence here again as you will your highness mumbled the dictator of the double kingdom though he returned with a bitter word in his mouth unduma felt the joy the biological rightness of being home rise warm within him he sat on a terrace under the mild sky of earth with the dear bright flow of the zambezi river at his feet and the slim towers of capital city rearing as far as he could see each gracious in its own green park the people on the clean quiet streets wore airy blouses and colorful kiltsnot the trousers for men anklelength skirts for women which muffled the sad folk of norstad and there was educated conversation in the gentle tierrans language music from an open window laughter on the verandas and children playing in the parks freedom law and leisure the thought that this might be rubbed out of history that the robots of norstad and the snakesouled monsters of kolresh might tramp between broken spires where starved earthmen hid was a tearing in unduma he managed to lift his drink and lean back with the proper casual elegance no sir he said they are not bluffing ngu chilongo premier of the federation parliament blinked unhappy eyes he was a small grizzled man and a wise man but this lay beyond everything he had known in a long lifetime and he was slow to grasp it but surely he began surely thisthis rusch person is not insane he cannot think that his two planets with a population of what is it perhaps one billion can overcome four billion terrestrials there would also be several million kolreshites to help reminded unduma however they would handle the naval end of it entirelyand their navy is considerably stronger than ours the norron forces would be the ones which actually landed to fight the air and ground battles and out of those paltry one billion rusch can raise approximately one hundred million soldiers chilongos glass crashed to the terrace what its true sir the third man present mustafa lefarge minister of defense spoke in a miserable tone its a question of every ablebodied citizen male and female being a trained member of the armed forces in time of war virtually everyone not in actual combat is directly contributing to some phase of the efforta civilian economy virtually ceases to exist theyre used to getting along for years at a stretch with no comforts and a bare minimum of necessities his voice grew sardonic by necessities they mean things like food and ammunitionnot say entertainment or cultural activity as we assume a hundred million whispered chilongo he stared at his hands why thats ten times our total forces which are illtrained illequipped and illregarded by our own civilians pointed out lefarge bitterly in short sir said unduma while we could defeat either kolresh or norstadostarik in an allout warthough with considerable difficultybetween them they can defeat us chilongo shivered unduma felt a certain pity for him you had to get used to it in small doses this fact which civilization screened from earth that the depths of hell are found in the human soul that no law of nature guards the upright innocent from malice but they wouldnt dare protested the premier our friendseverywhere all the humancolonized galaxy will wring its hands and send stiff notes of protest said lefarge then theyll pull the blankets back over their heads and assure themselves that now the big bad aggressor has been sated this noteof ruschs chilongo seemed to be grabbing out after support while the world dropped from beneath his feet sweat glistened on his wrinkled brown forehead their termssurely we can make some agreement their terms are impossible as youll see for yourself when you read said unduma flatly they want us to declare war on kolresh accept a joint command under norron leadership foot the bill andno but if we have to fight anyway began chilongo it would seem better to have at least one ally has earth changed that much since i was gone asked unduma in astonishment would our people really consent to thisthis extortionletting those hairy barbarians write our foreign policy for uswhy jumping into war making the first declaration ourselves its unconstitutional its uncivilized chilongo seemed to shrink a little no he said no i dont mean that of course its impossible better to be honestly defeated in battle i only thought perhaps we could bargain we can try said unduma skeptically but i never heard of hans rusch yielding an angstrom without a pistol at his head lefarge struck a cigar inhaled deeply and took another sip from his glass i hardly imagine an alliance with kolresh would please his own people he mused scarcely said unduma but theyll accept it if they must oh no chance for us to get him overthrownassassinated even not to speak of let me explain hes only a petty aristocrat by birth but during the last war with kolresh he gained high rank and a personal following of fanatically loyal young officers for the past few years since the king died hes been the dictator hes filled the key posts with his men hard able and unquestioning everyone else is either admiring or cowed give him credit hes no megalomaniache shuns publicitybut that simply divorces his power all the more from responsibility you can measure it by pointing out that everyone knows he will probably ally with kolresh and everyone has a nearly physical loathing of the ideabut there is not a word of criticism for rusch himself and when he orders it they will embark on kolreshite ships to ruin the earth they love it could almost make you believe in the old myths whispered chilongo about the devil incarnate well said unduma this sort of thing has happened before you know hmmm lefarge sat up unduma smiled sadly historical examples he said theyre of no practical value today except for giving the cold consolation that were not uniquely betrayed what do you mean asked chilongo well said unduma consider the astropolitics of the situation around polaris and beyond lies kolresh territory where for a long time they sharpened their teeth preying on backward autochthones at last they started expanding toward the richer humansettled planets norstad happened to lie directly on their path so norstad took the first blowand stopped them since then its been seven hundred years of stalemated war oh naturally kolresh outflanks norstad from time to time seizes this planet in the galactic west and raids that one to the north fights a war with one to the south and makes an alliance with one to the east but it has never amounted to anything important it cant with norstad astride the most direct line between the heart of kolresh and the heart of civilization if kolresh made a serious effort to bypass norstad the norrons couldand woulddisrupt everything with an attack in the rear in short despite the fact that interstellar space is threedimensional and enormous norstad guards the northern marches of civilization he paused for another sip it was cool and subtle on his tongue a benediction after the outworld rotgut hmmm i never thought of it just that way said lefarge i assumed it was just a matter of barbarians fighting each other for the usual barbarian reasons oh it is i imagine said unduma but the result is that norstad acts as the shield of earth now if you examine early terrestrial historyand rusch who has a remarkable knowledge of it stimulated me to do soyoull find that this is a common thing a small semicivilized state out on the marches holds off the enemy while the true civilization prospers behind it assyria warded mesopotamia rome defended greece the welsh border lords kept england safe the transoxanian tartars were the shield of persia prussia blocked the approaches to western europeoh i could add a good many examples in every instance a somewhat backward people on the distant frontier of a civilization receive the worst hammerblows of the really alien races beyond the wild men who would leave nothing standing if they could get at the protected cities of the inner society he paused for breath and so asked chilongo well of course suffering isnt good for people shrugged unduma it tends to make them rather nasty the marchmen react to incessant war by becoming a warrior race uncouth peasants with an absolute government of ruthless militarists nobody loves them neither the outer savages nor the inner polite nations and in the end theyre all too apt to turn inward their military skill and vigor need a more promising outlet than this grim business of always fighting off an enemy who always comes back and who has even less to steal than the sentry culture so assyria sacks babylon rome conquers greece percy rises against king henry tamerlane overthrows bajazet prussia clanks into france and norstadostarik falls on earth finished lefarge exactly said unduma its not even unprecedented for the border state to join hands with the very tribes it fought so long percy and owen glendower for instancethough in that case i imagine both parties were considerably more attractive than hans rusch or klerak belug what are we going to do chilongo whispered it toward the blue sky of earth from which no bombs had fallen for a thousand years then he shook himself jumped to his feet and faced the other two im sorry gentlemen this has taken me rather by surprise and ill naturally require time to look at this norron protocol and evaluate the other data but if it turns out youre righthe bowed urbanelyas im sure it will yes said unduma in a tautening voice why then we appear to have some months at least before anything drastic happens we can try to gain more time by negotiation we do have the largest industrial complex in the known universe and four billion people who have surely not had courage bred out of them well build up our armed forces and if those barbarians attack well whip them back into their own kennels and kick them through the rear walls thereof i hoped youd say that breathed unduma i hope well be granted time lefarge scowled i assume rusch is not a fool we cannot rearm in anything less than a glare of publicity when he learns of it whats to prevent him from cementing the kolresh alliance and attacking at once before were ready their mutual suspiciousness ought to help said unduma ill go back there of course and do what i can to stir up trouble between them he sat still for a moment then added as if to himself till we do finish preparing we have no resources but hope the kolreshite mutation was a subtle thing it did not show on the surface physically they were a handsome people running to white skin and orange hair over the centuries thousands of norron spies had infiltrated them and frequently gotten back alive what made such work unusually difficult was not the normal hazards of impersonation but an ingrained reluctance to practice cannibalism and worse the mutation was a psychic twist probably originating in some obscure gene related to the endocrine system it was extraordinarily hard to describeevery categorical statement about it had the usual quota of exceptions and qualifications but one might to a first approximation call it extreme xenophobia it is normal for homo sapiens to be somewhat wary of outsiders till he has established their bona fides it was normal for homo kolreshi to hate all outsiders from first glimpse to final destruction naturally such an instinct produced a tendency to inbreeding which lowered fertility but systematic execution of the unfit had so far kept the stock vigorous the instinct also led to strongarm rule within the nation to nomadism where a planet was only a base like the oasis of the ancient bedouin essential to life but rarely seen to a cult of secrecy and cruelty a religion of abominations to an ultimate goal of conquering the accessible universe and wiping out all other races of course it was not so simple nor so blatant among themselves the kolreshites doubtless found a degree of tenderness and fidelity visiting on neutral planetsie planets which it was not yet expedient to attackthey were very courteous and had an account of defending themselves against one unprovoked aggression after another which some found plausible even their enemies stood in awe of their personal heroism nevertheless few in the galaxy would have wept if the kolreshites all died one rainy night hans von thoma rusch brought his speedster to the great whaleback of the battleship it lay a lightyear from his sun hidden by cold emptiness the coordinates had been given him secretly together with an invitation which was more like a summons he glided into the landing cradle under the turrets of guns that could pound a moon apart and let the mechanism suck him down below decks when he stepped out into the high coldly lit debarkation chamber an honor guard in red presented arms and pipes twittered for him he walked slowly forward a big man in black and silver to meet his counterpart klerak belug the overman of kolresh who waited rigid in a bloodcolored tunic the cabin bristled around him with secret police and guns rusch clicked heels good day your dominance he said a faint echo followed his voice for some unknown reason this folk liked echoes and always built walls to resonate belug an aging giant who topped him by a head raised shaggy brows are you alone your lordship he asked in atrociously accented norron it was understood that you could bring a personal bodyguard rusch shrugged i would have needed a personal dreadnought to be quite safe he replied in fluent kolra so i decided to trust your safe conduct i assume you realize that any harm done to me means instant war with my kingdom the broad wrinkled lionface before him split into a grin my representatives did not misjudge you your lordship i think we can indeed do business come the overman turned and led the way down a ramp toward the guts of the ship rusch followed enclosed by guards and bayonets he kept a hand on his own sidearmnot that it would do him much good if matters came to that events were approaching their climax he thought in a cold layer of his brain for more than a year now negotiations had dragged on hemmed in by the requirement of secrecy weighted down by mutual suspicion there were only two points of disagreement remaining but discussion had been so thoroughly snagged on those that the two absolute rulers must meet to settle it personally it was belug who had issued the contemptuous invitation and he rusch had come tonight the old kings of norstad wept worms in their graves the party entered a small luxuriously chaired room there were the usual robots for transcription and reference purposes and there were guards but overman and margrave were essentially alone belug wheezed his bulk into a seat smoke drink i have my own thank you rusch took out his pipe and a hip flask that is scarcely diplomatic rumbled belug rusch laughed id always understood that your dominance had no use for the mannerisms of civilization i daresay wed both like to finish our business as quickly as possible the overman snapped his fingers someone glided up with wine in a glass he sipped for a while before answering yes by all means let us reach an executive agreement now and wait for our hirelings to draw up a formal treaty but it seems odd sir that after all these months of delay you are suddenly so eager to complete the work not odd said rusch earth is rearming at a considerable rate shes had almost a year now we can still whip her but in another six months well no longer be able to give her automated factories half a year beyond that and shell destroy us it must have been clear to you sir that after the earth ambassadorwhats his name undumaafter he returned to your planets last year he was doing all he could to gain time oh yes said rusch making offers to me and then haggling over thembrewing trouble elsewhere to divert our attentiona gallant effort but it didnt work frankly your dominance youve only yourself to blame for the delays for example your insisting that earth be administered as kolreshite territory my dear sir exploded belug it was a talking point only a talking point any diplomatist would have understood but you took six weeks to study it then offered that preposterous counterproposal that everything should revert to you loot and territory bothwhy if you had been truly willing to cooperate we could have settled the terms in a month as you like your dominance said rusch carelessly its all past now there are only these questions of troop transport and prisoners then were in total agreement klerak belug narrowed his eyes and rubbed his chin with one outsize hand i do not comprehend he said and neither do my naval officers we have regular transports for your men nothing extraordinary in the way of comfort to be sure but infinitely more suitable for so long a voyage thanthan the naval units you insist we use dont you understand a transport is for carrying men or cargo a ship of the line is to fight or convoy you do not mix the functions i do your dominance said rusch as many of my soldiers as possible are going to travel on regular warships furnished by kolresh and there are going to be double kingdom naval personnel with them for liaison but belugs fist closed on his wineglass as if to splinter it why he roared my representatives have explained it a hundred times said rusch wearily in blunt language i dont trust you ifoh let us say there should be disagreement between us while the armada is en routewell a transport ship is easily replaced after its convoy vessels have blown it up the fighting craft of kolresh are a better hostage for your good behavior he struck a light to his pipe naturally you cant take our whole fiftymillionman expeditionary force on your battle wagons but i want soldiers on every warship as well as in the transports belug shook his ginger head no come now said rusch your spies have been active enough on norstad and ostarik have you found any reason to doubt my intentions bearing in mind that an army the size of ours cannot be alerted for a given operation without a great many people knowing the fact yes yes grumbled belug granted he smiled a sharp flash of teeth but the upper hand is mine your lordship i can wait indefinitely to attack earth you cant eh rusch drew hard on his pipe in the last analysis even dictators rely on popular support my intelligence tells me you are rapidly losing yours the queen has not spoken to you for a year has she and there are many norrons whose first loyalty is to the crown as the thought of war with earth seeps in as men have time to comprehend how little they like the idea time to see through your present antiterrestrial propagandathey grow angry already they mutter about you in the beer halls and the officers clubs they whisper in ministry cloakrooms my agents have heard your personal cadre of young key officers are the only ones left with unquestioning loyalty to you let discontent grow just a little more let open revolt break out and your followers will be hanged from the lamp posts you cant delay much longer rusch made no reply for a while then he sat up his monocle glittering like a cold round window on winter i can always call off this plan and resume the normal state of affairs he snapped belug flushed red war with kolresh again it would take you too long to shift gearsto reorganize it would not our war college like any other has prepared military plans for all foreseeable combinations of circumstances if i cannot come to terms with you plan no soandso goes into effect and obviously it will have popular enthusiasm behind it he nailed the overman with a fishpale eye and continued in frozen tones after all your dominance i would prefer to fight you the only thing i would enjoy more would be to hunt you with hounds seven hundred years have shown this to be impossible i opened negotiations to make the best of an evil bargainsince you cannot be conquered it will pay better to join with you on a course of mutually profitable imperialism but if your stubborness prevents an agreement i can declare war on you in the usual manner and be no worse off than i was the choice is therefore yours belug swallowed even his guards lost some of their blankness one does not speak in that fashion across the negotiators table finally only his lips stirring he said your frankness is appreciated my lord some day i would like to discuss that aspect further as for now thoughyes i can see your point i am prepared to admit some of your troops to our ships of the line after another moment still sitting like a stone idol but this question of returning prisoners of war we have never done it i do not propose to begin i do not propose to let poor devils of norrons rot any longer in your camps said rusch i have a pretty good idea of what goes on there if were to be allies ill want back such of my countrymen as are still alive not many are still sane belug told him deliberately rusch puffed smoke and made no reply if i give in on the one item said belug i have a right to test your sincerity by the other we keep our prisoners ruschs own face had gone quite pale and still it grew altogether silent in the room very well he said after a long time let it be so without a word major othkar graaborg led his company into the black cruiser the words came from the spaceport where police held off a hooting hissing rockthrowing mob it was the first time in history that norron folk had stoned their own soldiers his men tramped stolidly behind him up the gangway and through the corridors among the helmets and packs and weapons racketing boots and clashing body armor their faces were lost they were an army without faces graaborg followed a kolreshite ensign who kept looking back nervously at these hereditary foes till they reached the bunkroom it had been hastily converted from a storage hold and was scant cramped comfort for a thousand men all right boys he said when the door had closed on his guide make yourselves at home they got busy opening packs spreading bedrolls on bunks immediately thereafter they started to assemble heavy machine guns howitzers even a nuclear blaster you there the accented voice squawked indignantly from a loudspeaker in the wall i see that i got video you not put guns together here graaborg looked up from his inspection of a live fission shell obscenity you he said pleasantly who are you anyway i executive officer i tell captain go right ahead my orders say that according to treaty as long as we stay in our assigned part of the ship were under our own discipline if your captain doesnt like it let him come down here and talk to us graaborg ran a thumb along the edge of his bayonet a wolfish chorus from his men underlined the invitation no one pressed the point the cruiser lumbered into space rendezvoused with her task force and went into nonspatial drive for several days the norron army contingent remained in its den more patient with such stinking quarters than the kolreshites could imagine anyone being nevertheless no spaceman ventured in there meals were fetched at the galley by norron squads graaborg alone wandered freely about the ship he was joined by commander von brecca of ostarik the head of the double kingdoms naval liaison on this ship a small band of officers and ratings housed elsewhere they conferred with the kolreshite officers as the necessity arose on routine problems rehearsal of various operations to be performed when earth was reached a month hencebut they did not mingle socially this suited their hosts the fact is the kolreshites were rather frightened of them a spaceman does not lack courage but he is a gentleman among warriors his ship either functions well keeping him clean and comfortable or it does not function at all and he dies quickly and mercifully he fights with machines at enormous ranges the ground soldier muscle in mud whose ultimate weapon is whetted steel in bare hands has a different kind of toughness two weeks after departure graaborgs wrist chronometer showed a certain hour he was drilling his men in full combat rig as he had been doing every day in spite of the narrow quarters tenshun the order flowed through captains lieutenants and sergeants the bulky mass of men crashed to stillness major graaborg put a small pocket amplifier to his lips all right lads he said casually assume gas masks radiation shields all gun squads to weapons now lets clean up this ship he himself blew down the wall with a grenade being perhaps the most thoroughly trained soldiers in the universe the norron men paused for only one amazed second then they cheered with death and hell in their voices and crowded at his heels little resistance was met until graaborg had picked up von breccas naval command the crucial ones who could sail and fight the ship the kolreshites were too dumbfounded thereafter the nomads rallied and fought gamely graaborg was handicapped by not having been able to give his men a battle plan he split up his forces and trusted to the intelligence of the noncoms his faith was not misplaced though the ship was in poor condition by the time the last kolreshite had been machinegunned graaborg himself had used a bayonet with vast satisfaction mkatze unduma entered the office in the witch tower you sent for me your lordship he asked his voice was as cold and bitter as the gale outside yes please be seated margrave hans von thoma rusch looked tired i have some news for you what news you declared war on earth two weeks ago your army cant have reached her yet unduma leaned over the desk is it that youve found transportation to send me home somewhat better news your excellency rusch leaned over and tuned a telescreen a background of clattering robots and frantically busy junior officers came into view then a face entered the screen young and with more life in it than unduma had ever before seen on this sullen planet central data headquartersoh yes your lordship boyishly against all rules weve got her the bheoka just called inshes ours hmmm good rusch glanced at unduma the bheoka is the superdreadnought accompanying task force two carry on with the news yes sir shes already reducing the units we failed to capture admiral sorrens estimates hell control force two entirely in another hour bulletin just came in from force three admiral gundrup killed in fighting but vice admiral smitt has assumed command and reports threefourths of the ships in our hands hes delaying fire until he sees how it goes aboard the rest also never mind said rusch ill get the comprehensive report later remind staff that for the next few hours all command decisions had better be made by officers on the spot after that when we see what weve got broader tactics can be prepared if some extreme emergency doesnt arise itll be a few hours before i can get over to hq yes sir sir imay i say so might the young norron have addressed a god all right son youve said it rusch turned off the screen and looked at unduma do you realize whats happening the ambassador sat down his knees seemed all at once to have melted what have you done it was like a stranger speaking what i planned quite a few years ago said the margrave he reached into his desk and brought forth a bottle here your excellency i think we could both use a swig authentic terrestrial scotch ive saved it for this day but there was no glory leaping in him it is often thus you reach a dream and you only feel how tired you are unduma let the liquid fire slide down his throat you understand dont you said rusch for seven centuries the elephant and the whale fought without being able to get at each others vitals i made this alliance against earth solely to get our men aboard their ships but a really large operation like that cant be faked it has to be genuinethe agreements the preparations the propaganda everything only a handful of officers men who could be trusted toto infinityhis voice cracked over and unduma thought of war prisoners sacrificed hideous casualties in the steel corridors of spaceships norron gunners destroying kolreshite vessels and the survivors of norron detachments which failed to capture themonly a few could be told and then only at the last instant for the rest i relied on the quality of our troops theyre good lads every one of them and therefore adaptable theyre especially adaptable when suddenly told to fall on the men theyd most like to kill he tilted the bottle afresh its proving expensive he said in a slurred hurried tone it will cost us as many casualties no doubt as ten years of ordinary war but if i hadnt done this there could easily have been another seven hundred years of war couldnt there couldnt there have been as it is weve already broken the spine of the kolreshite fleet she has plenty of ships yet to be sure still a menace but crippled i hope earth will see fit to join us between them earth and norstadostarik can finish off kolresh in a hurry and after all kolresh did declare war on you had every intention of destroying you if you wont help well we can end it by ourselves now that the fleet is broken but i hope youll join us i dont know said unduma he was still wobbling in a new cosmos were not aa hard people you ought to be said rusch hard enough anyway to win a voice for yourselves in whats going to happen around polaris important frontier polaris yes said unduma slowly there is that it wont cause any hosannahs in our streets butyes i think we will continue the war as your allies if only to prevent you from massacring the kolreshites they can be rehabilitated you know i doubt that grunted rusch but its a detail at the very least theyll never be allowed weapons again he raised a sardonic brow i suppose we too can be rehabilitated once you get your peace groups and psychotechs out here no doubt youll manage to demilitarize us and turn us into good plump democrats all right unduma send your civilizing missionaries but permit me to give thanks that i wont live to see their work completed the earthman nodded rather coldly you couldnt blame rusch for treachery callousness and arrogancehe was what his history had made himbut he remained unpleasant company for a civilized man i shall communicate with my government at once your lordship and recommend a provisional alliance the terms to be settled later he said i will report back to you as soon asah where will you be how should i know rusch got out of his chair the winter night howled at his back i have to convene the ministry and make a public telecast and get over to staff andno the devil with it if you need me inside the next few hours ill be at sorgenlos on ostarik but the matter had better be urgent philip k dick regarded as one of the most important writers of science fiction in the twentieth century

publication of his many mainstream novels several volumes of his collected letters and the fivevolume collected stories of philip k dick philip k dick the russian soldier made his way nervously up the ragged side of the hill holding his gun ready he glanced around him licking his dry lips his face set from time to time he reached up a gloved hand and wiped perspiration from his neck pushing down his coat collar eric turned to corporal leone want him or can i have him he adjusted the view sight so the russians features squarely filled the glass the lines cutting across his hard somber features leone considered the russian was close moving rapidly almost running dont fire wait leone tensed i dont think were needed the russian increased his pace kicking ash and piles of debris out of his way he reached the top of the hill and stopped panting staring around him the sky was overcast with drifting clouds of gray particles bare trunks of trees jutted up occasionally the ground was level and bare rubblestrewn with the ruins of buildings standing out here and there like yellowing skulls the russian was uneasy he knew something was wrong he started down the hill now he was only a few paces from the bunker eric was getting fidgety he played with his pistol glancing at leone dont worry leone said he wont get here theyll take care of him are you sure hes got damn far they hang around close to the bunker hes getting into the bad part get set the russian began to hurry sliding down the hill his boots sinking into the heaps of gray ash trying to keep his gun up he stopped for a moment lifting his field glasses to his face hes looking right at us eric said the russian came on they could see his eyes like two blue stones his mouth was open a little he needed a shave his chin was stubbled on one bony cheek was a square of tape showing blue at the edge a fungoid spot his coat was muddy and torn one glove was missing as he ran his belt counter bounced up and down against him leone touched erics arm here one comes across the ground something small and metallic came flashing in the dull sunlight of midday a metal sphere it raced up the hill after the russian its treads flying it was small one of the baby ones its claws were out two razor projections spinning in a blur of white steel the russian heard it he turned instantly firing the sphere dissolved into particles but already a second had emerged and was following the first the russian fired again a third sphere leaped up the russians leg clicking and whirring it jumped to the shoulder the spinning blades disappeared into the russians throat eric relaxed well thats that god those damn things give me the creeps sometimes i think we were better off before if we hadnt invented them they would have leone lit a cigarette shakily i wonder why a russian would come all this way alone i didnt see anyone covering him lieutenant scott came slipping up the tunnel into the bunker what happened something entered the screen an ivan just one eric brought the viewscreen around scott peered into it now there were numerous metal spheres crawling over the prostrate body dull metal globes clicking and whirring sawing up the russian into small parts to be carried away what a lot of claws scott murmured they come like flies not much game for them anymore scott pushed the sight away disgusted like flies i wonder why he was out there they know we have claws all around a larger robot had joined the smaller spheres a long blunt tube with projecting eyepieces it was directing operations there was not much left of the soldier what remained was being brought down the hillside by the host of claws sir leone said if its all right id like to go out there and take a look at him why maybe he came with something scott considered he shrugged all right but be careful i have my tab leone patted the metal band at his wrist ill be out of bounds he picked up his rifle and stepped carefully up to the mouth of the bunker making his way between blocks of concrete and steel prongs twisted and bent the air was cold at the top he crossed over the ground toward the remains of the soldier striding across the soft ash a wind blew around him swirling gray particles up in his face he squinted and pushed on the claws retreated as he came close some of them stiffening into immobility he touched his tab the ivan would have given something for that short hard radiation emitted from the tab neutralized the claws put them out of commission even the big robot with its two waving eyestalks retreated respectfully as he approached he bent down over the remains of the soldier the gloved hand was closed tightly there was something in it leone pried the fingers apart a sealed container aluminum still shiny he put it in his pocket and made his way back to the bunker behind him the claws came back to life moving into operation again the procession resumed metal spheres moving through the gray ash with their loads he could hear their treads scrabbling against the ground he shuddered scott watched intently as he brought the shiny tube out of his pocket he had that in his hand leone unscrewed the top maybe you should look at it sir scott took it he emptied the contents out in the palm of his hand a small piece of silk paper carefully folded he sat down by the light and unfolded it whats it say sir eric said several officers came up the tunnel major hendricks appeared major scott said look at this hendricks read the slip this just come a single runner just now where is he hendricks asked sharply the claws got him major hendricks grunted here he passed it to his companions i think this is what weve been waiting for they certainly took their time about it so they want to talk terms scott said are we going along with them thats not for us to decide hendricks sat down wheres the communications officer i want the moon base leone pondered as the communications officer raised the outside antenna cautiously scanning the sky above the bunker for any sign of a watching russian ship sir scott said to hendricks its sure strange they suddenly came around weve been using the claws for almost a year now all of a sudden they start to fold maybe claws have been getting down in their bunkers one of the big ones the kind with stalks got into an ivan bunker last week eric said it got a whole platoon of them before they got their lid shut how do you know a buddy told me the thing came back withwith remains moon base sir the communications officer said on the screen the face of the lunar monitor appeared his crisp uniform contrasted to the uniforms in the bunker and he was cleanshaven moon base this is forward command lwhistle on terra let me have general thompson the monitor faded presently general thompsons heavy features came into focus what is it major our claws got a single russian runner with a message we dont know whether to act on itthere have been tricks like this in the past whats the message the russians want us to send a single officer on policy level over to their lines for a conference they dont state the nature of the conference they say that matters of he consulted the slip matters of grave urgency make it advisable that discussion be opened between a representative of the un forces and themselves he held the message up to the screen for the general to scan thompsons eyes moved what should we do hendricks said send a man out you dont think its a trap it might be but the location they give for their forward command is correct its worth a try at any rate ill send an officer out and report the results to you as soon as he returns all right major thompson broke the connection the screen died up above the antenna came slowly down hendricks rolled up the paper deep in thought ill go leone said they want somebody at policy level hendricks rubbed his jaw policy level i havent been outside in months maybe i could use a little air dont you think its risky hendricks lifted the view sight and gazed into it the remains of the russian were gone only a single claw was in sight it was folding itself back disappearing into the ash like a crab like some hideous metal crabthats the only thing that bothers me hendricks rubbed his wrist i know im safe as long as i have this on me but theres something about them i hate the damn things i wish wed never invented them theres something wrong with them relentless little if we hadnt invented them the ivans would have hendricks pushed the sight back anyhow it seems to be winning the war i guess thats good sounds like youre getting the same jitters as the ivans hendricks examined his wristwatch i guess i had better get started if i want to be there before dark he took a deep breath and then stepped out onto the gray rubbled ground after a minute he lit a cigarette and stood gazing around him the landscape was dead nothing stirred he could see for miles endless ash and slag ruins of buildings a few trees without leaves or branches only the trunks above him the eternal rolling clouds of gray drifting between terra and the sun major hendricks went on off to the right something scuttled something round and metallic a claw going licketysplit after something probably after a small animal a rat they got rats too as a sort of sideline he came to the top of the little hill and lifted his field glasses the russian lines were a few miles ahead of him they had a forward command post there the runner had come from it a squat robot with undulating arms passed by him its arms weaving inquiringly the robot went on its way disappearing under some debris hendricks watched it go he had never seen that type before there were getting to be more and more types he had never seen new varieties and sizes coming up from the underground factories hendricks put out his cigarette and hurried on it was interesting the use of artificial forms in warfare how had they got started necessity the soviet union had gained great initial success usual with the side that got the war going most of north america had been blasted off the map retaliation was quick in coming of course the sky was full of circling diskbombers long before the war began they had been up there for years the disks began sailing down all over russia within hours after washington got it but that hadnt helped washington the american bloc governments moved to the moon base the first year there was not much else to do europe was gone a slag heap with dark weeds growing from the ashes and bones most of north america was useless nothing could be planted no one could live a few million people kept going up in canada and down in south america but during the second year soviet parachutists began to drop a few at first then more and more they wore the first really effective antiradiation equipment what was left of american production moved to the moon along with the governments all but the troops the remaining troops stayed behind as best they could a few thousand here a platoon there no one knew exactly where they were they stayed where they could moving around at night hiding in ruins in sewers cellars with the rats and snakes it looked as if the soviet union had the war almost won except for a handful of projectiles fired off from the moon daily there was almost no weapon in use against them they came and went as they pleased the war for all practical purposes was over nothing effective opposed them and then the first claws appeared and overnight the complexion of the war changed the claws were awkward at first slow the ivans knocked them off almost as fast as they crawled out of their underground tunnels but then they got better faster and more cunning factories all on terra turned them out factories a long way underground behind the soviet lines factories that had once made atomic projectiles now almost forgotten the claws got faster and they got bigger new types appeared some with feelers some that flew there were a few jumping kinds the best technicians on the moon were working on designs making them more and more intricate more flexible they became uncanny the ivans were having a lot of trouble with them some of the little claws were learning to hide themselves burrowing down into the ash lying in wait and then they started getting into the russian bunkers slipping down when the lids were raised for air and a look around one claw inside a bunker a churning sphere of blades and metalthat was enough and when one got in others followed with a weapon like that the war couldnt go on much longer maybe it was already over maybe he was going to hear the news maybe the politburo had decided to throw in the sponge too bad it had taken so long six years a long time for war like that the way they had waged it the automatic retaliation disks spinning down all over russia hundreds of thousands of them bacteria crystals the soviet guided missiles whistling through the air the chain bombs and now this the robots the claws the claws werent like other weapons they were alive from any practical standpoint whether the governments wanted to admit it or not they were not machines they were living things spinning creeping shaking themselves up suddenly from the gray ash and darting toward a man climbing up him rushing for his throat and that was what they had been designed to do their job they did their job well especially lately with the new designs coming up now they repaired themselves they were on their own radiation tabs protected the un troops but if a man lost his tab he was fair game for the claws no matter what his uniform down below the surface automatic machinery stamped them out human beings stayed a long way off it was too risky nobody wanted to be around them they were left to themselves and they seemed to be doing all right the new designs were faster more complex more efficient apparently they had won the war major hendricks lit a second cigarette the landscape depressed him nothing but ash and ruins he seemed to be alone the only living thing in the whole world to the right the ruins of a town rose up a few walls and heaps of debris he tossed the dead match away increasing his pace suddenly he stopped jerking up his gun his body tense for a minute it looked like from behind the shell of a ruined building a figure came walking slowly toward him walking hesitantly hendricks blinked stop the boy stopped hendricks lowered his gun the boy stood silently looking at him he was small not very old perhaps eight but it was hard to tell most of the kids who remained were stunted he wore a faded blue sweater ragged with dirt and short pants his hair was long and matted brown hair it hung over his face and around his ears he held something in his arms whats that you have hendricks said sharply the boy held it out it was a toy a bear a teddy bear the boys eyes were large but without expression hendricks relaxed i dont want it keep it the boy hugged the bear again where do you live henricks said in there the ruins yes underground yes how many are there howhow many how many of you how bigs your settlement the boy did not answer hendricks frowned youre not all by yourself are you the boy nodded how do you stay alive theres food what kind of food different hendricks studied him how old are you thirteen it wasnt possible or was it the boy was thin stunted and probably sterile radiation exposure years straight no wonder he was so small his arms and legs were like pipe cleaners knobby and thin hendricks touched the boys arm his skin was dry and rough radiation skin he bent down looking into the boys face there was no expression big eyes big and dark are you blind henricks said no i can see some how do you get away from the claws the claws the round things that run and burrow i dont understand maybe there werent any claws around a lot of areas were free they collected mostly around bunkers where there were people the claws had been designed to sense warmth warmth of living things youre lucky hendricks straightened up well which way are you going backback there can i come with you with me hendricks folded his arms im going a long way miles i have to hurry he looked at his watch i have to get there by nightfall i want to come hendricks fumbled in his pack it isnt worth it here he tossed down the food cans he had with him you take these and go back okay the boy said nothing ill be coming back this way in a day or so if youre around here when i come back you can come along with me all right i want to go with you now its a long walk i can walk hendricks shifted uneasily it made too good a target two people walking along and the boy would slow him down but he might not come back this way and if the boy were really all alone okay come along the boy fell in beside him hendricks strode along the boy walked silently clutching his teddy bear whats your name hendricks said after a time david edward derring david whatwhat happened to your mother and father they died how in the blast how long ago six years hendricks slowed down youve been alone six years no there were other people for a while they went away and youve been alone since yes hendricks glanced down the boy was strange saying very little withdrawn but that was the way they were the children who had survived quiet stoic a strange kind of fatalism gripped them nothing came as a surprise they accepted anything that came along there was no longer any normal any natural course of things moral or physical for them to expect custom habit all the determining forces of learning were gone only brute experience remained am i walking too fast hendricks said no how did you happen to see me i was waiting waiting hendricks was puzzled what were you waiting for to catch things what kind of things things to eat oh hendricks set his lips grimly a thirteenyearold boy living on rats and gophers and halfrotten canned food down in a hole under the ruins of a town with radiation pools and claws and russian divemines up above coasting around in the sky where are we going david asked to the russian lines russian the enemy the people who started the war they dropped the first radiation bombs they began all this the boy nodded his face showed no expression im an american hendricks said there was no comment on they went the two of them hendricks walking a little ahead david trailing behind him hugging his dirty teddy bear against his chest about four in the afternoon they stopped to eat hendricks built a fire in a hollow between some slabs of concrete he cleared the weeds away and heaped up bits of wood the russians lines were not very far ahead around him was what had once been a long valley acres of fruit trees and grapes nothing remained now but a few bleak stumps and the mountains that stretched across the horizon at the far end and the clouds of rolling ash that blew and drifted with the wind settling over the weeds and remains of buildings walls here and there once in a while what had been a road hendricks made coffee and heated up some boiled mutton and bread here he handed bread and mutton to david david squatted by the edge of the fire his knees knobby and white he examined the food and then passed it back shaking his head no no dont you want any no hendricks shrugged maybe the boy was a mutant used to special food it didnt matter when he was hungry he would find something to eat the boy was strange but there were many strange changes coming over the world life was not the same anymore it would never be the same again the human race was going to have to realize that suit yourself hendricks said he ate the bread and mutton by himself washing it down with coffee he ate slowly finding the food hard to digest when he was done he got to his feet and stamped the fire out david rose slowly watching him with his youngold eyes were going hendricks said all right hendricks walked along his gun in his arms they were close he was tense ready for anything the russians should be expecting a runner an answer to their own runner but they were tricky there was always the possibility of a slipup he scanned the landscape around him nothing but slag and ash a few hills charred trees concrete walls but some place ahead was the first bunker of the russian lines the forward command underground buried deep with only a periscope showing a few gun muzzles maybe an antenna will we be there soon david asked yes getting tired no why then david did not answer he plodded carefully along behind picking his way over the ash his legs and shoes were gray with dust his pinched face was streaked lines of gray ash in riverlets down the pale white of his skin there was no color to his face typical of the new children growing up in cellars and sewers and underground shelters hendricks slowed down he lifted his field glasses and studied the ground ahead of him were they there some place waiting for him watching him the way his men had watched the russian runner a chill went up his back maybe they were getting their guns ready preparing to fire the way his men had prepared made ready to kill hendricks stopped wiping perspiration from his face damn it made him uneasy but he should be expected the situation was different he strode over the ash holding his gun tightly with both hands behind him came david hendricks peered around tightlipped any second it might happen a burst of white light a blast carefully aimed from inside a deep concrete bunker he raised his arm and waved it around in a circle nothing moved to the right a long ridge ran topped with dead tree trunks a few wild vines had grown up around the trees remains of arbors and the eternal dark weeds hendricks studied the ridge was anything up there perfect place for a lookout he approached the ridge warily david coming silently behind if it were his command hed have a sentry up there watching for troops trying to infiltrate into the command area of course if it were his command there would be the claws around the area for full protection he stopped feet apart hands on his hips are we there david said almost why have we stopped i dont want to take any chances hendricks advanced slowly now the ridge lay directly beside him along his right overlooking him his uneasy feeling increased if an ivan was up there he wouldnt have a chance he waved his arm again they should be expecting someone in the un uniform in response to the note capsule unless the whole thing was a trap keep up with me he turned toward david dont drop behind with you up beside me were close we cant take any chances come on ill be all right david remained behind him in the rear a few paces away still clutching his teddy bear have it your way hendricks raised his glasses again suddenly tense for a momenthad something moved he scanned the ridge carefully everything was silent dead no life up there only tree trunks and ash maybe a few rats the big black rats that had survived the claws mutantsbuilt their own shelters out of saliva and ash some kind of plaster adaptation he started forward again a tall figure came out on the ridge above him cloak flapping graygreen a russian behind him a second soldier appeared another russian both lifted their guns aiming hendricks froze he opened his mouth the soldiers were kneeling sighting down the side of the slope a third figure had joined them on the ridge top a smaller figure in graygreen a woman she stood behind the other two hendricks found his voice stop he waved up at them frantically im the two russians fired behind hendricks there was a faint pop waves of heat lapped against him throwing him to the ground ash tore at his face grinding into his eyes and nose choking he pulled himself to his knees it was all a trap he was finished he had come to be killed like a steer the soldiers and the woman were coming down the side of the ridge toward him sliding down through the soft ash hendricks was numb his head throbbed awkwardly he got his rifle up and took aim it weighed a thousand tons he could hardly hold it his nose and cheeks stung the air was full of the blast smell a bitter acrid stench dont fire the first russian said in heavily accented english the three of them came up to him surrounding him put down your rifle yank the other said hendricks was dazed everything had happened so fast he had been caught and they had blasted the boy he turned his head david was gone what remained of him was strewn across the ground the three russians studied him curiously hendricks sat wiping blood from his nose picking out bits of ash he shook his head trying to clear it why did you do it he murmured thickly the boy why one of the soldiers helped him roughly to his feet he turned hendricks around look hendricks closed his eyes look the two russians pulled him forward see hurry up there isnt much time to spare yank hendricks looked and gasped see now now do you understand from the remains of david a metal wheel rolled relays glinting metal parts wiring one of the russians kicked at the heap of remains parts popped out rolling away wheels and springs and rods a plastic section fell in half charred hendricks bent shakily down the front of the head had come off he could make out the intricate brain wires and relays tiny tubes and switches thousands of minute studs a robot the soldier holding his arm said we watched it tagging you tagging me thats their way they tag along with you into the bunker thats how they get in hendricks blinked dazed but come on they led him toward the ridge we cant stay here it isnt safe there must be hundreds of them all around here the three of them pulled him up the side of the ridge sliding and slipping on the ash the woman reached the top and stood waiting for them the forward command hendricks muttered i came to negotiate with the soviet there is no more forward command they got in well explain they reached the top of the ridge were all thats left the three of us the rest were down in the bunker this way down this way the woman unscrewed a lid a gray manhole cover set in the ground get in hendricks lowered himself the two soldiers and the woman came behind him following him down the ladder the woman closed the lid after them bolting it tightly into place good thing we saw you one of the two soldiers grunted it had tagged you about as far as it was going to give me one of your cigarettes the woman said i havent had an american cigarette for weeks hendricks pushed the pack to her she took a cigarette and passed the pack to the two soldiers in the corner of the small room the lamp gleamed fitfully the room was lowceilinged cramped the four of them sat around a small wood table a few dirty dishes were stacked to one side behind a ragged curtain a second room was partly visible hendricks saw the corner of a coat some blankets clothes hung on a hook we were here the soldier beside him said he took off his helmet pushing his blond hair back im corporal rudi maxer polish impressed in the soviet army two years ago he held out his hand hendricks hesitated and then shook major joseph hendricks klaus epstein the other soldier shook with him a small dark man with thinning hair epstein plucked nervously at his ear austrian impressed god knows when i dont remember the three of us were here rudi and i with tasso he indicated the woman thats how we escaped all the rest were down in the bunker andand they got in epstein lit a cigarette first just one of them the kind that tagged you then it let others in hendricks became alert the kind are there more than one kind the little boy david david holding his teddy bear thats variety three the most effective what are the other types epstein reached into his coat here he tossed a packet of photographs onto the table tied with a string look for yourself hendricks untied the string you see rudi maxer said that was why we wanted to talk terms the russians i mean we found out about a week ago found out that your claws were beginning to make up new designs on their own new types of their own better types down in your underground factories behind our lines you let them stamp themselves repair themselves made them more and more intricate its your fault this happened hendricks examined the photos they had been snapped hurriedly they were blurred and indistinct the first few showeddavid david walking along a road by himself david and another david three davids all exactly alike each with a ragged teddy bear all pathetic look at the others tasso said the next pictures taken at a great distance showed a towering wounded soldier sitting by the side of a path his arm in a sling the stump of one leg extended a crude crutch on his lap then two wounded soldiers both the same standing side by side thats variety one the wounded soldier klaus reached out and took the pictures you see the claws were designed to get to human beings to find them each kind was better than the last they got farther closer past most of our defenses into our lines but as long as they were merely machines metal spheres with claws and horns feelers they could be picked off like any other object they could be detected as lethal robots as soon as they were seen once we caught sight of them variety one subverted our whole north wing rudi said it was a long time before anyone caught on then it was too late they came in wounded soldiers knocking and begging to be let in so we let them in and as soon as they were in they took over we were watching out for machines at that time it was thought there was only the one type klaus epstein said no one suspected there were other types the pictures were flashed to us when the runner was sent to you we knew of just one type variety one the big wounded soldier we thought that was all your line fell to to variety three david and his bear that worked even better klaus smiled bitterly soldiers are suckers for children we brought them in and tried to feed them we found out the hard way what they were after at least those who were in the bunker the three of us were lucky rudi said klaus and i werewere visiting tasso when it happened this is her place he waved a big hand around this little cellar we finished and climbed the ladder to start back from the ridge we saw that they were all around the bunker fighting was still going on david and his bear hundreds of them klaus took the pictures klaus tied up the photographs again and its going on all along your line hendricks said yes how about our lines without thinking he touched the tab on his arm can they theyre not bothered by your radiation tabs it makes no difference to them russian american pole german its all the same theyre doing what they were designed to do carrying out the original idea they track down life wherever they find it they go by warmth klaus said that was the way you constructed them from the very start of course those you designed were kept back by the radiation tabs you wear now theyve got around that these new varieties are leadlined whats the other variety hendricks asked the david type the wounded soldierwhats the other we dont know klaus pointed up at the wall on the wall were two metal plates ragged at the edges hendricks got up and studied them they were bent and dented the one on the left came off a wounded soldier rudi said we got one of them it was going along toward our old bunker we got it from the ridge the same way we got the david tagging you the plate was stamped iv hendricks touched the other plate and this came from the david type yes the plate was stamped iiiv klaus took a look at them leaning over hendrickss broad shoulder you can see what were up against theres another type maybe it was abandoned maybe it didnt work but there must be a second variety theres one and three you were lucky rudi said the david tagged you all the way here and never touched you probably thought youd get it into a bunker somewhere one gets in and its all over klaus said they move fast one lets all the rest inside theyre inflexible machines with one purpose they were built for only one thing he rubbed sweat from his lip we saw they were silent let me have another cigarette yank tasso said they are good i almost forgot how they were it was night the sky was black no stars were visible through the rolling clouds of ash klaus lifted the lid cautiously so that hendricks could look out rudi pointed into the darkness over that way are the bunkers where we used to be not over half a mile from us it was just chance klaus and i were not there when it happened weakness saved by our lusts all the rest must be dead klaus said in a low voice it came quickly this morning the politburo reached their decision they notified usforward command our runner was sent out at once we saw him start toward the direction of your lines we covered him until he was out of sight alex radrivsky we both knew him he disappeared about six oclock the sun had just come up about noon klaus and i had an hour relief we crept off away from the bunkers no one was watching we came here there used to be a town here a few houses a street this cellar was part of a big farmhouse we knew tasso would be here hiding down in her little place we had come here before others from the bunkers came here today happened to be our turn so we were saved klaus said chance it might have been others wewe finished and then we came up to the surface and started back along the ridge that was when we saw them the davids we understood right away we had seen the photos of the first variety the wounded soldier our commissar distributed them to us with an explanation if we had gone another step they would have seen us as it was we had to blast two davids before we got back there were hundreds of them all around like ants we took pictures and slipped back here bolting the lid tight theyre not so much when you catch them alone we moved faster than they did but theyre inexorable not like living things they came right at us and we blasted them major hendricks rested against the edge of the lid adjusting his eyes to the darkness is it safe to have the lid up at all if were careful how else can you operate your transmitter hendricks lifted the small belt transmitter slowly he pressed it against his ear the metal was cold and damp he blew against the mike raising up the short antenna a faint hum sounded in his ear thats true i suppose but he still hesitated well pull you under if anything happens klaus said thanks hendricks waited a moment resting the transmitter against his shoulder interesting isnt it what this the new types the new varieties of claws were completely at their mercy arent we by now theyve probably gotten into the un lines too it makes me wonder if were not seeing the beginning of a new species the new species evolution the race to come after man rudi grunted there is no race after man no why not maybe were seeing it now the end of human beings the beginning of the new society theyre not a race theyre mechanical killers you made them to destroy thats all they can do theyre machines with a job so it seems now but how about later on after the war is over maybe when there arent any humans to destroy their real potentialities will begin to show you talk as if they were alive arent they there was silence theyre machines rudi said they look like people but theyre machines use your transmitter major klaus said we cant stay up here forever holding the transmitter tightly hendricks called the code of the command bunker he waited listening no response only silence he checked the leads carefully everything was in place scott he said into the mike can you hear me silence he raised the gain up full and tried again only static i dont get anything they may hear me but they may not want to answer tell them its an emergency theyll think im being forced to call under your direction he tried again outlining briefly what he had learned but still the phone was silent except for the faint static radiation pools kill most transmission klaus said after a while maybe thats it hendricks shut the transmitter up no use no answer radiation pools maybe or they hear me but wont answer frankly thats what i would do if a runner tried to call from the soviet lines they have no reason to believe such a story they may hear everything i say or maybe its too late hendricks nodded we better get the lid down rudi said nervously we dont want to take unnecessary chances they climbed slowly back down the tunnel klaus bolted the lid carefully into place they descended into the kitchen the air was heavy and close around them could they work that fast hendricks said i left the bunker this noon ten hours ago how could they move so quickly it doesnt take them long not after the first one gets in it goes wild you know what the little claws can do even one of these is beyond belief razors each finger maniacal all right hendricks moved away impatiently he stood with his back to them whats the matter rudi said the moon base god if theyve gotten there the moon base hendricks turned around they couldnt have got to the moon base how would they get there it isnt possible i cant believe it what is this moon base weve heard rumors but nothing definite what is the actual situation you seem concerned were supplied from the moon the governments are there under the lunar surface all our people and industries thats what keeps us going if they should find some way of getting off terra onto the moon it only takes one of them once the first one gets in it admits the others hundreds of them all alike you should have seen them identical like ants perfect socialism tasso said the ideal of the communist state all citizens interchangeable klaus grunted angrily thats enough well what next hendricks paced back and forth around the small room the air was full of smells of food and perspiration the others watched him presently tasso pushed through the curtain into the other room im going to take a nap the curtain closed behind her rudi and klaus sat down at the table still watching hendricks its up to you klaus said we dont know your situation hendricks nodded its a problem rudi drank some coffee filling his cup from a rusty pot were safe here for a while but we cant stay here forever not enough food or supplies but if we go outside if we go outside theyll get us or probably theyll get us we couldnt go very far how far is your command bunker major three or four miles we might make it the four of us four of us could watch all sides they couldnt slip up behind us and start tagging us we have three rifles three blast rifles tasso can have my pistol rudi tapped his belt in the soviet army we didnt have shoes always but we had guns with all four of us armed one of us might get to your command bunker preferably you major what if theyre already there klaus said rudi shrugged well then we come back here hendricks stopped pacing what do you think the chances are theyre already in the american lines hard to say fairly good theyre organized they know exactly what theyre doing once they start they go like a horde of locusts they have to keep moving and fast its secrecy and speed they depend on surprise they push their way in before anyone has any idea i see hendricks murmured from the other room tasso stirred major hendricks pushed the curtain back what tasso looked up at him lazily from the cot have you any more american cigarettes left hendricks went into the room and sat down across from her on a wood stool he felt in his pockets no all gone too bad what nationality are you hendricks asked her after a while russian how did you get here here this used to be france this was part of normandy did you come with the soviet army why just curious he studied her she had taken off her coat tossing it over the end of the cot she was young about twenty slim her long hair stretched out over the pillow she was staring at him silently her eyes dark and large whats on your mind tasso said nothing how old are you eighteen she continued to watch him unblinking her arms behind her head she had on russian army pants and shirt graygreen thick leather belt with counter and cartridges medicine kit youre in the soviet army no where did you get the uniform she shrugged it was given to me she told him howhow old were you when you came here sixteen that young her eyes narrowed what do you mean hendricks rubbed his jaw your life would have been a lot different if there had been no war sixteen you came here at sixteen to live this way i had to survive im not moralizing your life would have been different too tasso murmured she reached down and unfastened one of her boots she kicked the boot off onto the floor major do you want to go in the other room im sleepy its going to be a problem the four of us here its going to be hard to live in these quarters are there just the two rooms yes how big was the cellar originally was it larger than this are there other rooms filled up with debris we might be able to open one of them perhaps i really dont know tasso loosened her belt she made herself comfortable on the cot unbuttoning her shirt youre sure you have no more cigarettes i had only one pack too bad maybe if we get back to your bunker we can find some the other boot fell tasso reached up for the light cord good night youre going to sleep thats right the room plunged into darkness hendricks got up and made his way past the curtain into the kitchen and stopped rigid rudi stood against the wall his face white and gleaming his mouth opened and closed but no sounds came klaus stood in front of him the muzzle of his pistol in rudis stomach neither of them moved klaus his hand tight around the gun his features set rudi pale and silent spreadeagled against the wall what hendricks muttered but klaus cut him off be quiet major come over here your gun get out your gun hendricks drew his pistol what is it cover him klaus motioned him forward beside me hurry rudi moved a little lowering his arms he turned to hendricks licking his lips the whites of his eyes shone wildly sweat dripped from his forehead down his cheeks he fixed his gaze on hendricks major hes gone insane stop him rudis voice was thin and hoarse almost inaudible whats going on hendricks demanded without lowering his pistol klaus answered major remember our discussion the three varieties we knew about one and three but we didnt know about two at least we didnt know before klauss fingers tightened around the gun butt we didnt know before but we know now he pressed the trigger a burst of white heat rolled out of the gun licking around rudi major this is the second variety tasso swept the curtain aside klaus what did you do klaus turned from the charred form gradually sinking down the wall onto the floor the second variety tasso now we know we have all three types identified the danger is less i tasso stared past him at the remains of rudi at the blackened smoldering fragments and bits of cloth you killed him him it you mean i was watching i had a feeling but i wasnt sure at least i wasnt sure before but this evening i was certain klaus rubbed his pistol butt nervously were lucky dont you understand another hour and it might you were certain tasso pushed past him and bent down over the steaming remains on the floor her face became hard major see for yourself bones flesh hendricks bent down beside her the remains were human remains seared flesh charred bone fragments part of a skull ligaments viscera blood blood forming a pool against the wall no wheels tasso said calmly she straightened up no wheels no parts no relays not a claw not the second variety she folded her arms youre going to have to be able to explain this klaus sat down at the table all the color drained suddenly from his face he put his head in his hands and rocked back and forth snap out of it tassos fingers closed over his shoulder why did you do it why did you kill him he was frightened hendricks said all this the whole thing building up around us maybe what then what do you think i think he may have had a reason for killing rudi a good reason what reason maybe rudi learned something hendricks studied her bleak face about what he asked about him about klaus klaus looked up quickly you can see what shes trying to say she thinks im the second variety dont you see major now she wants you to believe i killed him on purpose that im why did you kill him then tasso said i told you klaus shook his head wearily i thought he was a claw i thought i knew why i had been watching him i was suspicious why i thought i had seen something heard something i thought i he stopped go on we were sitting at the table playing cards you two were in the other room it was silent i thought i heard himwhirr there was silence do you believe that tasso said to hendricks yes i believe what he says i dont i think he killed rudi for a good purpose tasso touched the rifle resting in the corner of the room major no hendricks shook his head lets stop it right now one is enough were afraid the way he was if we kill him well be doing what he did to rudi klaus looked gratefully up at him thanks i was afraid you understand dont you now shes afraid the way i was she wants to kill me no more killing hendricks moved toward the end of the ladder im going above and try the transmitter once more if i cant get them were moving back toward my lines tomorrow morning klaus rose quickly ill come up with you and give you a hand the night air was cold the earth was cooling off klaus took a deep breath filling his lungs he and hendricks stepped onto the ground out of the tunnel klaus planted his feet wide apart the rifle up watching and listening hendricks crouched by the tunnel mouth tuning the small transmitter any luck klaus asked presently not yet keep trying tell them what happened hendricks kept trying without success finally he lowered the antenna its useless they cant hear me or they hear me and wont answer or or they dont exist ill try once more hendricks raised the antenna scott can you hear me come in he listened there was only static then still very faintly this is scott his fingers tightened scott is it you this is scott klaus squatted down is it your command scott listen do you understand about them the claws did you get my message did you hear me yes faintly almost inaudible he could hardly make out the word you got my message is everything all right at the bunker none of them have got in everything is all right have they tried to get in the voice was weaker no hendricks turned to klaus theyre all right have they been attacked no hendricks pressed the phone tighter to his ear scott i can hardly hear you have you notified the moon base do they know are they alerted no answer scott can you hear me silence hendricks relaxed sagging faded out must be radiation pools hendricks and klaus looked at each other neither of them said anything after a time klaus said did it sound like any of your men could you identify the voice it was too faint you couldnt be certain no then it could have been i dont know now im not sure lets go back down and get the lid closed they climbed back down the ladder slowly into the warm cellar klaus bolted the lid behind them tasso waited for them her face expressionless any luck she asked neither of them answered well klaus said at last what do you think major was it your officer or was it one of them i dont know then were just where we were before hendricks stared down at the floor his jaw set well have to go to be sure anyhow we have food here for only a few weeks wed have to go up after that in any case apparently so whats wrong tasso demanded did you get across to your bunker whats the matter it may have been one of my men hendricks said slowly or it may have been one of them but well never know standing here he examined his watch lets turn in and get some sleep we want to be up early tomorrow early our best chance to get through the claws should be early in the morning hendricks said the morning was crisp and clear major hendricks studied the countryside through his field glasses see anything klaus said no can you make out our bunkers which way here klaus took the glasses and adjusted them i know where to look he looked a long time silently tasso came to the top of the tunnel and stepped up onto the ground anything no klaus passed the glasses back to hendricks theyre out of sight come on lets not stay here the three of them made their way down the side of the ridge sliding in the soft ash across a flat rock a lizard scuttled they stopped instantly rigid what was it klaus muttered a lizard the lizard ran on hurrying through the ash it was exactly the same color as the ash perfect adaptation klaus said proves we were right lysenko i mean they reached the bottom of the ridge and stopped standing close together looking around them lets go hendricks started off its a good long trip on foot klaus fell in beside him tasso walked behind her pistol held alertly major ive been meaning to ask you something klaus said how did you run across the david the one that was tagging you i met it along the way in some ruins what did it say not much it said it was alone by itself you couldnt tell it was a machine it talked like a living person you never suspected it didnt say much i noticed nothing unusual its strange machines so much like people that you can be fooled almost alive i wonder where itll end theyre doing what you yanks designed them to do tasso said you designed them to hunt out life and destroy human life wherever they find it hendricks was watching klaus intently why did you ask me whats on your mind nothing klaus answered klaus thinks youre the second variety tasso said calmly from behind them now hes got his eye on you klaus flushed why not we sent a runner to the yank lines and he comes back maybe he thought hed find some good game here hendricks laughed harshly i came from the un bunkers there were human beings all around me maybe you saw an opportunity to get into the soviet lines maybe you saw your chance maybe you the soviet lines had already been taken over your lines had been invaded before i left my command bunker dont forget that tasso came up beside him that proves nothing at all major why not there appears to be little communication between the varieties each is made in a different factory they dont seem to work together you might have started for the soviet lines without knowing anything about the work of the other varieties or even what the other varieties were like how do you know so much about the claws hendricks said ive seen them ive observed them take over the soviet bunkers you know quite a lot klaus said actually you saw very little strange that you should have been such an acute observer tasso laughed do you suspect me now forget it hendricks said they walked on in silence are we going the whole way on foot tasso said after a while im not used to walking she gazed around at the plain of ash stretching out on all sides of them as far as they could see how dreary its like this all the way klaus said in a way i wish you had been in your bunker when the attack came somebody else would have been with you if not me klaus muttered tasso laughed putting her hands in her pockets i suppose so they walked on keeping their eyes on the vast plain of silent ash around them the sun was setting hendricks made his way forward slowly waving tasso and klaus back klaus squatted down resting his gun butt against the ground tasso found a concrete slab and sat down with a sigh its good to rest be quiet klaus said sharply hendricks pushed up to the top of the rise ahead of them the same rise the russian runner had come up the day before hendricks dropped down stretching himself out peering through his glasses at what lay beyond nothing was visible only ash and occasional trees but there not more than fifty yards ahead was the entrance of the forward command bunker the bunker from which he had come hendricks watched silently no motion no sign of life nothing stirred klaus slithered up beside him where is it down there hendricks passed him the glasses clouds of ash rolled across the evening sky the world was darkening they had a couple of hours of light left at the most probably not that much i dont see anything klaus said that tree there the stump by the pile of bricks the entrance is to the right of the bricks ill have to take your word for it you and tasso cover me from here youll be able to sight all the way to the bunker entrance youre going down alone with my wrist tab ill be safe the ground around the bunker is a living field of claws they collect down in the ash like crabs without tabs you wouldnt have a chance maybe youre right ill walk slowly all the way as soon as i know for certain if theyre down inside the bunker you wont be able to get back up here they go fast you dont realize what do you suggest klaus considered i dont know get them to come up to the surface so you can see hendricks brought his transmitter from his belt raising the antenna lets get started klaus signaled to tasso she crawled expertly up the side of the rise to where they were sitting hes going down alone klaus said well cover him from here as soon as you see him start back fire past him at once they come quick youre not very optimistic tasso said no im not hendricks opened the breech of his gun checking it carefully maybe things are all right you didnt see them hundreds of them all the same pouring out like ants i should be able to find out without going down all the way hendricks locked his gun gripping it in one hand the transmitter in the other well wish me luck klaus put out his hand dont go down until youre sure talk to them from up here make them show themselves hendricks stood up he stepped down the side of the rise a moment later he was walking slowly toward the pile of bricks and debris beside the dead tree stump toward the entrance of the forward command bunker nothing stirred he raised the transmitter clicking it on scott can you hear me silence scott this is hendricks can you hear me im standing outside the bunker you should be able to see me in the view sight he listened the transmitter gripped tightly no sound only static he walked forward a claw burrowed out of the ash and raced toward him it halted a few feet away and then slunk off a second claw appeared one of the big ones with feelers it moved toward him studied him intently and then fell in behind him dogging respectfully after him a few paces away a moment later a second big claw joined it silently the claws trailed him as he walked slowly toward the bunker hendricks stopped and behind him the claws came to a halt he was close now almost to the bunker steps scott can you hear me im standing right above you outside on the surface are you picking me up he waited holding his gun against his side the transmitter tightly to his ear time passed he strained to hear but there was only silence silence and faint static then distantly metallically this is scott the voice was neutral cold he could not identify it but the earphone was minute scott listen im standing right above you im on the surface looking down into the bunker entrance yes can you see me yes through the view sight you have the sight trained on me yes hendricks pondered a circle of claws waited quietly around him graymetal bodies on all sides of him is everything all right in the bunker nothing unusual has happened everything is all right will you come up to the surface i want to see you for a moment hendricks took a deep breath come up here with me i want to talk to you come down im giving you an order silence are you coming hendricks listened there was no response i order you to come to the surface come down hendricks set his jaw let me talk to leone there was a long pause he listened to the static then a voice came hard thin metallic the same as the other this is leone hendricks im on the surface at the bunker entrance i want one of you to come up here come down why come down im giving you an order silence hendricks lowered the transmitter he looked carefully around him the entrance was just ahead almost at his feet he lowered the antenna and fastened the transmitter to his belt carefully he gripped his gun with both hands he moved forward a step at a time if they could see him they knew he was starting toward the entrance he closed his eyes a moment then he put his foot on the first step that led downward two davids came up at him their faces identical and expressionless he blasted them into particles more came rushing silently up a whole pack of them all exactly the same hendricks turned and raced back away from the bunker back toward the rise at the top of the rise tasso and klaus were firing down the small claws were already streaking up toward them shining metal spheres going fast racing frantically through the ash but he had no time to think about that he knelt down aiming at the bunker entrance gun against his cheek the davids were coming out in groups clutching their teddy bears their thin knobby legs pumping as they ran up the steps to the surface hendricks fired into the main body of them they burst apart wheels and springs flying in all directions he fired again through the mist of particles a giant lumbering figure rose up in the bunker entrance tall and swaying hendricks paused amazed a man a soldier with one leg supporting himself with a crutch major tassos voice came more firing the huge figure moved forward davids swarming around it hendricks broke out of his freeze the first variety the wounded soldier he aimed and fired the soldier burst into bits parts and relays flying now many davids were out on the flat ground away from the bunker he fired again and again moving slowly back halfcrouching and aiming from the rise klaus fired down the side of the rise was alive with claws making their way up hendricks retreated toward the rise running and crouching tasso had left klaus and was circling slowly to the right moving away from the rise a david slipped up toward him its small white face expressionless brown hair hanging down in its eyes it bent over suddenly opening its arms its teddy bear hurtled down and leaped across the ground bounding toward him hendricks fired the bear and the david both dissolved he grinned blinking it was like a dream up here tassos voice hendricks made his way toward her she was over by some columns of concrete walls of a ruined building she was firing past him with the hand pistol klaus had given her thanks he joined her gasping for breath she pulled him back behind the concrete fumbling at her belt close your eyes she unfastened a globe from her waist rapidly she unscrewed the cap locking it into place close your eyes and get down she threw the bomb it sailed in an arc an expert rolling and bouncing to the entrance of the bunker two wounded soldiers stood uncertainly by the brick pile more davids poured from behind them out onto the plain one of the wounded soldiers moved toward the bomb stooping awkwardly down to pick it up the bomb went off the concussion whirled hendricks around throwing him on his face a hot wind rolled over him dimly he saw tasso standing behind the columns firing slowly and methodically at the davids coming out of the raging clouds of white fire back along the rise klaus struggled with a ring of claws circling around him he retreated blasting at them and moving back trying to break through the ring hendricks struggled to his feet his head ached he could hardly see everything was licking at him raging and whirling his right arm would not move tasso pulled back toward him come on lets go klaushes still up there come on tasso dragged hendricks back away from the columns hendricks shook his head trying to clear it tasso led him rapidly away her eyes intense and bright watching for claws that had escaped the blast one david came out of the rolling clouds of flame tasso blasted it no more appeared but klaus what about him hendricks stopped standing unsteadily he come on they retreated moving farther and farther away from the bunker a few small claws followed them for a little while and then gave up turning back and going off at last tasso stopped we can stop here and get our breaths hendricks sat down on some heaps of debris he wiped his neck gasping we left klaus back there tasso said nothing she opened her gun sliding a fresh round of blast cartridges into place hendricks stared at her dazed you left him back there on purpose tasso snapped the gun together she studied the heaps of rubble around them her face expressionless as if she were watching for something what is it hendricks demanded what are you looking for is something coming he shook his head trying to understand what was she doing what was she waiting for he could see nothing ash lay all around them ash and ruins occasional stark tree trunks without leaves or branches what tasso cut him off be still her eyes narrowed suddenly her gun came up hendricks turned following her gaze back the way they had come a figure appeared the figure walked unsteadily toward them its clothes were torn it limped as it made its way along going very slowly and carefully stopping now and then resting and getting its strength once it almost fell it stood for a moment trying to steady itself then it came on klaus hendricks stood up klaus he started toward him how the hell did you tasso fired hendricks swung back she fired again the blast passing him a searing line of heat the beam caught klaus in the chest he exploded gears and wheels flying for a moment he continued to walk then he swayed back and forth he crashed to the ground his arms flung out a few more wheels rolled away silence tasso turned to hendricks now you understand why he killed rudi hendricks sat down again slowly he shook his head he was numb he could not think do you see tasso said do you understand hendricks said nothing everything was slipping away from him faster and faster darkness rolling and plucking at him he closed his eyes hendricks opened his eyes slowly his body ached all over he tried to sit up but needles of pain shot through his arm and shoulder he gasped dont try to get up tasso said she bent down putting her cold hand against his forehead it was night a few stars glinted above shining through the drifting clouds of ash hendricks lay back his teeth locked tasso watched him impassively she had built a fire with some wood and weeds the fire licked feebly hissing at a metal cup suspended over it everything was silent unmoving darkness beyond the fire so he was the second variety hendricks murmured i had always thought so why didnt you destroy him sooner he wanted to know you held me back tasso crossed to the fire to look into the metal cup coffee itll be ready to drink in a while she came back and sat down beside him presently she opened her pistol and began to disassemble the firing mechanism studying it intently this is a beautiful gun tasso said half aloud the construction is superb what about them the claws the concussion from the bomb put most of them out of action theyre delicate highly organized i suppose the davids too yes how did you happen to have a bomb like that tasso shrugged we designed it you shouldnt underestimate our technology major without such a bomb you and i would no longer exist very useful tasso stretched out her legs warming her feet in the heat of the fire it surprised me that you did not seem to understand after he killed rudi why did you think he i told you i thought he was afraid really you know major for a little while i suspected you because you wouldnt let me kill him i thought you might be protecting him she laughed are we safe here hendricks asked presently for a while until they get reinforcements from some other area tasso began to clear the interior of the gun with a bit of rag she finished and pushed the mechanism back into place she closed the gun running her finger along the barrel we were lucky hendricks murmured yes very lucky thanks for pulling me away tasso did not answer she glanced up at him her eyes bright in the firelight hendricks examined his arm he could not move his fingers his whole side seemed numb down inside him was a dull steady ache how do you feel tasso asked my arm is damaged anything else internal injuries you didnt get down when the bomb went off hendricks said nothing he watched tasso pour the coffee from the cup into a flat metal pan she brought it over to him thanks he struggled up enough to drink it was hard to swallow his insides turned over and he pushed the pan away thats all i can drink now tasso drank the rest time passed the clouds of ash moved across the dark sky above them hendricks rested his mind blank after a while he became aware that tasso was standing over him gazing down at him what is it he murmured do you feel any better some you know major if i hadnt dragged you away they would have got you you would be dead like rudi i know do you want to know why i brought you out i could have left you i could have left you there why did you bring me out because we have to get away from here tasso stirred the fire with a stick peering calmly down into it no human being can live here when their reinforcements come we wont have a chance ive pondered about it while you were unconscious we have perhaps three hours before they come and you expect me to get us away thats right i expect you to get us out of here why me because i dont know any way her eyes shone at him in the light bright and steady if you cant get us out of here theyll kill us within three hours i see nothing else ahead well major what are you going to do ive been waiting all night while you were unconscious i sat here waiting and listening its almost dawn the night is almost over hendricks considered its curious he said at last curious that you should think i can get us out of here i wonder what you think i can do can you get us to the moon base the moon base how there must be some way hendricks shook his head no theres no way that i know of tasso said nothing for a moment her steady gaze wavered she ducked her head turning abruptly away she scrambled to her feet more coffee no suit yourself tasso drank silently he could not see her face he lay back against the ground deep in thought trying to concentrate it was hard to think his head still hurt and the numbing daze still hung over him there might be one way he said suddenly oh how soon is dawn two hours the sun will be coming up shortly theres supposed to be a ship near here ive never seen it but i know it exists what kind of a ship her voice was sharp a rocket cruiser will it take us off to the moon base its supposed to in case of emergency he rubbed his forehead whats wrong my head its hard to think i can hardlyhardly concentrate the bomb is the ship near here tasso slid over beside him settling down on her haunches how far is it where is it im trying to think her fingers dug into his arm nearby her voice was like iron where would it be would they store it underground hidden underground yes in a storage locker how do we find it is it marked is there a code marker to identify it hendricks concentrated no no markings no code symbol what then a sign what sort of sign hendricks did not answer in the flickering light his eyes were glazed two sightless orbs tassos fingers dug into his arm what sort of sign what is it ii cant think let me rest all right she let go and stood up hendricks lay back against the ground his eyes closed tasso walked away from him her hands in her pockets she kicked a rock out of her way and stood staring up at the sky the night blackness was already beginning to fade into gray morning was coming tasso gripped her pistol and walked around the fire in a circle back and forth on the ground major hendricks lay his eyes closed unmoving the grayness rose in the sky higher and higher the landscape became visible fields of ash stretching out in all directions ash and ruins of buildings a wall here and there heaps of concrete the naked trunk of a tree the air was cold and sharp somewhere a long way off a bird made a few bleak sounds hendricks stirred he opened his eyes is it dawn already yes hendricks sat up a little you wanted to know something you were asking me do you remember now yes what is it she tensed what she repeated sharply a well a ruined well its in a storage locker under a well a well tasso relaxed then well find a well she looked at her watch we have about an hour major do you think we can find it in an hour give me a hand up hendricks said tasso put her pistol away and helped him to his feet this is going to be difficult yes it is hendricks set his lips tightly i dont think were going to go very far they began to walk the early sun cast a little warmth down on them the land was flat and barren stretching out gray and lifeless as far as they could see a few birds sailed silently far above them circling slowly see anything hendricks said any claws no not yet they passed through some ruins upright concrete and bricks a cement foundation rats scuttled away tasso jumped back warily this used to be a town hendricks said a village provincial village this was all grape country once where we are now they came onto a ruined street weeds and cracks crisscrossing it over to the right a stone chimney stuck up be careful he warned her a pit yawned an open basement ragged ends of pipes jutted up twisted and bent they passed part of a house a bathtub turned on its side a broken chair a few spoons and bits of china dishes in the center of the street the ground had sunk away the depression was filled with weeds and debris and bones over here hendricks murmured this way to the right they passed the remains of a heavyduty tank hendrickss belt counter clicked ominously the tank had been radiationblasted a few feet from the tank a mumified body lay sprawled out mouth open beyond the road was a flat field stones and weeds and bits of broken glass there hendricks said a stone well jutted up sagging and broken a few boards lay across it most of the well had sunk into rubble hendricks walked unsteadily toward it tasso beside him are you certain about this tasso said this doesnt look like anything im sure hendricks sat down at the edge of the well his teeth locked his breath came quickly he wiped perspiration from his face this was arranged so the senior command officer could get away if anything happened if the bunker fell that was you yes where is the ship is it here were standing on it hendricks ran his hands over the surface of the well stones the eyelock responds to me not to anybody else its my ship or it was supposed to be there was a sharp click presently they heard a low grating sound from below them step back hendricks said he and tasso moved away from the well a section of the ground slid back a metal frame pushed slowly up through the ash shoving bricks and weeds out of the way the action ceased as the ship nosed into view there it is hendricks said the ship was small it rested quietly suspended in its mesh frame like a blunt needle a rain of ash sifted down into the dark cavity from which the ship had been raised hendricks made his way over to it he mounted the mesh and unscrewed the hatch pulling it back inside the ship the control banks and the pressure seat were visible tasso came and stood beside him gazing into the ship im not accustomed to rocket piloting she said after a while hendricks glanced at her ill do the piloting will you theres only one seat major i can see its built to carry only a single person hendrickss breathing changed he studied the interior of the ship intently tasso was right there was only one seat the ship was built to carry only one person i see he said slowly and the one person is you she nodded of course why you cant go you might not live through the trip youre injured you probably wouldnt get there an interesting point but you see i know where the moon base is and you dont you might fly around for months and not find it its well hidden without knowing what to look for ill have to take my chances maybe i wont find it not by myself but i think youll give me all the information i need your life depends on it how if i find the moon base in time perhaps i can get them to send a ship back to pick you up if i find the base in time if not then you havent a chance i imagine there are supplies on the ship they will last me long enough hendricks moved quickly but his injured arm betrayed him tasso ducked sliding lithely aside her hand came up lightning fast hendricks saw the gun butt coming he tried to ward off the blow but she was too fast the metal butt struck against the side of his head just above his ear numbing pain rushing through him pain and rolling clouds of blackness he sank down sliding to the ground dimly he was aware that tasso was standing over him kicking him with her toe major wake up he opened his eyes groaning listen to me she bent down the gun pointed at his face i have to hurry there isnt much time left the ship is ready to go but you must give me the information i need before i leave hendricks shook his head trying to clear it hurry up where is the moon base how do i find it what do i look for hendricks said nothing answer me sorry major the ship is loaded with provisions i can coast for weeks ill find the base eventually and in a halfhour youll be dead your only chance of survival she broke off along the slope by some crumbling ruins something moved something in the ash tasso turned quickly aiming she fired a puff of flame leaped something scuttled away rolling across the ash she fired again the claw burst apart wheels flying see tasso said a scout it wont be long youll bring them back here to get me yes as soon as possible hendricks looked up at her he studied her intently youre telling the truth a strange expression had come over his face an avid hunger you will come back for me youll get me to the moon base ill get you to the moon base but tell me where it is theres only a little time left all right hendricks picked up a piece of rock pulling himself to a sitting position watch hendricks began to scratch in the ash tasso stood by him watching the motion of the rock hendricks was sketching a crude lunar map this is the appenine range here is the crater of archimedes the moon base is beyond the end of the appenine about two hundred miles i dont know exactly where no one on terra knows but when youre over the appenine signal with one red flare and a green flare followed by two red flares in quick succession the base monitor will record your signal the base is under the surface of course theyll guide you down with magnetic grapples and the controls can i operate them the controls are virtually automatic all you have to do is give the right signal at the right time i will the seat absorbs most of the takeoff shock air and temperature are automatically controlled the ship will leave terra and pass out into free space itll line itself up with the moon falling into an orbit around it about a hundred miles above the surface the orbit will carry you over the base when youre in the region of the appenine release the signal rockets tasso slid into the ship and lowered herself into the pressure seat the arm locks folded automatically around her she fingered the controls too bad youre not going major all this put here for you and you cant make the trip leave me the pistol tasso pulled the pistol from her belt she held it in her hand weighing it thoughtfully dont go too far from this location itll be hard to find you as it is no ill stay here by the well tasso gripped the takeoff switch running her fingers over the smooth metal a beautiful ship major well built i admire your workmanship you people have always done good work you build fine things your work your creations are your greatest achievement give me the pistol hendricks said impatiently holding out his hand he struggled to his feet goodbye major tasso tossed the pistol past hendricks the pistol clattered against the ground bouncing and rolling away hendricks hurried after it he bent down snatching it up the hatch of the ship clanged shut the bolts fell into place hendricks made his way back the inner door was being sealed he raised the pistol unsteadily there was a shattering roar the ship burst up from its metal cage fusing the mesh behind it hendricks cringed pulling back the ship shot up into the rolling clouds of ash disappearing into the sky hendricks stood watching a long time until even the streamer had dissipated nothing stirred the morning air was chill and silent he began to walk aimlessly back the way they had come better to keep moving around it would be a long time before help cameif it came at all he searched his pockets until he found a package of cigarettes he lit one grimly they had all wanted cigarettes from him but cigarettes were scarce a lizard slithered by him through the ash he halted rigid the lizard disappeared above the sun rose higher in the sky some flies landed on a flat rock to one side of him hendricks kicked at them with his foot it was getting hot sweat trickled down his face into his collar his mouth was dry presently he stopped walking and sat down on some debris he unfastened his medicine kit and swallowed a few narcotic capsules he looked around him where was he something lay ahead stretched out on the ground silent and unmoving hendricks drew his gun quickly it looked like a man then he remembered it was the remains of klaus the second variety where tasso had blasted him he could see wheels and relays and metal parts strewn around on the ash glittering and sparkling in the sunlight hendricks got to his feet and walked over he nudged the inert form with his foot turning it over a little he could see the metal hull the aluminum ribs and struts more wiring fell out like viscera heaps of wiring switches and relays endless motors and rods he bent down the brain was visible he gazed at it a maze of circuits miniature tubes wires as fine as hair he touched the brain cage it swung aside the type plate was visible hendricks studied the plate and blanched for a long time he stared at the plate fourth variety not the second they had been wrong there were more types not just three many more perhaps at least four and klaus wasnt the second variety but if klaus wasnt the second variety suddenly he tensed something was coming walking through the ash beyond the hill what was it he strained to see figures coming slowly along making their way through the ash coming toward him hendricks crouched quickly raising his gun sweat dripped down into his eyes he fought down rising panic as the figures neared the first was a david the david saw him and increased its pace the others hurried behind it a second david a third three davids all alike coming toward him silently without expression their thin legs rising and falling clutching their teddy bears he aimed and fired the first two davids dissolved into particles the third came on and the figure behind it climbing silently toward him across the gray ash a wounded soldier towering over the david andand behind the wounded soldier came two tassos walking side by side heavy belt russian army pants shirt long hair the familiar figure as he had seen her only a little while before sitting in the pressure seat of the ship two slim silent figures both identical they were very near the david bent down suddenly dropping its teddy bear the bear raced across the ground automatically hendrickss fingers tightened around the trigger the bear was gone dissolved into mist the two tasso types moved on expressionless walking side by side through the gray ash when they were almost to him hendricks raised the pistol waist high and fired the two tassos dissolved but already a new group was starting up the rise five or six tassos all identical a line of them coming rapidly toward him and he had given her the ship and the signal code because of him she was on her way to the moon to the moon base he had made it possible he had been right about the bomb after all it had been designed with knowledge of the other types the david type and the wounded soldier type and the klaus type not designed by human beings it had been designed by one of the underground factories apart from all human contact the line of tassos came up to him hendricks braced himself watching them calmly the familiar face the belt the heavy shirt the bomb carefully in place the bomb as the tassos reached for him a last ironic thought drifted through hendrickss mind he felt a little better thinking about it the bomb made by the second variety to destroy the other varieties made for that end alone they were already beginning to design weapons to use against each other joe w haldeman praised for its authentic portrayal of the emotional detachment and psychological dislocation of soldiers in a millenniumlong future war joe haldemans first science fiction novel the forever war won both the hugo and nebula awards when it was published in and was later adapted into a threepart graphicnovel series since then haldeman has returned to the theme of future war several times notably in his trilogy worlds worlds apart and worlds enough and time about a future earth facing nuclear extinction and forever peace a further exploration of the dehumanizing potential of armed conflict haldemans other novels include mindbridge all my sins remembered and the alternateworld opus the hemingway hoax expanded from his nebula awardwinning novella of the same name haldemans stories have been collected in infinite dreams and dealing in futures and several of his essays are mixed with fiction in vietnam and other alien worlds his powerful non science fiction writing includes war year drawn from experiences during his tour of duty in vietnam and a portrait of america in the vietnam era he has also coedited the anthologies body armor spacefighters and supertanks joe w haldeman tonight were going to show you eight silent ways to kill a man the guy who said that was a sergeant who didnt look five years older than i ergo as they say he couldnt possibly ever have killed a man not in combat silently or otherwise i already knew eighty ways to kill people though most of them were pretty noisy i sat up straight in my chair and assumed a look of polite attention and fell asleep with my eyes open so did most everybody else wed learned that they never schedule anything important for these afterchop classes the projector woke me up and i sat through a short movie showing the eight silent ways some of the actors must have been brainwipes since they were actually killed after the movie a girl in the front row raised her hand the sergeant nodded at her and she rose to parade rest not badlooking but kind of chunky about the neck and shoulders everybody gets that way after carrying a heavy pack around for a couple of months sirwe had to call sergeants sir until graduationmost of those methods really they lookedkind of silly for instance like killing a man with a blow to the kidneys from an entrenching tool i mean when would you actually just have an entrenching tool and no gun or knife and why not just bash him over the head with it he might have a helmet on he said reasonably besides taurans probably dont even have kidneys he shrugged probably they dont this was and wed never seen a tauran hadnt even found any pieces of taurans bigger than a scorched chromosome but their body chemistry is similar to ours and we have to assume theyre similarly complex creatures they must have weaknesses vulnerable spots you have to find out where they are thats the important thing he stabbed a finger at the screen thats why those eight convicts got caulked for your benefityouve got to find out how to kill taurans and be able to do it whether you have a megawatt laser or just an emery board she sat back down not looking too convinced any more questions nobody raised a hand oktenchhut we staggered upright and he looked at us expectantly screw you sir came the tired chorus louder screw you sir one of the armys lessinspired morale devices thats better dont forget predawn maneuvers tomorrow chop at first formation anybody sacked after gets one stripe dismissed i zipped up my coverall and went across the snow to the lounge for a cup of soya and a joint id always been able to get by on five or six hours of sleep and this was the only time i could be by myself out of the army for a while looked at the newsfax for a few minutes another ship got caulked out by aldebaran sector that was four years ago they were mounting a reprisal fleet but itll take four years more for them to get out there by then the taurans would have every portal planet sewed up tight back at the billet everybody else was sacked and the main lights were out the whole companyd been dragging ever since we got back from the twoweek lunar training i dumped my clothes in the locker checked the roster and found out i was in bunk damn it right under the heater i slipped through the curtain as quietly as possible so as not to wake up my bunkmate couldnt see who it was but i couldnt have cared less i slipped under the blanket youre late mandella a voice yawned it was rogers sorry i woke you up i whispered sallright she snuggled over and clasped me spoonfashion she was warm and reasonably soft i patted her hip in what i hoped was a brotherly fashion night rogers gnight stallion she returned the gesture a good deal more pointedly why do you always get the tired ones when youre ready and the randy ones when youre tired i bowed to the inevitable awright lets get some back inta that stringer team move it upmove up a warm front had come in about midnight and the snow had turned to sleet the permaplast stringer weighed five hundred pounds and was a bitch to handle even when it wasnt covered with ice there were four of us two at each end carrying the plastic girder with frozen fingertips rogers and i were partners steel the guy behind me yelled meaning that he was losing his hold it wasnt steel but it was heavy enough to break your foot everybody let go and hopped away it splashed slush and mud all over us damn it petrov rogers said why didnt you go out for star fleet or maybe the red cross this damn things not that damn heavy most of the girls were a little more circumspect in their speech awright get a move on stringersepoxy team dog em dog em our two epoxy people ran up swinging their buckets lets go mandella im freezin me too the girl said earnestly onetwoheave we got the thing up again and staggered toward the bridge it was about threequarters completed looked as if the second platoon was going to beat us i wouldnt give a damn but the platoon that got their bridge built first got to fly home four miles of muck for the rest of us and no rest before chop we got the stringer in place dropped it with a clank and fitted the static clamps that held it to the risebeams the female half of the epoxy team started slopping glue on it before we even had it secured her partner was waiting for the stringer on the other side the floor team was waiting at the foot of the bridge each one holding a piece of the light stressed permaplast over his head like an umbrella they were dry and clean i wondered aloud what they had done to deserve it and rogers suggested a couple of colorful but unlikely possibilities we were going back to stand by the next stringer when the field firsthe was named dougelstein but we called him awrightblew a whistle and bellowed awright soldier boys and girls ten minutes smoke em if you got em he reached into his pocket and turned on the control that heated our coveralls rogers and i sat down on our end of the stringer and i took out my weed box i had lots of joints but we werent allowed to smoke them until after nightchop the only tobacco i had was a cigarro butt about three inches long i lit it on the side of the box it wasnt too bad after the first couple of puffs rogers took a puff to be sociable but made a face and gave it back were you in school when you got drafted she asked yeah just got a degree in physics was going after a teachers certificate she nodded soberly i was in biology figures i ducked a handful of slush how far six years bachelors and technical she slid her boot along the ground turning up a ridge of mud and slush the consistency of freezing ice milk why the hell did this have to happen i shrugged it didnt call for an answer least of all the answer that the unef kept giving us intellectual and physical elite of the planet going out to guard humanity against the tauran menace it was all just a big experience see whether we could goad the taurans into ground action awright blew the whistle two minutes early as expected but rogers and i and the other two stringers got to sit for a minute while the epoxy and floor teams finished covering our stringer it got cold fast sitting there with our suits turned off but we remained inactive on principle i really didnt see the sense of us having to train in the cold typical army halflogic sure it was going to be cold where we were going but not icecold or snowcold almost by definition a portal planet remained within a degree or two of absolute zero all the time since collapsars dont shineand the first chill you felt would mean that you were a dead man twelve years before when i was ten years old they had discovered the collapsar jump just fling an object at a collapsar with sufficient speed and it pops out in some other part of the galaxy it didnt take long to figure out the formula that predicted where it would come out it just traveled along the same lineactually an einsteinian geodesicit would have followed if the collapsar hadnt been in the wayuntil it reaches another collapsar field whereupon it reappears repelled with the same speed it had approaching the original collapsar travel time between the two collapsars is exactly zero it made a lot of work for mathematical physicists who had to redefine simultaneity then tear down general relativity and build it back up again and it made the politicians very happy because now they could send a shipload of colonists to fomalhaut for less than it once cost to put a brace of men on the moon there were a lot of people the politicians would just love to see on fomalhaut implementing a glorious adventure instead of stirring up trouble at home the ships were always accompanied by an automated probe that followed a couple of million miles behind we knew about the portal planets little bits of flotsam that whirled around the collapsars the purpose of the drone was to come back and tell us in the event that a ship had smacked into a portal planet at of the speed of light that particular catastrophe never happened but one day a drone did come limping back alone its data were analyzed and it turned out that the colonists ship had been pursued by another vessel and destroyed this happened near aldebaran in the constellation taurus but since aldebaranian is a little hard to handle they named the enemy taurans colonizing vessels thenceforth went out protected by an armed guard often the armed guard went out alone and finally the colonization effort itself slowed to a token trickle the united nations exploratory and colonization group got shortened to unef united nations exploratory force emphasis on the force then some bright lad in the general assembly decided that we ought to field an army of footsoldiers to guard the portal planets of the nearer collapsars this led to the elite conscription act of and the most rigorously selected army in the history of warfare so here we are fifty men and fifty women with iqs over and bodies of unusual health and strength slogging elitely through the mud and slush of central missouri reflecting on how useful our skill in building bridges will be on worlds where the only fluid will be your occasional standing pool of liquid helium about a month later we left for our final training exercise maneuvers on the planet charon though nearing perihelion it was still more than twice as far from the sun as pluto the troopship was a converted cattlewagon made to carry two hundred colonists and assorted bushes and beasts dont think it was roomy though just because there were half that many of us most of the excess space was taken up with extra reaction mass and ordnance the whole trip took three weeks accelerating at gs halfway decelerating the other half our top speed as we roared by the orbit of pluto was around one twentieth of the speed of lightnot quite enough for relativity to rear its complicated head three weeks of carrying around twice as much weight as normalits no picnic we did some cautious exercises three times a day and remained horizontal as much as possible still we had several broken bones and serious dislocations the men had to wear special supporters it was almost impossible to sleep what with nightmares of choking and being crushed and the necessity of rolling over periodically to prevent blood pooling and bedsores one girl got so fatigued that she almost slept through the experience of having a rib rub through to the open air id been in space several times before so when we finally stopped decelerating and went into free fall it was nothing but a relief but some people had never been out except for our training on the moon and succumbed to the sudden vertigo and disorientation the rest of us cleaned up after them floating through the quarters with sponges and inspirators to suck up globules of partlydigested concentrate highprotein lowresidue beef flavor soya a shuttle took us down to the surface in three trips i waited for the last one along with everybody else who wasnt bothered by free fall we had a good view of charon coming down from orbit there wasnt much to see though it was just a dim offwhite sphere with a few smudges on it we landed about two hundred meters from the base a pressurized crawler came out and mated with the ferry so we didnt have to suit up we clanked and squeaked up to the main building a featureless box of grayish plastic inside the walls were the same inspired color the rest of the company was sitting at desks chattering away there was a seat next to freeland jefffeeling better he still looked a little pale if the gods had meant for man to survive in free fall they would have given him a castiron glottis somewhat better dying for a smoke yeah you seemed to take it all right went up in school didnt you senior thesis in vacuum welding yeah three weeks in earth orbit i sat back and reached for my weed box for the thousandth time it still wasnt there of course the life support unit didnt want to handle nicotine and thc training was bad enough jeff groused but this crap i dont know id been thinking about it it might just all be worth it hell nothis is a space war let star fleet take care of ittheyre just going to send us out and either we sit for fifty years on some damn ice cube of a portal planet or we get well jeff youve got to look at it the other way too even if theres only one chance in a thousand that well be doing some good keeping the taurans tenchhut we stood up in a raggetyass fashion by twos and threes the door opened and a full major came in i stiffened a little he was the highestranking officer id ever seen he had a row of ribbons stitched into his coveralls including a purple strip meaning hed been wounded in combat fighting in the old american army must have been that indochina thing but it had fizzled out before i was born he didnt look that old sit sit he made a patting motion with his hand then he put his hands on his hips and scanned the company with a small smile on his face welcome to charon you picked a lovely day to land the temperature outside is a summery eight point one five degrees absolute we expect little change for the next two centuries or so some of us laughed halfheartedly youd best enjoy the tropical climate here at miami base enjoy it while you can were on the center of sunside here and most of your training will be on darkside over there the temperature drops to a chilly two point zero eight you might as well regard all the training you got on earth and the moon as just a warmup exercise to give you a fair chance of surviving charon youll have to go through your whole repertory here tools weapons maneuvers and youll find that at these temperatures tools dont work the way they should weapons dont want to fire and people move very cautiously he studied the clipboard in his hand right now you have fortynine women and fortyeight men two deaths one psychiatric release having read an outline of your training program im frankly surprised that so many of you pulled through but you might as well know that i wont be displeased if as few as fifty of you graduate from this final phase and the only way not to graduate is to die here the only way anybody gets back to earthincluding meis after a combat tour you will complete your training in one month from here you go to stargate collapsar a little over two lights away you will stay at the settlement on stargate i the largest portal planet until replacements arrive hopefully that will be no more than a month another group is due here as soon as you leave when you leave stargate you will be going to a strategically important collapsar set up a military base there and fight the enemy if attacked otherwise maintain the base until further orders the last two weeks of your training will consist of constructing such a base on darkside there you will be totally isolated from miami base no communication no medical evacuation no resupply sometime before the two weeks are up your defense facilities will be evaluated in an attack by guided drones they will be armed all of the permanent personnel here on charon are combat veterans thus all of us are forty to fifty years of age but i think we can keep up with you two of us will be with you at all times and will accompany you at least as far as stargate they are captain sherman stott your company commander and sergeant octavio cortez your first sergeant gentlemen two men in the front row stood easily and turned to face us captain stott was a little smaller than the major but cut from the same mold face hard and smooth as porcelain cynical halfsmile a precise centimeter of beard framing a large chin looking thirty at the most he wore a large gunpowdertype pistol on his hip sergeant cortez was another story his head was shaved and the wrong shape flattened out on one side where a large piece of skull had obviously been taken out his face was very dark and seamed with wrinkles and scars half his left ear was missing and his eyes were as expressive as buttons on a machine he had a moustacheandbeard combination that looked like a skinny white caterpillar taking a lap around his mouth on anybody else his schoolboy smile might look pleasant but he was about the ugliest meanestlooking creature id ever seen still if you didnt look at his head and considered the lower six feet or so he could pose as the after advertisement for a bodybuilding spa neither stott nor cortez wore any ribbons cortez had a small pocketlaser suspended in a magnetic rig sideways under his left armpit it had wooden grips that were worn very smooth now before i turn you over to the tender mercies of these two gentlemen let me caution you again two months ago there was not a living soul on this planet a working force of fortyfive men struggled for a month to erect this base twentyfour of them more than half died in the construction of it this is the most dangerous planet men have ever tried to live on but the places youll be going will be this bad and worse your cadre will try to keep you alive for the next month listen to themand follow their example all of them have survived here for longer than youll have to captain the captain stood up as the major went out the door tenchhut the last syllable was like an explosion and we all jerked to our feet now im only gonna say this once so you better listen he growled we are in a combat situation here and in a combat situation there is only one penalty for disobedience and insubordination he jerked the pistol from his hip and held it by the barrel like a club this is an army model automatic pistol caliber and it is a primitive but effective weapon the sergeant and i are authorized to use our weapons to kill to enforce discipline dont make us do it because we will we will he put the pistol back the holster snap made a loud crack in the dead quiet sergeant cortez and i between us have killed more people than are sitting in this room both of us fought in vietnam on the american side and both of us joined the united nations international guard more than ten years ago i took a break in grade from major for the privilege of commanding this company and first sergeant cortez took a break from submajor because we are both combat soldiers and this is the first combat situation since keep in mind what ive said while the first sergeant instructs you more specifically in what your duties will be under this command take over sergeant he turned on his heel and strode out of the room with the little smile on his face that hadnt changed one millimeter during the whole harangue the first sergeant moved like a heavy machine with lots of ball bearings when the door hissed shut he swiveled ponderously to face us and said at ease siddown in a surprisingly gentle voice he sat on a table in the front of the room it creakedbut held now the captain talks scary and i look scary but we both mean well youll be working pretty closely with me so you better get used to this thing ive got hanging in front of my brain you probably wont see the captain much except on maneuvers he touched the flat part of his head and speaking of brains i still have just about all mine in spite of chinese efforts to the contrary all of us old vets who mustered into unef had to pass the same criteria that got you drafted by the elite conscription act so i suspect all of you are smart and toughbut just keep in mind that the captain and i are smart and tough and experienced he flipped through the roster without really looking at it now as the captain said therell be only one kind of disciplinary action on maneuvers capital punishment but normally we wont have to kill you for disobeying charonll save us the trouble back in the billeting area itll be another story we dont much care what you do inside but once you suit up and go outside youve gotta have discipline that would shame a centurian there will be situations where one stupid act could kill us all anyhow the first thing weve gotta do is get you fitted to your fighting suits the armorers waiting at your billet hell take you one at a time lets go now i know you got lectured and lectured on what a fighting suit can do back on earth the armorer was a small man partially bald with no insignia of rank on his coveralls sergeant cortez told us to call him sir since he was a lieutenant but id like to reinforce a couple of points maybe add some things your instructors earthside werent clear about or couldnt know your first sergeant was kind enough to consent to being my visual aid sergeant cortez slipped out of his coveralls and came up to the little raised platform where a fighting suit was standing popped open like a manshaped clam he backed into it and slipped his arms into the rigid sleeves there was a click and the thing swung shut with a sigh it was bright green with cortez stenciled in white letters on the helmet camouflage sergeant the green faded to white then dirty gray this is good camouflage for charon and most of your portal planets said cortez from a deep well but there are several other combinations available the gray dappled and brightened to a combination of greens and browns jungle then smoothed out to a hard light ochre desert dark brown darker to a deep flat black night or space very good sergeant to my knowledge this is the only feature of the suit which was perfected after your training the control is around your left wrist and is admittedly awkward but once you find the right combination its easy to lock in now you didnt get much insuit training earthside because we didnt want you to get used to using the thing in a friendly environment the fighting suit is the deadliest personal weapon ever built and with no weapon it is easier for the user to kill himself through carelessness turn around sergeant case in point he tapped a square protuberance between the shoulders exhaust fins as you know the suit tries to keep you at a comfortable temperature no matter what the weathers like outside the material of the suit is as near to a perfect insulator as we could get consistent with mechanical demands therefore these fins get hotespecially hot compared to darkside temperaturesas they bleed off the bodys heat all you have to do is lean up against a boulder of frozen gas theres lots of it around the gas will sublime off faster than it can escape from the fins in escaping it will push against the surrounding ice and fracture itand in about one hundredth of a second you have the equivalent of a hand grenade going off right below your neck youll never feel a thing variations on this theme have killed eleven people in the past two months and they were just building a bunch of huts i assume you know how easily the waldo capabilities can kill you or your companions anybody want to shake hands with the sergeant he stepped over and clasped his glove hes had lots of practice until you have be extremely careful you might scratch an itch and wind up bleeding to death remember semilogarithmic repose two pounds pressure exerts five pounds force three pounds gives ten four pounds twentythree five pounds fortyseven most of you can muster up a grip of well over a hundred pounds theoretically you could rip a steel girder in two with that amplified actually youd destroy the material of your gloves and at least on charon die very quickly itd be a race between decompression and flashfreezing youd be the loser the leg waldos are also dangerous even though the amplification is less extreme until youre really skilled dont try to run or jump youre likely to trip and that means youre likely to die charons gravity is threefourths of earth normal so its not too bad but on a really small world like luna you could take a running jump and not come down for twenty minutes just keep sailing over the horizon maybe bash into a mountain at eighty meters per second on a small asteroid itd be no trick at all to run up to escape velocity and be off on an informal tour of intergalactic space its a slow way to travel tomorrow morning well start teaching you how to stay alive inside of this infernal machine the rest of the afternoon and evening ill call you one at a time to be fitted thats all sergeant cortez went to the door and turned the stopcock that let air into the air lock a bank of infrared lamps went on to keep the air from freezing inside it when the pressures were equalized he shut the stopcock unclamped the door and stepped in clamping it shut behind him a pump hummed for about a minute evacuating the air lock then he stepped out and sealed the outside door it was pretty much like the ones on luna first i want private omar almizar the rest of you can go find your bunks ill call you over the squawker alphabetical order sir yep about ten minutes apiece if your name begins with z you might as well get sacked that was rogers she probably was thinking about getting sacked the sun was a hard white point directly overhead it was a lot brighter than i had expected it to be since we were eighty aus out it was only th as bright as it is on earth still it was putting out about as much light as a powerful streetlamp this is considerably more light than youll have on a portal planet captain stotts voice crackled in our collective ear be glad that youll be able to watch your step we were lined up single file on a permaplast sidewalk connecting the billet and the supply hut wed practiced walking inside all morning and this wasnt any different except for the exotic scenery though the light was rather dim you could see all the way to the horizon quite clearly with no atmosphere in the way a black cliff that looked too regular to be natural stretched from one horizon to the other passing within a kilometer of us the ground was obsidianblack mottled with patches of white or bluish ice next to the supply hut was a small mountain of snow in a bin marked oxygen the suit was fairly comfortable but it gave you the odd feeling of being simultaneously a marionette and a puppeteer you apply the impulse to move your leg and the suit picks it up and magnifies it and moves your leg for you today were only going to walk around the company area and nobody will leave the company area the captain wasnt wearing his but he had a laserfinger like the rest of us and his was probably hooked up keeping an interval of at least two meters between each person we stepped off the permaplast and followed the captain over the smooth rock we walked carefully for about an hour spiraling out and finally stopped at the far edge of the perimeter now everybody pay close attention im going out to that blue slab of iceit was a big one about twenty meters awayand show you something that youd better know if you want to live he walked out a dozen confident steps first i have to heat up a rockfilters down i slapped the stud under my armpit and the filter slid into place over my image converter the captain pointed his finger at a black rock the size of a basketball and gave it a short burst the glare rolled a long shadow of the captain over us and beyond the rock shattered into a pile of hazy splinters it doesnt take long for these to cool down he stooped and picked up a piece this one is probably twenty or twentyfive degrees watch he tossed the warm rock on the ice slab it skittered around in a crazy pattern and shot off the side he tossed another one and it did the same as you know you are not quite perfectly insulated these rocks are about the temperature of the soles of your boots if you try to stand on a slab of hydrogen the same thing will happen to you except that the rock is already dead the reason for this behavior is that the rock makes a slick interface with the icea little puddle of liquid hydrogenand rides a few molecules above the liquid on a cushion of hydrogen vapor this makes the rock or you a frictionless bearing as far as the ice is concerned and you cant stand up without any friction under your boots after you have lived in your suit for a month or so you should be able to survive falling down but right now you just dont know enough watch the captain flexed and hopped up onto the slab his feet shot out from under him and he twisted around in midair landing on hands and knees he slipped off and stood on the ground the idea is to keep your exhaust fins from making contact with the frozen gas compared to the ice they are as hot as a blast furnace and contact with any weight behind it will result in an explosion after that demonstration we walked around for another hour or so and returned to the billet once through the air lock we had to mill around for a while letting the suits get up to something like room temperature somebody came up and touched helmets with me william she had mccoy stenciled above her faceplate hi sean anything special i just wondered if you had anyone to sleep with tonight thats right id forgotten there wasnt any sleeping roster here everybody just chose his own partner sure i mean uh nono i havent asked anybody sure if you want to thanks william see you later i watched her walk away and thought that if anybody could make a fighting suit look sexy itd be sean but even sean couldnt cortez decided we were warm enough and led us to the suit room where we backed the things into place and hooked them up to the charging plateseach suit had a little chunk of plutonium that would power it for several years but we were supposed to run on fuel cells as much as possible after a lot of shuffling around everybody finally got plugged in and we were allowed to unsuit ninetyseven naked chickens squirming out of bright green eggs it was coldthe air the floor and especially the suitsand we made a pretty disorderly exit toward the lockers i slipped on tunic trousers and sandals and was still cold i took my cup and joined the line for soya everybody jumping up and down to keep warm how ccold do you think it is mmandella that was mccoy i dont even want to think about it i stopped jumping and rubbed myself as briskly as possible while holding a cup in one hand at least as cold as missouri was ungwish theyd get some damn heat in this place it always affects the small girls more than anybody else mccoy was the littlest one in the company a waspwaist doll barely five feet high theyve got the airco going it cant be long now i wish i was a big slab of meat like you i was glad she wasnt we had our first casualty on the third day learning how to dig holes with such large amounts of energy stored in a soldiers weapons it wouldnt be practical for him to hack out a hole in the frozen ground with the conventional pick and shovel still you can launch grenades all day and get nothing but shallow depressionsso the usual method is to bore a hole in the ground with the hand laser drop a timed charge in after its cooled down and ideally fill the hole with stuff of course theres not much loose rock on charon unless youve already blown a hole nearby the only difficult thing about the procedure is getting away to be safe we were told youve got to either be behind something really solid or be at least a hundred meters away youve got about three minutes after setting the charge but you cant just spring away not on charon the accident happened when we were making a really deep hole the kind you want for a large underground bunker for this we had to blow a hole then climb down to the bottom of the crater and repeat the procedure again and again until the hole was deep enough inside the crater we used charges with a fiveminute delay but it hardly seemed enough timeyou really had to go slow picking your way up the craters edge just about everybody had blown a double hole everybody but me and three others i guess we were the only ones paying really close attention when bovanovitch got into trouble all of us were a good two hundred meters away with my image converter turned up to about forty power i watched her disappear over the rim of the crater after that i could only listen in on her conversation with cortez im on the bottom sergeant normal radio procedure was suspended for these maneuvers only the trainee and cortez could broadcast ok move to the center and clear out the rubble take your time no rush until you pull the pin sure sergeant we could hear small echoes of rocks clattering sound conduction through her boots she didnt say anything for several minutes found bottom she sounded a little out of breath ice or rock oh its rock sergeant the greenish stuff use a low setting then one point two dispersion four god darn it sergeant thatll take forever yeah but that stuffs got hydrated crystals in itheat it up too fast and you might make it fracture and wed just have to leave you there girl ok one point two dee four the inside edge of the crater flickered red with reflected laser light when you get about half a meter deep squeeze it up to dee two roger it took her exactly seventeen minutes three of them at dispersion two i could imagine how tired her shooting arm was now rest for a few minutes when the bottom of the hole stops glowing arm the charge and drop it in then walk out understand youll have plenty of time i understand sergeant walk out she sounded nervous well you dont often have to tiptoe away from a twenty microton tachyon bomb we listened to her breathing for a few minutes here goes faint slithering sound of the bomb sliding down slow and easy now youve got five minutes yyeah five her footsteps started out slow and regular then after she started climbing the side the sounds were less regular maybe a little frantic and with four minutes to go crap a loud scraping noise then clatters and bumps whats wrong private oh crap silence crap private you dont wanna get shot you tell me whats wrong iim stuck damn rockslidedo something i cant move i cant move i i shut up how deep cant move my crap my damn legs help me then damn it use your armspushyou can move a ton with each hand three minutes then she stopped cussing and started to mumble in russian i guess a low monotone she was panting and you could hear rocks tumbling away im free two minutes go as fast as you can cortezs voice was flat emotionless at ninety seconds she appeared crawling over the rim run girlyou better run she ran five or six steps and fell skidded a few meters and got back up running fell again got up again it looked like she was going pretty fast but she had only covered about thirty meters when cortez said all right bovanovitch get down on your stomach and lie still ten seconds but she didnt hear him or she wanted to get just a little more distance and she kept running careless leaping strides and at the high point of one leap there was a flash and a rumble and something big hit her below the neck and her headless body spun off end over end through space trailing a redblack spiral of flashfrozen blood that settled gracefully to the ground a path of crystal powder that nobody disturbed while we gathered rocks to cover the juiceless thing at the end of it that night cortez didnt lecture us didnt even show up for nightchop we were all very polite to each other and everybody was afraid to talk about it i sacked with rogers everybody sacked with a good friend but all she wanted to do was cry and she cried so long and so hard that she got me doing it too fire team amove out the twelve of us advanced in a ragged line toward the simulated bunker it was about a kilometer away across a carefully prepared obstacle course we could move pretty fast since all of the ice had been cleared from the field but even with ten days experience we werent ready to do more than an easy jog i carried a grenade launcher loaded with tenthmicroton practice grenades everybody had their laserfingers set at point oh eight dee one not much more than a flashlight this was a simulated attackthe bunker and its robot defender cost too much to be used once and thrown away team b follow team leaders take over we approached a clump of boulders at about the halfway mark and potter my team leader said stop and cover we clustered behind the rocks and waited for team b barely visible in their blackened suits the dozen men and women whispered by us as soon as they were clear they jogged left out of our line of sight fire red circles of light danced a halfclick downrange where the bunker was just visible five hundred meters was the limit for these practice grenades but i might luck out so i lined the launcher up on the image of the bunker held it at a angle and popped off a salvo of three return fire from the bunker started before my grenades even landed its automatic lasers were no more powerful than the ones we were using but a direct hit would deactivate your image converter leaving you blind it was setting down a random field of fire not even coming close to the boulders we were hiding behind three magnesiumbright flashes blinked simultaneously about thirty meters short of the bunker mandella i thought you were supposed to be good with that thing damn it potterit only throws half a click once we get closer ill lay em right on top every time sure you will i didnt say anything she wouldnt be team leader forever besides she hadnt been such a bad girl before the power went to her head since the grenadier is the assistant team leader i was slaved into potters radio and could hear b team talk to her potter this is freeman losses potter hereno looks like they were concentrating on you yeah we lost three right now were in a depression about eighty a hundred meters down from you we can give cover whenever youre ready ok start soft click a team follow me she slid out from behind the rock and turned on the faint pink beacon beneath her powerpack i turned on mine and moved out to run alongside of her and the rest of the team fanned out in a trailing wedge nobody fired while b team laid down a cover for us all i could hear was potters breathing and the soft crunchcrunch of my boots couldnt see much of anything so i tongued the image converter up to a log two intensification that made the image kind of blurry but adequately bright looked like the bunker had b team pretty well pinned down they were getting quite a roasting all of their return fire was laser they must have lost their grenadier potter this is mandella shouldnt we take some of the heat off b team soon as i can find us good enough cover is that all right with you private shed been promoted to corporal for the duration of the exercise we angled to the right and laid down behind a slab of rock most of the others found cover nearby but a few had to just hug the ground freeman this is potter potter this is smithy freemans out samuels is out we only have five men left give us some cover so we can get roger smithyclickopen up a team the bs are really hurtin i peeked out over the edge of the rock my rangefinder said that the bunker was about three hundred fifty meters away still pretty far i aimed just a smidgeon high and popped three then down a couple of degrees and three more the first ones overshot by about twenty meters then the second salvo flared up directly in front of the bunker i tried to hold on that angle and popped fifteen the rest of the magazine in the same direction i should have ducked down behind the rock to reload but i wanted to see where the fifteen would land so i kept my eyes on the bunker while i reached back to unclip another magazine when the laser hit my image converter there was a red glare so intense it seemed to go right through my eyes and bounce off the back of my skull it must have been only a few milliseconds before the converter overloaded and went blind but the bright green afterimage hurt my eyes for several minutes since i was officially dead my radio automatically cut off and i had to remain where i was until the mock battle was over with no sensory input besides the feel of my own skinand it ached where the image converter had shone on itand the ringing in my ears it seemed like an awfully long time finally a helmet clanked against mine you ok mandella potters voice sorry i died of boredom twenty minutes ago stand up and take my hand i did so and we shuffled back to the billet it must have taken over an hour she didnt say anything more all the way backits a pretty awkward way to communicatebut after wed cycled through the air lock and warmed up she helped me undo my suit i got ready for a mild tonguelashing but when the suit popped open before i could even get my eyes adjusted to the light she grabbed me around the neck and planted a wet kiss on my mouth nice shooting mandella huh the last salvo before you got hitfour direct hits the bunker decided it was knocked out and all we had to do was walk the rest of the way great i scratched my face under the eyes and some dry skin flaked off she giggled you should see yourself you look like all personnel report to the assembly area that was the captains voice bad news she handed me a tunic and sandals lets go the assembly areachop hall was just down the corridor there was a row of rollcall buttons at the door i pressed the one beside my name four of the names were covered with black tape that was good we hadnt lost anybody else during todays maneuvers the captain was sitting on the raised dais which at least meant we didnt have to go through the tenchhut bullshit the place filled up in less than a minute a soft chime indicated the roll was complete captain stott didnt stand up you did fairly well today nobody got killed and i expected some to in that respect you exceeded my expectations but in every other respect you did a poor job i am glad youre taking good care of yourselves because each of you represents an investment of over a million dollars and onefourth of a human life but in this simulated battle against a very stupid robot enemy thirtyseven of you managed to walk into laser fire and be killed in a simulated way and since dead people require no food you will require no food for the next three days each person who was a casualty in this battle will be allowed only two liters of water and a vitamin ration each day we knew enough not to groan or anything but there were some pretty disgusted looks especially on the faces that had singed eyebrows and a pink rectangle of sunburn framing their eyes mandella sir you are far and away the worst burned casualty was your image converter set on normal oh crap no sir log two i see who was your team leader for the exercise acting corporal potter sir private potter did you order him to use image intensification sir ii dont remember you dont well as a memory exercise you may join the dead people is that satisfactory yes sir good dead people get one last meal tonight and go on no rations starting tomorrow are there any questions he must have been kidding all right dismissed i selected the meal that looked as if it had the most calories and took my tray over to sit by potter that was a quixotic damn thing to do but thanks nothing ive been wanting to lose a few pounds anyway i couldnt see where she was carrying any extra i know a good exercise i said she smiled without looking up from her tray have anybody for tonight kind of thought id ask jeff better hurry then hes lusting after uhuru well that was mostly true everybody did i dont know maybe we ought to save our strength that third day come on i scratched the back of her hand lightly with a fingernail we havent sacked since missouri maybe ive learned something new maybe you have she tilted her head up at me in a sly way ok actually she was the one with the new trick the french corkscrew she called it she wouldnt tell me who taught it to her though id like to shake his hand the two weeks training around miami base eventually cost us eleven lives twelve if you count dahlquist i guess having to spend the rest of your life on charon with a hand and both legs missing is close enough to dying little foster was crushed in a landslide and freeland had a suit malfunction that froze him solid before we could carry him inside most of the other deaders were people i didnt know all that well but they all hurt and they seemed to make us more scared rather than more cautious now darkside a flier brought us over in groups of twenty and set us down beside a pile of building materials thoughtfully immersed in a pool of helium ii we used grapples to haul the stuff out of the pool its not safe to go wading since the stuff crawls all over you and its hard to tell whats underneath you could walk out onto a slab of hydrogen and be out of luck id suggested that we try to boil away the pool with our lasers but ten minutes of concentrated fire didnt drop the helium level appreciably it didnt boil either helium ii is a superfluid so what evaporation there was had to take place evenly all over the surface no hot spots so no bubbling we werent supposed to use lights to avoid detection there was plenty of starlight with your image converter cranked up to log three or four but each stage of amplification meant some loss of detail by log four the landscape looked like a crude monochrome painting and you couldnt read the names on peoples helmets unless they were right in front of you the landscape wasnt all that interesting anyhow there were half a dozen mediumsized meteor cratersall with exactly the same level of helium ii in themand the suggestion of some puny mountains just over the horizon the uneven ground was the consistency of frozen spiderwebs every time you put your foot down youd sink half an inch with a squeaking crunch it could get on your nerves it took most of a day to pull all the stuff out of the pool we took shifts napping which you could do either standing up sitting or lying on your stomach i didnt do well in any of those positions so i was anxious to get the bunker built and pressurized we could build the thing undergrounditd just fill up with helium iiso the first thing to do was to build an insulating platform a permaplastvacuum sandwich three layers tall i was an acting corporal with a crew of ten people we were carrying the permaplast layers to the building sitetwo people can carry one easilywhen one of my men slipped and fell on his back damn it singer watch your step wed had a couple of deaders that way sorry corporal im bushed just got my feet tangled up yeah just watch it he got back up all right and with his partner placed the sheet and went back to get another i kept my eye on him in a few minutes he was practically staggering not easy to do with that suit of cybernetic armor singer after you set that plank i want to see you ok he labored through the task and mooched over let me check your readout i opened the door on his chest to expose the medical monitor his temperature was two degrees high blood pressure and heart rate both elevated not up to the red line though you sick or something hell mandella i feel ok just tired since i fell ive been a little dizzy i chinned the medics combination doc this is mandella you wanna come over here for a minute sure where are you i waved and he walked over from poolside whats the problem i showed him singers readout he knew what all the other little dials and things meant so it took him a while as far as i can tell mandellahes just hot hell i coulda told you that said singer maybe you better have the armorer take a look at his suit we had two people whod taken a crash course in suit maintenance they were our armorers i chinned sanchez and asked him to come over with his tool kit be a couple of minutes corporal carryin a plank well put it down and get on over here i was getting an uneasy feeling waiting for him the medic and i looked over singers suit uhoh doc jones said look at this i went around to the back and looked where he was pointing two of the fins on the heat exchanger were bent out of shape what is wrong singer asked you fell on your heat exchanger right sure corporalthats it it must not be working right i dont think its working at all said doc sanchez came over with his diagnostic kit and we told him what had happened he looked at the heat exchanger then plugged a couple of jacks into it and got a digital readout from a little monitor in his kit i didnt know what it was measuring but it came out zero to eight decimal places heard a soft click sanchez chinning my private frequency corporal this guys a deader what cant you fix the damn thing maybemaybe i could if i could take it apart but theres no way hey sanchez singer was talking on the general freak find out whats wrong he was panting click keep your pants on man were working on it click he wont last long enough for us to get the bunker pressurized and i cant work on that heat exchanger from outside of the suit youve got a spare suit havent you two of em the fitanybody kind but theres no placesay right go get one of the suits warmed up i chinned the general freak listen singer weve gotta get you out of that thing sanchez has a spare unit but to make the switch were gonna have to build a house around you understand huhuh look well just make a box with you inside and hook it up to the lifesupport unit that way you can breathe while you make the switch souns pretty compiscomplicated tme look just come along ill be all right man jus lemme res i grabbed his arm and led him to the building site he was really weaving doc took his other arm and between us we kept him from falling over corporal ho this is corporal mandella ho was in charge of the lifesupport unit go away mandella im busy youre going to be busier i outlined the problem to her while her group hurried to adapt the lsufor this purpose it need only be an air hose and heateri got my crew to bring around six slabs of permaplast so we could build a big box around singer and the extra suit it would look like a huge coffin a meter square and six meters long we set the suit down on the slab that would be the floor of the coffin ok singer lets go no answer singer he was just standing there doc jones checked his readout hes out man unconscious my mind raced there might just be room for another person in the box give me a hand here i took singers shoulders and doc took his feet and we carefully laid him out at the feet of the empty suit then i laid down myself above the suit ok close er up look mandella if anybody goes in there it oughta be me no doc my job my man that sounded all wrong william mandella boy hero they stood a slab up on edgeit had two openings for the lsu input and exhaustand proceeded to weld it to the bottom plank with a narrow laser beam on earth wed just use glue but here the only fluid was helium which has lots of interesting properties but is definitely not sticky after about ten minutes we were completely walled up i could feel the lsu humming i switched on my suit lightthe first time since we landed on darksideand the glare made purple blotches dance in front of my eyes mandella this is ho stay in your suit at least two or three minutes were putting hot air in but its coming back just this side of liquid i lay and watched the purple fade ok its still cold but you can make it i popped my suit it wouldnt open all the way but i didnt have too much trouble getting out the suit was still cold enough to take some skin off my fingers and butt as i wiggled out i had to crawl feetfirst down the coffin to get to singer it got darker fast moving away from my light when i popped his suit a rush of hot stink hit me in the face in the dim light his skin was dark red and splotchy his breathing was very shallow and i could see his heart palpitating first iunhooked the relief tubesan unpleasant businessthen the bio sensors and then i had the problem of getting his arms out of their sleeves its pretty easy to do for yourself you twist this way and turn that way and the arm pops out doing it from the outside is a different matter i had to twist his arm and then reach under and move the suits arm to matchand it takes muscle to move a suit around from the outside once i had one arm out it was pretty easy i just crawled forward putting my feet on the suits shoulders and pulled on his free arm he slid out of the suit like an oyster slipping out of its shell i popped the spare suit and after a lot of pulling and pushing managed to get his legs in hooked up the bio sensors and the front relief tube hed have to do the other one himself its too complicated for the nth time i was glad not to have been born female they have to have two of those damned plumbers friends instead of just one and a simple hose i left his arms out of the sleeves the suit would be useless for any kind of work anyhow waldos have to be tailored to the individual his eyelids fluttered mandella wherethe hell i explained slowly and he seemed to get most of it now im gonna close you up and go get into my suit ill have the crew cut the end off this thing and ill haul you out got it he nodded strange to see thatwhen you nod or shrug in a suit it doesnt communicate anything i crawled into my suit hooked up the attachments and chinned the general freak doc i think hes gonna be ok get us out of here now will do hos voice the lsu hum was replaced by a chatter then a throb evacuating the box to prevent an explosion one corner of the seam grew red then white and a bright crimson beam lanced through not a foot away from my head i scrunched back as far as i could the beam slid up the seam and around three corners back to where it started the end of the box fell away slowly trailing filaments of melted plast wait for the stuff to harden mandella sanchez im not that stupid here you go somebody tossed a line to me that would be smarter than dragging him out by myself i threaded a long bight under his arms and tied it behind his neck then i scrambled out to help them pull which was sillythey had a dozen people already lined up to haul singer got out all right and was actually sitting up while doc jones checked his readout people were asking me about it and congratulating me when suddenly ho said look and pointed toward the horizon it was a black ship coming in fast i just had time to think it wasnt fair they werent supposed to attack until the last few days and then the ship was right on top of us we all flopped to the ground instinctively but the ship didnt attack it blasted braking rockets and dropped to land on skids then it skied around to come to a rest beside the building site everybody had it figured out and was standing around sheepishly when the two suited figures stepped out of the ship a familiar voice crackled over the general freak every one of you saw us coming in and not one of you responded with laser fire it wouldnt have done any good but it would have indicated a certain amount of fighting spirit you have a week or less before the real thing and since the sergeant and i will be here i will insist that you show a little more will to live acting sergeant potter here sir get me a detail of twelve men to unload cargo we brought a hundred small robot drones for target practice so that you might have at least a fighting chance when a live target comes over move now we only have thirty minutes before the ship returns to miami i checked and it was actually more like forty minutes having the captain and sergeant there didnt really make much difference we were still on our own they were just observing once we got the floor down it only took one day to complete the bunker it was a gray oblong featureless except for the airlock blister and four windows on top was a swivelmounted bevawatt laser the operatoryou couldnt call him a gunnersat in a chair holding deadman switches in both hands the laser wouldnt fire as long as he was holding one of those switches if he let go it would automatically aim for any moving aerial object and fire at will primary detection and aiming was by means of a kilometerhigh antenna mounted beside the bunker it was the only arrangement that could really be expected to work with the horizon so close and human reflexes so slow you couldnt have the thing fully automatic because in theory friendly ships might also approach the aiming computer could choose up to twelve targets appearing simultaneouslyfiring at the largest ones first and it would get all twelve in the space of half a second the installation was partly protected from enemy fire by an efficient ablative layer that covered everything except the human operator but then they were deadman switches one man above guarding eighty inside the armys good at that kind of arithmetic once the bunker was finished half of us stayed inside at all timesfeeling very much like targetstaking turns operating the laser while the other half went on maneuvers about four clicks from the base was a large lake of frozen hydrogen one of our most important maneuvers was to learn how to get around on the treacherous stuff it really wasnt too difficult you couldnt stand up on it so you had to belly down and slide if you had somebody to push you from the edge getting started was no problem otherwise you had to scrabble with your hands and feet pushing down as hard as was practical until you started moving in a series of little jumps once started you would keep going until you ran out of ice you could steer a little bit by digging in hand and foot on the appropriate side but you couldnt slow to a stop that way so it was a good idea not to go too fast and to be positioned in such a way that your helmet didnt absorb the shock of stopping we went through all the things wed done on the miami side weapons practice demolition attack patterns we also launched drones at irregular intervals toward the bunker thus ten or fifteen times a day the operators got to demonstrate their skill in letting go of the handles as soon as the proximity light went on i had four hours of that like everybody else i was nervous until the first attack when i saw how little there was to it the light went on i let go the gun aimed and when the drone peeped over the horizonzzt nice touch of color the molten metal spraying through space otherwise not too exciting so none of us were worried about the upcoming graduation exercise thinking it would be just more of the same miami base attacked on the thirteenth day with two simultaneous missiles streaking over opposite sides of the horizon at some forty kilometers per second the laser vaporized the first one with no trouble but the second got within eight clicks of the bunker before it was hit we were coming back from maneuvers about a click away from the bunker i wouldnt have seen it happen if i hadnt been looking directly at the bunker the moment of the attack the second missile sent a shower of molten debris straight toward the bunker eleven pieces hit and as we later reconstructed it this is what happened the first casualty was uhuru pretty uhuru inside the bunker who was hit in the back and head and died instantly with the drop in pressure the lsu went into high gear friedman was standing in front of the main airco outlet and was blown into the opposite wall hard enough to knock him unconscious he died of decompression before the others could get him to his suit everybody else managed to stagger through the gale and get into their suits but garcias suit had been holed and didnt do him any good by the time we got there they had turned off the lsu and were welding up the holes in the wall one man was trying to scrape up the unrecognizable mess that had been uhuru i could hear him sobbing and retching they had already taken garcia and friedman outside for burial the captain took over the repair detail from potter sergeant cortez led the sobbing man over to a corner and came back to work on cleaning up uhurus remains alone he didnt order anybody to help and nobody volunteered as a graduation exercise we were unceremoniously stuffed into a shipearths hope the same one we rode to charonand bundled off to stargate at a little more than g the trip seemed endless about six months subjective time and boring but not as hard on the carcass as going to charon had been captain stott made us review our training orally day by day and we did exercises every day until we were worn to a collective frazzle stargate i was like charons darkside only more so the base on stargate i was smaller than miami baseonly a little bigger than the one we constructed on darksideand we were due to lay over a week to help expand the facilities the crew there was very glad to see us especially the two females who looked a little worn around the edges we all crowded into the small dining hall where submajor williamson the man in charge of stargate i gave us some disconcerting news everybody get comfortable get off the tables though theres plenty of floor i have some idea of what you just went through training on charon i wont say its all been wasted but where youre headed things will be quite different warmer he paused to let that soak in aleph aurigae the first collapsar ever detected revolves around the normal star epsilon aurigae in a twentysevenyear orbit the enemy has a base of operations not on a regular portal planet of aleph but on a planet in orbit around epsilon we dont know much about the planet just that it goes around epsilon once every seven hundred fortyfive days is about threefourths the size of earth and has an albedo of meaning its probably covered with clouds we cant say precisely how hot it will be but judging from its distance from epsilon its probably rather hotter than earth of course we dont know whether youll be workingfighting on lightside or darkside equator or poles its highly unlikely that the atmosphere will be breathableat any rate youll stay inside your suits now you know exactly as much about where youre going as i do questions sir stein drawled now we know where were goinanybody know what were goin to do when we get there williamson shrugged thats up to your captainand your sergeant and the captain of earths hope and hopes logistic computer we just dont have enough data yet to project a course of action for you it may be a long and bloody battle it may be just a case of walking in to pick up the pieces conceivably the taurans might want to make a peace offercortez snortedin which case you would simply be part of our muscle our bargaining power he looked at cortez mildly no one can say for sure the orgy that night was kind of amusing but it was like trying to sleep in the middle of a raucous beach party the only area big enough to sleep all of us was the dining hall they draped a few bedsheets here and there for privacy then unleashed stargates eighteen sexstarved men on our women compliant and promiscuous by military customand lawbut desiring nothing so much as sleep on solid ground the eighteen men acted as if they were compelled to try as many permutations as possible and their performance was impressivein a strictly quantitative sense that is the next morningand every other morning we were on stargate iwe staggered out of bed and into our suits to go outside and work on the new wing eventually stargate would be tactical and logistic headquarters for the war with thousands of permanent personnel guarded by halfadozen heavy cruisers in hopes class when we started it was two shacks and twenty people when we left it was four shacks and twenty people the work was a breeze compared to darkside since we had all the light we needed and got sixteen hours inside for every eight hours work and no drone attacks for a final exam when we shuttled back up to the hope nobody was too happy about leavingthough some of the more popular females declared itd be good to get some reststargate was the last easy safe assignment wed have before taking up arms against the taurans and as williamson had pointed out the first day there was no way of predicting what that would be like most of us didnt feel too enthusiastic about making a collapsar jump either wed been assured that we wouldnt even feel it happen just free fall all the way i wasnt convinced as a physics student id had the usual courses in general relativity and theories of gravitation we only had a little direct data at that timestargate was discovered when i was in grade schoolbut the mathematical model seemed clear enough the collapsar stargate was a perfect sphere about three kilometers in radius it was suspended forever in a state of gravitational collapse that should have meant its surface was dropping toward its center at nearly the speed of light relativity propped it up at least gave it the illusion of being therethe way all reality becomes illusory and observeroriented when you study general relativity or buddhism at any rate there would be a theoretical point in spacetime when one end of our ship was just above the surface of the collapsar and the other end was a kilometer awayin our frame of reference in any sane universe this would set up tidal stresses and tear the ship apart and we would be just another million kilograms of degenerate matter on the theoretical surface rushing headlong to nowhere for the rest of eternity or dropping to the center in the next trillionth of a second you pays your money and you takes your frame of reference but they were right we blasted away from stargate i made a few course corrections and then just dropped for about an hour then a bell rang and we sank into our cushions under a steady two gravities of deceleration we were in enemy territory wed been decelerating at two gravities for almost nine days when the battle began lying on our couches being miserable all we felt were two soft bumps missiles being released some eight hours later the squawkbox crackled attention all crew this is the captain quinsana the pilot was only a lieutenant but was allowed to call himself captain aboard the vessel where he outranked all of us even captain stott you grunts in the cargo hold can listen too we just engaged the enemy with two fiftybevaton tachyon missiles and have destroyed both the enemy vessel and another object which it had launched approximately three microseconds before the enemy has been trying to overtake us for the past one hundred seventynine hours ship time at the time of the engagement the enemy was moving at a little over half the speed of light relative to aleph and was only about thirty aus from earths hope it was moving atc relative to us and thus we would have been coincident in spacetimerammedin a little more than nine hours the missiles were launched at ships time and destroyed the enemy at both tachyon bombs detonating within a thousand clicks of the enemy objects the two missiles were a type whose propulsion system itself was only a barelycontrolled tachyon bomb they accelerated at a constant rate of gs and were traveling at a relativistic speed by the time the nearby mass of the enemy ship detonated them we expect no further interference from enemy vessels our velocity with respect to aleph will be zero in another five hours we will then begin to journey back the return will take twentyseven days general moans and dejected cussing everybody knew all that already of course but we didnt care to be reminded of it so after another month of logycalisthenics and drill at a constant gs we got our first look at the planet we were going to attack invaders from outer space yes sir it was a blinding white crescent basking two aus from epsilon the captain had pinned down the location of the enemy base from fifty aus out and we had jockeyed in on a wide arc keeping the bulk of the planet between them and us that didnt mean we were sneaking up on themquite the contrary they launched three abortive attacksbut it put us in a stronger defensive position until we had to go to the surface that is then only the ship and its star fleet crew would be reasonably safe since the planet rotated rather slowlyonce every ten and onehalf daysa stationary orbit for the ship had to be one hundred fifty thousand clicks out this made the people in the ship feel quite secure with six thousand miles of rock and ninety thousand miles of space between them and the enemy but it meant a whole seconds time lag in communication between us on the ground and the ships battle computer a person could get awful dead while that neutrino pulse crawled up and back our vague orders were to attack the base and gain control while damaging a minimum of enemy equipment we were to take at least one enemy alive we were under no circumstances to allow ourselves to be taken alive however and the decision wasnt up to us one special pulse from the battle computer and that speck of plutonium in your power plant would fission with all of efficiency and youd be nothing but a rapidly expanding very hot plasma they strapped us into six scoutshipsone platoon of twelve people in eachand we blasted away from earths hope at gs each scoutship was supposed to follow its own carefully random path to our rendezvous point one hundred eight clicks from the base fourteen drone ships were launched at the same time to confound the enemys antispacecraft system the landing went off almost perfectly one ship suffered minor damage a near miss boiling away some of the ablative material on one side of the hull but itd still be able to make it and return as long as it kept its speed down while in the atmosphere we zigged and zagged and wound up first ship at the rendezvous point there was only one trouble it was under four kilometers of water i could almost hear that machine ninety thousand miles away grinding its mental gears adding this new bit of data we proceeded just as if we were landing on solid ground braking rockets falling skids out hit the water skip hit the water skip hit the water sink it would have made sense to go ahead and land on the bottomwe were streamlined after all and water just another fluidbut the hull wasnt strong enough to hold up a fourkilometer column of water sergeant cortez was in the scoutship with us sarge tell that computer to do something were gonna get oh shut up mandella trust in th lord lord was definitely lowercase when cortez said it there was a loud bubbly sigh then another and a slight increase in pressure on my back that meant the ship was rising flotation bags cortez didnt deign to answer or didnt know that must have been it we rose to within ten or fifteen meters of the surface and stopped suspended there through the port i could see the surface above shimmering like a mirror of hammered silver i wondered what it could be like to be a fish and have a definite roof over your world i watched another ship splash in it made a great cloud of bubbles and turbulence then fellslightly tailfirstfor a short distance before large bags popped out under each delta wing then it bobbed up to about our level and stayed soon all of the ships were floating within a few hundred meters of us like a school of ungainly fish this is captain stott now listen carefully there is a beach some twentyeight clicks from your present position in the direction of the enemy you will be proceeding to this beach by scoutship and from there will mount your assault on the tauran position that was some improvement wed only have to walk eighty clicks we deflated the bags blasted to the surface and flew in a slow spreadout formation to the beach it took several minutes as the ship scraped to a halt i could hear pumps humming making the cabin pressure equal to the air pressure outside before it had quite stopped moving the escape slot beside my couch slid open i rolled out onto the wing of the craft and jumped to the ground ten seconds to find coveri sprinted across loose gravel to the treeline a twisty bramble of tall sparse bluishgreen shrubs i dove into the briar path and turned to watch the ships leave the drones that were left rose slowly to about a hundred meters then took off in all directions with a bonejarring roar the real scoutships slid slowly back into the water maybe that was a good idea it wasnt a terribly attractive world but certainly would be easier to get around in than the cryogenic nightmare we were trained for the sky was a uniform dull silver brightness that merged with the mist over the ocean so completely as to make it impossible to tell where water ended and air began small wavelets licked at the black gravel shore much too slow and graceful in the threequarters earth normal gravity even from fifty meters away the rattle of billions of pebbles rolling with the tide was loud in my ears the air temperature was centigrade not quite hot enough for the sea to boil even though the air pressure was low compared to earths wisps of steam drifted quickly upward from the line where water met land i wondered how long a man would survive exposed here without a suit would the heat or the low oxygenpartial pressure oneeighth earth normalkill him first or was there some deadly microorganism that would beat them both this is cortez everybody come over and assemble by me he was standing on the beach a little to the left of me waving his hand in a circle over his head i walked toward him through the shrubs they were brittle unsubstantial seemed paradoxically driedout in the steamy air they wouldnt offer much in the way of cover well be advancing on a heading radians east of north i want platoon one to take point two and three follow about twenty meters behind to the left and right seven command platoon is in the middle twenty meters behind two and three five and six bring up the rear in a semicircular closed flank everybody straight sure we could do that arrowhead maneuver in our sleep ok lets move out i was in platoon seven the command group captain stott put me there not because i was expected to give any commands but because of my training in physics the command group was supposedly the safest place buffered by six platoons people were assigned to it because there was some tactical reason for them to survive at least a little longer than the rest cortez was there to give orders chavez was there to correct suit malfuncts the senior medic doc wilsonthe only medic who actually had an mdwas there and so was theodopolis the radio engineer our link with the captain who had elected to stay in orbit the rest of us were assigned to the command group by dint of special training or aptitude that wouldnt normally be considered of a tactical nature facing a totally unknown enemy there was no way of telling what might prove important thus i was there because i was the closest the company had to a physicist rogers was biology tate was chemistry he could crank out a perfect score on the rhine extrasensory perception test every time bohrs was a polyglot able to speak twentyone languages fluently idiomatically petrovs talent was that he had tested out to have not one molecule of xenophobia in his psyche keating was a skilled acrobat debby hollisterlucky hollistershowed a remarkable aptitude for making money and also had a consistently high rhine potential when we first set out we were using the jungle camouflage combination on our suits but what passed for jungle in these anemic tropics was too sparse we looked like a band of conspicuous harlequins trooping through the woods cortez had us switch to black but that was just as bad as the light from epsilon came evenly from all parts of the sky and there were no shadows except us we finally settled on the duncolored desert camouflage the nature of the countryside changed slowly as we walked north away from the sea the throned stalks i guess you could call them trees came in fewer numbers but were bigger around and less brittle at the base of each was a tangled mass of vine with the same bluegreen color which spread out in a flattened cone some ten meters in diameter there was a delicate green flower the size of a mans head near the top of each tree grass began to appear some five clicks from the sea it seemed to respect the trees property rights leaving a strip of bare earth around each cone of vine at the edge of such a clearing it would grow as timid bluegreen stubble then moving away from the tree would get thicker and taller until it reached shoulderhigh in some places where the separation between two trees was unusually large the grass was a lighter greener shade than the trees and vines we changed the color of our suits to the bright green we had used for maximum visibility on charon keeping to the thickest part of the grass we were fairly inconspicuous i couldnt help thinking that one week of training in a south american jungle would have been worth a hell of a lot more than all those weeks on charon we wouldnt be so understrength either we covered over twenty clicks each day buoyant after months under gs until the second day the only form of animal life we saw was a kind of black worm fingersized with hundreds of cilium legs like the bristles of a stiff brush rogers said that there obviously had to be some sort of larger creature around or there would be no reason for the trees to have thorns so we were doubly on guard expecting trouble both from the taurans and the unidentified large creatures potters second platoon was on point the general freak was reserved for her since point would likely be the first platoon to spot any trouble sarge this is potter we all heard movement ahead get down then we are dont think they see us first platoon go up to the right of point keep down fourth get up to the left tell me when you get in position sixth platoon stay back and guard the rear fifth and third close with the command group two dozen people whispered out of the grass to join us cortez must have heard from the fourth platoon good how about you firstok fine how many are there eight we can see potters voice good when i give the word open fire shoot to kill sargetheyre just animals potterif youve known all this time what a tauran looks like you shouldve told us shoot to kill but we need we need a prisoner but we dont need to escort him forty clicks to his home base and keep an eye on him while we fight clear yes sergeant ok seventh all you brains and weirds were going up and watch fifth and third come along to guard we crawled through the meterhigh grass to where the second platoon had stretched out in a firing line i dont see anything cortez said ahead and just to the left dark green they were only a shade darker than the grass but after you saw the first one you could see them all moving slowly around some thirty meters ahead fire cortez fired first then twelve streaks of crimson leaped out and the grass wilted back disappeared and the creatures convulsed and died trying to scatter hold fire hold it cortez stood up we want to have something leftsecond platoon follow me he strode out toward the smoldering corpses laser finger pointed out front obscene divining rod pulling him toward the carnagei felt my gorge rising and knew that all the lurid training tapes all the horrible deaths in training accidents hadnt prepared me for this sudden realitythat i had a magic wand that i could point at a life and make it a smoking piece of halfraw meat i wasnt a soldier nor even wanted to be one nor ever would want ok seventh come on up while we were walking toward them one of the creatures moved a tiny shudder and cortez flicked the beam of his laser over it with an almost negligent gesture it made a handdeep gash across the creatures middle it died like the others without emitting a sound they were not quite as tall as humans but wider in girth they were covered with dark green almost black fur white curls where the laser had singed they appeared to have three legs and an arm the only ornament to their shaggy heads was a mouth wet black orifice filled with flat black teeth they were thoroughly repulsive but their worst feature was not a difference from human beings but a similaritywherever the laser had opened a body cavity milkwhite glistening veined globes and coils of organs spilled out and their blood was dark clotting red rogers take a look taurans or not rogers knelt by one of the disemboweled creatures and opened a flat plastic box filled with glistening dissecting tools she selected a scalpel one way we might be able to find out doc wilson watched over her shoulder as she methodically slit the membrane covering several organs here she held up a blackish fibrous mass between two fingers parody of daintiness through all that armor so its grass sergeant if the taurans can eat grass and breathe the air they certainly found a planet remarkably like their home she tossed it away theyre animals sergeant just damn animals i dont know doc wilson said just because they walk around on all fours threes maybe and are able to eat grass well lets check out the brain she found one that had been hit on the head and scraped the superficial black char from the wound look at that it was almost solid bone she tugged and ruffled the hair all over the head of another one what the hell does it use for sensory organs no eyes or ears or she stood up nothing in that head but a mouth and ten centimeters of skull to protect nothing not a damn thing if i could shrug id shrug the doctor said it doesnt prove anythinga brain doesnt have to look like a mushy walnut and it doesnt have to be in the head maybe that skull isnt bone maybe thats the brain some crystal lattice yeah but the stomachs in the right place and if those arent intestines ill eat look cortez said this is all real interesting but all we need to know is whether that things dangerous then weve gotta move on we dont have all they arent dangerous rogers began they dont medic doc somebody was waving his arms back at the firing line doc sprinted back to him the rest of us following whats wrong he had reached back and unclipped his medical kit on the run its ho shes out doc swung open the door on hos biomedical monitor he didnt have to look far shes dead dead cortez said what the hell just a minute doc plugged a jack into the monitor and fiddled with some dials on his kit everybodys biomed readout is stored for twelve hours im running it backwards should be able tothere what four and a half minutes agomust have been when you opened fire well massive cerebral hemorrhage no he watched the dials nowarning no indication of anything out of the ordinary blood pressure up pulse up but normal under the circumstancesnothing toindicate he reached down and popped her suit her fine oriental features were distorted in a horrible grimace both gums showing sticky fluid ran from under her collapsed eyelids and a trickle of blood still dripped from each ear doc wilson closed the suit back up ive never seen anything like it its as if a bomb went off in her skull oh crap rogers said she was rhinesensitive wasnt she thats right cortez sounded thoughtful all right everybody listen platoon leaders check your platoons and see if anybodys missing or hurt anybody else in seventh iive got a splitting headache sarge lucky said four others had bad headaches one of them affirmed that he was slightly rhinesensitive the others didnt know cortez i think its obvious doc wilson said that we should give thesemonsters wide berth especially shouldnt harm any more of them not with five people susceptible to whatever apparently killed ho of course damn it i dont need anybody to tell me that wed better get moving i just filled the captain in on what happened he agrees that wed better get as far away from here as we can before we stop for the night lets get back in formation and continue on the same bearing fifth platoon take over point second come back to the rear everybody else same as before what about ho lucky asked shell be taken care of from the ship after wed gone half a click there was a flash and rolling thunder where ho had been came a wispy luminous mushroom cloud boiling up to disappear against the gray sky we stopped for the nightactually the sun wouldnt set for another seventy hoursatop a slight rise some ten clicks from where we had killed the aliens but they werent aliens i had to remind myselfwe were two platoons deployed in a ring around the rest of us and we flopped down exhausted everybody was allowed four hours sleep and had two hours guard duty potter came over and sat next to me i chinned her frequency hi marygay oh william her voice over the radio was hoarse and cracking god its so horrible its over now i killed one of them the first instant i shot it right in the in the i put my hand on her knee the contact made a plastic click and i jerked it back visions of machines embracing copulating dont feel singled out marygay whatever guilt there is belongs evenly to all of usbut a triple portion for cor you privates quit jawin and get some sleep you both pull guard in two hours ok sarge her voice was so sad and tired i couldnt bear it i felt if i could only touch her i could drain off the sadness like a ground wire draining current but we were each trapped in our own plastic world gnight william night its almost impossible to get sexually excited inside a suit with the relief tube and all the silver chloride sensors poking you but somehow this was my bodys response to the emotional impotence maybe remembering more pleasant sleeps with marygay maybe feeling that in the midst of all this death personal death could be soon cranking up the procreative derrick for one last trylovely thoughts like this and i fell asleep and dreamed that i was a machine mimicking the functions of life creaking and clanking my clumsy way through the world people too polite to say anything but giggling behind my back and the little man who sat inside my head pulling the levers and clutches and watching the dials he was hopelessly mad and was storing up hurts for the day mandellawake up damn it your shift i shuffled over to my place on the perimeter to watch for god knows whatbut i was so weary i couldnt keep my eyes open finally i tongued a stimtab knowing id pay for it later for over an hour i sat there scanning my sector left right near far the scene never changing not even a breath of wind to stir the grass then suddenly the grass parted and one of the threelegged creatures was right in front of me i raised my finger but didnt squeeze movement movement holdyour fire dont shoot movement movement i looked left and right and as far as i could see every perimeter guard had one of the blind dumb creatures standing right in front of him maybe the drug id taken to stay awake made me more sensitive to whatever they did my scalp crawled and i felt a formless thing in my mind the feeling you get when somebody has said something and you didnt quite hear it want to respond but the opportunity to ask him to repeat it is gone the creature sat back on its haunches leaning forward on the one front leg big green bear with a withered arm its power threaded through my mind spiderwebs echo of night terrors trying to communicate trying to destroy me i couldnt know all right everybody on the perimeter fall back slow dont make any quick gesturesanybody got a headache or anything sergeant this is hollister lucky theyre trying to say somethingi can almostno just well all i can get is that they think werethink werewell funny they arent afraid you mean the one in front of you isnt no the feeling comes from all of them theyre all thinking the same thing dont ask me how i know i just do maybe they thought it was funny what they did to ho maybe i dont feel like theyre dangerous just curious about us sergeant this is bohrs yeah the taurans have been here at least a yearmaybe theyve learned how to communicate with theseovergrown teddybears they might be spying on us might be sending back i dont think theyd show themselves if that were the case lucky said they can obviously hide from us pretty well when they want to anyhow cortez said if theyre spies the damage has been done dont think itd be smart to take any action against them i know youd all like to see em dead for what they did to ho so would i but wed better be careful i didnt want to see them dead but id just as soon not see them in any condition i was walking backwards slowly toward the middle of camp the creature didnt seem disposed to follow maybe he just knew we were surrounded he was pulling up grass with his arm and munching ok all of you platoon leaders wake everybody up get a roll count let me know if anybodys been hurt tell your people were moving out in one minute i dont know what cortez expected but of course the creatures just followed right along they didnt keep us surrounded just had twenty or thirty following us all the time not the same ones either individuals would saunter away new ones would join the parade it was pretty obvious that they werent going to tire out we were each allowed one stimtab without it no one could have marched an hour a second pill would have been welcome after the edge started to wear off but the mathematics of the situation forbade it we were still thirty clicks from the enemy base fifteen hours marching at the least and though one could stay awake and energetic for a hundred hours on the tabs aberrations of judgment and perception snowballed after the second tab until in extremis the most bizarre hallucinations would be taken at face value and a person would fidget for hours deciding whether to have breakfast under artificial stimulation the company traveled with great energy for the first six hours was slowing by the seventh and ground to an exhausted halt after nine hours and nineteen kilometers the teddybears had never lost sight of us and according to lucky had never stopped broadcasting cortezs decision was that we would stop for seven hours each platoon taking one hour of perimeter guard i was never so glad to have been in the seventh platoon as we stood guard the last shift and thus were the only ones to get six hours of uninterrupted sleep in the few moments i lay awake after finally lying down the thought came to me that the next time i closed my eyes could well be the last and partly because of the drug hangover mostly because of the past days horrors i found that i really just didnt give a damn our first contact with the taurans came during my shift the teddybears were still there when i woke up and replaced doc jones on guard theyd gone back to their original formation one in front of each guard position the one who was waiting for me seemed a little larger than normal but otherwise looked just like all the others all the grass had been cropped where he was sitting so he occasionally made forays to the left or right but he always returned to sit right in front of me you would say staring if he had had anything to stare with we had been facing each other for about fifteen minutes when cortezs voice rumbled awright everybody wake up and get hid i followed instinct and flopped to the ground and rolled into a tall stand of grass enemy vessel overhead his voice was almost laconic strictly speaking it wasnt really overhead but rather passing somewhat east of us it was moving slowly maybe a hundred clicks per hour and looked like a broomstick surrounded by a dirty soap bubble the creature riding it was a little more humanlooking than the teddybears but still no prize i cranked my image amplifier up to forty log two for a closer look he had two arms and two legs but his waist was so small you could encompass it with both hands under the tiny waist was a large horseshoeshaped pelvic structure nearly a meter wide from which dangled two long skinny legs with no apparent knee joint above that waist his body swelled out again to a chest no smaller than the huge pelvis his arms looked surprisingly human except that they were too long and undermuscled there were too many fingers on his hands shoulderless neckless his head was a nightmarish growth that swelled like a goiter from his massive chest two eyes that looked like clusters of fish eggs a bundle of tassles instead of a nose and a rigidly open hole that might have been a mouth sitting low down where his adams apple should have been evidently the soap bubble contained an amenable environment as he was wearing absolutely nothing except a ridged hide that looked like skin submerged too long in hot water then dyed a pale orange he had no external genitalia nor anything that might hint of mammary glands obviously he either didnt see us or thought we were part of the herd of teddybears he never looked back at us but just continued in the same direction we were headed rad east of north might as well go back to sleep now if you can sleep after looking at that thing we move out at forty minutes because of the planets opaque cloud cover there had been no way to tell from space what the enemy base looked like or how big it was we only knew its position the same way we knew the position the scoutships were supposed to land on so it could easily have been underwater too or underground but some of the drones were reconnaissance ships as well as decoys and in their mock attacks on the base one managed to get close enough to take a picture captain stott beamed down a diagram of the place to cortezthe only one with a visor in his suitwhen we were five clicks from the bases radio position we stopped and he called all of the platoon leaders in with the seventh platoon to confer two teddybears loped in too we tried to ignore them ok the captain sent down some pictures of our objective im going to draw a map you platoon leaders copy they took pads and styli out of their leg pockets while cortez unrolled a large plastic mat he gave it a shake to randomize any residual charge and turned on his stylus now were coming from this direction he put an arrow at the bottom of the sheet first thing well hit is this row of huts probably billets or bunkers but who the hell knowsour initial objective is to destroy these buildingsthe whole base is on a flat plain theres no way we could really sneak by them potter here why cant we jump over them yeah we could do that and wind up completely surrounded cut to ribbons we take the buildings after we do thatall i can say is that well have to think on our feet from the aerial reconnaissance we can figure out the function of only a couple of buildingsand that stinks we might wind up wasting a lot of time demolishing the equivalent of an enlisted mans bar ignoring a huge logistic computer because it looks likea garbage dump or something mandella here i said isnt there a spaceport of some kindseems to me we ought to ill get to that damn it theres a ring of these huts all around the camp so weve got to break through somewhere this placell be closest less chance of giving away our position before we attack theres nothing in the whole place that actually looks like a weapon that doesnt mean anything though you could hide a bevawatt laser in each of those huts now about five hundred meters from the huts in the middle of the base well come to this big flowershaped structure cortez drew a large symmetrical shape that looked like the outline of a flower with seven petals what the hell this is your guess is as good as mine theres only one of them though so we dont damage it any more than we have to which meanswe blast it to splinters if i think its dangerous now as far as your spaceport mandella is concernedthere just isnt one nothing that cruiser the hope caulked had probably been left in orbit like ours has to be if they have any equivalent of a scoutship or drone missiles theyre either not kept here or theyre well hidden bohrs here then what did they attack with while we were coming down from orbit i wish we knew private obviously we dont have any way of estimating their numbers not directly recon pictures failed to show a single tauran on the grounds of the base meaning nothing because it is an alien environment indirectly thoughwe can count the number of broomsticks there are fiftyone huts and each has at most one broomstick four dont have one parked outside but we located three at various other parts of the base maybe this indicates that there are fiftyone taurans one of whom was outside the base when the picture was taken keating here or fiftyone officers thats rightmaybe fifty thousand infantrymen stacked in one of these buildings no way to tell maybe ten taurans each with five broomsticks to use according to his mood weve got one thing in our favor and thats communications they evidently use a frequency modulation of megahertz electromagnetic radiation radio thats right whoever you are identify yourself when you speak so its quite possible that they cant detect our phasedneutrino communications also just prior to the attack the hope is going to deliver a nice dirty fission bomb detonate it in the upper atmosphere right over the base thatll restrict them to lineofsight communication for some time even those will be full of static why donttate herewhy dont they just drop the bomb right in their laps would save us a lot of that doesnt even deserve an answer private but the answer is they might and you better hope they dont if they caulk the base itll be for the safety of the hope after weve attacked and probably before were far enough away for it to make much difference we keep that from happening by doing a good job we have to reduce the base to where it can no longer function at the same time leave as much intact as possible and take one prisoner potter here you mean at least one prisoner i mean what i say one only potteryoure relieved of your platoon send chavez up all right sergeant the relief in her voice was unmistakable cortez continued with his map and instructions there was one other building whose function was pretty obvious it had a large steerable dish antenna on top we were to destroy it as soon as the grenadiers got in range the attack plan was very loose our signal to begin would be the flash of the fission bomb at the same time several drones would converge on the base so we could see what their antispacecraft defenses were we would try to reduce the effectiveness of those defenses without destroying them completely immediately after the bomb and the drones the grenadiers would vaporize a line of seven huts everybody would break through the hole into the baseand what would happen after that was anybodys guess ideally wed sweep from that end of the base to the other destroying certain targets caulking all but one tauran but that was unlikely to happen as it depended on the taurans offering very little resistance on the other hand if the taurans showed obvious superiority from the beginning cortez would give the order to scatter everybody had a different compass bearing for retreatwed blossom out in all directions the survivors to rendezvous in a valley some forty clicks east of the base then wed see about a return engagement after the hope softened the base up a bit one last thing cortez rasped maybe some of you feel the way potter evidently does maybe some of your men feel that waythat we ought to go easy not make this so much of a bloodbath mercy is a luxury a weakness we cant afford to indulge in at this stage of the war all we know about the enemy is that they have killed seven hundred and ninetyeight humans they havent shown any restraint in attacking our cruisers and itd be foolish to expect any this time this first ground action they are responsible for the lives of all of your comrades who died in training and for ho and for all the others who are surely going to die today i cant understand anybody who wants to spare them but that doesnt make any difference you have your orders and what the hell you might as well know all of you have a posthypnotic suggestion that i will trigger by a phrase just before the battle it will make your job easier sergeant shut up were short on time get back to your platoons and brief them we move out in five minutes the platoon leaders returned to their men leaving cortez and the ten of us plus three teddybears milling around getting in the way we took the last five clicks very carefully sticking to the highest grass running across occasional clearings when we were five hundred meters from where the base was supposed to be cortez took the third platoon forward to scout while the rest of us laid low cortezs voice came over the general freak looks pretty much like we expected advance in a file crawling when you get to the third platoon follow your squad leader to the left or right we did that and wound up with a string of eightythree people in a line roughly perpendicular to the direction of attack we were pretty well hidden except for the dozen or so teddybears that mooched along the line munching grass there was no sign of life inside the base all of the buildings were windowless and a uniform shiny white the huts that were our first objective were large featureless halfburied eggs some sixty meters apart cortez assigned one to each grenadier we were broken into three fire teams team a consisted of platoons two four and six team b was one three and five the command platoon was team c less than a minute nowfilters downwhen i say fire grenadiers take out your targets god help you if you miss there was a sound like a giants belch and a stream of five or six iridescent bubbles floated up from the flowershaped building they rose with increasing speed to where they were almost out of sight then shot off to the south over our heads the ground was suddenly bright and for the first time in a long time i saw my shadow a long one pointed north the bomb had gone off prematurely i just had time to think that it didnt make too much difference itd still make alphabet soup out of their communications drones a ship came screaming in just above tree level and a bubble was in the air to meet it when they contacted the bubble popped and the drone exploded into a million tiny fragments another one came from the opposite side and suffered the same fate fire seven bright glares of microton grenades and a sustained concussion that im sure would have killed an unprotected man filters up gray haze of smoke and dust clods of dirt falling with a sound like heavy raindrops listen up scots wha hae wi wallace bled scots wham bruce has aften led welcome to your gory bed or to victory i hardly heard him for trying to keep track of what was going on in my skull i knew it was just posthypnotic suggestion even remembered the session in missouri when theyd implanted it but that didnt make it any less compelling my mind reeled under the strong pseudomemories shaggy hulks that were tauransnot at all what we now knew they looked likeboarding a colonists vessel eating babies while mothers watched in screaming terrorthe colonists never took babies they wouldnt stand the accelerationthen raping the women to death with huge veined purple membersridiculous that they would feel desire for humansholding the men down while they plucked flesh from their living bodies and gobbled ita hundred grisly details as sharply remembered as the events of a minute ago ridiculously overdone and logically absurd but while my conscious mind was reflecting the silliness somewhere much deeper down in that sleeping giant where we keep our real motives and morals something was thirsting for alien blood secure in the conviction that the noblest thing a man could do would be to die killing one of those horrible monsters i knew it was all purest soya and i hated the men who had taken such obscene liberties with my mind but still i could hear my teeth grinding feel cheeks frozen in a spastic grin bloodlusta teddybear walked in front of me looking dazed i started to raise my laserfinger but somebody beat me to it and the creatures head exploded in a cloud of gray splinters and blood lucky groaned halfwhining dirtyfilthy bastards lasers flared and crisscrossed and all of the teddybears fell dead watch it damn it cortez screamed aim those things they arent toys team a move outinto the craters to cover b somebody was laughing and sobbing what the crap is wrong with you petrov first time i could remember cortez cussing i twisted around and saw petrov behind and to my left lying in a shallow hole digging frantically with both hands crying and gurgling crap cortez said team b past the craters ten meters get down in a line team cinto the craters with a i scrambled up and covered the hundred meters in twelve amplified strides the craters were practically large enough to hide a scoutship some ten meters in diameter i jumped to the opposite side of the hole and landed next to a fellow named chin he didnt even look around when i landed just kept scanning the base for signs of life team apast team b ten meters down in line just as he finished the building in front of us burped and a salvo of the bubbles fanned out toward our lines most people saw it coming and got down but chin was just getting up to make his rush and stepped right into one it grazed the top of his helmet and disappeared with a faint pop he took one step backwards and toppled over the edge of the crater trailing an arc of blood and brains lifeless spreadeagled he slid halfway to the bottom shoveling dirt into the perfectly symmetrical hole where the bubble had chewed through plastic hair skin bone and brain indiscriminately everybody hold it platoon leaders casualty reportcheckcheck checkcheck check checkcheck we have three deaders wouldnt be any if youd have kept low so everybody grab dirt when you hear that thing go off team a complete the rush they completed the maneuver without incident ok team c rush to where bhold it down everybody was already hugging the ground the bubbles slid by in a smooth arc about two meters off the ground they went serenely over our heads and except for one that made toothpicks out of a tree disappeared in the distance b rush past a ten meters c take over bs place you b grenadiers see if you can reach the flower two grenades tore up the ground thirty or forty meters from the structure in a good imitation of panic it started belching out a continuous stream of bubblesstill none coming lower than two meters off the ground we kept hunched down and continued to advance suddenly a seam appeared in the building widened to the size of a large door and taurans came swarming out grenadiers hold your fire b team laser fire to the left and right keep em bunched up a and c rush down the center one tauran died trying to turn through a laser beam the others stayed where they were in a suit its pretty awkward to run and try to keep your head down at the same time you have to go from side to side like a skater getting started otherwise youll be airborne at least one person somebody in a team bounced too high and suffered the same fate as chin i was feeling pretty fencedin and trapped with a wall of laser fire on each side and a low ceiling that meant death to touch but in spite of myself i felt happy euphoric at finally getting the chance to kill some of those villainous babyeaters they werent fighting back except for the rather ineffective bubblesobviously not designed as an antipersonnel weaponand they didnt retreat back into the building either they just milled around about a hundred of them and watched us get closer a couple of grenades would caulk them all but i guess cortez was thinking about the prisoner ok when i say go were going to flank em b team will hold firesecond and fourth to the right sixth and seventh to the left b team will move forward in line to box them in go we peeled off to the left as soon as the lasers stopped the taurans bolted running in a group on a collision course with our flank a team down and fire dont shoot until youre sure of your aimif you miss you might hit a friendly and fer chrissake save me one it was a horrifying sight that herd of monsters bearing down on us they were running in great leapsthe bubbles avoiding themand they all looked like the one we saw earlier riding the broomstick naked except for an almost transparent sphere around their whole bodies that moved along with them the right flank started firing picking off individuals in the rear of the pack suddenly a laser flared through the taurans from the other side somebody missing his mark there was a horrible scream and i looked down the line to see someone i think it was perry writhing on the ground right hand over the smoldering stump of his left arm seared off just below the elbow blood sprayed through his fingers and the suit its camouflage circuits scrambled flickered blackwhitejungledesertgreengray i dont know how long i staredlong enough for the medic to run over and start giving aidbut when i looked up the taurans were almost on top of me my first shot was wild and high but it grazed the top of the leading taurans protective bubble the bubble disappeared and the monster stumbled and fell to the ground jerking spasmodically foam gushed out of his mouthhole first white then streaked with red with one last jerk he became rigid and twisted backwards almost to the shape of a horseshoe his long scream a highpitched whistle stopped just as his comrades trampled over him and i hated myself for smiling it was slaughter even though our flank was outnumbered five to one they kept coming without faltering even when they had to climb over the drift of bodies and parts of bodies that piled up high parallel to our flank the ground between us was slick red with tauran bloodall gods children got hemoglobinand like the teddybears their guts looked pretty much like guts to my untrained eye my helmet reverberated with hysterical laughter while we cut them to gory chunks i almost didnt hear cortez hold your firei said hold it damn it catch a couple of the bastards they wont hurt you i stopped shooting and eventually so did everybody else when the next tauran jumped over the smoking pile of meat in front of me i dove to tackle him around those spindly legs it was like hugging a big slippery balloon when i tried to drag him down he just popped out of my arms and kept running we managed to stop one of them by the simple expedient of piling halfadozen people on top of him by that time the others had run through our line and were headed for the row of large cylindrical tanks that cortez had said were probably for storage a little door had opened in the base of each one weve got our prisoner cortez shouted kill they were fifty meters away and running hard difficult targets lasers slashed around them bobbing high and low one fell sliced in two but the others about ten of them kept going and were almost to the doors when the grenadiers started firing they were still loaded with mike bombs but a near miss wasnt enoughthe concussion would just send them flying unhurt in their bubbles the buildings get the damn buildings the grenadiers raised their aim and let fly but the bombs only seemed to scorch the white outside of the structures until by chance one landed in a door that split the building just as if it had a seam the two halves popped away and a cloud of machinery flew into the air accompanied by a huge pale flame that rolled up and disappeared in an instant then the others all concentrated on the doors except for potshots at some of the taurans not so much to get them as to blow them away before they could get inside they seemed awfully eager all this time we were trying to get the taurans with laser fire while they weaved and bounced around trying to get into the structures we moved in as close to them as we could without putting ourselves in danger from the grenade blaststhat was still too far away for good aim still we were getting them one by one and managed to destroy four of the seven buildings then when there were only two aliens left a nearby grenade blast flung one of them to within a few meters of a door he dove in and several grenadiers fired salvos after him but they all fell short or detonated harmlessly on the side bombs were falling all around making an awful racket but the sound was suddenly drowned out by a great sigh like a giants intake of breath and where the building had been was a thick cylindrical cloud of smoke solidlooking dwindling away into the stratosphere straight as if laid down by a ruler the other tauran had been right at the base of the cylinder i could see pieces of him flying a second later a shock wave hit us and i rolled helplessly pinwheeling to smash into the pile of tauran bodies and roll beyond i picked myself up and panicked for a second when i saw there was blood all over my suitwhen i realized it was only alien blood i relaxed but felt unclean catch the bastard catch him in the confusion the taurannow the only one left alivehad got free and was running for the grass one platoon was chasing after him losing ground but then all of b team ran over and cut him off i jogged over to join in the fun there were four people on top of him and fifty people watching spread out damn it there might be a thousand more of them waiting to get us in one place we dispersed grumbling by unspoken agreement we were all sure that there were no more live taurans on the face of the planet cortez was walking toward the prisoner while i backed away suddenly the four men collapsed in a pile on top of the creatureeven from my distance i could see the foam spouting from his mouthhole his bubble had popped suicide damn cortez was right there get off that bastard the four men got off and cortez used his laser to slice the monster into a dozen quivering chunks heartwarming sight thats all right though well find another oneeverybody back in the arrowhead formation combat assault on the flower well we assaulted the flower which had evidently run out of ammunitionit was still belching but no bubblesand it was empty we just scurried up ramps and through corridors fingers at the ready like kids playing soldier there was nobody home the same lack of response at the antenna installation the salami and twenty other major buildings as well as the fortyfour perimeter huts still intact so we had captured dozens of buildings mostly of incomprehensible purpose but failed in our main mission capturing a tauran for the xenologists to experiment with oh well they could have all the bits and pieces of the creatures theyd ever want that was something after wed combed every last square centimeter of the base a scoutship came in with the real exploration crew star fleet scientists cortez said all right snap out of it and the hypnotic compulsion fell away at first it was pretty grim a lot of the people like lucky and marygay almost went crazy with the memories of bloody murder multiplied a hundred times cortez ordered everybody to take a sedtab two for the ones most upset i took two without being specifically ordered to do so because it was murder unadorned butcheryonce we had the antispacecraft weapon doped out we werent in any danger the taurans didnt seem to have any conception of persontoperson fighting we just herded them up and slaughtered them in the first encounter between mankind and another intelligent species what might have happened if we had sat down and tried to communicate maybe it was the second encounter counting the teddybears but they got the same treatment i spent a long time after that telling myself over and over that it hadnt been me who so gleefully carved up those frightened stampeding creatures back in the twentieth century they established to everybodys satisfaction that i was just following orders was an inadequate excuse for inhuman conductbut what can you do when the orders come from deep down in that puppet master of the unconscious worst of all was the feeling that perhaps my actions werent all that inhuman ancestors only a few generations back would have done the same thing even to their fellowmen without any hypnotic conditioning so i was disgusted with the human race disgusted with the army and horrified at the prospect of living with myself for another century or sowell there was always brainwipe the ship that the lone tauran survivor had escaped in had got away clean the bulk of the planet shielding it from earths hope while it dropped into alephs collapsar field escaped to home i guessed wherever that was to report what twenty men with handweapons could do to a hundred fleeing on foot unarmed i suspected that the next time humans met taurans in ground combat we would be more evenly matched and i was right arthur c clarke arthur c clarkes lengthy publishing credentials include articles in midcentury scientific journals that laid the

days in making this statementwhich i do of my own free willi wish first to make it perfectly clear that i am not in any way trying to gain sympathy nor do i expect any mitigation of whatever sentence the court may pronounce i am writing this in an attempt to refute some of the lying reports broadcast over the prison radio and published in the papers i have been allowed to see these have given an entirely false picture of the true cause of our defeat and as the leader of my races armed forces at the cessation of hostilities i feel it my duty to protest against such libels upon those who served under me i also hope that this statement may explain the reasons for the application i have twice made to the court and will now induce it to grant a favor for which i can see no possible grounds of refusal the ultimate cause of our failure was a simple one despite all statements to the contrary it was not due to lack of bravery on the part of our men or to any fault of the fleets we were defeated by one thing onlyby the inferior science of our enemies i repeatby the inferior science of our enemies when the war opened we had no doubt of our ultimate victory the combined fleets of our allies greatly exceeded in number and armament those which the enemy could muster against us and in almost all branches of military science we were their superiors we were sure that we could maintain this superiority our belief proved alas to be only too well founded at the opening of the war our main weapons were the longrange homing torpedo dirigible balllightning and the various modifications of the klydon beam every unit of the fleet was equipped with these and though the enemy possessed similar weapons their installations were generally of lesser power moreover we had behind us a far greater military research organization and with this initial advantage we could not possibly lose the campaign proceeded according to plan until the battle of the five suns we won this of course but the opposition proved stronger than we had expected it was realized that victory might be more difficult and more delayed than had first been imagined a conference of supreme commanders was therefore called to discuss our future strategy present for the first time at one of our war conferences was professorgeneral norden the new chief of the research staff who had just been appointed to fill the gap left by the death of malvar our greatest scientist malvars leadership had been responsible more than any other single factor for the efficiency and power of our weapons his loss was a very serious blow but no one doubted the brilliance of his successorthough many of us disputed the wisdom of appointing a theoretical scientist to fill a post of such vital importance but we had been overruled i can well remember the impression norden made at that conference the military advisers were worried and as usual turned to the scientists for help would it be possible to improve our existing weapons they asked so that our present advantage could be increased still further nordens reply was quite unexpected malvar had often been asked such a questionand he had always done what we requested frankly gentlemen said norden i doubt it our existing weapons have practically reached finality i dont wish to criticize my predecessor or the excellent work done by the research staff in the last few generations but do you realize that there has been no basic change in armaments for over a century it is i am afraid the result of a tradition that has become conservative for too long the research staff has devoted itself to perfecting old weapons instead of developing new ones it is fortunate for us that our opponents have been no wiser we cannot assume that this will always be so nordens words left an uncomfortable impression as he had no doubt intended he quickly pressed home the attack what we want are new weaponsweapons totally different from any that have been employed before such weapons can be made it will take time of course but since assuming charge i have replaced some of the older scientists with young men and have directed research into several unexplored fields which show great promise i believe in fact that a revolution in warfare may soon be upon us we were skeptical there was a bombastic tone in nordens voice that made us suspicious of his claims we did not know then that he never promised anything that he had not already almost perfected in the laboratory in the laboratorythat was the operative phrase norden proved his case less than a month later when he demonstrated the sphere of annihilation which produced complete disintegration of matter over a radius of several hundred meters we were intoxicated by the power of the new weapon and were quite prepared to overlook one fundamental defectthe fact that it was a sphere and hence destroyed its rather complicated generating equipment at the instant of formation this meant of course that it could not be used on warships but only on guided missiles and a great program was started to convert all homing torpedoes to carry the new weapon for the time being all further offensives were suspended we realize now that this was our first mistake i still think that it was a natural one for it seemed to us then that all our existing weapons had become obsolete overnight and we already regarded them as almost primitive survivals what we did not appreciate was the magnitude of the task we were attempting and the length of time it would take to get the revolutionary superweapon into battle nothing like this had happened for a hundred years and we had no previous experience to guide us the conversion problem proved far more difficult than anticipated a new class of torpedo had to be designed as the standard model was too small this meant in turn that only the larger ships could launch the weapon but we were prepared to accept this penalty after six months the heavy units of the fleet were being equipped with the sphere training maneuvers and tests had shown that it was operating satisfactorily and we were ready to take it into action norden was already being hailed as the architect of victory and had half promised even more spectacular weapons then two things happened one of our battleships disappeared completely on a training flight and an investigation showed that under certain conditions the ships longrange radar could trigger the sphere immediately after it had been launched the modification needed to overcome this defect was trivial but it caused a delay of another month and was the source of much bad feeling between the naval staff and the scientists we were ready for action againwhen norden announced that the radius of effectiveness of the sphere had now been increased by ten thus multiplying by a thousand the chances of destroying an enemy ship so the modifications started all over again but everyone agreed that the delay would be worth it meanwhile however the enemy had been emboldened by the absence of further attacks and had made an unexpected onslaught our ships were short of torpedoes since none had been coming from the factories and were forced to retire so we lost the systems of kyrane and floranus and the planetary fortress of rhamsandron it was an annoying but not a serious blow for the recaptured systems had been unfriendly and difficult to administer we had no doubt that we could restore the position in the near future as soon as the new weapon became operational these hopes were only partially fulfilled when we renewed our offensive we had to do so with fewer of the spheres of annihilation than had been planned and this was one reason for our limited success the other reason was more serious while we had been equipping as many of our ships as we could with the irresistible weapon the enemy had been building feverishly his ships were of the old pattern with the old weaponsbut they now outnumbered ours when we went into action we found that the numbers ranged against us were often percent greater than expected causing target confusion among the automatic weapons and resulting in higher losses than anticipated the enemy losses were higher still for once a sphere had reached its objective destruction was certain but the balance had not swung as far in our favor as we had hoped moreover while the main fleets had been engaged the enemy had launched a daring attack on the lightly held systems of eriston duranus carmanidora and pharanidonrecapturing them all we were thus faced with a threat only fifty lightyears from our home planets there was much recrimination at the next meeting of the supreme commanders most of the complaints were addressed to nordengrand admiral taxaris in particular maintaining that thanks to our admittedly irresistible weapon we were now considerably worse off than before we should he claimed have continued to build conventional ships thus preventing the loss of our numerical superiority norden was equally angry and called the naval staff ungrateful bunglers but i could tell that he was worriedas indeed we all wereby the unexpected turn of events he hinted that there might be a speedy way of remedying the situation we now know that research had been working on the battle analyzer for many years but at the time it came as a revelation to us and perhaps we were too easily swept off our feet nordens argument also was seductively convincing what did it matter he said if the enemy had twice as many ships as weif the efficiency of ours could be doubled or even trebled for decades the limiting factor in warfare had been not mechanical but biologicalit had become more and more difficult for any single mind or group of minds to cope with the rapidly changing complexities of battle in threedimensional space nordens mathematicians had analyzed some of the classic engagements of the past and had shown that even when we had been victorious we had often operated our units at much less than half of their theoretical efficiency the battle analyzer would change all this by replacing the operations staff with electronic calculators the idea was not new in theory but until now it had been no more than a utopian dream many of us found it difficult to believe that it was still anything but a dream after we had run through several very complex dummy battles however we were convinced it was decided to install the analyzer in four of our heaviest ships so that each of the main fleets could be equipped with one at this stage the trouble beganthough we did not know it until later the analyzer contained just short of a million vacuum tubes and needed a team of five hundred technicians to maintain and operate it it was quite impossible to accommodate the extra staff aboard a battleship so each of the four units had to be accompanied by a converted liner to carry the technicians not on duty installation was also a very slow and tedious business but by gigantic efforts it was completed in six months then to our dismay we were confronted by another crisis nearly five thousand highly skilled men had been selected to serve the analyzers and had been given an intensive course at the technical training schools at the end of seven months per cent of them had had nervous breakdowns and only per cent had qualified once again everyone started to blame everyone else norden of course said that the research staff could not be held responsible and so incurred the enmity of the personnel and training commands it was finally decided that the only thing to do was to use two instead of four analyzers and to bring the others into action as soon as men could be trained there was little time to lose for the enemy was still on the offensive and his morale was rising the first analyzer fleet was ordered to recapture the system of eriston on the way by one of the hazards of war the liner carrying the technicians was struck by a roving mine a warship would have survived but the liner with its irreplaceable cargo was totally destroyed so the operation had to be abandoned the other expedition was at first more successful there was no doubt at all that the analyzer fulfilled its designers claims and the enemy was heavily defeated in the first engagements he withdrew leaving us in possession of saphran leucon and hexanerax but his intelligence staff must have noted the change in our tactics and the inexplicable presence of a liner in the heart of our battlefleet it must have noted also that our first fleet had been accompanied by a similar shipand had withdrawn when it had been destroyed in the next engagement the enemy used his superior numbers to launch an overwhelming attack on the analyzer ship and its unarmed consort the attack was made without regard to lossesboth ships were of course very heavily protectedand it succeeded the result was the virtual decapitation of the fleet since an effectual transfer to the old operational methods proved impossible we disengaged under heavy fire and so lost all our gains and also the systems of lormyia ismarnus beronis alphanidon and sideneus at this stage grand admiral taxaris expressed his disapproval of norden by committing suicide and i assumed supreme command the situation was now both serious and infuriating with stubborn conservatism and complete lack of imagination the enemy continued to advance with his oldfashioned and inefficient but now vastly more numerous ships it was galling to realize that if we had only continued building without seeking new weapons we would have been in a far more advantageous position there were many acrimonious conferences at which norden defended the scientists while everyone else blamed them for all that had happened the difficulty was that norden had proved every one of his claims he had a perfect excuse for all the disasters that had occurred and we could not now turn backthe search for an irresistible weapon must go on at first it had been a luxury that would shorten the war now it was a necessity if we were to end it victoriously we were on the defensive and so was norden he was more than ever determined to reestablish his prestige and that of the research staff but we had been twice disappointed and would not make the same mistake again no doubt nordens twenty thousand scientists would produce many further weapons we would remain unimpressed we were wrong the final weapon was something so fantastic that even now it seems difficult to believe that it ever existed its innocent noncommittal namethe exponential fieldgave no hint of its real potentialities some of nordens mathematicians had discovered it during a piece of entirely theoretical research into the properties of space and to everyones great surprise their results were found to be physically realizable it seems very difficult to explain the operation of the field to the layman according to the technical description it produces an exponential condition of space so that a finite distance in normal linear space may become infinite in pseudospace norden gave an analogy which some of us found useful it was as if one took a flat disk of rubberrepresenting a region of normal spaceand then pulled its center out to infinity the circumference of the disk would be unalteredbut its diameter would be infinite that was the sort of thing the generator of the field did to the space around it as an example suppose that a ship carrying the generator was surrounded by a ring of hostile machines if it switched on the field each of the enemy ships would think that itand the ships on the far side of the circlehad suddenly receded into nothingness yet the circumference of the circle would be the same as before only the journey to the center would be of infinite duration for as one proceeded distances would appear to become greater and greater as the scale of space altered it was a nightmare condition but a very useful one nothing could reach a ship carrying the field it might be englobed by an enemy fleet yet would be as inaccessible as if it were at the other side of the universe against this of course it could not fight back without switching off the field but this still left it at a very great advantage not only in defense but in offense for a ship fitted with the field could approach an enemy fleet undetected and suddenly appear in its midst this time there seemed to be no flaws in the new weapon needless to say we looked for all the possible objections before we committed ourselves again fortunately the equipment was fairly simple and did not require a large operating staff after much debate we decided to rush it into production for we realized that time was running short and the war was going against us we had now lost about the whole of our initial gains and enemy forces had made several raids into our own solar system we managed to hold off the enemy while the fleet was reequipped and the new battle techniques were worked out to use the field operationally it was necessary to locate an enemy formation set a course that would intercept it and then switch on the generator for the calculated period of time on releasing the field againif the calculations had been accurateone would be in the enemys midst and could do great damage during the resulting confusion retreating by the same route when necessary the first trial maneuvers proved satisfactory and the equipment seemed quite reliable numerous mock attacks were made and the crews became accustomed to the new technique i was on one of the test flights and can vividly remember my impressions as the field was switched on the ships around us seemed to dwindle as if on the surface of an expanding bubble in an instant they had vanished completely so had the starsbut presently we could see that the galaxy was still visible as a faint band of light around the ship the virtual radius of our pseudospace was not really infinite but some hundred thousand lightyears and so the distance to the farthest stars of our system had not been greatly increasedthough the nearest had of course totally disappeared these training maneuvers however had to be canceled before they were completed owing to a whole flock of minor technical troubles in various pieces of equipment notably the communications circuits these were annoying but not important though it was thought best to return to base to clear them up at that moment the enemy made what was obviously intended to be a decisive attack against the fortress planet of iton at the limits of our solar system the fleet had to go into battle before repairs could be made the enemy must have believed that we had mastered the secret of invisibilityas in a sense we had our ships appeared suddenly out of nowhere and inflicted tremendous damagefor a while and then something quite baffling and inexplicable happened i was in command of the flagship hircania when the trouble started we had been operating as independent units each against assigned objectives our detectors observed an enemy formation at medium range and the navigating officers measured its distance with great accuracy we set course and switched on the generator the exponential field was released at the moment when we should have been passing through the center of the enemy group to our consternation we emerged into normal space at a distance of many hundred milesand when we found the enemy he had already found us we retreated and tried again this time we were so far away from the enemy that he located us first obviously something was seriously wrong we broke communicator silence and tried to contact the other ships of the fleet to see if they had experienced the same trouble once again we failedand this time the failure was beyond all reason for the communication equipment appeared to be working perfectly we could only assume fantastic though it seemed that the rest of the fleet had been destroyed i do not wish to describe the scenes when the scattered units of the fleet struggled back to base our casualties had actually been negligible but the ships were completely demoralized almost all had lost touch with one another and had found that their ranging equipment showed inexplicable errors it was obvious that the exponential field was the cause of the troubles despite the fact that they were only apparent when it was switched off the explanation came too late to do us any good and nordens final discomfiture was small consolation for the virtual loss of the war as i have explained the field generators produced a radial distortion of space distances appearing greater and greater as one approached the center of the artificial pseudospace when the field was switched off conditions returned to normal but not quite it was never possible to restore the initial state exactly switching the field on and off was equivalent to an elongation and contraction of the ship carrying the generator but there was a hysteretic effect as it were and the initial condition was never quite reproducible owing to all the thousands of electrical changes and movements of mass aboard the ship while the field was on these asymmetries and distortions were cumulative and though they seldom amounted to more than a fraction of one per cent that was quite enough it meant that the precision ranging equipment and the tuned circuits in the communication apparatus were thrown completely out of adjustment any single ship could never detect the changeonly when it compared its equipment with that of another vessel or tried to communicate with it could it tell what had happened it is impossible to describe the resultant chaos not a single component of one ship could be expected with certainty to work aboard another the very nuts and bolts were no longer interchangeable and the supply position became quite impossible given time we might even have overcome these difficulties but the enemy ships were already attacking in thousands with weapons which now seemed centuries behind those that we had invented our magnificent fleet crippled by our own science fought on as best it could until it was overwhelmed and forced to surrender the ships fitted with the field were still invulnerable but as fighting units they were almost helpless every time they switched on their generators to escape from enemy attack the permanent distortion of their equipment increased in a month it was all over this is the true story of our defeat which i give without prejudice to my defense before this court i make it as i have said to counteract the libels that have been circulating against the men who fought under me and to show where the true blame for our misfortunes lay finally my request which as the court will now realize i make in no frivolous manner and which i hope will therefore be granted the court will be aware that the conditions under which we are housed and the constant surveillance to which we are subjected night and day are somewhat distressing yet i am not complaining of this nor do i complain of the fact that shortage of accommodation has made it necessary to house us in pairs but i cannot be held responsible for my future actions if i am compelled any longer to share my cell with professor norden late chief of the research staff of my armed

treasure box and homebody and the hugo awardwinning guide how to write science fiction and fantasy whatever your gravity is when you get to the door rememberthe enemys gate is down if you step through your own door like youre out for a stroll youre a big target and you deserve to get hit with more than a flasher ender wiggins paused and looked over the group most were just watching him nervously a few understanding a few sullen and resisting first day with this army all fresh from the teacher squads and ender had forgotten how young new kids could be hed been in it for three years theyd had six monthsnobody over nine years old in the whole bunch but they were his at eleven he was half a year early to be a commander hed had a toon of his own and knew a few tricks but there were forty in his new army green all marksmen with a flasher all in top shape or they wouldnt be herebut they were all just as likely as not to get wiped out first time into battle remember he went on they cant see you till you get through that door but the second youre out theyll be on you so hit that door the way you want to be when they shoot at you legs go under you going straight down he pointed at a sullen kid who looked like he was only seven the smallest of them all which way is down greenoh toward the enemy door the answer was quick it was also surly as if to say yeah yeah now get on with the important stuff name kid bean get that for size or for brains bean didnt answer the rest laughed a little ender had chosen right the kid was younger than the rest must have been advanced because he was sharp the others didnt like him much they were happy to see him taken down a little like enders first commander had taken him down well bean youre right onto things now i tell you this nobodys gonna get through that door without a good chance of getting hit a lot of you are going to be turned into cement somewhere make sure its your legs right if only your legs get hit then only your legs get frozen and in nullo thats no sweat ender turned to one of the dazed ones whatre legs for hmmm blank stare confusion stammer forget it guess ill have to ask bean here legs are for pushing off walls still bored thanks bean get that everybody they all got it and didnt like getting it from bean right you cant see with legs you cant shoot with legs and most of the time they just get in the way if they get frozen sticking straight out youve turned yourself into a blimp no way to hide so how do legs go a few answered this time to prove that bean wasnt the only one who knew anything under you tucked up under right a shield youre kneeling on a shield and the shield is your own legs and theres a trick to the suits even when your legs are flashed you can still kick off ive never seen anybody do it but mebut youre all gonna learn it ender wiggins turned on his flasher it glowed faintly green in his hand then he let himself rise in the weightless workout room pulled his legs under him as though he were kneeling and flashed both of them immediately his suit stiffened at the knees and ankles so that he couldnt bend at all okay im frozen see he was floating a meter above them they all looked up at him puzzled he leaned back and caught one of the handholds on the wall behind him and pulled himself flush against the wall im stuck at a wall if i had legs id use legs and string myself out like a string bean right they laughed but i dont have legs and thats better got it because of this ender jackknifed at the waist then straightened out violently he was across the workout room in only a moment from the other side he called to them got that i didnt use hands so i still had use of my flasher and i didnt have my legs floating five feet behind me now watch it again he repeated the jackknife and caught a handhold on the wall near them now i dont just want you to do that when theyve flashed your legs i want you to do that when youve still got legs because its better and because theyll never be expecting it all right now everybody up in the air and kneeling most were up in a few seconds ender flashed the stragglers and they dangled helplessly frozen while the others laughed when i give an order you move got it when were at a door and they clear it ill be giving you orders in two seconds as soon as i see the setup and when i give the order you better be out there because whoevers out there first is going to win unless hes a fool im not and you better not be or ill have you back in the teacher squads he saw more than a few of them gulp and the frozen ones looked at him with fear you guys who are hanging there you watch youll thaw out in about fifteen minutes and lets see if you can catch up to the others for the next half hour ender had them jackknifing off walls he called a stop when he saw that they all had the basic idea they were a good group maybe theyd get better now youre warmed up he said to them well start working ender was the last one out after practice since he stayed to help some of the slower ones improve on technique theyd had good teachers but like all armies they were uneven and some of them could be a real drawback in battle their first battle might be weeks away it might be tomorrow a schedule was never printed the commander just woke up and found a note by his bunk giving him the time of his battle and the name of his opponent so for the first while he was going to drive his boys until they were in top shapeall of them ready for anything at any time strategy was nice but it was worth nothing if the soldiers couldnt hold up under the strain he turned the corner into the residence wing and found himself face to face with bean the sevenyearold he had picked on all through practice that day problems ender didnt want problems right now ho bean ho ender pause sir ender said softly were not on duty in my army bean were always on duty ender brushed past him beans high voice piped up behind him i know what youre doing ender sir and im warning you ender turned slowly and looked at him warning me im the best man youve got but id better be treated like it or what ender smiled menacingly or ill be the worst man youve got one or the other and what do you want love and kisses ender was getting angry now bean was unworried i want a toon ender walked back to him and stood looking down into his eyes ill give a toon he said to the boys who prove theyre worth something theyve got to be good soldiers theyve got to know how to take orders theyve got to be able to think for themselves in a pinch and theyve got to be able to keep respect thats how i got to be a commander thats how youll get to be a toon leader got it bean smiled thats fair if you actually work that way ill be a toon leader in a month ender reached down and grabbed the front of his uniform and shoved him into the wall when i say i work a certain way bean then thats the way i work bean just smiled ender let go of him and walked away and didnt look back he was sure without looking that bean was still watching still smiling still just a little contemptuous he might make a good toon leader at that ender would keep an eye on him captain graff six foot two and a little chubby stroked his belly as he leaned back in his chair across his desk sat lieutenant anderson who was earnestly pointing out high points on a chart here it is captain anderson said enders already got them doing a tactic thats going to throw off everyone who meets it doubled their speed graff nodded and you know his test scores he thinks well too graff smiled all true all true anderson hes a fine student shows real promise they waited graff sighed so what do you want me to do enders the one hes got to be hell never be ready in time lieutenant hes eleven for heavens sake man what do you want a miracle i want him into battles every day starting tomorrow i want him to have a years worth of battles in a month graff shook his head that would have his army in the hospital no sir hes getting them into form and we need ender correction lieutenant we need somebody you think its ender all right i think its ender which of the commanders if it isnt him i dont know lieutenant graff ran his hands over his slightly fuzzy bald head these are children anderson do you realize that enders army is nine years old are we going to put them against the older kids are we going to put them through hell for a month like that lieutenant anderson leaned even farther over graffs desk enders test scores captain ive seen his bloody test scores ive watched him in battle ive listened to tapes of his training sessions ive watched his sleep patterns ive heard tapes of his conversations in the corridors and in the bathrooms im more aware of ender wiggins than you could possibly imagine and against all the arguments against his obvious qualities im weighing one thing i have this picture of ender a year from now if you have your way i see him completely useless worn down a failure because he was pushed farther than he or any living person could go but it doesnt weigh enough does it lieutenant because theres a war on and our best talent is gone and the biggest battles are ahead so give ender a battle every day this week and then bring me a report anderson stood and saluted thank you sir he had almost reached the door when graff called his name he turned and faced the captain anderson captain graff said have you been outside lately i mean not since last leave six months ago i didnt think so not that it makes any difference but have you ever been to beaman park there in the city hmm beautiful park trees grass no nullo no battles no worries do you know what else there is in beaman park what sir lieutenant anderson asked children graff answered of course children said anderson i mean children i mean kids who get up in the morning when their mothers call them and they go to school and then in the afternoons they go to beaman park and play theyre happy they smile a lot they laugh they have fun hmmm im sure they do sir is that all you can say anderson anderson cleared his throat its good for children to have fun i think sir i know i did when i was a boy but right now the world needs soldiers and this is the way to get them graff nodded and closed his eyes oh indeed youre right by statistical proof and by all the important theories and dammit they work and the system is right but all the same enders older than i am hes not a child hes barely a person if thats true sir then at least we all know that ender is making it possible for the others of his age to be playing in the park and jesus died to save all men of course graff sat up and looked at anderson almost sadly but were the ones graff said were the ones who are driving in the nails ender wiggins lay on his bed staring at the ceiling he never slept more than five hours a nightbut the lights went off at and didnt come on again until so he stared at the ceiling and thought hed had his army for three and a half weeks dragon army the name was assigned and it wasnt a lucky one oh the charts said that about nine years ago a dragon army had done fairly well but for the next six years the name had been attached to inferior armies and finally because of the superstition that was beginning to play about the name dragon army was retired until now and now ender thought smiling dragon army was going to take them by surprise the door opened quietly ender did not turn his head someone stepped softly into his room then left with the sound of the door shutting when soft steps died away ender rolled over and saw a white slip of paper lying on the floor he reached down and picked it up dragon army against rabbit army ender wiggins and carn carby the first battle ender got out of bed and quickly dressed he went rapidly to the rooms of each of his toon leaders and told them to rouse their boys in five minutes they were all gathered in the corridor sleepy and slow ender spoke softly first battle against rabbit army ive fought them twice before but theyve got a new commander never heard of him theyre an older group though and i know a few of their old tricks now wake up run doublefast warmup in workroom three for an hour and a half they worked out with three mock battles and calisthenics in the corridor out of the nullo then for fifteen minutes they all lay up in the air totally relaxing in the weightlessness at ender roused them and they hurried into the corridor ender led them down the corridor running again and occasionally leaping to touch a light panel on the ceiling the boys all touched the same light panel and at they reached their gate to the battleroom the members of toons c and d grabbed the first eight handholds in the ceiling of the corridor toons a b and e crouched on the floor ender hooked his feet into two handholds in the middle of the ceiling so he was out of everyones way which way is the enemys door he hissed down they whispered back and laughed flashers on the boxes in their hands glowed green they waited for a few seconds more and then the grey wall in front of them disappeared and the battleroom was visible ender sized it up immediately the familiar open grid of most early games like the monkey bars at the park with seven or eight boxes scattered through the grid they called the boxes stars there were enough of them and in forward enough positions that they were worth going for ender decided this in a second and he hissed spread to near stars e hold the four groups in the corners plunged through the forcefield at the doorway and fell down into the battleroom before the enemy even appeared through the opposite gate enders army had spread from the door to the nearest stars then the enemy soldiers came through the door from their stance ender knew they had been in a different gravity and didnt know enough to disorient themselves from it they came through standing up their entire bodies spread and defenseless kill em e ender hissed and threw himself out the door knees first with his flasher between his legs and firing while enders group flew across the room the rest of dragon army lay down a protecting fire so that e group reached a forward position with only one boy frozen completely though they had all lost the use of their legswhich didnt impair them in the least there was a lull as ender and his opponent carn carnby assessed their positions aside from rabbit armys losses at the gate there had been few casualties and both armies were near full strength but carn had no originalityhe was in a fourcorner spread that any fiveyearold in the teacher squads might have thought of and ender knew how to defeat it he called out loudly e covers a c down b d angle east wall under e toons cover b and d toons lunged away from their stars while they were still exposed a and c toons left their stars and drifted toward the near wall they reached it together and together jackknifed off the wall at double the normal speed they appeared behind the enemys stars and opened fire in a few seconds the battle was over with the enemy almost entirely frozen including the commander and the rest scattered to the corners for the next five minutes in squads of four dragon army cleaned out the dark corners of the battleroom and shepherded the enemy into the center where their bodies frozen at impossible angles jostled each other then ender took three of his boys to the enemy gate and went through the formality of reversing the oneway field by simultaneously touching a dragon army helmet at each corner then ender assembled his army in vertical files near the knot of frozen rabbit army soldiers only three of dragon armys soldiers were immobile their victory margin to was ridiculously high and ender began to laugh dragon army joined him laughing long and loud they were still laughing when lieutenant anderson and lieutenant morris came in from the teachergate at the south end of the battleroom lieutenant anderson kept his face stiff and unsmiling but ender saw him wink as he held out his hand and offered the stiff formal congratulations that were ritually given to the victor in the game morris found carn carby and unfroze him and the thirteenyearold came and presented himself to ender who laughed without malice and held out his hand carn graciously took enders hand and bowed his head over it it was that or be flashed again lieutenant anderson dismissed dragon army and they silently left the battleroom through the enemys dooragain part of the ritual a light was blinking on the north side of the square door indicating where the gravity was in that corridor ender leading his soldiers changed his orientation and went through the forcefield and into gravity on his feet his army followed him at a brisk run back to the workroom when they got there they formed up into squads and ender hung in the air watching them good first battle he said which was excuse enough for a cheer which he quieted dragon army did all right against rabbits but the enemy isnt always going to be that bad and if that had been a good army we would have been smashed we still would have won but we would have been smashed now let me see b and d toons out here your takeoff from the stars was way too slow if rabbit army knew how to aim a flasher you all would have been frozen solid before a and c even got to the wall they worked out for the rest of the day that night ender went for the first time to the commanders mess hall no one was allowed there until he had won at least one battle and ender was the youngest commander ever to make it there was no great stir when he came in but when some of the other boys saw the dragon on his breast pocket they stared at him openly and by the time he got his tray and sat at an empty table the entire room was silent with the other commanders watching him intensely selfconscious ender wondered how they all knew and why they all looked so hostile then he looked above the door he had just come through there was a huge scoreboard across the entire wall it showed the winloss record for the commander of every army that days battles were lit in red only four of them the other three winners had barely made itthe best of them had only two men whole and eleven mobile at the end of the game dragon armys score of thirtyeight mobile was embarrassingly better other new commanders had been admitted to the commanders mess hall with cheers and congratulations other new commanders hadnt won thirtyeight to zero ender looked for rabbit army on the scoreboard he was surprised to find that carn carbys score to date was eight wins and three losses was he that good or had he only fought against inferior armies whichever there was still a zero in carns mobile and whole columns and ender looked down from the scoreboard grinning no one smiled back and ender knew that they were afraid of him which meant that they would hate him which meant that anyone who went into battle against dragon army would be scared and angry and less competent ender looked for carn carby in the crowd and found him not too far away he stared at carby until one of the other boys nudged the rabbit commander and pointed to ender ender smiled again and waved slightly carby turned red and ender satisfied leaned over his dinner and began to eat at the end of the week dragon army had fought seven battles in seven days the score stood wins and losses ender had never had more than five boys frozen in any game it was no longer possible for the other commanders to ignore ender a few of them sat with him and quietly conversed about game strategies that enders opponents had used other much larger groups were talking with the commanders that ender had defeated trying to find out what ender had done to beat them in the middle of the meal the teacher door opened and the groups fell silent as lieutenant anderson stepped in and looked over the group when he located ender he strode quickly across the room and whispered in enders ear ender nodded finished his glass of water and left with the lieutenant on the way out anderson handed a slip of paper to one of the older boys the room became very noisy with conversation as anderson and ender left ender was escorted down corridors he had never seen before they didnt have the blue glow of the soldier corridors most were wood paneled and the floors were carpeted the doors were wood with nameplates on them and they stopped at one that said captain graff supervisor anderson knocked softly and a low voice said come in they went in captain graff was seated behind a desk his hands folded across his pot belly he nodded and anderson sat ender also sat down graff cleared his throat and spoke seven days since your first battle ender ender did not reply won seven battles one every day ender nodded scores unusually high too ender blinked why graff asked him ender glanced at anderson and then spoke to the captain behind the desk two new tactics sir legs doubled up as a shield so that a flash doesnt immobilize jackknife takeoffs from the walls superior strategy as lieutenant anderson taught think places not spaces five toons of eight instead of four of ten incompetent opponents excellent toon leaders good soldiers graff looked at ender without expression waiting for what ender wondered lieutenant anderson spoke up ender whats the condition of your army do they want me to ask for relief not a chance he decided a little tired in peak condition morale high learning fast anxious for the next battle anderson looked at graff graff shrugged slightly and turned to ender is there anything you want to know ender held his hands loosely in his lap when are you going to put us up against a good army graffs laughter rang in the room and when it stopped graff handed a piece of paper to ender now the captain said and ender read the paper dragon army against leopard army ender wiggins and pol slattery ender looked up at captain graff thats ten minutes from now sir graff smiled better hurry then boy as ender left he realized pol slattery was the boy who had been handed his orders as ender left the mess hall he got to his army five minutes later three toon leaders were already undressed and lying naked on their beds he sent them all flying down the corridors to rouse their toons and gathered up their suits himself when all his boys were assembled in the corridor most of them still getting dressed ender spoke to them this ones hot and theres no time well be late to the door and the enemyll be deployed right outside our gate ambush and ive never heard of it happening before so well take our time at the door a and b toons keep your belts loose and give your flashers to the leaders and seconds of the other toons puzzled his soldiers complied by then all were dressed and ender led them at a trot to the gate when they reached it the forcefield was already on oneway and some of his soldiers were panting they had had one battle that day and a full workout they were tired ender stopped at the entrance and looked at the placement of the enemy soldiers some of them were grouped not more than twenty feet out from the gate there was no grid there were no stars a big empty space where were most of the enemy soldiers there should have been thirty more theyre flat against this wall ender said where we cant see them he took a and b toons and made them kneel their hands on their hips then he flashed them so that their bodies were frozen rigid youre shields ender said and then had boys from c and d kneel on their legs and hook both arms under the frozen boys belts each boy was holding two flashers then ender and the members of e toon picked up the duos three at a time and threw them out the door of course the enemy opened fire immediately but they mainly hit the boys who were already flashed and in a few moments pandemonium broke out in the battleroom all the soldiers of leopard army were easy targets as they lay pressed flat against the wall or floated unprotected in the middle of the battleroom and enders soldiers armed with two flashers each carved them up easily pol slattery reacted quickly ordering his men away from the wall but not quickly enoughonly a few were able to move and they were flashed before they could get a quarter of the way across the battleroom when the battle was over dragon army had only twelve boys whole the lowest score they had ever had but ender was satisfied and during the ritual of surrender pol slattery broke form by shaking hands and asking why did you wait so long getting out of the gate ender glanced at anderson who was floating nearby i was informed late he said it was an ambush slattery grinned and gripped enders hand again good game ender didnt smile at anderson this time he knew that now the games would be arranged against him to even up the odds he didnt like it it was nearly time for lights out when ender knocked at the door of the room shared by bean and three other soldiers one of the others opened the door then stepped back and held it wide ender stood for a moment then asked if he could come in they answered of course of course come in and he walked to the upper bunk where bean had set down his book and was leaning on one elbow to look at ender bean can you give me twenty minutes near lights out bean answered my room ender answered ill cover for you bean sat up and slid off his bed together he and ender padded silently down the corridor to enders room bean entered first and ender closed the door behind them sit down ender said and they both sat on the edge of the bed looking at each other remember four weeks ago bean when you told me to make you a toon leader yeah ive made five toon leaders since then havent i and none of them was you bean looked at him calmly was i right ender asked yes sir bean answered ender nodded how have you done in these battles bean cocked his head to one side ive never been immobilized sir and ive immobilized fortythree of the enemy ive obeyed orders quickly and ive commanded a squad in mopup and never lost a soldier then youll understand this ender paused then decided to back up and say something else first you know youre early bean by a good half year i was too and ive been made a commander six months early now theyve put me into battles after only three weeks of training with my army theyve given me eight battles in seven days ive already had more battles than boys who were made commander four months ago ive won more battles than many whove been commanders for a year and then tonight you know what happened tonight bean nodded they told you late i dont know what the teachers are doing but my army is getting tired and im getting tired and now theyre changing the rules of the game you see bean ive looked in the old charts no one has ever destroyed so many enemies and kept so many of his own soldiers whole in the history of the game im uniqueand im getting unique treatment bean smiled youre the best ender ender shook his head maybe but it was no accident that i got the soldiers i got my worst soldier could be a toon leader in another army ive got the best theyve loaded things my waybut now theyre loading it all against me i dont know why but i know i have to be ready for it i need your help why mine because even though there are some better soldiers than you in dragon armynot many but sometheres nobody who can think better and faster than you bean said nothing they both knew it was true ender continued i need to be ready but i cant retrain the whole army so im going to cut every toon down by one including you with four others youll be a special squad under me and youll learn to do some new things most of the time youll be in the regular toons just like you are now but when i need you see bean smiled and nodded thats right thats good can i pick them myself one from each toon except your own and you cant take any toon leaders what do you want us to do bean i dont know i dont know what theyll throw at us what would you do if suddenly our flashers didnt work and the enemys did what would you do if we had to face two armies at once the only thing i know isthere may be a game where we dont even try for score where we just go for the enemys gate thats when the battle is technically wonfour helmets at the corners of the gate i want you ready to do that any time i call for it got it you take them for two hours a day during regular workout then you and i and your soldiers well work at night after dinner well get tired i have a feeling we dont know what tired is ender reached out and took beans hand and gripped it even when its rigged against us bean well win bean left in silence and padded down the corridor dragon army wasnt the only army working out after hours now the other commanders had finally realized they had some catching up to do from early morning to lights out soldiers all over training and command center none of them over fourteen years old were learning to jackknife off walls and use each other as living shields but while other commanders mastered the techniques that ender had used to defeat them ender and bean worked on solutions to problems that had never come up there were still battles every day but for a while they were normal with grids and stars and sudden plunges through the gate and after the battles ender and bean and four other soldiers would leave the main group and practice strange maneuvers attacks without flashers using feet to physically disarm or disorient an enemy using four frozen soldiers to reverse the enemys gate in less than two seconds and one day bean came to workout with a meter cord whats that for i dont know yet absently bean spun one end of the cord it wasnt more than an eighth of an inch thick but it could have lifted ten adults without breaking where did you get it commissary they asked what for i said to practice tying knots bean tied a loop in the end of the rope and slid it over his shoulders here you two hang on to the wall here now dont let go of the rope give me about fifty yards of slack they complied and bean moved about ten feet from them along the wall as soon as he was sure they were ready he jackknifed off the wall and flew straight out fifty yards then the rope snapped taut it was so fine that it was virtually invisible but it was strong enough to force bean to veer off at almost a right angle it happened so suddenly that he had inscribed a perfect arc and hit the wall hard before most of the other soldiers knew what had happened bean did a perfect rebound and drifted quickly back to where ender and the others waited for him many of the soldiers in the five regular squads hadnt noticed the rope and were demanding to know how it was done it was impossible to change direction that abruptly in nullo bean just laughed wait till the next game without a grid theyll never know what hit them they never did the next game was only two hours later but bean and two others had become pretty good at aiming and shooting while they flew at ridiculous speeds at the end of the rope the slip of paper was delivered and dragon army trotted off to the gate to battle with griffin army bean coiled the rope all the way when the gate opened all they could see was a large brown star only fifteen feet away completely blocking their view of the enemys gate ender didnt pause bean give yourself fifty feet of rope and go around the star bean and his four soldiers dropped through the gate and in a moment bean was launched sideways away from the star the rope snapped taut and bean flew forward as the rope was stopped by each edge of the star in turn his arc became tighter and his speed greater until when he hit the wall only a few feet away from the gate he was barely able to control his rebound to end up behind the star but he immediately moved all his arms and legs so that those waiting inside the gate would know that the enemy hadnt flashed him anywhere ender dropped through the gate and bean quickly told him how griffin army was situated theyve got two squares of stars all the way around the gate all their soldiers are under cover and theres no way to hit any of them until were clear to the bottom wall even with shields wed get there at half strength and we wouldnt have a chance they moving ender asked do they need to i would ender thought for a moment this ones tough well go for the gate bean griffin army began to call out to them hey is anybody there wake up theres a war on we wanna join the picnic they were still calling when enders army came out from behind their star with a shield of fourteen frozen soldiers william bee griffin armys commander waited patiently as the screen approached his men waiting at the fringes of their stars for the moment when whatever was behind the screen became visible about ten yards away the screen suddenly exploded as the soldiers behind it shoved the screen north the momentum carried them south twice as fast and at the same moment the rest of dragon army burst from behind their star at the opposite end of the room firing rapidly william bees boys joined battle immediately of course but william bee was far more interested in what had been left behind when the shield disappeared a formation of four frozen dragon army soldiers was moving headfirst toward the griffin army gate held together by another frozen soldier whose feet and hands were hooked through their belts a sixth soldier hung to his waist and trailed like the tail of a kite griffin army was winning the battle easily and william bee concentrated on the formation as it approached the gate suddenly the soldier trailing in back movedhe wasnt frozen at all and even though william bee flashed him immediately the damage was done the formation drifted to the griffin army gate and their helmets touched all four corners simultaneously a buzzer sounded the gate reversed and the frozen soldier in the middle was carried by momentum right through the gate all the flashers stopped working and the game was over the teachergate opened and lieutenant anderson came in anderson stopped himself with a slight movement of his hands when he reached the center of the battleroom ender he called breaking protocol one of the frozen dragon soldiers near the south wall tried to call through jaws that were clamped shut by the suit anderson drifted to him and unfroze him ender was smiling i beat you again sir ender said anderson didnt smile thats nonsense ender anderson said softly your battle was with william bee of griffin army ender raised an eyebrow after that maneuver anderson said the rules are being revised to require that all of the enemys soldiers must be immobilized before the gate can be reversed thats all right ender said it could only work once anyway anderson nodded and was turning away when ender added is there going to be a new rule that armies be given equal positions to fight from anderson turned back around if youre in one of the positions ender you can hardly call them equal whatever they are william bee counted carefully and wondered how in the world he had lost when not one of his soldiers had been flashed and only four of enders soldiers were even mobile and that night as ender came into the commanders mess hall he was greeted with applause and cheers and his table was crowded with respectful commanders many of them two or three years older than he was he was friendly but while he ate he wondered what the teachers would do to him in his next battle he didnt need to worry his next two battles were easy victories and after that he never saw the battleroom again it was and ender was a little irritated to hear someone knock at his door his army was exhausted and he had ordered them all to be in bed after the last two days had been regular battles and ender was expecting the worst in the morning it was bean he came in sheepishly and saluted ender returned his salute and snapped bean i wanted everybody in bed bean nodded but didnt leave ender considered ordering him out but as he looked at bean it occurred to him for the first time in weeks just how young bean was he had turned eight a week before and he was still small andno ender thought he wasnt young nobody was young bean had been in battle and with a whole army depending on him he had come through and won and even though he was small ender could never think of him as young again ender shrugged and bean came over and sat on the edge of the bed the younger boy looked at his hands for a while and finally ender grew impatient and asked well what is it im transferred got orders just a few minutes ago ender closed his eyes for a moment i knew theyd pull something new now theyre takingwhere are you going rabbit army how can they put you under an idiot like carn carby carn was graduated support squads ender looked up well whos commanding rabbit then bean held his hands out helplessly me he said ender nodded and then smiled of course after all youre only four years younger than the regular age it isnt funny bean said i dont know whats going on here first all the changes in the game and now this i wasnt the only one transferred either ender ren peder brian wins younger all commanders now ender stood up angrily and strode to the wall every damn toon leader ive got he said and whirled to face bean if theyre going to break up my army bean why did they bother making me a commander at all bean shook his head i dont know youre the best ender nobodys ever done what youve done nineteen battles in fifteen days sir and you won every one of them no matter what they did to you and now you and the others are commanders you know every trick ive got i trained you and who am i supposed to replace you with are they going to stick me with six greenohs it stinks ender but you know that if they gave you five crippled midgets and armed you with a roll of toilet paper youd win they both laughed and then they noticed that the door was open lieutenant anderson stepped in he was followed by captain graff ender wiggins graff said holding his hands across his stomach yes sir ender answered orders anderson extended a slip of paper ender read it quickly then crumpled it still looking at the air where the paper had been after a few moments he asked can i tell my army theyll find out graff answered its better not to talk to them after orders it makes it easier for you or for me ender asked he didnt wait for an answer he turned quickly to bean took his hand for a moment and then headed for the door wait bean said where are you going tactical or support school command school ender answered and then he was gone and anderson closed the door command school bean thought nobody went to command school until they had gone through three years of tactical but then nobody went to tactical until they had been through at least five years of battle school ender had only had three the system was breaking up no doubt about it bean thought either somebody at the top was going crazy or something was going wrong with the warthe real war the one they were training to fight in why else would they break down the training system advance somebodyeven somebody as good as enderstraight to command school why else would they ever have an eightyearold greenoh like bean command an army bean wondered about it for a long time and then he finally lay down on enders bed and realized that hed never see ender again probably for some reason that made him want to cry but he didnt cry of course training in the preschools had taught him how to force down emotions like that he remembered how his first teacher when he was three would have been upset to see his lip quivering and his eyes full of tears bean went through the relaxing routine until he didnt feel like crying anymore then he drifted off to sleep his hand was near his mouth it lay on his pillow hesitantly as if bean couldnt decide whether to bite his nails or suck on his fingertips his forehead was creased and furrowed his breathing was quick and light he was a soldier and if anyone had asked him what he wanted to be when he grew up he wouldnt have known what they meant theres a war on they said and that was excuse enough for all the hurry in the world they said it like a password and flashed a little card at every ticket counter and customs check and guard station it got them to the head of every line ender wiggins was rushed from place to place so quickly he had no time to examine anything but he did see trees for the first time he saw men who were not in uniform he saw women he saw strange animals that didnt speak but that followed docilely behind women and small children he saw suitcases and conveyor belts and signs that said words he had never heard of he would have asked someone what the words meant except that purpose and authority surrounded him in the persons of four very high officers who never spoke to each other and never spoke to him ender wiggins was a stranger to the world he was being trained to save he did not remember ever leaving battle school before his earliest memories were of childish war games under the direction of a teacher of meals with other boys in the grey and green uniforms of the armed forces of his world he did not know that the grey represented the sky and the green represented the great forests of his planet all he knew of the world was from vague references to outside and before he could make any sense of the strange world he was seeing for the first time they enclosed him again within the shell of the military where nobody had to say theres a war on anymore because no one within the shell of the military forgot it for a single instant of a single day they put him in a spaceship and launched him to a large artificial satellite that circled the world this space station was called command school it held the ansible on his first day ender wiggins was taught about the ansible and what it meant to warfare it meant that even though the starships of todays battles were launched a hundred years ago the commanders of the starships were men of today who used the ansible to send messages to the computers and the few men on each ship the ansible sent words as they were spoken orders as they were made battleplans as they were fought light was a pedestrian for two months ender wiggins didnt meet a single person they came to him namelessly taught him what they knew and left him to other teachers he had no time to miss his friends at battle school he only had time to learn how to operate the simulator which flashed battle patterns around him as if he were in a starship at the center of the battle how to command mock ships in mock battle by manipulating the keys on the simulator and speaking words into the ansible how to recognize instantly every enemy ship and the weapons it carried by the pattern that the simulator showed how to transfer all that he learned in the nullo battles at battle school to the starship battles at command school he had thought the game was taken seriously before here they hurried him through every step were angry and worried beyond reason every time he forgot something or made a mistake but he worked as he had always worked and learned as he had always learned after a while he didnt make any more mistakes he used the simulator as if it were a part of himself then they stopped being worried and gave him a teacher maezr rackham was sitting crosslegged on the floor when ender awoke he said nothing as ender got up and showered and dressed and ender did not bother to ask him anything he had long since learned that when something unusual was going on he would often find out more information faster by waiting than by asking maezr still hadnt spoken when ender was ready and went to the door to leave the room the door didnt open ender turned to face the man sitting on the floor maezr was at least forty which made him the oldest man ender had ever seen close up he had a days growth of black and white whiskers that grizzled his face only slightly less than his closecut hair his face sagged a little and his eyes were surrounded by creases and lines he looked at ender without interest ender turned back to the door and tried again to open it all right he said giving up whys the door locked maezr continued to look at him blankly ender became impatient im going to be late if im not supposed to be there until later than tell me so i can go back to bed no answer is it a guessing game ender asked no answer ender decided that maybe the man was trying to make him angry so he went through a relaxing exercise as he leaned on the door and soon he was calm again maezr didnt take his eyes off ender for the next two hours the silence endured maezr watching ender constantly ender trying to pretend he didnt notice the old man the boy became more and more nervous and finally ended up walking from one end of the room to the other in a sporadic pattern he walked by maezr as he had several times before and maezrs hand shot out and pushed enders left leg into his right in the middle of a step ender fell flat on the floor he leaped to his feet immediately furious he found maezr sitting calmly crosslegged as if he had never moved ender stood poised to fight but the others immobility made it impossible for ender to attack and he found himself wondering if he had only imagined the old mans hand tripping him up the pacing continued for another hour with ender wiggins trying the door every now and then at last he gave up and took off his uniform and walked to his bed as he leaned over to pull the covers back he felt a hand jab roughly between his thighs and another hand grab his hair in a moment he had been turned upside down his face and shoulders were being pressed into the floor by the old mans knee while his back was excruciatingly bent and his legs were pinioned by maezrs arm ender was helpless to use his arms and he couldnt bend his back to gain slack so he could use his legs in less than two seconds the old man had completely defeated ender wiggins all right ender gasped you win maezrs knee thrust painfully downward since when maezr asked in a soft rasping voice do you have to tell the enemy when he has won ender remained silent i surprised you once ender wiggins why didnt you destroy me immediately afterward just because i looked peaceful you turned your back on me stupid you have learned nothing you have never had a teacher ender was angry now ive had too many damned teachers how was i supposed to know youd turn out to be a ender hunted for a word maezr supplied one an enemy ender wiggins maezr whispered i am your enemy the first one youve ever had who was smarter than you there is no teacher but the enemy ender wiggins no one but the enemy will ever tell you what the enemy is going to do no one but the enemy will ever teach you how to destroy and conquer i am your enemy from now on from now on i am your teacher then maezr let enders legs fall to the floor because the old man still held enders head to the floor the boy couldnt use his arms to compensate and his legs hit the plastic surface with a loud crack and a sickening pain that made ender wince then maezr stood and let ender rise slowly the boy pulled his legs under him with a faint groan of pain and he knelt on all fours for a moment recovering then his right arm flashed out maezr quickly danced back and enders hand closed on air as his teachers foot shot forward to catch ender on the chin enders chin wasnt there he was lying flat on his back spinning on the floor and during the moment that maezr was off balance from his kick enders feet smashed into maezrs other leg the old man fell on the ground in a heap what seemed to be a heap was really a hornets nest ender couldnt find an arm or a leg that held still long enough to be grabbed and in the meantime blows were landing on his back and arms ender was smallerhe couldnt reach past the old mans flailing limbs so he leaped back out of the way and stood poised near the door the old man stopped thrashing about and sat up crosslegged again laughing better this time boy but slow you will have to be better with a fleet than you are with your body or no one will be safe with you in command lesson learned ender nodded slowly maezr smiled good then well never have such a battle again all the rest with the simulator i will program your battles i will devise the strategy of your enemy and you will learn to be quick and discover what tricks the enemy has for you remember boy from now on the enemy is more clever than you from now on the enemy is stronger than you from now on you are always about to lose then maezrs face became serious again you will be about to lose ender but you will win you will learn to defeat the enemy he will teach you how maezr got up and walked toward the door ender stepped back out of the way as the old man touched the handle of the door ender leaped into the air and kicked maezr in the small of the back with both feet he hit hard enough that he rebounded onto his feet as maezr cried out and collapsed on the floor maezr got up slowly holding on to the door handle his face contorted with pain he seemed disabled but ender didnt trust him he waited warily and yet in spite of his suspicion he was caught off guard by maezrs speed in a moment he found himself on the floor near the opposite wall his nose and lip bleeding where his face had hit the bed he was able to turn enough to see maezr open the door and leave the old man was limping and walking slowly ender smiled in spite of the pain then rolled over onto his back and laughed until his mouth filled with blood and he started to gag then he got up and painfully made his way to the bed he lay down and in a few minutes a medic came and took care of his injuries as the drug had its effect and ender drifted off to sleep he remembered the way maezr limped out of his room and laughed again he was still laughing softly as his mind went blank and the medic pulled the blanket over him and snapped off the light he slept until the pain woke him in the morning he dreamed of defeating maezr the next day ender went to the simulator room with his nose bandaged and his lip still puffy maezr was not there instead a captain who had worked with him before showed him an addition that had been made the captain pointed to a tube with a loop at one end radio primitive i know but it loops over your ear and we tuck the other end into your mouth like this watch it ender said as the captain pushed the end of the tube into his swollen lip sorry now you just talk good who to the captain smiled ask and see ender shrugged and turned to the simulator as he did a voice reverberated through his skull it was too loud for him to understand and he ripped the radio off his ear what are you trying to do make me deaf the captain shook his head and turned a dial on a small box on a nearby table ender put the radio back on commander the radio said in a familiar voice ender answered yes instructions sir the voice was definitely familiar bean ender asked yes sir bean this is ender silence and then a burst of laughter from the other side then six or seven more voices laughing and ender waited for silence to return when it did he asked who else a few voices spoke at once but bean drowned them out me im bean and peder wins younger lee and vlad ender thought for a moment then he asked what the hell was going on they laughed again they cant break up the group bean said we were commanders for maybe two weeks and here we are at command school training with the simulator and all of a sudden they told us we were going to form a fleet with a new commander and thats you ender smiled are you boys any good if we arent youll let us know ender chuckled a little might work out a fleet for the next ten days ender trained his toon leaders until they could maneuver their ships like precision dancers it was like being back in the battleroom again except that now ender could always see everything and could speak to his toon leaders and change their orders at any time one day as ender sat down at the control board and switched on the simulator harsh green lights appeared in the spacethe enemy this is it ender said x y bullet c d reserve screen e south loop bean angle north the enemy was grouped in a globe and outnumbered ender two to one half of enders force was grouped in a tight bulletlike formation with the rest in a flat circular screenexcept for a tiny force under bean that moved off the simulator heading behind the enemys formation ender quickly learned the enemys strategy whenever enders bullet formation came close the enemy would give way hoping to draw ender inside the globe where he would be surrounded so ender obligingly fell into the trap bringing his bullet to the center of the globe the enemy began to contract slowly not wanting to come within range until all their weapons could be brought to bear at once then ender began to work in earnest his reserve screen approached the outside of the globe and the enemy began to concentrate his forces there then beans force appeared on the opposite side and the enemy again deployed ships on that side which left most of the globe only thinly defended enders bullet attacked and since at the point of attack it outnumbered the enemy overwhelmingly he tore a hole in the formation the enemy reacted to try to plug the gap but in the confusion the reserve force and beans small force attacked simultaneously with the bullet moved to another part of the globe in a few more minutes the formation was shattered most of the enemy ships destroyed and the few survivors rushing away as fast as they could go ender switched the simulator off all the lights faded maezr was standing beside ender his hands in his pockets his body tense ender looked up at him i thought you said the enemy would be smart ender said maezrs face remained expressionless what did you learn i learned that a sphere only works if your enemys a fool he had his forces so spread out that i outnumbered him whenever i engaged him and and ender said you cant stay committed to one pattern it makes you too easy to predict is that all maezr asked quietly ender took off his radio the enemy could have defeated me by breaking the sphere earlier maezr nodded you had an unfair advantage ender looked up at him coldly i was outnumbered two to one maezr shook his head you have the ansible the enemy doesnt we include that in the mock battles their messages travel at the speed of light ender glanced toward the simulator is there enough space to make a difference dont you know maezr asked none of the ships was ever closer than thirty thousand kilometers to any other ender tried to figure the size of the enemys sphere astronomy was beyond him but now his curiosity was stirred what kind of weapons are on those ships to be able to strike so fast maezr shook his head the science is too much for you youd have to study many more years than youve lived to understand even the basics all you need to know is that the weapons work why do we have to come so close to be in range the ships are all protected by forcefields a certain distance away the weapons are weaker and cant get through closer in the weapons are stronger than the shields but the computers take care of all that theyre constantly firing in any direction that wont hurt one of our ships the computers pick targets aim they do all the detail work you just tell them when and get them in a position to win all right no ender twisted the tube of the radio around his fingers i have to know how the weapons work i told you it would take i cant command a fleetnot even on the simulatorunless i know ender waited a moment then added just the rough idea maezr stood up and walked a few steps away all right ender it wont make any sense but ill try as simply as i can he shoved his hands into his pockets its this way ender everything is made up of atoms little particles so small you cant see them with your eyes these atoms there are only a few different types and theyre all made up of even smaller particles that are pretty much the same these atoms can be broken so that they stop being atoms so that this metal doesnt hold together anymore or the plastic floor or your body or even the air they just seem to disappear if you break the atoms all thats left is the pieces and they fly around and break more atoms the weapons on the ships set up an area where its impossible for atoms of anything to stay together they all break down so things in that areathey disappear ender nodded youre right i dont understand it can it be blocked no but it gets wider and weaker the farther it goes from the ship so that after a while a forcefield will block it ok and to make it strong at all it has to be focused so that a ship can only fire effectively in maybe three or four directions at once ender nodded again but he didnt really understand not well enough if the pieces of the broken atoms go breaking more atoms why doesnt it just make everything disappear space those thousands of kilometers between the ships theyre empty almost no atoms the pieces dont hit anything and when they finally do hit something theyre so spread out they cant do any harm maezr cocked his head quizzically anything else you need to know do the weapons on the shipsdo they work against anything besides ships maezr moved in close to ender and said firmly we only use them against ships never anything else if we used them against anything else the enemy would use them against us got it maezr walked away and was nearly out the door when ender called to him i dont know your name yet ender said blandly maezr rackham maezr rackham ender said i defeated you maezr laughed ender you werent fighting me today he said you were fighting the stupidest computer in the command school set on a tenyearold program you dont think id use a sphere do you he shook his head ender my dear little fellow when you fight me youll know it because youll lose and maezr left the room ender still practiced ten hours a day with his toon leaders he never saw them though only heard their voices on the radio battles came every two or three days the enemy had something new every time something harderbut ender coped with it and won every time and after every battle maezr would point out mistakes and show ender that he had really lost maezr only let ender finish so that he would learn to handle the end of the game until finally maezr came in and solemnly shook enders hand and said that boy was a good battle because the praise was so long in coming it pleased ender more than praise had ever pleased him before and because it was so condescending he resented it so from now on maezr said we can give you hard ones from then on enders life was a slow nervous breakdown he began fighting two battles a day with problems that steadily grew more difficult he had been trained in nothing but the game all his life but now the game began to consume him he woke in the morning with new strategies for the simulator and went fitfully to sleep at night with the mistakes of the day preying on him sometimes he would wake up in the middle of the night crying for a reason he didnt remember sometimes he woke with his knuckles bloody from biting them but every day he went impassively to the simulator and drilled his toon leaders until the battles and drilled his toon leaders after the battles and endured and studied the harsh criticism that maezr rackham piled on him he noted that rackham perversely criticized him more after his hardest battles he noted that every time he thought of a new strategy the enemy was using it within a few days and he noted that while his fleet always stayed the same size the enemy increased in numbers every day he asked his teacher we are showing you what it will be like when you really command the ratios of enemy to us why does the enemy always outnumber us maezr bowed his grey head for a moment as if deciding whether to answer finally he looked up and reached out his hand and touched ender on the shoulder i will tell you even though the information is secret you see the enemy attacked us first he had good reason to attack us but that is a matter for politicians and whether the fault was ours or his we could not let him win so when the enemy came to our worlds we fought back hard and spent the finest of our young men in the fleets but we won and the enemy retreated maezr smiled ruefully but the enemy was not through boy the enemy would never be through they came again with more numbers and it was harder to beat them and another generation of young men was spent only a few survived so we came up with a planthe big men came up with the plan we knew that we had to destroy the enemy once and for all totally eliminate his ability to make war against us to do that we had to go to his home worldshis home world really since the enemys empire is all tied to his capital world and so ender asked and so we made a fleet we made more ships than the enemy ever had we made a hundred ships for every ship he had sent against us and we launched them against his twentyeight worlds they started leaving a hundred years ago and they carried on them the ansible and only a few men so that someday a commander could sit on a planet somewhere far from the battle and command the fleet so that our best minds would not be destroyed by the enemy enders question had still not been answered why do they outnumber us maezr laughed because it took a hundred years for our ships to get there theyve had a hundred years to prepare for us theyd be fools dont you think boy if they waited in old tugboats to defend their harbors they have new ships great ships hundreds of ships all we have is the ansible that and the fact that they have to put a commander with every fleet and when they loseand they will losethey lose one of their best minds every time ender started to ask another question no more ender wiggins ive told you more than you ought to know as it is ender stood angrily and turned away i have a right to know do you think this can go on forever pushing me through one school and another and never telling me what my life is for you use me and the others as a tool someday well command your ships someday maybe well save your lives but im not a computer and i have to know ask me a question then boy maezr said and if i can answer i will if you use your best minds to command the fleets and you never lose any then what do you need me for who am i replacing if theyre all still there maezr shook his head i cant tell you the answer to that ender be content that we will need you soon its late go to bed you have a battle in the morning ender walked out of the simulator room but when maezr left by the same door a few moments later the boy was waiting in the hall all right boy maezr said impatiently what is it i dont have all night and you need to sleep ender wasnt sure what his question was but maezr waited finally ender asked softly do they live does who live the other commanders the ones now and before me maezr snorted live of course they live he wonders if they live still chuckling the old man walked off down the hall ender stood in the corridor for a while but at last he was tired and he went off to bed they live he thought they live but he cant tell me what happens to them that night ender didnt wake up crying but he did wake up with blood on his hands months wore on with battles every day until at last ender settled into the routine of the destruction of himself he slept less every night dreamed more and he began to have terrible pains in his stomach they put him on a very bland diet but soon he didnt even have an appetite for that eat maezr said and ender would mechanically put food in his mouth but if nobody told him to eat he didnt eat one day as he was drilling his toon leaders the room went black and he woke up on the floor with his face bloody where he had hit the controls they put him to bed then and for three days he was very ill he remembered seeing faces in his dreams but they werent real faces and he knew it even while he thought he saw them he thought he saw bean sometimes and sometimes he thought he saw lieutenant anderson and captain graff and then he woke up and it was only his enemy maezr rackham im awake he said to maezr so i see maezr answered took you long enough you have a battle today so ender got up and fought the battle and he won it but there was no second battle that day and they let him go to bed earlier his hands were shaking as he undressed during the night he thought he felt hands touching him gently and he dreamed he heard voices saying how long can he go on long enough so soon in a few days then hes through how will he do fine even today he was better than ever ender recognized the last voice as maezr rackhams he resented rackhams intruding even in his sleep he woke up and fought another battle and won then he went to bed he woke up and won again and the next day was his last day in command school though he didnt know it he got up and went to the simulator for the battle maezr was waiting for him ender walked slowly into the simulator room he step was slightly shuffling and he seemed tired and dull maezr frowned are you awake boy if ender had been alert he would have cared more about the concern in his teachers voice instead he simply went to the controls and sat down maezr spoke to him todays game needs a little explanation ender wiggins please turn around and pay strict attention ender turned around and for the first time he noticed that there were people at the back of the room he recognized graff and anderson from battle school and vaguely remembered a few of the men from command schoolteachers for a few hours at some time or another but most of the people he didnt know at all who are they maezr shook his head and answered observers every now and then we let observers come in to watch the battle if you dont want them well send them out ender shrugged maezr began his explanation todays game boy has a new element were staging this battle around a planet this will complicate things in two ways the planet isnt large on the scale were using but the ansible cant detect anything on the other side of itso theres a blind spot also its against the rules to use weapons against the planet itself all right why dont the weapons work against planets maezr answered coldly there are rules of war ender that apply even in training games ender shook his head slowly can the planet attack maezr looked nonplussed for a moment then smiled i guess youll have to find that one out boy and one more thing today ender your opponent isnt the computer i am your enemy today and today i wont be letting you off so easily today is a battle to the end and ill use any means i can to defeat you then maezr was gone and ender expressionlessly led his toon leaders through maneuvers ender was doing well of course but several of the observers shook their heads and graff kept clasping and unclasping his hands crossing and uncrossing his legs ender would be slow today and today ender couldnt afford to be slow a warning buzzer sounded and ender cleared the simulator board waiting for todays game to appear he felt muddled today and wondered why people were there watching were they going to judge him today decide if he was good enough for something else for another two years of grueling training another two years of struggling to exceed his best ender was twelve he felt very old and as he waited for the game to appear he wished he could simply lose it lose the battle badly and completely so that they would remove him from the program punish him however they wanted he didnt care just so he could sleep then the enemy formation appeared and enders weariness turned to desperation the enemy outnumbered him a thousand to one the simulator glowed green with them and ender knew that he couldnt win and the enemy was not stupid there was no formation that ender could study and attack instead the vast swarms of ships were constantly moving constantly shifting from one momentary formation to another so that a space that for one moment was empty was immediately filled with formidable enemy force and even though enders fleet was the largest he had ever had there was no place he could deploy it where he would outnumber the enemy long enough to accomplish anything and behind the enemy was the planet the planet which maezr had warned him about what difference did a planet make when ender couldnt hope to get near it ender waited waited for the flash of insight that would tell him what to do how to destroy the enemy and as he waited he heard the observers behind him begin to shift in their seats wondering what ender was doing what plan he would follow and finally it was obvious to everyone that ender didnt know what to do that there was nothing to do and a few of the men at the back of the room made quiet little sounds in their throats then ender heard beans voice in his ear bean chuckled and said remember the enemys gate is down a few of the other toon leaders laughed and ender thought back to the simple games he had played and won in battle school they had put him against hopeless odds there too and he had beaten them and hed be damned if hed let maezr rackham beat him with a cheap trick like outnumbering him a thousand to one he had won a game in battle school by going for something against the ruleshe had won by going against the enemys gate and the enemys gate was down ender smiled and realized that if he broke this rule theyd probably kick him out of school and that way hed win for sure he would never have to play a game again he whispered into the microphone his six commanders each took a part of the fleet and launched themselves against the enemy they pursued erratic courses darting off in one direction and then another the enemy immediately stopped his aimless maneuvering and began to group around enders six fleets ender took off his microphone leaned back in his chair and watched the observers murmured out loud now ender was doing nothinghe had thrown the game away but a pattern began to emerge from the quick confrontations with the enemy enders six groups lost ships constantly as they brushed with each enemy forcebut they never stopped for a fight even when for a moment they could have won a small tactical victory instead they continued on their erratic course that led eventually down toward the enemy planet and because of their seemingly random course the enemy didnt realize it until the same time that the observers did by then it was too late just as it had been too late for william bee to stop enders soldiers from activating the gate more of enders ships could be hit and destroyed so that of the six fleets only two were able to get to the planet and those were decimated but those tiny groups did get through and they opened fire on the planet ender leaned forward now anxious to see if his guess would pay off he half expected a buzzer to sound and the game to be stopped because he had broken the rule but he was betting on the accuracy of the simulator if it could simulate a planet it could simulate what would happen to a planet under attack it did the weapons that blew up little ships didnt blow up the entire planet at first but they did cause terrible explosions and on the planet there was no space to dissipate the chain reaction on the planet the chain reaction found more and more fuel to feed it the planets surface seemed to be moving back and forth but soon the surface gave way in an immense explosion that sent light flashing in all directions it swallowed up enders entire fleet and then it reached the enemy ships the first simply vanished in the explosion then as the explosion spread and became less bright it was clear what happened to each ship as the light reached them they flashed brightly for a moment and disappeared they were all fuel for the fire of the planet it took more than three minutes for the explosion to reach the limits of the simulator and by then it was much fainter all the ships were gone and if any had escaped before the explosion reached them they were few and not worth worrying about where the planet had been there was nothing the simulator was empty ender had destroyed the enemy by sacrificing his entire fleet and breaking the rule against destroying the enemy planet he wasnt sure whether to feel triumphant at his victory or defiant at the rebuke he was certain would come so instead he felt nothing he was tired he wanted to go to bed and sleep he switched off the simulator and finally heard the noise behind him there were no longer two rows of dignified military observers instead there was chaos some of them were slapping each other on the back some of them were bowed head in hands others were openly weeping captain graff detached himself from the group and came to ender tears streamed down his face but he was smiling he reached out his arms and to enders surprise he embraced the boy held him tightly and whispered thank you thank you thank you ender soon all the observers were gathered around the bewildered child thanking him and cheering him and patting him on the shoulder and shaking his hand ender tried to make sense of what they were saying had he passed the test after all why did it matter so much to them then the crowd parted and maezr rackham walked through he came straight up to ender wiggins and held out his hand you made the hard choice boy but heaven knows there was no other way you could have done it congratulations you beat them and its all over all over beat them i beat you maezr rackham maezr laughed a loud laugh that filled the room ender wiggins you never played me you never played a game since i was your teacher ender didnt get the joke he had played a great many games at a terrible cost to himself he began to get angry maezr reached out and touched his shoulder ender shrugged him off maezr then grew serious and said ender wiggins for the last months you have been the commander of our fleets there were no games the battles were real your only enemy was the enemy you won every battle and finally today you fought them at their home world and you destroyed their world their fleet you destroyed them completely and theyll never come against us again you did it you real not a game enders mind was too tired to cope with it all he walked away from maezr walked silently through the crowd that still whispered thanks and congratulations to the boy walked out of the simulator room and finally arrived in his bedroom and closed the door he was asleep when graff and maezr rackham found him they came in quietly and roused him he awoke slowly and when he recognized them he turned away to go back to sleep ender graff said we need to talk to you ender rolled back to face them he said nothing graff smiled it was a shock to you yesterday i know but it must make you feel good to know you won the war ender nodded slowly maezr rackham here he never played against you he only analyzed your battles to find out your weak spots to help you improve it worked didnt it ender closed his eyes tightly they waited he said why didnt you tell me maezr smiled a hundred years ago ender we found out some things that when a commanders life is in danger he becomes afraid and fear slows down his thinking when a commander knows that hes killing people he becomes cautious or insane and neither of those help him do well and when hes mature when he has responsibilities and an understanding of the world he becomes cautious and sluggish and cant do his job so we trained children who didnt know anything but the game and never knew when it would become real that was the theory and you proved that the theory worked graff reached out and touched enders shoulder we launched the ships so that they would all arrive at their destination during these few months we knew that wed probably have only one good commander if we were lucky in history its been very rare to have more than one genius in a war so we planned on having a genius we were gambling and you came along and we won ender opened his eyes again and they realized that he was angry yes you won graff and maezr rackham looked at each other he doesnt understand graff whispered i understand ender said you needed a weapon and you got it and it was me thats right maezr answered so tell me ender went on how many people lived on that planet that i destroyed they didnt answer him they waited awhile in silence and then graff spoke weapons dont need to understand what theyre pointed at ender we did the pointing and so were responsible you just did your job maezr smiled of course ender youll be taken care of the government will never forget you you served us all very well ender rolled over and faced the wall and even though they tried to talk to him he didnt answer them finally they left ender lay in his bed for a long time before anyone disturbed him again the door opened softly ender didnt turn to see who it was then a hand touched him softly ender its me bean ender turned over and looked at the little boy who was standing by his bed sit down ender said bean sat that last battle ender i didnt know how youd get us out of it ender smiled i didnt i cheated i thought theyd kick me out can you believe it we won the war the whole wars over and we thought wed have to wait till we grew up to fight in it and it was us fighting it all the time i mean ender were little kids im a little kid anyway bean laughed and ender smiled then they were silent for a little while bean sitting on the edge of the bed ender watching him out of halfclosed eyes finally bean thought of something else to say what will we do now that the wars over he said ender closed his eyes and said i need some sleep bean bean got up and left and ender slept graff and anderson walked through the gates into the park there was a breeze but the sun was hot on their shoulders abba technics in the capital graff asked no in biggock county training division anderson replied they think my work with children is good preparation and you graff smiled and shook his head no plans ill be here for a few more months reports winding down ive had offers personnel development for dcia executive vicepresident for u and p but i said no publisher wants me to do memoirs of the war i dont know they sat on a bench and watched leaves shivering in the breeze children on the monkey bars were laughing and yelling but the wind and the distance swallowed their words look graff said pointing a little boy jumped from the bars and ran near the bench where the two men sat another boy followed him and holding his hands like a gun he made an explosive sound the child he was shooting at didnt stop he fired again i got you come back here the other little boy ran on out of sight dont you know when youre dead the boy shoved his hands in his pockets and kicked a rock back to the monkey bars anderson smiled and shook his head kids he said then he and graff stood up and walked on out of the park david drake david drakes multivolume series of novels and short fiction

from the heart of darkness many of which have warbased themes the light in the kitchen alcove glittered on lt schillings blond curls glittered also on the frostspangled window beside her and from the armor of the tank parked outside all the highlights looked cold to capt danny pritchard as he stepped closer to the infantry lieutenant sal pritchard began from the orderly room behind them came the babble of the radios ranked against one wall and less muted the laughter of soldiers waiting for action you cant think like a dutchman anymore were hammers slammers all of us were mercs not dutch not frisians youre not lt schilling snapped looking up from the cup of bitter chocolate she had just drawn from the urn she was a short woman and lightly built but she had the unerring instinct of a bully who is willing to make a scene for a victim who is not willing to be part of one youre a farmer from dunstan what dyou care about dutch miners whatever these bleeding french do to them but a lot of us do care danny and if you had a little compassion but sal pritchard repeated only his right arm moving as he touched the blond girls shoulder get your hands off me captain she shouted thats over she shifted the mug of steaming chocolate in her hand the voices in the orderly room stilled then simultaneously someone turned up the volume of the radios and at least three people began to talk loudly on unconnected subjects pritchard studied the back of his hand turned it over to examine the calloused palm as well he smiled sorry ill remember that he said in a normal voice he turned and stepped back into the orderly room a brownhaired man of with a good set of muscles to cover his moderate frame and nothing at all to cover his heart those who knew danny pritchard slightly thought him a relaxed man and he looked relaxed even now but waiting around the electric grate were three troopers who knew danny very well indeed the crew of the plow pritchards command tank kowie drove the beast a rabbiteyed man whose fingers now flipped cards in another game of privy solitaire his deck was so dirty that only familiarity allowed him to read the pips kowies hands and eyes were just as quick at the controls of the tank sliding its bulbous hundred and fifty metric tons through spaces that were only big enough to pass it when he had to he drove nervelessly through objects instead of going around kowie would never be more than a tank driver but he was the best tank driver in the regiment rob jenne was big and as blond as lt schilling he grinned up at pritchard his expression changing from embarrassment to relief as he saw that his captain was able to smile also jenne had transferred from combat cars to tanks three years back after the slammers had pulled out of squires world he was sharpeyed and calm in a crisis twice after his transfer jenne had been offered a blower of his own to command if he would return to combat cars he had refused both promotions saying he would stay with tanks or buy back his contract that there was no way he was going back to those opentopped coffins again when a tank commanders slot came open jenne got it and pritchard had made the blond sergeant his own blower chief when a directional mine had retired the previous man now jenne straddled a chair backwards his hands flexing a collapsible torsion device that kept his muscles as dense and hard as they had been the day he was recruited from a quarry on burlage line tanks carry only a driver and the blower chief who directs the tank and its guns when they are not under the direct charge of the regiments computer in addition to those two and a captain command tanks have a communications technician to handle the multiplex burden of radio traffic focused on the vehicle pritchards commo tech was margritte dimanzo a slender widow who cropped her lustrous hair short so that it would not interfere with the radio helmet she wore most of her waking hours she was off duty now but she had not removed the bulky headgear which linked her to the six radios in the tank parked outside their simultaneous sound would have been unintelligible babbling to most listeners the blackhaired womans training both conscious and hypnotic broke that babbling into a set of discrete conversations when pritchard reentered the room margritte was speaking to jenne she did not look up at her commander until jennes brightening expression showed her it was safe to do so two commo people and a sergeant with intelligence tabs were at consoles in the orderly room they were from the regiments hq battalion assigned to sector two here on kobold but in no sense a part of the sectors combat companies capt riis s companyinfantryand pritchards own tanks riis was the senior captain and in charge of the sector a matter which neither he nor pritchard ever forgot sally schilling led his first platoon her aide a blackhaired corporal sat with his huge boots up humming as he polished the pieces of his fieldstripped powergun its barrel gleamed orange in the light of the electric grate electricity was more general on kobold than on some wealthier worlds since mining and copper smelting made fusion units a practical necessity but though the copper in the transmission cable might well have been processed on kobold the wire had probably been drawn offworld and shipped back here aurore and friesland had refused to allow even such simple manufactures here on their joint colony they had kept kobold a market and a supplier of raw materials but never a rival going to snow tonight jenne asked umm too cold pritchard said walking over to the grate he pretended he did not hear lt schilling stepping out of the alcove i figure hold it said margritte her index finger curling out for a volume control before the duty man had time to react one of the wall radios boomed loudly to the whole room prodding another switch margritte patched the signal separately through the link implanted in pritchards right mastoid guns and looks like satchel charges theres only one man in each truck but theyve been on the horn too and we can figure on more frenchies here any red alert pritchard ordered facing his commo tech so that she could read his lips where is this the headquarters radiomen stood nervously afraid to interfere but unwilling to let an outsider run their equipment however ably red alert margritte was repeating over all bands then through pritchards implant she said its patrol sigma threenine near haacin dutch civiliansve stopped three outbound provisions trucks from barthes company scramble first platoon pritchard said but tell em to hold for us to arrive as margritte coolly passed on the order pritchard picked up the commo helmet he had laid on his chair when he followed lt schilling into the kitchen the helmet gave him automatic switching and greater range than the bioelectric unit behind his ear the wall radio was saying need some big friendlies fast or itll drop in the pot for sure sigma threeniner pritchard said this is michael one go ahead michael one replied the distant squad leader pritchards commo helmet added an airy boundlessness to his surroundings without really deadening the ambient noise hold what youve got boys the tank captain said theres help on the way the door of the orderly room stood ajar the way pritchards crewmen had left it the captain slammed it shut as he too ran for his tank behind in the orderly room lt schilling was snapping out quick directions to her own platoon and to her awakened commander the plow was already floating when danny reached it ice crystals spewed from beneath the skirts by the lift fans made a bluewhite dazzle in the vehicles running lights frost whitened the ladder up the high side of the tanks plenum chamber and hull pritchard paused to pull on his gloves before mounting sgt jenne anchoring himself with his left hand on the turrets storage rack reached down and lifted his captain aboard without noticeable effort side by side the two men slid through the hatches to their battle stations ready pritchard said over the intercom movin on replied kowie and with his words the tank slid forward over the frozen ground like grease on a hot griddle the command post had been a district roadmaintenance center before all semblance of central government on kobold had collapsed the orderly room and officers quarters were in the supervisors house a comfortable structure with shutters and mottoes embroidered in french on the walls some of the hangings had been defaced by shortrange gunfire the crew barracks across the road now served the troopers on headquarters duty many of the slammers could read the dutch periodicals abandoned there in the breakup the equipment shed beside the barracks garaged the infantry skimmers because the batterypowered platforms could not shrug off the weather like the huge panzers of m company the shed doors were open pluming the night with heated air as the duty platoon ran for its mounts some of the troopers had not yet donned their helmets and body armor jenne waved as the tank swept on by then the road curved and the infantry was lost in the night kobold was a joint colony of aurore and friesland when eighty years of french oppression had driven the dutch settlers to rebellion their first act was to hire hammers slammers the break between hammer and friesland had been sharp but time has a way of blunting anger and letting old habits resume the regimental language was dutch and many of the slammers officers were frisians seconded from their own service friesland gained from the mens experience when they returned home hammer gained company officers with excellent training from the groningen academy to counter the slammers the settlers of auroran descent had hired three francophone regiments if either group of colonists could have afforded to pay its mercenaries unaided the fighting would have been immediate and brief kobold had been kept deliberately poor by its home worlds however so in their necessities the settlers turned to those home worlds for financial help and neither aurore nor friesland wanted a war on kobold friesland had let its settlers swing almost from the beginning sloughing their interests for a half share of the copper produced and concessions elsewhere in its sphere of influence the arrangement was still satisfactory to the council of state if frisian public opinion could be mollified by apparent activity aurore was on the brink of war in the zemla system her parlement feared another proxy war which could in a moment explode fullfledged even though friesland had been weakened by a decade of severe internal troubles so aurore and friesland reached a compromise then under threat of abandonment the warring parties were forced to transfer their mercenaries contracts to the home worlds finally aurore and friesland mutually hired the four regiments the slammers compagnie de barthe the alaudae and phenix moirots mercs from either side were mixed and divided among eight sectors imposed on a map of inhabited kobold there the contract ordered them to keep peace between the factions prevent the importation of modern weapons to either side andwait but col barthe and the auroran leaders had come to a further secret agreement and although hammer had learned of it he had informed only two menmaj steuben his aide and bodyguard and capt daniel pritchard pritchard scowled at the memory even without the details a traitor had sold hammer it would have been obvious that barthe had his own plans in the other sectors hammers men and their french counterparts ran joint patrols both sides scattered their camps throughout the sectors just as the villages of either nationality were scattered barthe had split his sectors in halves brusquely ordering the slammers to keep to the west of the river aillet because his own troops were mining the east of the basin heavily barthes company was noted for its minefields that skill was one of the reasons they had been hired by the french since most of kobold was covered either by forests or by rugged hills armor was limited to roads where wellplaced mines could stack tanks like crushed boxes hammer listened to barthes pronouncement and laughed despite the anger of most of his staff officers beside him joachim steuben had grinned and traced the line of his cutaway holster when danny pritchard was informed he had only shivered a little and called a vehicle inspection for the next morning that had been three months ago the night streamed by like smoke around the tank pritchard lowered his face shield but he did not drop his seat into the belly of the tank vision blocks within gave a view of the tanks surroundings but the farmer in danny could not avoid the feeling of blindness within the impenetrable walls jenne sat beside his captain in a cupola fitted with a threebarrelled automatic weapon he too rode with his head out of the hatch but that was only for comradeship the sergeant much preferred to be inside he would button up at the first sign of hostile action jenne was in no sense a coward it was just that he had quirks most combat veterans do pritchard liked the whistle of the black wind past his helmet warm air from the tanks resistance heaters jetted up through the hatch and kept his body quite comfortable the vehicles huge mass required the power of a fusion plant to drive its lift motors and the additional burden of climate control was inconsequential the tankers face shields automatically augmented the light of the moon dim and red because the sun it reflected was dim and red as well the boosted light level displayed the walls of forest the boles snaking densely to either side of the road at kobolds perihelion the thin stems grew in days to their full sixmeter height and spread a ceiling of redbrown leaves the size of blankets now at aphelion the chilled sapless trees burned with almost explosive intensity the wood was too dangerous to use for heating even if electricity had not been common but it fueled the gasogene engines of most vehicles on the planet jenne gestured ahead blowers he muttered on the intercom his head rested on the gun switch though he knew the vehicles must be friendly the plow slowed pritchard nodded agreement michael first this is michael one he said flash your running lights so we can be sure its you roger replied the radio blue light flickered from the shapes hulking at the edge of the forest ahead kowie throttled the fans up to cruise then chopped them and swung expertly into the midst of the four tanks of the outlying platoon michael one this is sigma one capt riis angry voice demanded in the helmet go ahead barthes sent a battalion across the river im moving lt schilling into position to block em and called central for artillery support you hold your first platoon at haacin for reserve and any partisans up from portela ill take direct command of the rest of negative negative sigma one pritchard snapped the plow was accelerating again second in the line of five tanks they were beasts of prey sliding across the landscape of snow and black trees at kph and climbing let the french through captain there wont be fighting repeat negative fighting there damned well will be fighting michael one if barthe tries to shove a battalion into my sector riis thundered back remember this isnt your command or a joint command im in charge here margritte patch me through to battalion pritchard hissed on intercom the plows turret was cocked to the right it covered the forest sweeping by to that side and anything which might be hiding there pritchards mind was on sally schilling riding a skimmer through forest like that flanking the tanks hurrying with her fifty men to try to stop a battalions hasty advance the commo helmet popped quietly to itself pritchard tensed groping for the words he would need to convince lt col miezierk miezierk under whom command of sectors one and two was grouped had been a frisian regular until five years ago he was supposed to think like a merc now not like a frisian but the voice that suddenly rasped override override was not miezierks sigma one michael one this is regiment go ahead pritchard blurted capt riis equally rattled said yes sir on the threeway link sigma your fire order is cancelled keep your troops on alert but keep em the hell out of barthes way but col hammer riis youre not going to start a war tonight michael one can your panzers handle whatevers going on at haacin without violating the contract yes sir pritchard flashed a map briefly on his face shield to check his position were almost there now if you cant handle it captain youd better hope youre killed in action col hammer said bluntly i havent nursed this regiment for twentythree years to lose it because somebody forgets what his job is then more softlypritchard could imagine the colonel flicking his eyes side to side to gauge bystanders reactionshe added theres support if you need it captainif theyre the ones who breach the contract affirmative keep the lid on boy regiment out the trees had drunk the whine of the fans now the road curved and the tanks banked greasily to join the main highway from dimo to portela the tailings pile of the haacin mine loomed to the right and hurled the drive noise back redoubled at the vehicles the steel skirts of the lead tank touched the road metal momentarily showering the night with orange sparks beyond the mine were the nowempty wheat fields and then the village itself haacin the largest dutch settlement in sector two sprawled to either side of the highway its houses were two and threestory lumps of cemented mine tailings they were roofed with tile or plastic rather than shakes of native timber because of the woods lethal flammability the highway was straight and broad it gave pritchard a good view of the three cargo vehicles pulled to one side men in local dress swarmed about them across the road were ten of hammers khakiclad infantry patrol s whose ported weapons halfthreatened halfprotected the trio of drivers in their midst occasionally a civilian turned to hurl a curse at barthes men but mostly the dutch busied themselves with offloading cartons from the trucks pritchard gave a brief series of commands the four line tanks grounded in a hedgehog at the edge of the village their main guns and automatics faced outward in all directions kowie swung the command vehicle around the tank which had been leading it he cut the fans angle of attack slowing the plow without losing the ability to accelerate quickly the command vehicle eased past the squad of infantry then grounded behind the rearmost truck pritchard felt the fans hum through the metal of the hull whos in charge here the captain demanded his voice booming through the command vehicles public address system the dutch unloading the trucks halted silently a squat man in a parka of feathery native fur stepped forward unlike many of the other civilians he was not armed he did not flinch when pritchard pinned him with the spotlight of the tank i am paul van oosten the man announced in the heavy dutch of kobold i am mayor of haacin but if you mean who leads us in what we are doing here wellperhaps justice herself does klaus show them what these trucks were carrying to portela another civilian stepped forward ripping the top off the box he carried flat plastic wafers spilled from it glittering in the cold light powergun ammunition intended for shoulder weapons like those the infantry carried they were taking powerguns to the beasts of portela to use against us van oosten said he used the slang term skepsels to name the francophone settlers the mayors shaven jaw was jutting out in anger captain called one of barthes truck drivers brushing forward through the ring of hammers men let me explain one of the civilians growled and lifted his heavy musket rob jenne rang his knuckles twice on the receiver of his tribarrel calling attention to the muzzles as he swept them down across the crowd the dutchman froze jenne smiled without speaking we were sent to pick up wheat the regiment had purchased barthes man began pritchard was not familiar with barthes insigniae but from the mercs age and bearing he was a senior sergeant an unlikely choice to be driving a provisions truck one of the vehicles happened to be partly loaded we didnt take the time to empty it because we were in a hurry to finish the run and go off dutythere was enough room and lift to handle that little bit of gear and the grain besides in any case and here the sergeant began pressing because the tank captain had not cut him off at the first sentence as expectedyou do not and these fools surely do not have the right to stop col barthes transport if you have questions about the way we pick up wheat thats between your co and ours sir pritchard ran his gloved index finger back and forth below his right eyesocket he was ice inside bubbling ice that tore and chilled him and had nothing to do with the weather he turned back to mayor van oosten reload the trucks he said hoping that his voice did not break you cant van oosten cried these powerguns are the only chance my village my people have to survive when you leave you know thatll happen dont you friesland and aurore theyll come to an agreement a tradeoff theyll call it and all the troops will leave its our lives theyre trading the beasts in dimo in portela if you let these go through theyll have powerguns that their mercenaries gave them and we pritchard whispered a prepared order into his helmet mike the rearmost of the four tanks at the edge of the village fired a single round from its main gun the night flared cyan as the mm bolt struck the middle of the tailings pile a kilometer away stone decomposed by the enormous energy of the shot recombined in a huge gout of flame vapor lava and cinders spewed in every direction after a moment bits of highflung rock began pattering down on the roofs of haacin the bolt caused a double thunderclap that of the heated air followed by the explosive release of energy at the point of impact when the reverberations died away there was utter silence in haacin on the distant jumble of rock a dying red glow marked where the charge had hit the shot had also ignited some saplings rooted among the stones they had blazed as white torches for a few moments but they were already collapsing as cinders the slammers are playing this by the rules pritchard said loudspeakers flung his quiet words about the village like the echoes of the shot but he was really speaking for the recorder in the belly of the tank preserving his words for a later bonding authority hearing therell be no powerguns in civilian hands load every bit of this gear back in the truck remember theres satellites up there pritchard waved generally at the skythat see everything that happens on kobold if one powergun is fired by a civilian in this sector ill come for him i promise you the mayor sagged within his furs turning to the crowd behind him he said put the guns back on the truck so that the portelans can kill us more easily are you mad van oosten demanded the gunman who had earlier threatened barthes sergeant are you mad kruse the mayor shouted back without trying to hide his fury dye doubt what those tanks would do to haacin and do you doubt this butcher his back was to pritchard but there was no doubt as to whom the mayor meantwould use them on us perhaps tomorrow we could have there was motion at the far edge of the crowd near the corner of a building margritte watching the vision blocks within called a warning pritchard reached for his panic barrob jenne was traversing the tribarrel all three of them were too late the muzzle flash was red and it expanded in pritchards eyes as a hammer blow smashed him in the middle of the forehead the bullets impact heaved the tanker up and backwards his shattered helmet flew off into the night the unyielding hatch coaming caught him in the small of the back arching his torso over it as if he were being broken on the wheel pritchards eyes flared with sheets of light as reaction flung him forward again he realized he was hearing the reports of jennes powergun and that some of the hellish flashes were real if the tribarrels discharges were less brilliant than that of the main gun then they were more than a hundred times as close to the civilians the burst snapped within a meter of one bystander an old man who stumbled backwards into a wall his mouth and staring eyes were three circles of empty terror jenne fired seven rounds every charge but one struck the sniper or the building he sheltered against powdered concrete sprayed from the wall the snipers body spun backwards chest gobbled away by the bolts his right arm still gripped the musket he had fired at pritchard the arm had been flung alone onto the snowy pavement the electric bite of ozone hung in the air with the ghostly afterimages of the shots the dead mans clothes were burning tiny orange flames that rippled into smoke an inch from their bases jennes big left hand was wrapped in the fabric of pritchards jacket holding the dazed officer upright theres another rule you play by the sergeant roared to the crowd you shoot at hammers slammers and you get your balls kicked between your ears sure as god boys sure as death jennes right hand swung the muzzles of his weapon across the faces of the civilians now load the bleeding trucks like the captain said heroes for a brief moment nothing moved but the threatening powergun then a civilian turned and hefted a heavy crate back aboard the truck from which he had just taken it emptyhanded the colonist began to sidle away from the vehicleand from the deadly tribarrel one by one the other villagers reloaded the hijacked cargo the guns and ammunition they had hoped would save them in the cataclysm they awaited one by one they took the blower chiefs unspoken leave to return to their houses one who did not leave was sobbing out her grief over the mangled body of the sniper none of her neighbors had gone to her side they could all appreciatenowwhat it would have meant if that first shot had led to a general firefight instead of jennes selective response rob help me get him inside pritchard heard margritte say pritchard braced himself with both hands and leaned away from his sergeants supporting arm no im all right he croaked his vision was clear enough but the landscape was flashing bright and dim with varicolored light the side hatch of the turret clanked margritte was beside her captain she had stripped off her cold weather gear in the belly of the tank and wore only her khaki uniform get back inside there pritchard muttered its not safe he was afraid of falling if he raised a hand to fend her away he felt an injector prick the swelling flesh over his cheekbones the flashing colors died away though pritchards ears began to ring they carried some into the nearest building the noncom from barthes company was saying he spoke in dutch having sleeptrained in the language during the transit to kobold just as hammers men had in french get it jenne ordered the civilians still near the trucks three of them were already scurrying toward the house the merc had indicated they were back in moments carrying the last of the arms chests pritchard surveyed the scene the cargo had been reloaded except for the few spilled rounds winking from the pavement van oosten and the furious kruse were the only villagers still in sight all right pritchard said to the truck drivers get aboard and get moving and come back by way of bitzen not here ill arrange an escort for you the french noncom winked grinned and shouted a quick order to his men the infantrymen stepped aside silently to pass the truckers the french mercenaries mounted their vehicles and kicked them to life their fans whined and the trucks lifted sending snow crystals dancing with gathering speed they slid westward along the forestrimmed highway jenne shook his head at the departing trucks then stiffened as his helmet spat a message captain he said we got company coming pritchard grunted his own radio helmet had been smashed by the bullet and his implant would only relay messages on the band to which it had been verbally keyed most recently margritte start switching for me he said his slender commo tech was already slipping back inside through the side hatch pritchards blood raced with the chemicals margritte had shot into it his eyes and mind worked perfectly though all his thoughts seemed to have razor edges on them use mine jenne said trying to hand the captain his helmet ive got the implant pritchard said he started to shake his head and regretted the motion instantly that and margrittes worth a helmet any day its a whole battalion jenne explained quietly his eyes scanning the bever road down which command central had warned that barthes troops were coming all but the artillerythats back in dimo but itll range here easy enough brought in antitank battery and a couple calliopes though slide us up ahead of michael first pritchard ordered his driver as the plow shuddered then spun on its axis the captain dropped his seat into the turret to use the vision blocks he heard jennes seat whirr down beside him and the cupola hatch snick closed in front of pritchards knees pale in the instrument lights margritte dimanzo sat still and openeyed at her communications console little friendlies pritchard called through his loudspeakers to the ten infantrymen find yourselves a quiet alley and hope nothing happens the lord help you if you fire a shot without me ordering it the lord help us all pritchard thought to himself ahead of the command vehicle the beetle shapes of first platoon began to shift position michael first pritchard ordered sharply get back as you were were not going to engage barthe were going to meet him maybe kowie slid them alongside then a little forward of the point vehicle of the defensive lozenge they set down all of the tanks were buttoned up save for the hatch over pritchards head the central vision block was a meter by cm panel it could be set for anything from a view of the tanks surroundings to a onetoone image of an object a kilometer away pritchard focused and ran the gain to ten magnifications then thirty at the higher power motion curling along the snowsmoothed grainfields between haacin and its mine resolved into men barthes troops were clad in sootywhite coveralls and battle armor the leading elements were hunched low on the meager platforms of their skimmers magnification and the augmented light made the skittering images grainy but the tankers practiced eye caught the tubes of rocket launchers clipped to every one of the skimmers the skirmish line swelled at two points where selfpropelled guns were strung like beads on the cord of men antitank weapons mm powerguns firing highintensity charges they were supposed to be able to burn through the heaviest armor barthes boys had come loaded for bear oh yes they thought they knew just what they were going up against well the slammers werent going to show them they were wrong tonight running lights everybody pritchard ordered then taking a deep breath he touched the lift on his seat and raised himself head and shoulders back into the chill night air there was a hand light clipped to pritchards jacket he snapped it on aiming the beam down onto the turret top so that the burnished metal splashed diffused radiance up over him it bathed his torso and face plainly for the oncoming infantry through the open hatch pritchard could hear rob cursing just possibly margritte was mumbling a prayer batteries at dimo and harfleur in sector one have received fire orders and are waiting for a signal to execute the implant grated if barthe opens fire command central will not repeat negative use michael first or michael one to knock down the shells your guns will be clear for action michael one pritchard grinned starkly his face would not have been pleasant even if livid bruises were not covering almost all of it the slammers central fire direction computer used radar and satellite reconnaissance to track shells in flight then the computer took control of any of the regiments vehiclemounted powerguns and swung them onto the target centrals message notified pritchard that he would have full control of his weapons at all times while guns tens or hundreds of kilometers away kept his force clear of artillery fire margritte had blocked most of the commo traffic pritchard realized she had let through only this message that was crucial to what they were about to do a good commo tech a very good person indeed the skirmish line grounded the nearest infantrymen were within fifty meters of the tanks and their fellows spread off into the night like lethal wings barthes men rolled off their skimmers and lay prone pritchard began to relax when he noticed that their rocket launchers were still aboard the skimmers the antitank weapons were in instant reach but at least they were not being leveled for an immediate salvo barthe didnt want to fight the slammers his targets were the dutch civilians just as mayor van oosten had suggested an air cushion jeep with a driver and two officers aboard drew close it hissed slowly through the line of infantry then stopped nearly touching the command vehicles bow armor one of the officers dismounted he was a tall man who was probably very thin when he was not wearing insulated coveralls and battle armor he raised his face to pritchard atop the high curve of the blower sweeping up his reflective face shield as he did so he was lt col benoit commander of the french mercenaries in sector two a cleanshaven man with sharp features and a splash of gray hair displaced across his forehead by his helmet benoit grinned and waved at the muzzle of the mm powergun pointed at him nobody had ever said barthes chief subordinate was a coward pritchard climbed out of the turret to the deck then slid down the bow slope to the ground benoit was several inches taller than the tanker with a force of personality which was daunting in a way that height alone could never be it didnt matter to pritchard he worked with tanks and with col hammer nothing else was going to face down a man who was accustomed to those sgt major oberlie reported how well andfirmly you handled their little affair captain benoit said extending his hand to pritchard ill admit that i was a little concerned that i would have to rescue my men myself hammers slammers can be depended on to keep their contracts the tanker replied smiling with false warmth i told these squareheads that any civilian caught with a powergun was going to have to answer to me for it then we made sure nobody thinks we were kidding benoit chuckled little puffs of vapor spurted from his mouth with the sounds youve been sent to the groningen academy have you not capt pritchard the older man asked you understand that i take an interest in my opposite numbers in this sector pritchard nodded the old man picked me for the two year crash course on friesland yeah now and again he sends noncoms he wants to promote but youre not a frisian though you have frisian military training the other mercenary continued nodding to himself as you know captain promotion in some infantry regiments comes much faster than it does in theslammers if you feel a desire to speak to col barthe some time in the future i assure you this evenings business will not be forgotten just doing my job colonel pritchard simpered did benoit think a job offer would make a traitor of him perhaps hammer had bought barthes plans for very little considering their military worth enforcing the contract just like youd have done if things were the other way around benoit chuckled again and stepped back aboard his jeep until we meet again capt pritchard he said for the moment i think well just proceed on into portela thats permissible under the contract of course swing wide around haacin will you pritchard called back the folks therere pretty worked up nobody wants more trouble do we benoit nodded as his jeep lifted he spoke into his helmet communicator the skirmish company rose awkwardly and set off in a counterclockwise circuit of haacin behind them in a column reformed from their support positions at the base of the tailings heap came the truckmounted men of the other three companies pritchard stood and watched until the last of them whined past air stirred by the tanks idling fans leaked out under the skirts the jets formed tiny deltas of the snow which winked as pritchards feet caused eddy currents in their cold precision the tanker recalled col benoits grin command central pritchard said as he climbed his blower michael one everythings smooth here over then sigma one this is michael one ill be back as quick as fansll move me so if you have anything to say we can discuss it then pritchard knew that capt riis must have been burning the net up trying to raise him for a report or to make demands it wasnt fair to make margritte hold the bag now that pritchard himself was free to respond to the sector chief but neither did the dunstan tanker have the energy to argue with riis just at the moment already this night hed faced death and col benoit riis could wait another ten minutes the plows armor was a tight fit for its crew the radios and the central bulk of the main gun with its feed mechanism the command vehicle rode glasssmooth over the frozen roadway with none of the jouncing that a rougher surface might bring even through the air cushion margritte faced pritchard over her console her seat a meter lower than his so that she appeared a suppliant her short hair was the lustrous purpleblack of a grackles throat in sunlight hidden illumination from the instruments brought her face to life gee captain jenne was saying at pritchards side i wish youd a let me pick up that squareheads rifle i know those groundpounders theyre just as apt as not to claim the kill credit themselves and if i cant prove i stepped on the body they might get away with it i remember on paradise me and piet de hagenhe was left wing gunner i was rightboth shot at a partisan and then damned if central didnt decide the slope had blown herself up with a hand grenade after wed wounded her so neither of us got the credit youd think lords blood sergeant pritchard snarled are you so damned proud of killing one of the poor bastards who hired us to protect them jenne said nothing pritchard shrank up inside realizing what he had said and unable to take the words back oh lord rob he said without looking up im sorry itim shook thats all after a brief silence the blond sergeant laughed never been shot in the head myself captain but i can see it might shake a fellow yeah jenne let the whine of the fans stand for a moment as the only further comment while he decided whether he would go on then he said captain for a week after i first saw action i meant to get out of the slammers even if i had to sweep floors on curwin for the rest of my life finally i decided id stick it i didnt like therules of the game but i could learn to play by them and i did and one rule is that you get to be as good as you can at killing the people col hammer wants killed yeah im proud about that one just now it was a tough snap shot and i made it i dont care why were on kobold or who brought us here but i know im supposed to kill anybody who shoots at us and i will well im glad you did pritchard said evenly as he looked the sergeant in the eyes you pretty well saved things from getting out of hand by the way you reacted as if he had not heard his captain jenne went on i was afraid if i stayed in the slammers id turn into an animal like the dogs we trained back home to kill rats in the quarries and i was right but its the way i am now so i dont seem to mind you do care about those villagers dont you margritte asked pritchard unexpectedly the captain looked down and found her eyes on him they were the rich powderblue of chicory flowers youre probably the only person in the regiment who thinks that he said bitterly except for me and maybe col hammer margritte smiled a quick flash and as quickly gone therere rulebook soldiers in the slammers she said captains whod never believe barthe was passing arms to the auroran settlements since hed signed a contract that said he wouldnt you arent that kind and the lord knows col hammer isnt and hes backing you ive been around you too long danny to believe you like what you see the french doing pritchard shrugged his whole face was stiff with bruises and the drugs margritte had injected to control them if hed locked the helmets chin strap the bullets impact would have broken his neck even though the lead itself did not penetrate no i dont like it the brownhaired captain said it reminds me too much of the way the combine kept us so poor on dunstan that a thousand of us signed on for birdseed to fight offplanet just because it was offplanet and if kobold only gets cop from the worlds who settled her then the french skim the best of that sure ill tell the lord i feel sorry for the dutch here pritchard held the commo techs eyes with his own as he continued but its just like rob said margritte ill do my job no matter who gets hurt we cant do a thing to barthe or the french until they step over the line in a really obvious way thatll mean a lot of people get hurt too but thats what im waiting for margritte reached up and touched pritchards hand where it rested on his knee youll do something when you can she said quietly he turned his palm up so that he could grasp the womans fingers what if she knew he was planning an incident not just waiting for one ill do something yeah he said but its going to be too late for an awful lot of people kowie kept the plow at cruising speed until they were actually in the yard of the command post then he cocked the fan shafts forward lifting the bow and bringing the tanks mass around in a curve that killed its velocity and blasted an arc of snow against the building someone inside had started to unlatch the door as they heard the vehicle approach the air spilling from the tanks skirts flung the panel against the inner wall and skidded the man within on his back the man was capt riis pritchard noted without surprise well the incident wouldnt make the infantry captain any angrier than the rest of the evening had made him already riis had regained his feet by the time pritchard could jump from the deck of his blower to the fancleared ground in front of the building the frisians normally pale face was livid now with rage he was of the same somatotype as lt col benoit his french counterpart in the sector tall thin and proudly erect despite the fact that riis was only he was pritchards senior in grade by two years he had kept the rank he held in frieslands regular army when col hammer recruited him many of the slammers were like riis frisian soldiers who had transferred for the action and pay of a fighting regiment in which their training would be appreciated you cowardly filth the infantryman hissed as pritchard approached a squad in battle gear stood within the orderly room beyond riis he pursed his fine lips to spit hey captain rob jenne called riis looked up pritchard turned surprised that the big tank commander was not right on his heels jenne still smiled from the plows cupola he waved at the officers with his left hand his right was on the butterfly trigger of the tribarrel the threat unspoken as it was made a professional of riis again come on into my office he muttered to the tank captain turning his back on the armored vehicle as if it were only a part of the landscape the infantrymen inside parted to pass the captains sally schilling was there her eyes were as hard as her porcelain armor as they raked over pritchard that didnt matter he lied to himself tiredly riis office was at the top of the stairs a narrow cubicle which had once been a childs bedroom the sloping roof pressed in on the occupants though a dormer window brightened the room during daylight one wall was decorated with a regimental battle flagnot hammers rampant lion but a pattern of seven stars on a white field it had probably come from the unit in which riis had served on friesland over the door hung another souvenir a bigbore musket of local manufacture riis threw himself into the padded chair behind his desk those bastards were carrying powerguns to portela he snarled at pritchard the tanker nodded he was leaning with his right shoulder against the door jamb thats what the folks at haacin thought he agreed if theyll put in a complaint with the bonding authority ill testify to what i saw testify testify riis shouted were not lawyers were soldiers you shouldve seized the trucks right then and no i should not have captain pritchard shouted back holding up a mirror to riis anger because if i had barthe wouldve complained to the authority himself and wed at leastve been fined at least the contract says the slammersll cooperate with the other three units in keeping peace on kobold just because we suspect barthe is violating the contract doesnt give us a right to violate it ourselves especially in a way any simpleton can see is a violation if barthe can get away with it we can riis insisted but he settled back in his chair he was physically bigger than pritchard but the tanker had spent half his life with the slammers years like those mark men death is never very far behind their eyes i dont think barthe can get away with it pritchard lied quietly remembering hammers advice on how to handle riis and calm the frisian without telling him the truth barthes officers had been in on his plans and one of them had talked any regiment might have one traitor the tanker lifted down the musket on the wall behind him and began turning it in his fingers if the dutch settlers can prove to the authority that barthes been passing out powerguns to the french the tanker mused aloud well theyre responsible for half barthes pay remember its about as bad a violation as youll find the authorityll forfeit his whole bond and pay it over to whoever they decide the injured parties are thats about three years gross earnings for barthe id judgehe wont be able to replace it and without a bond posted well he may get jobs but theyll be the kind nobody elsed touch for the risk and the pay his best troopsll sign on with other people in a year or so barthe wont have a regiment anymore hes willing to take the chance said riis col hammer isnt pritchard blazed back you dont know that it isnt the sort of thing the colonel could say say pritchard shouted he waved the musket at riis its breech was triplestrapped to take the shock of the industrial explosive it used for propellant clumsy and large it was the best that could be produced on a mining colony whose home worlds had forbidden local manufacturing say i bet my life against one of these tonight that the colonel wanted us to obey the contract do you have the guts to ask him flat out if he wants us to run guns to the dutch i dont think that would be proper captain said riis coldly as he stood up again then try not to think it proper to go do some bloody stupid stunt on your ownsir pritchard retorted so much for good intentions hammerand pritchardhad expected riis support of the dutch civilians they had even planned on it but the man seemed to have lost all his common sense pritchard laid the musket on the desk because his hands were trembling too badly to hang it back on the hooks if it werent for you captain riis said theres not a slammer in this sector whod object to our helping the only decent people on this planet the way we ought to youve made your decision and it sickens me but ive made decisions too pritchard went out without being dismissed he blundered into the jamb but he did not try to slam the door that would have been petty and there was nothing petty in the tankers rage blankfaced he clumped down the stairs his bunk was in a parlor which had its own door to the outside pritchards crew was still in the plow there they had listened intently to his half of the argument with riis transmitted by the implant if pritchard had called for help kowie would have sent the command vehicle through the front wall buttoned up with jenne ready to shoot if he had to to rescue his co a tank looks huge when seen closeup it is all howling steel and iridium with black muzzles ready to spew death across a planet on a battlefield when the sky is a thousand shrieking colors no god ever made and the earth beneath trembles and gouts in sudden mountains a tank is a small world indeed for its crew their loyalties are to nearer things than an abstraction like the regiment besides tankers and infantrymen have never gotten along well together no one was in the orderly room except two radiomen they kept their backs to the stairs pritchard glanced at them then unlatched his door the room was dark as he had left it but there was a presence pritchard said sal as he stepped within and the club knocked him forward into the arms of the man waiting to catch his body the first thing pritchard thought as his mind slipped toward oblivion was that the cloth rubbing his face was homespun not the hard synthetic from which uniforms were made the last thing pritchard thought was that there could have been no civilians within the headquarters perimeter unless the guards had allowed them and that lt schilling was officer of the guard tonight pritchard could not be quite certain when he regained consciousness a heavy felt rug covered and hid his trussed body on the floor of a clattering surface vehicle he had no memory of being carried to the truck though presumably it had been parked some distance from the command post riis and his confederates would not have been so open as to have civilians drive to the door to take a kidnapped officer even if pritchards crew could have been expected to ignore the breach of security kidnapped not for later murder or he would already be dead instead of smothering under the musty rug thick as it was the rug was still inadequate to keep the cold from his shivering body the only lights pritchard could see were the washings of icy color from the nights doubled shock to his skull that bonedeep ache reminded pritchard of the transceiver implanted in his mastoid he said in a husky whisper which he hoped would not penetrate the rug michael one to any unit any unit at all come in please any slammer nothing well no surprise the implant had an effective range of less than twenty meters enough for relaying to and from a base unit but unlikely to be useful in kobolds empty darkness of course if the truck happened to be passing one of m companys night defensive positions michael one to any unit the tanker repeated more urgently a boot slammed him in the ribs a voice in guttural dutch snarled shut up you or you get what you gave henrik so hed been shopped to the dutch not that there had been much question about it and not that he might not have been safer in french hands the way everybody on this cursed planet thought he was a traitor to his real employers well it wasnt fair but danny pritchard had grown up a farmer and no farmer is ever tricked into believing that life is fair the truck finally jolted to a stop gloved hands jerked the cover from pritchards eyes he was not surprised to recognize the concrete angles of haacin as men passed him hand to hand into a cellar the attempt to hijack barthes powerguns had been an accident an opportunity seized but the crew which had kidnapped pritchard must have been in position before the call from s had intervened is this wise pritchard heard someone demand from the background if they begin searching surely theyll begin in haacin the two men at the bottom of the cellar stairs took pritchards shoulders and ankles to carry him to a spring cot it had no mattress the man at his feet called there wont be a search they dont have enough men besides the beastll be blamedas they should be for so many things if pauli wont let us kill the turncoat then well all have to stand the extra risk of him living you talk too much mayor van oosten muttered as he dropped pritchards shoulders on the bunk many civilians had followed the captive into the cellar the last of them swung the door closed it lay almost horizontal to the ground when it slammed dust sprang from the ceiling someone switched on a dim incandescent light the scores of men and women in the storage room were as hard and fell as the bare walls there were three windows at street level high on the wall slotted shutters blocked most of their dusty glass get some heat in this hole or you may as well cut my throat pritchard grumbled a woman with a musket cursed and spat in his face the man behind her took her arm before the gunbutt could smear the spittle almost in apology the man said to pritchard it was her husband you killed youre being kept out of the way said a husky mankruse the hothead from the hijack scene his facial hair was pale and long merging indistinguishably with the silky fringe of his parka like most of the others in the cellar he carried a musket without your meddling therell be a chance for us toget ready to protect ourselves after the tanks leave and the beasts come to finish us with their powerguns does riis think i wont talk when this is over pritchard asked i told you one of the men shouted at van oosten the heavyset mayor silenced him with a tap on the chest and a bellowed quiet the rising babble hushed long enough for van oosten to say captain you will be released in a very few days if youcause trouble then it will only be an embarrassment to yourself even if your colonel believes you were doing right he wont be the one to bring to light a violation which was committed withso you will claimthe connivance of his own officers the mayor paused to clear his throat and glower around the room though in fact we had no help from any of your fellows either in seizing you or in arming ourselves for our own protection are you all blind pritchard demanded he struggled with his elbows and back to raise himself against the wall do you think a few lies will cover it all up the only ships thatve touched on kobold in three months are the ones supplying us and the other mercs barthe maybes smuggled in enough guns in cans of lube oil and the like to arm some civilians he wont be able to keep that a secret but maybe he can keep the authority from proving whos responsible thats with three months and preplanning if riis tries to do anything on his own that many of his own men are going to be short sidearmstheyre all issued by serial number lord take itand a blind mongoloid could get enough proof to sink the regiment you think we dont understand said kruse in a quiet voice he transferred his musket to his left hand then slapped pritchard across the side of the head we understand very well the civilian said all the mercenaries will leave in a few days or weeks if the french have powerguns and we do not they will kill us our wives our children theres a hundred and fifty villages on kobold like this one dutch and as many french ones scattered between it was bad before with no one but the beasts allowed any real say in the government but now if they win therell be french villages and french minesand slave pens forever you think a few gunsll save you pritchard asked kruses blow left no visible mark in the tankers livid flesh though a better judge than kruse might have noted that pritchards eyes were as hard as his voice was mild theyll help us save ourselves when the time comes kruse retorted if youd gotten powerguns from french civilians instead of the mercs directly you might have been all right the captain said he was coldly aware that the lie he was telling was more likely to be believed in this situation than it would have been in any setting he might deliberately have contrived there had to be an incident the french civilians had to think they were safe in using their illegal weapons the portelans say couldnt admit to having guns to lose but anything you take from mercsus or barthe it doesnt matterwell take back the hard way you dont know what youre buying into kruses face did not change but his fist drew back for another blow the mayor caught the younger mans arm and snapped franz were here to show him that its not a few of us its every family in the village behindour holding him van oosten nodded around the room more of us than your colonel could dream of trying to punish he added naively to pritchard then he flashed back at kruse if you act like a fool hell want revenge anyway you may never believe this pritchard interjected wearily but i just want to do my job if you let me go now itmay be easier in the long run fool kruse spat and turned his back on the tanker a trap door opened in the ceiling spilling more light into the cellar pauli a woman shouted down the opening hals is on the radio theres tanks coming down the road just like before the lords wounds van oosten gasped we must they cant know kruse insisted but weve got to get everybody out of here and back to their own houses everybody but me and hima nod at pritchardand this the musket lowered so that its round black eye pointed straight into the bound mans face no by the side door van oosten called to the press of conspirators clumping up toward the street dont run right out in front of them cursing and jostling the villagers climbed the ladder to the ground floor there presumably to exit on an alley able only to twist his head and legs pritchard watched kruse and the trembling muzzle of his weapon the village must have watchmen with radios at either approach through the forests if hals was atop the heap of mine tailingswhere pritchard would have placed his outpost if he were in charge certainlythen hed gotten a nasty surprise when the main gun splashed the rocks with hell the captain grinned at the thought kruse misunderstood and snarled if they are coming for you youre dead you treacherous bastard to the backs of his departing fellows the young dutchman called turn out the light here but leave the trap door open that wont show on the street but itll give me enough light to shoot by the tanks werent coming for him pritchard knew because they couldnt have any idea where he was perhaps his disappearance had stirred up some patrolling for want of more directed action perhaps a platoon was just changing ground because of its commanders whim pritchard had encouraged random motion tanks that freeze in one place are sitting targets albeit hard ones but whatever the reason tanks were approaching haacin if they whined by in the street outside they would be well within range of his implanted transmitter the big blowers were audible now nearing with an arrogant lack of haste as if bears headed for a beehive they were moving at about kph more slowly than pritchard would have expected even for a contact patrol from the sound there were four or more of them smooth and gray and deadly kruse im serious the slammer captain said light from the trap door backlit the civilian into a hulking beast with a musket if you shut up kruse snarled prodding his prisoners bruised forehead with the gun muzzle one more word any word and kruses right hand was so tense and white that the musket might fire even without his deliberate intent the first of the tanks slid by outside its cushion of air was so dense that the ground trembled even though none of the blowers tonnes was in direct contact with it squeezed between the pavement and the steel curtain of the plenum chamber the air spurted sideways and rattled the cellar windows the rattling was inaudible against the howling of the fans themselves but the trembling shutters chopped facets in the play of the tanks running lights kruses face and the far wall flickered in blotched abstraction the tank moved on without pausing pritchard had not tried to summon it that power kruse was mumbling to himself that should be for us to use to sweep the beasts the rest of his words were lost in the growing wail of the second tank in the column pritchard tensed within even if a passing tank picked up his implants transmission its crew would probably ignore the message unless pritchard identified himself the tankers would assume it was babbling thrown by the ionosphere and if he did identify himself kruse kruse thrust his musket against pritchards skull again banging the tankers head back against the cellar wall the dutchmans voice was lost in the blowers howling but his bluelit lips clearly were repeating one word the tank moved on down the highway toward portela and maybe ill shoot you anyway kruse was saying thats the way to serve traitors isnt it mercenary the third blower was approaching its note seemed slightly different though that might be the aftereffect of the preceding vehicles echoing din pritchard was cold all the way to his heart because in a moment he was going to call for help he knew that kruse would shoot him knew also that he would rather die now than live after hope had come so near but passed on passed on the third tank smashed through the wall of the house the plows skirts were not a bulldozer blade but they were thick steel and backed with the mass of a tonne command tank the slag wall repowdered at the impact ceiling joists buckled into pretzel shape and ripped the cellar open to the floor above kruse flung his musket up and fired through the cascading rubble the boom and red flash were lost in the chaos but the bluegreen fire stabbing back across the cellar laid the dutchman on his back with his parka aflame pritchard rolled to the floor at the first shock he thrust himself with corded legs and arms back under the feeble protection of the bunk when the sound of falling objects had died away the captain slitted his eyelids against the rock dust and risked a look upward the collision had torn a gap ten feet long in the house wall crushing it from street level to the beams supporting the second story the tank blocked the hole with its gray bulk fresh scars brightened the patina of corrosion etched onto its skirts by the atmospheres of a dozen planets through the buckled flooring and the dust whipped into arabesques by the idling fans pritchard glimpsed a slight figure clinging lefthanded to the turret her right hand still threatened the wreckage with a submachinegun carpeting burned on the floor above ignited by the burst that killed kruse somewhere a woman was screaming in dutch margritte pritchard shouted margritte down here the helmeted woman swung up her face shield and tried to pierce the cellar gloom with her unaided eyes the tankbattered opening had sufficed for the exchange of shots but the tangle of structural members and splintered flooring was too tight to pass a manor even a small woman sooty flames were beginning to shroud the gap margritte jumped to the ground and struggled for a moment before she was able to heave open the door the plows turret swung to cover her though neither the main gun nor the tribarrel in the cupola could depress enough to rake the cellar margritte ran down the steps to pritchard coughing in the rock dust he rolled out over the rubble to meet her much of the smashed sidewall had collapsed onto the street when the tank backed after the initial impact still the crumpled beams of the ground floor sagged further with the additional weight of the slag on them headsized pieces had splanged on the cot above pritchard margritte switched the submachinegun to her left hand and began using a clasp knife on her captains bonds the cord with which he was tied bit momentarily deeper at the blades pressure pritchard winced then began flexing his freed hands you know margi he said i dont think ive ever seen you with a gun before the commo techs face hardened as if the polarized helmet shield had slipped down over it again you hadnt she said the ankle bindings parted and she stood the dust graying her helmet and her foamfilled coveralls captain kowie had to drive and we needed rob in the cupola at the gun that left me todo anything else that had to be done i did what had to be done pritchard tried to stand using the technician as a post on which to draw himself upright margritte looked frail but with her legs braced she stood like a rock her arm around pritchards back was as firm as a mans you didnt ask capt riis for help i guess pritchard said pain making his breath catch the line tanks had twoman crews with no one to spare for outrider of course we didnt report you missing margritte said even to first platoon they just went along like before thinking you were in the plow giving orders together captain and technician shuffled across the floor to the stairs as they passed kruses body margritte muttered cryptically thats four pritchard assumed the tremors beginning to shake the womans body were from physical strain he took as much weight off her as he could and found his numbed feet were beginning to function reasonably well he would never have been able to board the plow without sgt jennes grip on his arm however the battered officer settled in the turret with a groan of comfort the seat cradled his body with gentle firmness and the warm air blown across him was just the near side of heaven captain jenne said what dwe do about the slopes who grabbed you shall we call in an interrogation team and we dont do anything pritchard interrupted we just pretend none of this happened and head back to he paused his flesh wavered both hot and cold as margritte sprayed his ankles with some of the apparatus from the medical kit say how did you find me anyway we shut off coverage when youwent into your room jenne said seeing that the commo tech herself did not intend to speak he meant pritchard knew they had shut off the sound when their captain had said sal none of the three of them were looking either of the other two in the eyes after a bit though margi noticed the carrier line from your implant had dropped off her oscilloscope i checked your room didnt find you didnt see much point talking it over with the remfs on duty either so we got satellite recce and found two trucksd left the area since we got back one was riis and the other was a civvie junker before that itd been parked in the woods out of sight half a kay up the road from the buildings both trucks unloaded in haacin we couldnt tell which load was you but margi said if we got close shed home on your carrier even though you werent calling us on the implant some girl we got here hey pritchard bent forward and squeezed the commo techs shoulder she did not look up but she smiled yeah always knew she was something he agreed but i dont think i realized quite what a person she was until just now margritte lifted her smile rob ordered first platoon to fall in with us she said he set up the whole rescue her finefingered hands caressed pritchards calves but there was other business in haacin now riis had been quicker to act than pritchard had hoped he asked you say one of the infantrys trucks took a load here a little bit ago yeah you want the offprint jenne agreed searching for the flimsy copy of the satellite picture what the hell would they be doing anyhow i got a suspicion his captain said grimly and i suppose its one weve got to check out michael firstthree to michael one the radio broke in vehicles approaching from the east on the hardball michael one to michael first pritchard said letting the search for contraband arms wait for this new development reverse and form a line abreast beyond the village twenty meter intervals the plowll take the road more weapons from riis more of barthes troops when half his sector command was already in portela pritchard touched switches beneath the vision blocks as kowie slid the tank into position he split the screen between satellite coverage and a groundlevel view at top magnification six vehicles combat cars coming fast pritchard swore friendly because only the slammers had armored vehicles on kobold not that cars were a threat to tanks anyway but no combat cars were assigned to this sector and the unexpected is always bad news to a company commander juggling too many variables already platoon nearing tango sigma fourtwo threetwo please identify to michael one pritchard requested giving haacins map coordinates margritte turned up the volume of the main radio while she continued to bandage the captains rope cuts the set crackled michael one this is alpha one and alpha first stand by gods bleeding cunt rob jenne swore under his breath pritchard was nodding in equal agitation alpha was the regiments special duty company its four combat car platoons were col hammers bodyguards and police the troopers of a company were nicknamed the white mice and they were viewed askance even by the slammers of other companiesmen who prided themselves on being harder than any other combat force in the galaxy the white mice in turn feared their commander maj joachim steuben and if that slightlybuilt killer feared anyone it was the man who was probably traveling with him this night pritchard sighed and asked the question alpha one this is michael one are you flying a pennant sir affirmative michael one well hed figured col hammer was along as soon as he heard what the unit was what the old man was doing here was another question and one whose answer pritchard did not look forward to learning the combat cars glided to a halt under the guns of their bigger brethren the tremble of their fans gave the appearance of heat ripples despite the snow from his higher vantage point pritchard watched the second car slide out of line and fall alongside the plow the men at the nose and right wing guns were both short garbed in nondescript battle gear they differed from the other troopers only in that their helmet shields were raised and that the faces visible beneath were older than those of most slammers col alois hammer and his hatchetman no need for radio captain hammer called in a husky voice what are you doing here pritchards tongue quivered between the truth and a lie his crew had been covering for him and he wasnt about to leave them holding the bag all the breaches of regulations they had committed were for their captains sake sir i brought first platoon back to haacin to check whether any of the powerguns theyd hijacked from barthe were still in civvie hands pritchard could feel eyes behind the cracked shutters of every eastfacing window in the village and have you completed your check the colonel pressed his voice mild but his eyes as hard as those of maj steuben beside him as hard as the iridium plates of the gun shields pritchard swallowed he owed nothing to capt riis but the young fool was his superiorand at least he hadnt wanted the dutch to kill pritchard he wouldnt put riis ass in the bucket if there were neutral ways to explain the contraband besides they were going to need riis and his dutch contacts for the rest of the plan sir when you approached i was about to search a building where i suspect some illegal weapons are stored and instead youll provide backup for the major here said hammer the false humor gone from his face his words rattled like shrapnel hell retrieve the twentyfour powerguns which capt riis saw fit to turn over to civilians tonight if joachim hadnt chanced chanced onto that requisition hammers left glove shuddered with the strength of his grip on the forward tribarrel then the colonel lowered his eyes and voice adding the quartermaster who filled a requisition for twentyfour pistols from central supply is in the infantry again tonight and capt riis is no longer with the regiment steuben tittered loose despite the tension of everyone around him the cold was bitter but joachims right hand was bare with it he traced the baroque intaglios of his holstered pistol mr riis is lucky to be alive the slight newlander said pleasantly luckier than some would have wished but colonel i think wed best go pick up the merchandise before anybody nerves themself to use it on us hammer nodded calm again interfile your blowers with ours captain he ordered your panzers watch street level while the cars take care of upper floors and roofs pritchard saluted and slid down into the tank relaying the order to the rest of his platoon kowie blipped the plows throttles swinging the turreted mass in its own length and sending it back into the village behind the lead combat car the tank felt light as a dancer despite the constricting sidestreet kowie followed the car into pritchard scanned the full circuit of the vision blocks nothing save the wind and armored vehicles moved in haacin when steuben had learned a line company was requisitioning two dozen extra sidearms the major had made the same deductions as pritchard had and had inspected the same satellite tape of a truck unloading either riis was insane or he really thought col hammer was willing to throw away his lifes work to arm a villageinadequately lord and martyrs riis would have had to be insane to believe that their objective was a nondescript twostory building separated from its neighbors by narrow alleys hammer directed the four rearmost blowers down a parallel street to block the rear the searchlights of the vehicles chilled the flat concrete and glared back from the windows of the building a battered surface truck was parked in the street outside it was empty nothing stirred in the house hammer and steuben dismounted without haste the majors helmet was slaved to a loudspeaker in the car the speaker boomed everyone out of the building you have thirty seconds anyone found inside after thatll be shot thirty seconds though the residents had not shown themselves earlier the way they boiled out of the doors proved they had expected the summons all told there were eleven of them from the front door came a welldressed man and woman with their three children a sexless infant carried by its mother in a zippered cocoon a girl of eight with her hood down and her hair coiled in braids about her forehead and a twelveyearold boy who looked nearly as husky as his father outside staircases disgorged an aged couple on the one hand and four toughlooking men on the other pritchard looked at his blower chief the sergeants right hand was near the gun switch and he mumbled an old ballad under his breath chest tightening pritchard climbed out of his hatch he jumped to the ground and paced quietly over to hammer and his aide theres twentyfour pistols in this building joachims amplified voice roared or at least you people know where they are i want somebody to save trouble and tell me the civilians tensed the mother halfturned to swing her body between her baby and the officers joachims pistol was in his hand though pritchard had not seen him draw it nobody to speak joachim queried he shot the eightyearold in the right knee the spray of blood was momentary as the flesh exploded the girls mouth pursed as her buckling leg dropped her facedown in the street the pain would come later her parents screamed the father falling to his knees to snatch up the child as the mother pressed her forehead against the door jamb in blind panic pritchard shouted you son of a bitch and clawed for his own sidearm steuben turned with the precision of a turret lathe his pistols muzzle was a whitehot ring from its previous discharge pritchard knew only that and the fact that his own weapon was not clear of its holster then he realized that col hammer was shouting no and that his open hand had rocked joachims head back joachims face went pale except for the handprint burning on his cheek his eyes were empty after a moment he holstered his weapon and turned back to the civilians now wholl tell us where the guns are he asked in a voice like breaking glassware the tearblind woman still holding her infant gurgled here in the basement as she threw open the door two troopers followed her within at a nod from hammer the father was trying to close the girls wounded leg with his hands but his palms were not broad enough pritchard vomited on the snowy street margritte was out of the tank with a medikit in her hand she flicked the civilians hands aside and began freezing the wound with a spray the front door banged open again the two white mice were back with their submachineguns slung under their arms and a heavy steel weaponschest between them hammer nodded and walked to them you could have brought in an interrogation team pritchard shouted at the backs of his superiors you dont shoot children machine interrogation takes time captain steuben said mildly he did not turn to acknowledge the tanker this was just as effective thats a little girl pritchard insisted with his hand clenched the child was beginning to cry though the local anesthetic in the skinsealer had probably blocked the physical pain the psychic shock of a body that would soon end at the right knee would be worse though the child was old enough to know that no local doctor could save the limb this isnt something that human beings do captain steuben said theyre lucky i havent shot all of them hammer closed the arms chest weve got what we came for he said lets go stealing guns from my colonel the newlander continued as if hammer had not spoken the handprint had faded to a dull blotch i really ought to joachim shut it off hammer shouted were going to talk about what happened tonight you and i id rather do it when we were alonebut ill tell you now if i have to or in front of a court martial steuben squeezed his forehead with the fingers of his left hand he said nothing lets go the colonel repeated pritchard caught hammers arm take the kid back to centrals medics he demanded hammer blinked i should have thought of that he said simply sometimes i lose track ofthings that arent going to shoot at me but we dont need this sort of reputation i dont care cop for public relations pritchard snapped just save that little girls leg steuben reached for the child now lying limp margritte had used a shot of general anesthetic the girls father went wildeyed and swung at joachim from his crouch margritte jabbed with the injector from behind the civilian he gasped as the drug took hold then sagged as if his bones had dissolved steuben picked up the girl hammer vaulted aboard the combat car and took the child from his subordinates arms cutting himself into the loudspeaker system the stocky colonel thundered to the street listen you people if you take guns from mercseither barthes men or my ownwell grind you to dust take em from civilians if you think you can you may have a chance then if you rob mercs you just get a chance to die hammer nodded to the civilians nodded again to the brooding buildings to either side he gave an unheard command to his driver the combat cars began to rev their fans pritchard gave margritte a hand up and followed her michael one to michael first he said head back with alpha first pritchard rode inside the turret after they left haacin glad for once of the armor and the cabin lights in the writhing treelimbs he had seen the dutch mothers face as the shot maimed her daughter margritte passed only one call to her commander it came shortly after the combat cars had separated to return to their base camp near midi the planetary capital the colonels voice was as smooth as it ever got it held no hint of the rage which had blazed out in haacin capt pritchard hammer said ive transferred command of sigma company to the leader of its first platoon the sector of course is in your hands now i expect you to carry out your duties with the ability youve already shown michael one to regiment pritchard replied curtly acknowledged kowie drew up in front of the command post without the furious caracole which had marked their most recent approach pritchard slid his hatch open his crewmen did not move ive got to worry about being sector chief for a while he said but you three can rack out in the barracks now youve put in a full tour in my book think ill sleep here rob said he touched a stud rotating his seat into a couch alongside the receiver and loading tube of the main gun pritchard frowned margritte he asked she shrugged no ill stay by my set for a while her eyes were blue and calm on the intercom kowie chimed in with yeah you worry about the sector well worry about ourselves say dont you think a tank platoond be better for base security than these pongoes shut up kowie jenne snapped the blond burlager glanced at his captain everythingll be fine so long as were here he said from one elbow he patted the breech of the mm gun pritchard shrugged and climbed out into the cold night he heard the hatch grind shut behind him until pritchard walked in the door of the building it had not occurred to him that riis replacement was sally schilling the words first platoon leader had not been a name to the tanker not in the midst of the furor of his mind the little blonde glanced up at pritchard from the map display she was studying she spat cracklingly on the electric stove and faced around again her aide the big corporal blinked in some embarrassment none of the headquarters staff spoke i need the display console from my room pritchard said to the corporal the infantryman nodded and got up before he had taken three steps lt schillings voice cracked like pressureheaved ice cpl webbert sir the big mans face went tight as he found himself a pawn in a game whose stakes went beyond his interest go get the display console for our new commander its in his room licking his lips with relief the corporal obeyed he carried the heavy fourlegged console back without effort sally was making it easier for him pritchard thought but how he wished that riis hadnt made so complete a fool of himself that he had to be removed using riis to set up a double massacre would have been a lot easier to justify when danny awoke in the middle of the night and found himself remembering pritchard positioned the console so that he sat with his back to the heater it separated him from schilling the top of the instrument was a slanted cm screen which glowed when pritchard switched it on sector two display he directed in response to his words the screen sharpened into a relief map population centers he said they flashed on as well several dozen of them ranging from a few hundred souls to the several thousand of haacin and dimo portela the largest francophone settlement west of the aillet was about twenty kilometers west of haacin and there were now french mercenaries on both sides of that division line sally had turned from her own console and stood up to see what pritchard was doing the tanker said all mercenary positions confirmed and calculated the board spangled itself with red and green symbols each of them marked in small letters with a unit designation the reconnaissance satellites gave unit strengths very accurately and computer analysis of radio traffic could generally name the forces in the eastern half of the sector lt col benoit had spread out one battalion in platoonstrength billets the guardposts were close enough to most points to put down trouble immediately a full company near dimo guarded the headquarters and two batteries of rocket howitzers the remaining battalion in the sector benoits own was concentrated in positions blasted into the rocky highlands ten kays west of portela it was not a deployment that would allow the mercs to effectively police the west half of the sector but it was a very good defensive arrangement the forest that covered the center of the sector was ideal for hitandrun sniping by small units of infantry the tree boles were too densely woven for tanks to plow through them because the forest was so flammable at this season however it would be equally dangerous to ambushers benoit was wise to concentrate in the barren highground besides the highlands the fields cleared around every settlement were the only safe locations for a modern firefight the fields and the broad swathes cleared for roads through the forest incoming traffic for sector chief announced a radioman its from the skepsel colonel sir he threw his words into the air afraid to direct them at either of the officers in the orderly room voice only or is there visual pritchard asked schilling held her silence visual component sir patch him through to my console the tanker decided and sonwatch your language otherwise you say beast when you shouldnt the map blurred from the display screen and was replaced by the hawk features of lt col benoit a pickup on the screens surface threw pritchards own image onto benoits similar console the frenchman blinked capt pritchard im very pleased to see you but my words must be with capt riis directly could you wake him thereve been some changes the tanker said in the back of his mind he wondered what had happened to riis pulled back under arrest probably im in charge of sector two now cocharge with you that is benoits face steadied as he absorbed the information without betraying an opinion about it then he beamed like a feasting wolf and said congratulations captain some day you and i will have to discuss theevents of the past few days but what i was calling about is far less pleasant im afraid benoits image wavered on the screen as he paused pritchard touched his tongue to the corner of his mouth go ahead colonel he said ive gotten enough bad news today that a little more wont signify benoit quirked his brow in what might or might not have been humor when we were proceeding to portela he said some of my troops mistook the situation and set up passive tank interdiction points mines all over the sector theyre boobytrapped of course the only safe way to remove them is for the troops responsible to do it they will of course be punished later pritchard chuckled how long do you estimate itll take to clear the roads colonel he asked the frenchman spread his hands palms up weeks perhaps its much harder to clear mines safely than to lay them of course but there wouldnt be anything between here and haacin would there the tanker prodded it was all happening just as hammers informant had said barthe planned it first hem the tanks in with nets of forest and minefields then break the most important dutch stronghold while your mercs were still around to back you up the spur road toour hq here wasnt on your route and besides we just drove tanks over it a few minutes ago behind pritchard sally schilling was cursing in a sharp carrying voice benoit could probably hear her but the colonel kept his voice as smooth as milk as he said actually im afraid there is a fieldgas shaped charges and glassshard antipersonnel minessomewhere on that road yes fortunately the field was signal activated it wasnt primed until after you had passed through i assure you capt pritchard that all the roads west of the aillet may be too dangerous to traverse until i have cleared them i warn you both as a friend and so that we will not be charged with damage to any of your vehiclesand men you have been fully warned of the danger anything that happens now is your responsibility pritchard leaned back in the consoles integral seat chuckling again you know colonel the tank captain said im not sure that the bonding authority wouldnt find those mines were a hostile act justifying our retaliation benoit stiffened more an internal hardness than anything that showed in his muscles pritchard continued to speak through a smile we wont of course mistakes happen but one thing col benoit the frenchman nodded waiting for the edge to bite he knew as well as pritchard did that at best if there were an authority investigation barthe would have to throw a scapegoat out a highranking scapegoat mistakes happen pritchard repeated but they cant be allowed to happen twice youve got my permission to send out a tenman team by daylightonly by daylightto clear the road from portela to bever thatll give you a route back to your side of the sector if any other troops leave their present position for any reason ill treat it as an attack captain this demarcation within the sector was not part of the contract it was at the demand of col barthe pritchard snapped and agreed to by the demonstrable practice of both regiments over the past three months hammer had briefed pritchard very carefully on the words to use here to be recorded for the benefit of the bonding authority youve heard the terms colonel you can either take them or well put the whole thingthe minefields and some other matters thatve come up recentlybefore the authority right now your choice benoit stared at pritchard apparently calm but tugging at his upper lip with thumb and forefinger i think you are unwise captain in taking full responsibility for an area in which your tanks cannot move but that is your affair of course i will obey your mandate we should have the portelahaacin segment cleared by evening tomorrow well proceed to bever good day the screen segued back to the map display pritchard stood up a spare helmet rested beside one of the radiomen the tank captain donned ithe had forgotten to requisition a replacement from storesand said michael one to all michael units he paused for the acknowledgment lights from his four platoons and the command vehicle then hold your present position dont attempt to move by road any road until further notice the roads have been mined there are probably safe areas and well get you a map of them as soon as command central works it up for the time being just stay where you are michael one out are you really going to take that lt schilling demanded in a low harsh voice pass the same orders to your troops sally pritchard said i know they can move through the woods where my tanks cant but i dont want any friendlies in the forest right now either to the intelligence sergeant on watch pritchard added samuels get central to run a plot of all activity by any of benoits men that wont tell us where theyve laid mines but itll let us know where they cant have what happens if the bleeding skepsels ignore you sally blazed youve bloody taught them to ignore you havent you knuckling under every time somebody whispers contract you cant move a tank to stop them if they do leave their base and ive got effectives a battaliond laugh at me laugh schillings arms were akimbo her face as pale with rage as the snow outside speaking with deliberate calm pritchard said ill call in artillery if i need to benoit only brought two calliopes with him and they cant stop all the shells from three firebases at the same time the road between his position and portelas just a snaketrack cut between rocks a couple firecracker rounds going off above infantry strung out therevia itll be a butcher shop schillings eyes brightened then for tonight the sectors just like it was before we came she thought out loud well i suppose you know best she added in false agreement with false nonchalance im going back to the barracks ill brief first platoon in person and radio the others from there come along webbert the corporal slammed the door behind himself and his lieutenant the gust of air that licked about the walls was cold but pritchard was already shivering at what he had just done to a woman he loved it was daylight by now and the frosted windows turned to flame in the ruddy sun speaking to no one but his consoles memory pritchard began to plot tracks from each tank platoon he used a topographic display ignoring the existence of the impenetrable forest which covered the ground margrittes resonant voice twanged in the implant captain would you come to the blower for half a sec on the way pritchard said shrugging into his coat the orderly room staff glanced up at him margritte poked her head out of the side hatch pritchard climbed onto the deck to avoid some of the generator whine the skirts sang even when the fans were cut off completely rob jenne curious but at ease was visible at his battle station beyond the commo tech sir margritte said weve been picking up signals fromthere the blueeyed woman thumbed briefly at the infantry barracks without letting her pupils follow the gesture pritchard nodded lt schillings passing on my orders to her company danny the transmissions in code and its not a code of ours margritte hesitated then touched the back of the officers gloved left hand theres answering signals too i cant triangulate without moving the blower of course but the source is in line with the tailings pile at haacin it was what he had planned after all someone the villagers could trust had to get word of the situation to them otherwise they wouldnt draw the portelans and their mercenary backers into a fatal mistake hard luck for the villagers who were acting as bait but very good for every other dutchman on kobold pritchard had no reason to feel anything but relief that it had happened he tried to relax the muscles which were crushing all the breath out of his lungs margrittes fingers closed over his hand and squeezed it ignore the signals the captain said at last weve known all along they were talking to the civilians havent we neither of his crewmen spoke pritchards eyes closed tightly he said weve known for months hammer and i every damned thing that barthes been plotting with the skepsels they want a chance to break haacin now while theyre around to cover for the portelans well give them their chance and ram it up their ass crosswise the old man hasnt spread the word for fear the storyd get out the same way barthes plans did were all mercenaries after all but i want you three to know and ill be glad when the only thing i have to worry about is the direction the shots are coming from abruptly the captain dropped back to the ground get some sleep he called ill be needing you sharp tonight back at his console pritchard resumed plotting courses and distances after he figured each line he called in a series of map coordinates to command central he knew his radio traffic was being monitored and probably unscrambled by barthes intelligence staff knew also that even if he had read the coordinates out in clear the french would have assumed it was a code the locations made no sense unless one knew they were ground zero for incendiary shells as pritchard worked he kept close watch on the french battalions benoits own troops held their position as pritchard had ordered they used the time to dig in at first they had blasted slit trenches in the rock now they dug covered bunkers with the help of mining machinery tracked from portela by civilians five of the six antitank guns were sited atop the eastern ridge of the position they could rake the highway as it snaked and switched back among the foothills west of portela pritchard chuckled grimly again when sgt samuels handed him highmagnification offprints from the satellites benoits two squat bulky calliopes were sited in defilade behind the humps of the eastern ridge line there the eightbarrelled powerguns were safe from the smashing fire of m companys tanks but their ability to sweep artillery shells from the sky was degraded by the closer horizon the slammers did not bother with calliopes themselves their central fire director did a far better job by working through the hundreds of vehiclemounted weapons how much better benoit might learn very shortly the minesweeping team cleared the portelahaacin road as directed the men returned to benoits encampment an hour before dusk the french did not come within five kilometers of the dutch village pritchard watched the retiring mine sweepers then snapped off the console he stood im going out to my blower he said his crew had been watching for him a hatch shot open spouting condensate as soon as pritchard came out the door the smooth bulk of the tank blew like a restive whale on the horizon the sun was so low that the treetops stood out in silhouette like a line of bayonets wearily the captain dropped through the hatch into his seat jenne and margritte murmured greeting and waited noticeably tense im going to get a couple hours sleep pritchard said he swung his seat out and up so that he lay horizontal in the turret his legs hid margrittes oval face from him punch up coverage of the road west of haacin would you he asked im going to take a tab of glirine slap me with the antidote when something moves there if something moves jenne amended when pritchard sucked down the pill the squareheads think theyve got one last chance to smack portela and hijack the powerguns again thing is the portelansll have already distributed the guns and be waiting for the dutch to come through itll be a damn short fight that one the drug took hold and pritchards consciousness began to flow away like a sugar cube in water damn short at first pritchard felt only the sting on the inside of his wrist then the narcotic haze ripped away and he was fully conscious again there a line of trucks looks like twenty moving west out of haacin sir theyre blacked out but the satellite has em on infrared red alert pritchard ordered he locked his seat upright into its combat position margrittes soft voice sounded the general alarm pritchard slipped on his radio helmet michael one to all michael units check off five green lights flashed their silent acknowledgements across the top of the captains faceshield display michael one to sigma one pritchard continued go ahead michael one sallys voice held a note of triumph sigma one pull all your troops into large clear areasthe fields around the towns are fine but stay the hell away from portela and haacin get ready to slow down anybody coming this way from across the aillet over affirmative danny affirmative sally replied couldnt she use the satellite reconnaissance herself and see the five blurred dots halfway between the villages they were clearly the trucks which had brought the portelans into their ambush positions what would she say when she realized how she had set up the villagers she was trying to protect lambs to the slaughter the vision block showed the dutch trucks more clearly than the camouflaged portelans the crushed stone of the roadway was dark on the screen cooler than the surrounding trees and the vehicles upon it pritchard patted the breech of the main gun and looked across it to his blower chief we got a basic load for this aboard he asked do bears cop in the woods jenne grinned we gonna get a chance to bust caps tonight captain pritchard nodded for three months weve been here doing nothing but selling rope to the french tonight theyve bought enough that we can hang em with it he looked at the vision block again you alive kowie he asked on intercom ready to slide any time you give me a course said the driver from his closed cockpit the vision block sizzled with bright streaks that seemed to hang on the screen though they had passed in microseconds the leading blobs expanded and brightened as trucks blew up michael one to fire central pritchard said go ahead michael one replied the machine voice prepare fire order alpha roger michael one margritte get me benoit go ahead captain slammers to benoit pritchard to benoit come in please colonel capt pritchard michel benoit here the colonels voice was smooth but too hurried to disguise the concern underlying it i assure you that none of my men are involved in the present fighting i have a company ready to go out and control the disturbance immediately however the tanker ignored him the shooting had already stopped for lack of targets colonel ive got some artillery aimed to drop various places in the forest its coming nowhere near your troops or any other human beings if you interfere with this necessary shelling the slammerll treat it as an act of war i speak with my colonels authority captain i dont pritchard switched manually michael one to fire central execute fire order alpha on the way michael one michael one to michael first second fourth command central has fed movement orders into your map displays incendiary clusters are going to burst over marked locations to ignite the forest use your own main guns to set the trees burning in front of your immediate positions one round ought to do it button up and you can move through the firethe trees just fall to pieces when theyve burned the turret whined as it slid under robs control michael third im attaching you to the infantry more frenchmenre apt to be coming this way from the east its up to you to see they dont slam a door on us the main gun fired its discharge so sudden that the air rang like a solid thing seepage from the ejection system filled the hull with the reek of superheated polyurethane the side vision blocks flashed cyan then began to flood with the mounting white helllight of the blazing trees in the central block still set on remote all the dutch trucks were burning as were patches of forest which the ambush had ignited the portelans had left the concealment of the trees and swept across the road mopping up the dutch kowie lets move jenne was saying on intercom syncopated by the mild echo of his voice in the turret margrittes face was calm her lips moving subtly as she handled some traffic that she did not pass on to her captain the tank slid forward like oil on a lake from the far distance came the thumps of incendiary rounds scattering their hundreds of separate fireballs high over the trees pritchard slapped the central vision block back on direct the tanks interior shone white with transmitted fire the plows bow slope sheared into a thicket of blazing trees the wood tangled and sagged then gave in a splash of fiery splinters whipped aloft by the blowers fans the tank was in hell on all sides kowie steering by instinct and his inertial compass even with his screens filtered all the way down the driver would not be able to use his eyes effectively until more of the labyrinth had burned away benoits calliopes had not tried to stop the shelling well there were other ways to get the french mercs to take the first step over the line for instance punch up benoit again pritchard ordered even through the dense iridium plating the roar of the fire was a subaural presence in the tank go ahead margritte said flipping a switch on her console she had somehow been holding the french officer in conversation all the time pritchard was on other frequencies colonel pritchard said weve got clear running through this fire were going to chase down everybody who used a powergun tonight then well shoot them well shoot everybody in their families everybody with them in this ambush and well blow up every house that anybody involved lived in thats likely to be every house in portela isnt it more than the heat and ions of the blazing forest distorted benoits face he shouted are you mad you cant think of such a thing pritchard the tankers lips parted like a wolfs he could think of mass murder and there were plenty of men in the slammers who would really be willing to carry out the threat but pritchard wouldnt have to because benoit was like riis and schilling too much of a nationalist to remember his first duty as a merc col benoit the contract demands wekeep the peace and stay impartial the record shows how we treated people in haacin for having powerguns for what the portelans did tonightdont worry well be impartial and theyll never break the peace again captain i will not allow you to massacre french civilians benoit stated flatly move a man out of your present positions and ill shoot him dead pritchard said its your choice colonel over and out the plow bucked and rolled as it pulverized fireshattered trucks but the vehicle was meeting nothing solid enough to slam it to a halt pritchard used a side block on remote to examine benoits encampment the satellites enhanced infrared showed a stream of sparks flowing from the defensive positions toward the portela road infantry on skimmers the pair of larger more diffuse blobs were probably antitank guns benoit wasnt moving his whole battalion only a reinforced company in a show of force to make pritchard back off the fool nobody was going to back off now michael one to all michael and sigma units pritchard said in a voice as clear as the white flames around his tank were now in a state of war with barthes company and its civilian auxiliaries michael first second and fourth well rendezvous at the ambush site as plotted on your displays anybody between there and portela is fair game if we take any fire from portela we go down the main drag in line and blow the cop out of it if any of barthes people are in the way we keep on sliding west sigma one mount a fluid defense dont push and wait for help its coming if this works its barthe against hammerand thats wheat against the scythe acknowledged as pritchards call board lit green a raspy new voice broke into the sector frequency wish i was with you panzers well cover your butts and the other sectorsif anybodys dumb enough to move good hunting i wish you were here and not me colonel pritchard whispered but that was to himselfand perhaps it was not true even in his heart dannys guts were very cold and his face was as cold as death to pritchards left a lighted display segregated the area of operations it was a computer analog not direct satellite coverage doubtful images were brightened and labeledgreen for the slammers red for barthe blue for civilians unless they were fighting on one side or the other the green dot of the plow converged on the ambush site at the same time as the columns of first and fourth platoons second was a minute or two farther off pritchards breath caught a sheaf of narrow red lines was streaking across the display toward his tanks barthe had ordered his companys artillery to support benoits threatened battalion the salvo frayed and vanished more suddenly than it had appeared other slammers vehicles had ripped the threat from the sky green lines darted from hammers own three firebases offscreen at the analogs present scale the fighting was no longer limited to sector two if pritchard and hammer had played their hand right though it would stay limited to only the slammers and compagnie de barthe the other francophone regiments would fear to join an unexpected battle which certainly resulted from someones contract violation if the breach were hammers the dutch would not be allowed to profit by the fighting if the breach were barthes anybody who joined him was apt to be punished as sternly by the bonding authority so violent was the forests combustion that the flames were already dying down into sparks and black ashes the command tank growled out into the broad avenue of the road west of haacin dutch trucks were still burningfabric lubricants and the very paint of their frames had been ignited by the powerguns many of the bodies sprawled beside the vehicles were smouldering also some corpses still clutched their useless muskets the dead were victims of six centuries of progress which had come to kobold prepackaged just in time to kill them barthe had given the portelans only shoulder weapons but even that meant the world here the powerguns were repeaters with awesome destruction in every bolt without answering fire to rattle them even untrained gunmen could be effective with weapons which shot linestraight and had no recoil certainly the portelans had been effective throwing ash and fire like sharks in the surf the four behemoths of first platoon slewed onto the road from the south almost simultaneously fourth joined through the dying hellstorm to the other side the right of way was fifty meters wide and there was no reason to keep to the center of it the forest ablaze or glowing embers held no ambushes anymore the plow lurched as kowie guided it through the bodies some of them were still moving pritchard wondered if any of the dutch had lived through the night but that was with the back of his mind the slammers were at war and nothing else really mattered triple line ahead he ordered first to the left fourth to the right the plowll take the center alone till second joins second wick up when you hit the hardball and fall in behind us if it moves shoot it at kph the leading tanks caught the portelans three kilometers east of their village the settlers were in the trucks that had been hidden in the forest fringe until the fires had been started the ambushers may not have known they were being pursued until the rearmost truck exploded rob jenne had shredded it with his tribarrel at five kilometers distance the cyan flicker and its answering orange blast signalled the flanking tanks to fire they had just enough parallax to be able to rake the four remaining trucks without being blocked by the one which had blown up a few snapping discharges proved that some portelans survived to use their new powerguns on tougher meat than before hits streaked ashes on the tanks armor no one inside noticed from portelas eastern windows children watched their parents burn a hose of cyan light played from a distant roof top it touched the command tank as kowie slewed to avoid a portelan truck the burst was perfectly aimed an automatic weapon served by professionals professionals should have known how useless it would be against heavy armor a vision block dulled as a few receptors fused jenne cursed and trod the footswitch of the main gun a building leaped into dazzling prominence in the microsecond flash then it and most of the block behind collapsed into internal fires burying the machinegun and everything else in the neighborhood a moment later a salvo of hammers high explosive got through the calliopes inadequate screen the village began to spew skyward in white flashes the portelans had wanted to play soldier pritchard thought he had dammed up all pity for the villagers of haacin he would not spend it now on these folk line aheadfirst fourth and second pritchard ordered the triple column slowed and reformed with the plow the second vehicle in the new line the shelling lifted from portela as the tanks plunged into the village green trails on the analog terminated over the road crowded with benoits men and over the main french position despite anything the calliopes could do the sky over benoits bunkers rippled and flared as firecracker rounds sleeted down their thousands of individual bomblets the defensive fire cut off entirely pritchard could imagine the carnage among the unprotected calliope crews when the shrapnel whirred through them the tanks were firing into the houses on either side using tribarrels and occasional wallops from their main guns the bluegreen flashes were so intense they colored even the flames they lit among the wreckage at kph the thirteen tanks swept through the center of town hindered only by the rubble of houses spilled across the street barthes men were skittering white shadows who burst when powerguns hit them point blank the copper mine was just west of the village and three hundred meters north of the highway as the lead tank bellowed out around the last houses a dozen infantrymen rose from where they had sheltered in the pit head and loosed a salvo of buzzbombs the tanks automatic defense system was live white fire rippled from just above the skirts as the charges there flailed pellets outward to intersect the rockets most of the buzzbombs exploded ten meters distant against the steel hail one missile soared harmlessly over its target its motor a tiny flare against the flickering sky only one of the shaped charges burst alongside the turret forming a bell of light momentarily bigger than the tank even that was only a near miss it gouged the iridium armor like a misthrust rapier which tears skin but does not pierce the skull main guns and tribarrels answered the rockets instantly men dropped some dead some reloading second platoon go put some he down the shaft and rejoin pritchard ordered the lead tank now had expended half its defensive charges michael firstthree fall in behind firstone michael one leads he went on kowie grunted acknowledgement the plow revved up to full honk benoits men were on the road those who had not reached portela when the shooting started or who had fled when the artillery churned the houses to froth the infantry skimmers were trapped between sheer rocks and sheer dropoffs between their own slow speed and the onrushing frontal slope of the plow there were trees where the rocks had given them purchase scattered incendiaries had made them blazing cressets lighting a charnel procession jennes tribarrel scythed through body armor and dismembered men in short bursts one of the antitank gunswas the other buried in portelalay skewed against a rock wall its driver killed by a shell fragment rob put a round from the main gun into it so did each of the next two tanks at the third shot the ammunition ignited in a blinding secondary explosion the antitank guns still emplaced on the ridge line had not fired though they swept several stretches of the road perhaps the crews had been rattled by the shelling perhaps benoit had held his fire for fear of hitting his own men a narrow defile notched the final ridge the plow heaved itself up the rise and at the top three bolts slapped it from different angles because the bow was lifted two of the shots vaporized portions of the skirt and the front fans the tank nosed down and sprayed sparks with half its length the third bolt grazed the left top of the turret making the iridium ring as it expanded the interior of the armor streaked white though it was not pierced the temperature inside the tank rose even as the plow skidded sgt jenne was laying his main gun on the hot spot that was the barrel of the leftmost antitank weapon the plows shot did what heavy top cover had prevented hammers rocket howitzers from accomplishing with shrapnel the antitank gun blew up in a distancemuffled flash one of its crewmen was silhouetted high in the air by the vaporizing metal of his gun then the two remaining weapons ripped the night and the command blower with their charges the bolt that touched the right side of the turret spewed droplets of iridium across the interior of the hull air pistoned pritchards eardrums rob jenne lurched in his harness right arm burned away by the shot his left hand blackened where it touched bare metal that sparked and sang as circuits shorted margrittes radios were exploding one by one under the overloads the vision blocks worked and the turret hummed placidly as pritchard rotated it to the right with his duplicate controls cut the power robs burning margritte was shrieking she had torn off her helmet her thick hair stood out like tendrils of bread mold in the gathering charge then pritchard had the main gun bearing and it lit the ridge line with another secondary explosion danny our ammunition itll benoits remaining gun blew the tribarrel and the cupola away deafeningly the automatics loading tube began to gangfire down into the bowels of the tank it reached a bright tendril up into the sky but the turret still rolled electricity crackled around pritchards boot and the foot trip as he fired again the bolt stabbed the night there was no answering blast pritchard held down the switch his nostrils thick with ozone and superheated plastic and the sizzling flesh of his friend there was still no explosion from the target bunker the rock turned white between the cyan flashes it cracked and flowed away like sunmelted snow and the antitank gun never fired again the loading tube emptied pritchard slapped the main switch and cut off the current the interior light and the dancing arcs died leaving only the dying glow of the boltheated iridium tank after tank edged by the silent command vehicle and roared on toward the ridge benoits demoralized men were already beginning to throw down their weapons and surrender pritchard manually unlatched jennes harness and swung it horizontal the blower chief was breathing but unconscious pritchard switched on a batterypowered handlight he held it steady as margritte began to spray sealant on the burns occasionally she paused to separate clothing from flesh with a stylus it had to be done pritchard whispered by sacrificing haacin he had mousetrapped benoit into starting a war the infantry could not win hammer was now crushing barthes company one on one in an iridium vise frieslands council of state would not have let hammer act had they known his intentions but in the face of a stunning victory they simply could not avoid dictating terms to the french it had to be done but i look at what i did pritchard swung his right hand in a gesture that would have included both the fuming wreck of portela and the raiders from haacin dead on the road beyond he struck the breech of the main gun instead clenching his fist he slammed it again into the metal in selfpunishment margritte cried out and blocked his arm with her own margi pritchard repeated in anguish it isnt something that human beings do to each other but soldiers do and hangmen harry turtledove harry turtledove first came to prominence as a writer of alternate world fantasy with the misplaced legion the

article of my faith it is also the last article of my creed mohandas gandhi the one means that wins the easiest victory over reason terror and force adolf hitler mein kampf the tank rumbled down the rajpath past the ruins of the memorial arch toward the india gate the gateway arch was still standing although it had taken a couple of shell hits in the fighting before new delhi fell the union jack fluttered above it british troops lined both sides of the rajpath watching silently as the tank rolled past them their khaki uniforms were filthy and torn many wore bandages they had the weary pastcaring stares of beaten men though the army of india had fought until flesh and munitions gave out the india gate drew near a military band smartened up for the occasion began to play as the tank went past the bagpipes sounded thin and lost in the hot humid air a single man stood waiting in the shadow of the gate field marshal walther model leaned down into the cupola of the panzer iv no one can match the british at ceremonies of this sort he said to his aide major dieter lasch laughed a bit unkindly theyve had enough practice sir he answered raising his voice to be heard over the flatulent roar of the tanks engine what is that tune the field marshal asked does it have a meaning its called the world turned upside down said lasch who had been involved with his british opposite number in planning the formal surrender lord cornwalliss army musicians played it when he yielded to the americans at yorktown ah the americans model was for a moment so lost in his own thoughts that his monocle threatened to slip from his right eye he screwed it back in the single lens was the only thing he shared with the cliched image of a high german officer he was no lean hawkfaced prussian but his rounded features were unyielding and his stocky body sustained the energy of his will better than the thin dyspeptic frames of so many aristocrats the americans he repeated well that will be the next step wont it but enough one thing at a time the panzer stopped the driver switched off the engine the sudden quiet was startling model leaped nimbly down he had been leaping down from tanks for eight years now since his days as a staff officer for the iv corps in the polish campaign the man in the shadows stepped forward saluted flashbulbs lit his long tired face as german photographers recorded the moment for history the englishman ignored cameras and cameramen alike field marshal model he said politely he might have been about to discuss the weather model admired his sangfroid field marshal auchinleck he replied returning the salute and giving auchinleck a last few seconds to remain his equal then he came back to the matter at hand field marshal have you signed the instrument of surrender of the british army of india to the forces of the reich i have auchinleck replied he reached into the left blouse pocket of his battledress removed a folded sheet of paper before handing it to model though he said i should like to request your permission to make a brief statement at this time of course sir you may say what you like at whatever length you like in victory model could afford to be magnanimous he had even granted marshal zhukov leave to speak in the soviet capitulation at kuibyshev before the marshal was taken out and shot i thank you auchinleck stiffly dipped his head i will say then that i find the terms i have been forced to accept to be cruelly hard on the brave men who have served under my command that is your privilege sir but models round face was no longer kindly and his voice had iron in it as he replied i must remind you however that my treating with you at all under the rules of war is an act of mercy for which berlin may yet reprimand me when britain surrendered in all imperial forces were also ordered to lay down their arms i daresay you did not expect us to come so far but i would be within my rights in reckoning you no more than so many bandits a slow flush darkened auchinlecks cheeks we gave you a bloody good run for bandits so you did model remained polite he did not say he would ten times rather fight straightup battles than deal with the partisans who to this day harassed the germans and their allies in occupied russia have you anything further to add no sir i do not auchinleck gave the german the signed surrender handed him his sidearm model put the pistol in the empty holster he wore for the occasion it did not fit well the holster was made for a walther p not this mankilling brute of a webley and scott that mattered little thoughthe ceremony was almost over auchinleck and model exchanged salutes for the last time the british field marshal stepped away a german lieutenant came up to lead him into captivity major lasch waved his left hand the union jack came down from the flagpole on the india gate the swastika rose to replace it lasch tapped discreetly on the door stuck his head into the field marshals office that indian politician is here for his appointment with you sir oh yes very well dieter send him in model had been dealing with indian politicians even before the british surrender and with hordes of them now that resistance was over he had no more liking for the breed than for russian politicians or even german ones no matter what pious principles they spouted his experience was that they were all out for their own good first the small frail brown man the aide showed in made him wonder the indians emaciated frame and the plain white cotton loincloth that was his only garment contrasted starkly with the victorian splendor of the viceregal palace from which model was administering the reichs new conquest sit down herr gandhi the field marshal urged i thank you very much sir as he took his seat gandhi seemed a child in an adults chair it was much too wide for him and its soft overstuffed cushions hardly sagged under his meager weight but his eyes model saw were not a childs eyes they peered with disconcerting keenness through his wireframed spectacles as he said i have come to enquire when we may expect german troops to depart from our country model leaned forward frowning for a moment he thought he had misunderstood gandhis gujaratiflavored english when he was sure he had not he said do you think perhaps we have come all this way as tourists indeed i do not gandhis voice was sharp with disapproval tourists do not leave so many dead behind them models temper kindled no tourists do not pay such a high price for the journey having come regardless of that cost i assure you we shall stay i am very sorry sir i cannot permit it you cannot again model had to concentrate to keep his monocle from falling out he had heard arrogance from politicians before but this scrawny old devil surpassed belief do you forget i can call my aide and have you shot behind this building you would not be the first i assure you yes i know that gandhi said sadly if you have that fate in mind for me i am an old man i will not run combat had taught model a hard indifference to the prospect of injury or death he saw the older man possessed something of the same sort however he had acquired it a moment later he realized his threat had not only failed to frighten gandhi but had actually amused him disconcerted the field marshal said have you any serious issues to address only the one i named just now we are a nation of more than three hundred million it is no more just for germany to rule us than for the british model shrugged if we are able to we will we have the strength to hold what we have conquered i assure you where there is no right there can be no strength gandhi said we will not permit you to hold us in bondage do you think to threaten me model growled in fact though the indians audacity surprised him most of the locals had fallen over themselves fawning on their new masters here at least was a man out of the ordinary gandhi was still shaking his head although model saw he had still not frightened him a man out of the ordinary indeed thought the field marshal who respected courage when he found it i make no threats sir but i will do what i believe to be right most noble model said but to his annoyance the words came out sincere rather than with the sardonic edge he had intended he had heard such canting phrases before from englishmen from russians yes and from germans as well somehow though this gandhi struck him as one who always meant exactly what he said he rubbed his chin considering how to handle such an intransigent a large green fly came buzzing into the office models air of detachment vanished the moment he heard that malignant whine he sprang from his seat swatted at the fly he missed the insect flew around a while longer then settled on the arm of gandhis chair kill it model told him last week one of those accursed things bit me on the neck and i still have the lump to prove it gandhi brought his hand down but several inches from the fly frightened it took off gandhi rose he was surprisingly nimble for a man nearing eighty he chivvied the fly out of the office ignoring model who watched his performance in openmouthed wonder i hope it will not trouble you again gandhi said returning as calmly as if he had done nothing out of the ordinary i am one of those who practice ahimsa i will do no injury to any living thing model remembered the fall of moscow and the smell of burning bodies filling the chilly autumn air he remembered machine guns knocking down cossack cavalry before they could close and the screams of the wounded horses more heartrending then any womans he knew of other things too things he had not seen for himself and of which he had no desire to learn more herr gandhi he said how do you propose to bend to your will someone who opposes you if you will not use force for the purpose i have never said i will not use force sir gandhis smile invited the field marshal to enjoy with him the distinction he was making i will not use violence if my people refuse to cooperate in any way with yours how can you compel them what choice will you have but to grant us leave to do as we will without the intelligence estimates he had read model would have dismissed the indian as a madman no madman though could have caused the british so much trouble but perhaps the decadent raj simply had not made him afraid model tried again you understand that what you have said is treason against the reich he said harshly gandhi bowed in his seat you may of course do what you will with me my spirit will in any case survive among my people model felt his face heat few men were immune to fear just his luck he thought sourly to have run into one of them i warn you herr gandhi to obey the authority of the officials of the reich or it will be the worse for you i will do what i believe to be right and nothing else if you germans exert yourselves toward the freeing of india joyfully will i work with you if not then i regret we must be foes the field marshal gave him one last chance to see reason were it you and i alone there might be some doubt as to what would happen not much he thought not when gandhi was twentyodd years older and thin enough to break like a stick he fought down the irrelevance went on but where herr gandhi is your wehrmacht of all things he had least expected to amuse the indian again yet gandhis eyes unmistakably twinkled behind the lenses of his spectacles field marshal i have an army too models patience never of the most enduring sort wore thin all at once get out he snapped gandhi stood bowed and departed major lasch stuck his head into the office the field marshals glare drove him out again in a hurry well jawaharlal nehru paced back and forth tall slim and saturnine he towered over gandhi without dominating him dare we use the same policies against the germans that we employed against the english if we wish our land free dare we do otherwise gandhi replied they will not grant our wish of their own volition model struck me as a man not much different from various british leaders whom we have succeeded in vexing in the past he smiled at the memory of what passive resistance had done to officials charged with combating it very well satyagraha it is but nehru was not smiling he had less humor than his older colleague gandhi teased him gently do you fear another spell in prison then both men had spent time behind bars during the war until the british released them in a last vain effort to rally the support of the indian people to the raj you know better nehru refused to be drawn and persisted the rumors that come out of europe frighten me do you tell me you take them seriously gandhi shook his head in surprise and a little reproof each side in any war will always paint its opponents as blackly as it can i hope you are right and that that is all still i confess i would feel more at ease with what we plan to do if you found me one jew officer or other rank in the army now occupying us you would be hardpressed to find any among the forces they defeated the british have little love for jews either yes but i daresay it could be done with the germans they are banned by law the english would never make such a rule and while the laws are vile enough i think of the tales that man wiesenthal told the one who came here the gods know how across russia and persia from poland those i do not believe gandhi said firmly no nation could act in that way and hope to survive where could men be found to carry out such horrors azad hind nehru said quoting the free india motto of the locals who had fought on the german side but gandhi shook his head they are only soldiers doing as soldiers have always done wiesenthals claims are for an entirely different order of bestiality one which could not exist without destroying the fabric of the state that gave it birth i hope very much you are right nehru said walther model slammed the door behind him hard enough to make his aide whose desk faced away from the field marshals office jump in alarm enough of this twaddle for one day model said i need schnapps to get the taste of these indians out of my mouth come along if you care to dieter thank you sir major lasch threw down his pen eagerly got to his feet i sometimes think conquering india was easier than ruling it will be model rolled his eyes i know it was i would ten times rather be planning a new campaign than sitting here bogged down in pettifogging details the sooner berlin sends me people trained in colonial administration the happier i will be the bar might have been taken from an english pub it was dark quiet and paneled in walnut a dart board still hung on the wall but a german sergeant in field gray stood behind the bar and despite the lazily turning ceiling fan the temperature was close to thirtyfive celsius the one might have been possible in occupied london the other not model knocked back his first shot at a gulp he sipped his second more slowly savoring it warmth spread through him warmth that had nothing to do with the heat of the evening he leaned back in his chair steepled his fingers a long day he said yes sir lasch agreed after the effrontery of that gandhi any day would seem a long one ive rarely seen you so angry considering models temper that was no small statement ah yes gandhi models tone was reflective rather than irate lasch looked at him curiously the field marshal said for my money hes worth a dozen of the ordinary sort sir the aide no longer tried to hide his surprise he is an honest man he tells me what he thinks and he will stick by that i may kill himi may have to kill himbut he and i will both know why and i will not change his mind model took another sip of schnapps he hesitated as if unsure whether to go on at last he did do you know dieter after he left i had a vision sir now lasch sounded alarmed the field marshal might have read his aides thoughts he chuckled wryly no no i am not about to swear off eating beefsteak and wear sandals instead of my boots that i promise but i saw myself as a roman procurator listening to the rantings of some early christian priest lasch raised an eyebrow such musings were unlike model who was usually direct to the point of bluntness and altogether materialisticassets in the makeup of a general officer the major cautiously sounded these unexpected depths how do you suppose the roman felt facing that kind of man bloody confused i suspect model said which sounded more like him and because he and his comrades did not know how to handle such fanatics you and i are christians today dieter so we are the major rubbed his chin is that a bad thing model laughed and finished his drink from your point of view or mine no but i doubt that old roman would agree with us any more than gandhi agrees with me over what will happen next here but then i have two advantages over the dead procurator he raised his finger the sergeant hurried over to fill his glass at laschs nod the young man also poured more schnapps for him the major drank then said i should hope so we are more civilized more sophisticated than the romans ever dreamed of being but model was still in that fey mood are we my procurator was such a sophisticate that he tolerated anything and never saw the danger in a foe who would not do the same our christian god though is a jealous god who puts up with no rivals and one who is a national socialist serves also the volk to whom he owes sole loyalty i am immune to gandhis virus in a way the roman was not to the christians yes that makes sense lasch agreed after a moment i had not thought of it in that way but i see it is so and what is our other advantage over the roman procurator suddenly the field marshal looked hard and cold much the way he had looked leading the tanks of third panzer against the kremlin compound the machine gun he said the rising suns rays made the sandstone of the red fort seem even more the color of blood gandhi frowned and turned his back on the fortress not caring for that thought even at dawn the air was warm and muggy i wish you were not here nehru told him the younger man lifted his trademark foreandaft cap scratched his graying hair and glanced at the crowd growing around them the germans orders forbid assemblies and they will hold you responsible for this gathering i am am i not gandhi replied would you have me send my followers into a danger i do not care to face myself how would i presume to lead them afterwards a general does not fight in the front ranks nehru came back if you are lost to our cause will we be able to go on if not then surely the cause is not worthy yes now let us be going nehru threw his hands in the air gandhi nodded satisfied and worked his way toward the head of the crowd men and women stepped aside to let him through still shaking his head nehru followed the crowd slowly began to march east up chandni chauk the street of silversmiths some of the fancy shops had been wrecked in the fighting more looted afterwards but others were opening up their owners as happy to take german money as they had been to serve the british before one of the proprietors a man who had managed to stay plump even through the past year of hardship came rushing out of his shop when he saw the procession go by he ran to the head of the march and spotted nehru whose height and elegant dress singled him out are you out of your mind the silversmith shouted the germans have banned assemblies if they see you something dreadful will happen is it not dreadful that they take away the liberty which properly belongs to us gandhi asked the silversmith spun round his eyes grew wide when he recognized the man who was speaking to him gandhi went on not only is it dreadful it is wrong and so we do not recognize the germans right to ban anything we may choose to do join us will you greatsouled one ii the silversmith spluttered then his glance slid past gandhi the germans he squeaked he turned and ran gandhi led the procession toward the approaching squad the germans stamped down chandni chauk as if they expected the people in front of them to melt from their path their gear gandhi thought was not that much different from what british soldiers wore ankle boots shorts and opennecked tunics but their coalscuttle helmets gave them a look of sullen beetlebrowed ferocity the british tin hat did not convey even for a man of gandhis equanimity it was daunting as no doubt it was intended to be hello my friends he said do any of you speak english i speak it a little one of them replied his shoulder straps had the twin pips of a sergeantmajor he was the squadleader then he hefted his rifle not menacingly gandhi thought but to emphasize what he was saying go to your homes back this coming together is verboten i am sorry but i must refuse to obey your order gandhi said we are walking peacefully on our own street in our own city we will harm no one no matter what this i promise you but walk we will as we wish he repeated himself until he was sure the sergeantmajor understood the german spoke to his comrades in his own language one of the soldiers raised his gun and with a nasty smile pointed it at gandhi he nodded politely the german blinked to see him unafraid the sergeantmajor slapped the rifle down one of his men had a field telephone on his back the sergeantmajor cranked it waited for a reply spoke urgently into it nehru caught gandhis eye his dark tired gaze was full of worry somehow that nettled gandhi more than the germans arrogance in ordering about his people he began to walk forward again the marchers followed him flowing around the german squad like water round a boulder the soldier who had pointed his rifle at gandhi shouted in alarm he brought up the weapon again the sergeantmajor barked at him reluctantly he lowered it a sensible man gandhi said to nehru he sees we do no injury to him or his and so does none to us sadly though not everyone is so sensible the younger man replied as witness his lancecorporal there and even a sensible man may not be wellinclined to us you notice he is still on the telephone the phone on field marshal models desk jangled he jumped and swore he had left orders he was to be disturbed only for an emergency he had to find time to work he picked up the phone this had better be good he growled without preamble he listened swore again slammed the receiver down lasch he shouted it was his aides turn to jump sir dont just sit there on your fat arse the field marshal said unfairly call out my car and driver and quickly then belt on your sidearm and come along the indians are doing something stupid oh yes order out a platoon and have them come after us up on chandni chauk the trouble is lasch called for the car and the troops then hurried after model a riot he asked as he caught up no no model moved his stumpy frame along so fast that the taller lasch had to trot beside him some of gandhis tricks damn him the field marshals mercedes was waiting when he and his aide hurried out of the viceregal palace chandni chauk model snapped as the driver held the door open for him after that he sat in furious silence as the powerful car roared up irwin road round a third of connaught circle and north on chelmsford road past the bombedout railway station until for no reason model could see the streets name changed to qutb road a little later the driver said some kind of disturbance up ahead sir disturbance lasch echoed leaning forward to peer through the windscreen its a whole damned regiments worth of indians coming at us dont they know better than that and what the devil he added his voice rising are so many of our men doing ambling along beside them dont they know theyre supposed to break up this sort of thing in his indignation he did not notice he was repeating himself i suspect they dont model said dryly gandhi i gather can have that effect on people who arent ready for his peculiar brand of stubbornness that however does not include me he tapped the driver on the shoulder pull up about two hundred meters in front of the first rank of them joachim yes sir even before the car had stopped moving model jumped out of it lasch hand on his pistol was close behind protesting what if one of those fanatics has a gun then colonelgeneral weidling assumes command and a lot of indians end up dead model strode toward gandhi as it had at the surrender ceremony indias damp heat smote him even while he was sitting quietly in the car his tunic had stuck to him sweat started streaming down his face the moment he started to move each breath felt as if he were taking in warm soup the air even had a faint smell of soup soup that had gone slightly off in its own way he thought surprised at himself this beastly weather was worse than a russian winter either was plenty to lay a man low by itself but countless exotic diseases flourished in the moisture warmth and filth here the snows at least were clean the field marshal ignored the german troops who were drawing themselves to stiff horrified attention at the sight of his uniform he would deal with them later for the moment gandhi was more important he had stoppedwhich meant the rest of the marchers did tooand was waiting politely for model to approach the german commandant was not impressed he thought gandhi sincere and could not doubt his courage but none of that mattered at all he said harshly you were warned against this sort of behavior gandhi looked him in the eye they were very much of a height and i told you i do not recognize your right to give such orders this is our country not yours and if some of us choose to walk on our streets we will do so from behind gandhi nehrus glance flicked worriedly from one of the antagonists to the other model noticed him only peripherally if he was already afraid he could be handled whenever necessary gandhi was a tougher nut the field marshal waved at the crowd behind the old man you are responsible for all these people if harm comes to them you will be to blame why should harm come to them they are not soldiers they do not attack your men i told that to one of your sergeants and he understood it and refrained from hindering us surely you sir an educated cultured man can see that what i say is selfevident truth model turned his head to speak to his aide in german if we did not have goebbels this would be the one for his job he shuddered to think of the propaganda victory gandhi would win if he got away with flouting german ordinances the whole countryside would be boiling with partisans in a week and he had already managed to hoodwink some germans into letting him do it then gandhi surprised him again ich danke ihnen herr generalfeldmarschall aber das glaube ich kein kompliment zu sein he said in slow but clear german i thank you field marshal but i believe that to be no compliment having to hold his monocle in place helped model keep his face straight take it however you like he said get these people off the street or they and you will face the consequences we will do what you force us to i force you to nothing as for these people who follow each does so of his or her own free will we are free and will show it not by violence but through firmness in truth now model listened with only half an ear he had kept gandhi talking long enough for the platoon he had ordered out to arrive half a dozen sdkfz armored personnel carriers came clanking up the men piled out of them give me a firing line three ranks deep model shouted as the troopers scrambled to obey he waved the halftracks into position behind them all but blocking qutb road the halftracks commanders swiveled the machine guns at the front of the vehicles troop compartments so they bore on the indians gandhi watched these preparations as calmly as if they had nothing to do with him again model had to admire his calm his followers were less able to keep fear from their faces very few though used the pause to slip away gandhis discipline was a long way from the military sort but effective all the same tell them to disperse now and we can still get away without bloodshed the field marshal said we will shed no ones blood sir but we will continue on our pleasant journey moving carefully we will i think be able to get between your large lorries there gandhi turned to wave his people forward once more you insolent rage choked model which was as well for it kept him from cursing gandhi like a fishwife to give him time to master his temper he plucked his monocle from his eye and began polishing the lens with a silk handkerchief he replaced the monocle started to jam the handkerchief back into his trouser pocket then suddenly had a better idea come lasch he said and started toward the waiting german troops about halfway to them he dropped the handkerchief on the ground he spoke in loud simple german so his men and gandhi could both follow if any indians come past this spot i wash my hands of them he might have known gandhi would have a comeback ready that is what pilate said also you will recall sir pilate washed his hands to evade responsibility the field marshal answered steadily he was in control of himself again i accept it i am responsible to my fuhrer and to the oberkommandowehrmacht for maintaining reichs control over india and will do what i see fit to carry out that obligation for the first time since they had come to know each other gandhi looked sad i too sir have my responsibilities he bowed slightly to model lasch chose that moment to whisper in his commanders ear sir what of our men over there had you planned to leave them in the line of fire the field marshal frowned he had planned to do just that the wretches deserved no better for being taken in by gandhi but lasch had a point the platoon might balk at shooting countrymen if it came to that you men model said sourly jabbing his marshals baton at them fall in behind the armored personnel carriers at once the germans boots pounded on the macadam as they dashed to obey they were still all right then with a clear order in front of them something model thought but not much he had also worried that the indians would take advantage of the moment of confusion to press forward but they did not gandhi and nehru and a couple of other men were arguing among themselves model nodded once some of them knew he was in earnest then and gandhis followers discipline as the field marshal had thought a few minutes ago was not of the military sort he could not simply issue an order and know his will would be done i issue no orders gandhi said let each man follow his conscience as he willwhat else is freedom they will follow you if you go forward greatsouled one nehru replied and that german i fear means to carry out his threat will you throw your life away and those of your countrymen i will not throw my life away gandhi said but before the men around him could relax he went on i will gladly give it if freedom requires that i am but one man if i fall others will surely carry on perhaps the memory of me will serve to make them more steadfast he stepped forward oh damnation nehru said softly and followed for all his vigor gandhi was far from young nehru did not need to nod to the marchers close by him of their own accord they hurried ahead of the man who had led them for so long forming with their bodies a barrier between him and the german guns he tried to go faster stop leave me my place what are you doing he cried though in his heart he understood only too well this once they will not listen to you nehru said but they must gandhi peered through eyes dimmed now by tears as well as age where is that stupid handkerchief we must be almost to it for the last time i warn you to halt model shouted the indians still came on the sound of their feet sandalclad or bare was like a growing murmur on the pavement very different from the clatter of german boots fools the field marshal muttered under his breath he turned to his men take your aim the advance slowed when the rifles came up of that model was certain for a moment he thought that ultimate threat would be enough to bring the marchers to their senses but then they advanced again the polish cavalry had shown that same reckless bravery charging with lances and sabers and carbines against the german tanks model wondered whether the inhabitants of the reichsgeneralgouvernement of poland thought the gallantry worthwhile a man stepped on the field marshals handkerchief fire model said a second passed two nothing happened model scowled at his men gandhis deviltry had got into them sneaky as a jew he was turning the appearance of weakness into a strange kind of strength but then trained discipline paid its dividend one finger tightened on a mauser trigger a single shot rang out as if it were a signal that recalled the other men to their duty they too began to fire from the armored personnel carriers the machine guns started their deadly chatter model heard screams above the gunfire the volley smashed into the front ranks of marchers at close range men fell others ran or tried to only to be held by the power of the stream still advancing behind them once begun the germans methodically poured fire into the column of indians the march dissolved into a panicstricken mob gandhi still tried to press forward a fleeing wounded man smashed into him splashing him with blood and knocking him to the ground nehru and another man immediately lay down on top of him let me up let me up he shouted no nehru screamed in his ear with shooting like this you are in the safest spot you can be we need you and need you alive now we have martyrs around whom to rally our cause now we have dead husbands and wives fathers and mothers who will tend to their loved ones gandhi had no time for more protest nehru and the other man hauled him to his feet and dragged him away soon they were among their people all running now from the german guns a bullet struck the back of the unknown man who was helping gandhi escape gandhi heard the slap of the impact felt the man jerk then the strong grip on him loosened as the man fell he tried to tear free from nehru before he could another indian laid hold of him even at that horrid moment he felt the irony of his predicament all his life he had championed individual liberty and here his own followers were robbing him of his in other circumstances it might have been funny in here nehru shouted several people had already broken down the door to a shop and gandhi saw a moment later the rear exit as well then he was hustled into the alley behind the shop and through a maze of lanes which reminded him that old delhi unlike its britishdesigned sister city was an indian town through and through at last the nameless man with gandhi and nehru knocked on the back door of a tearoom the woman who opened it gasped to recognize her unexpected guests then pressed her hands together in front of her and stepped aside to let them in you will be safe here the man said at least for a while now i must see to my own family from the bottom of our hearts we thank you nehru replied as the fellow hurried away gandhi said nothing he was winded battered and filled with anguish at the failure of the march and at the suffering it had brought to so many marchers and to their kinsfolk the woman sat the two fugitive leaders at a small table in the kitchen served them tea and cakes i will leave you now best ones she said quietly lest those out front wonder why i neglect them for so long gandhi left the cake on his plate he sipped the tea its warmth began to restore him physically but the wound in his spirit would never heal the amritsar massacre pales beside this he said setting down the empty cup there the british panicked and opened fire this had nothing of panic about it model told me what he would do and he did it he shook his head still hardly believing what he had just been through so he did nehru had gobbled his cake like a starving wolf and ate his companions when he saw gandhi did not want it his onceimmaculate white jacket and pants were torn filthy and bloodspattered his cap sat awry on his head but his eyes usually so somber were lit with a fierce glow and by his brutality he has delivered himself into our hands no one now can imagine the germans have anything but their own interests at heart we will gain followers all over the country after this not a wheel will turn in india yes i will declare the satyagraha campaign gandhi said noncooperation will show how we reject foreign rule and will cost the germans dear because they will not be able to exploit us the combination of nonviolence and determined spirit will surely shame them into granting us our liberty thereyou see encouraged by his mentors rally nehru rose and came round the table to embrace the older man we will triumph yet so we will gandhi said and sighed heavily he had pursued indias freedom for half his long life and this change of masters was a setback he had not truly planned for even after england and russia fell the british were finally beginning to listen to him when the germans swept them aside now he had to begin anew he sighed again it will cost our poor people dear though cease firing model said few good targets were left on qutb road almost all the indians in the procession were down or had run from the guns even after the bullets stopped the street was far from silent most of the people the german platoon had shot were alive and shrieking as if he needed more proofthe russian campaign had taught the field marshal how hard human beings were to kill outright still the din distressed him and evidently lasch as well we ought to put them out of their misery the major said so we should model had a happy inspiration and i know just how come with me the two men turned their backs on the carnage and walked around the row of armored personnel carriers as they passed the lieutenant commanding the platoon model nodded to him and said well done the lieutenant saluted thank you sir the soldiers in earshot nodded at one another nothing bucked up the odds of getting promoted like performing under the commanders eye the germans behind the armored vehicles were not so proud of themselves they were the ones who had let the march get this big and come this far in the first place model slapped his boot with his field marshals baton you all deserve courtsmartial he said coldly glaring at them you know the orders concerning native assemblies yet there you were tagging along more like sheepdogs than soldiers he spat in disgust but sir began one of them a sergeantmajor model saw he subsided in a hurry when models gaze swung his way speak the field marshal urged enlighten metell me what possessed you to act in the disgraceful way you did was it some evil spirit perhaps this country abounds with them if you listen to the nativesas you all too obviously have been the sergeantmajor flushed under models sarcasm but finally burst out sir it didnt look to me as if they were up to any harm thats all the old man heading them up swore they were peaceful and he looked too feeble to be anything but if you take my meaning models smile had all the warmth of a moscow december night and so in your wisdom you set aside the commands you had received the results of that wisdom you hear now the field marshal briefly let himself listen to the cries of the wounded a sound the war had taught him to screen out now then come with meyes you sergeantmajor and the rest of your shirkers too or those of you who wish to avoid a court as he had known they would they all trooped after him there is your handiwork he said pointing to the shambles in the street his voice hardened you are responsible for those people lying therehad you acted as you should you would have broken up that march long before it ever got so far or so large now the least you can do is give those people their release he set hands on hips waited no one moved sir the sergeantmajor said faintly he seemed to have become the groups spokesman model made an impatient gesture go on finish them a bullet in the back of the head will quiet them once and for all in cold blood sir the sergeantmajor had not wanted to understand him before now he had no choice the field marshal was inexorable theyand youdisobeyed reich commands they made themselves liable to capital punishment the moment they gathered you at least have the chance to atone by carrying out this just sentence i dont think i can the sergeantmajor muttered he was probably just talking to himself but model gave him no chance to change his mind he turned to the lieutenant of the platoon that had broken the march place this man under arrest after the sergeantmajor had been seized model turned his chill monocled stare on the rest of the reluctant soldiers any others two more men let themselves be arrested rather than draw their weapons the field marshal nodded to the others carry out your orders he had an afterthought if you find gandhi or nehru out there bring them to me alive the germans moved out hesitantly they were no einsatzkommandos and not used to this kind of work some looked away as they administered the first coup de grace one missed as a result and had his bullet ricochet off the pavement and almost hit a comrade but as the soldiers worked their way up qutb road they became quicker more confident and more competent war was like that model thought so soon one became used to what had been unimaginable after a while the flat cracks died away but from lack of targets rather than reluctance a few at a time the soldiers returned to model no sign of the two leaders he asked they all shook their heads very welldismissed and obey your orders like good germans henceforward no further reprisals lasch asked as the relieved troopers hurried away no let them go they carried out their part of the bargain and i will meet mine i am a fair man after all dieter very well sir gandhi listened with undisguised dismay as the shopkeeper babbled out his tale of horror this is madness he cried i doubt field marshal model for his part understands the principle of ahimsa nehru put in neither gandhi nor he knew exactly where they were a safe house somewhere not far from the center of delhi was the best guess he could make the men who brought the shopkeeper were masked what one did not know one could not tell the germans if captured neither do you the older man replied which was true nehru had a more pragmatic nature than gandhi gandhi went on rather more to the point neither do the british and model to speak to seemed no different from any highranking british military man his specialty has made him harsh and rigid but he is not stupid and does not appear unusually cruel just a simple soldier doing his job nehrus irony was palpable he must have gone insane gandhi said it was the only explanation that made even the slightest sense of the massacre of the wounded undoubtedly he will be censured when news of this atrocity reaches berlin as general dyer was by the british after amritsar such is to be hoped but again nehru did not sound hopeful how could it be otherwise after such an appalling action what government what leaders could fail to be filled with humiliation and remorse at it model strode into the mess the officers stood and raised their glasses in salute sit sit the field marshal growled using gruffness to hide his pleasure an indian servant brought him a fair imitation of roast beef and yorkshire pudding better than they were eating in london these days he thought the servant was silent and unsmiling but model would only have noticed more about him had he been otherwise servants were supposed to assume a cloak of invisibility when the meal was done model took out his cigar case the waffenss officer on his left produced a lighter model leaned forward puffed a cigar into life my thanks brigadefuhrer the field marshal said he had little use for ss titles of rank but brigade commander was at least recognizably close to brigadier sir it is my great pleasure jurgen stroop declared you could not have handled things better a lesson for the indiansless than they deserve too he also took no notice of the servant and a good one for your men as well we train ours harshly too model nodded he knew about ss training methods no one denied the daring of the waffenss divisions no one except the ss denied that the wehrmacht had better officers stroop drank a lesson he repeated in a pedantic tone that went oddly with the sss reputation for aggressiveness force is the only thing the racially inferior can understand why when i was in warsaw that had been four or five years ago model suddenly recalled stroop had been a brigadefuhrer then too if memory served no wonder he was still one now even after all the hard fighting since he was lucky not to be a buck private imagine letting a pack of desperate starving jews chew up the finest troops in the world and imagine afterwards submitting a seventyfivepage operations report bound in leather and grandiosely called the warsaw ghetto is no more and imagine with all that having the crust to boast about it afterwards no wonder the man sounded like a pompous ass he was a pompous ass and an inept butcher to boot model had done enough butchery before todays workanyone who fought in russia learned all about butcherybut he had never botched it he did not revel in it either he wished stroop would shut up he thought about telling the brigadefuhrer he would sooner have been listening to gandhi the look on the fellows face he thought would be worth it but no one could never be sure who was listening better safe the shortwave set crackled to life it was in a secret cellar a tiny dark hot room lit only by the glow of its dial and by the red end of the cigarette in its owners mouth the germans had made not turning in a radio a capital crime of course gandhi thought harboring him was also a capital crime that weighed on his conscience but the man knew the risk he was taking the fellow gandhi knew him only as lal fiddled with the controls usually we listen to the americans he said there is some hope of truth from them but tonight you want to hear berlin yes gandhi said i must learn what action is to be taken against model if any nehru added he was once again impeccably attired in white which made him the most easily visible object in the cellar we have argued this before gandhi said tiredly no government can uphold the author of a coldblooded slaughter of wounded men and women the world would cry out in abhorrence lal said that government controls too much of the world already he adjusted the tuning knob again after a burst of static the strains of a strauss waltz filled the little room lal grunted in satisfaction we are a little early yet after a few minutes the incongruously sweet music died away this is radio berlins englishlanguage channel an announcer declared in a moment the news programme another german tune rang out the horst wessel song gandhis nostrils flared with distaste a new voice came over the air good day this is william joyce the nasal oxonian accent was that of the archetypical british aristocrat now vanished from india as well as england it was the accent that flavored gandhis own english and nehrus as well in fact gandhi had heard joyce was a new yorkborn rabblerouser of irish blood who also happened to be a passionately sincere nazi the combination struck the indian as distressing what did the english used to call him nehru murmured lord hawhaw gandhi waved his friend to silence joyce was reading the news or what the propaganda ministry in berlin wanted to present to englishspeakers as the news most of it was on the dull side a trade agreement between manchukuo japanesedominated china and japanesedominated siberia advances by germansupported french troops against americansupported french troops in a war by proxy in the african jungles slightly more interesting was the german warning about american interference in the east asia coprosperity sphere one day soon gandhi thought sadly the two mighty powers of the old world would turn on the one great nation that stood between them he feared the outcome thinking herself secure behind ocean barriers the united states had stayed out of the european war now the war was bigger than europe and the oceans barriers no longer but highways for her foes lord hawhaw droned on and on he gloated over the fate of rebels hunted down in scotland they were publicly hanged nehru leaned forward now he guessed gandhi nodded but the commentator passed on to unlikelysounding boasts about the prosperity of europe under the new order against his will gandhi felt anger rise in him were indians too insignificant to the reich even to be mentioned more music came from the radio the first bars of the other german anthem deutschland uber alles william joyce said solemnly and now a special announcement from the ministry for administration of acquired territories reichsminister reinhard heydrich commends field marshal walther models heroic suppression of insurrection in india and warns that his leniency will not be repeated leniency nehru and gandhi burst out together the latter making it into as much of a curse as he allowed himself as if explaining to them the voice on the radio went on henceforward hostages will be taken at the slightest sound of disorder and will be executed forthwith if it continues field marshal model has also placed a reward of fifty thousand rupees on the capture of the criminal revolutionary gandhi and twentyfive thousand on the capture of his henchman nehru deutschland uber alles rang out again to signal the end of the announcement joyce went on to the next piece of news turn that off nehru said after a moment lal obeyed plunging the cellar into complete darkness nehru surprised gandhi by laughing i have never before been the henchman of a criminal revolutionary the older man might as well not have heard him they commended him he said commended disbelief put the full tally of his years in his voice which usually sounded much stronger and younger what will you do lal asked quietly a match flared dazzling in the dark as he lit another cigarette they shall not govern india in this fashion gandhi snapped not a soul will cooperate with them from now on we outnumber them a thousand to one what can they accomplish without us we shall use that to full advantage i hope the price is not more than the people can pay nehru said the british shot us down too and we were on our way toward prevailing gandhi said stoutly as he would not have a few days before though he added so do i field marshal model scowled and yawned at the same time the pot of tea that should have been on his desk was nowhere to be found his stomach growled a plate of rolls should have been beside the teapot how am i supposed to get anything done without breakfast he asked rhetorically no one was in the office to hear him complain rhetorical complaint was not enough to satisfy him lasch he shouted sir the aide came rushing in model jerked his chin at the empty space on his desk where the silver tray full of good things should have been whats become of whatshisname naoroji thats it if hes home with a hangover he could have had the courtesy to let us know i will enquire with the liaison officer for native personnel sir and also have the kitchen staff send you up something to eat lasch picked up a telephone spoke into it the longer he talked the less happy he looked when he turned back to the field marshal his expression was a good match for the stony one model often wore he said none of the locals has shown up for work today sir what none models frown made his monocle dig into his cheek he hesitated i will feel better if you tell me some new hideous malady has broken out among them lasch spoke with the liaison officer again he shook his head nothing like that sir or at least he corrected himself with the caution that made him a good aide nothing captain wechsler knows about models phone rang again it startled him he jumped bitte he growled into the mouthpiece embarrassed at starting even though only lasch had seen he listened then he growled again in good earnest this time he slammed the phone down that was our railway officer hardly any natives are coming in to the station the phone rang again bitte this time it was a swear word model snarled cutting off whatever the man on the other end was saying and hung up the damned clerks are staying out too he shouted at lasch as if it were the majors fault i know whats wrong with the blasted locals by godan overdose of gandhi thats what we should have shot him down in that riot he led lasch said angrily not for lack of effort that we didnt model said now that he saw where his trouble was coming from he began thinking like a general stafftrained officer again that discipline went deep in him his voice was cool and musing as he corrected his aide it was no riot dieter that man is a skilled agitator armed with no more than words he gave the british fits remember that the fuhrer started out as an agitator too ah but the fuhrer wasnt above breaking heads to back up what he said lasch smiled reminiscently and raised a fist he was a munich man and wore on his sleeve the hashmark that showed party membership before but the field marshal said you think gandhi doesnt his way is to break them from the inside out to make his foes doubt themselves those soldiers who took courts rather than obey their commanding officer had their heads broken wouldnt you say think of him as a russian tank commander say rather than as a political agitator he is fighting us every bit as much as much as the russians did lasch thought about it plainly he did not like it a cowards way of fighting the weak cannot use the weapons of the strong model shrugged he does what he can and skillfully but i can make his backers doubt themselves too see if i dont sir well start with the railway workers they are the most essential to have back on the job yes get a list of names cross off every twentieth one send a squad to each of those homes haul the slackers out and shoot them in the street if the survivors dont report tomorrow do it again keep at it every day until they go back to work or no workers are left yes sir lasch hesitated at last he asked are you sure sir have you a better idea dieter we have a dozen divisions here gandhi has the whole subcontinent i have to convince them in a hurry that obeying me is a better idea than obeying him obeying is what counts i dont care a pfennig as to whether they love me oderint dum metuant sir the major had no latin let them hate so long as they fear ah lasch said yes i like that he fingered his chin as he thought in aid of which the muslims hereabouts like the hindus none too well i daresay we could use them to help hunt gandhi down now that i like model said most of our indian legion lads are muslims they will know people or know people who know people andthe field marshal chuckled cynicallythe reward will do no harm either now get those orders out and ring up legioncolonel sadar well get those feelers in motionand if they pay off youll probably have earned yourself a new pip on your shoulderboards thank you very much sir my pleasure as i say youll have earned it so long as things go as they should i am a very easy man to get along with even gandhi could if he wanted to he will end up having caused a lot of people to be killed because he does not yes sir lasch agreed if only he would see that since we have won india from the british we will not turn around and tamely yield it to those who could not claim it for themselves youre turning into a political philosopher now dieter ha not likely but the major looked pleased as he picked up the phone my dear friend my ally my teacher we are losing nehru said as the messenger scuttled away from this latest in a series of what were hopefully called safe houses day by day more people return to their jobs gandhi shook his head slowly as if the motion caused him physical pain but they must not each one who cooperates with the germans sets back the day of his own freedom each one who fails to ends up dead nehru said dryly most men lack your courage greatsouled one to them that carries more weight than the other some are willing to resist but would rather take up arms than the restraint of satyagraha if they take up arms they will be defeated the british could not beat the germans with guns and tanks and planes how shall we besides if we shoot a german here and there we give them the excuse they need to strike at us when one of their lieutenants was waylaid last month their bombers leveled a village in reprisal against those who fight through nonviolence they have no such justification they do not seem to need one either nehru pointed out before gandhi could reply to that a man burst into the hovel where they were hiding you must flee he cried the germans have found this place they are coming out with me quick i have a cart waiting nehru snatched up the canvas bag in which he carried his few belongings for a man used to being something of a dandy the haggard life of a fugitive came hard gandhi had never wanted much now that he had nothing that did not disturb him he rose calmly followed the man who had come to warn them hurry the fellow shouted as they scrambled into his oxcart while the humpbacked cattle watched indifferently with their liquid brown eyes when gandhi and nehru were lying in the cart the man piled blankets and straw mats over them he scrambled up to take the reins saying inshallah we shall be safely away from here before the platoon arrives he flicked a switch over the backs of the cattle they lowed indignantly the cart rattled away lying in the sweltering semidarkness under the concealment the man had draped on him gandhi peered through chinks trying to figure out where in delhi he was going next he had played the game more than once these last few weeks though he knew doctrine said he should not the less he knew the less he could reveal unlike most men though he was confident he could not be made to talk against his will we are using the technique the american poe called the purloined letter i see he remarked to nehru we will be close by the german barracks they will not think to look for us there the younger man frowned i did not know we had safe houses there he said then he relaxed as well as he could when folded into too small a space of course i do not pretend to know everything there is to know about such matters it would be dangerous if i did i was thinking much the same myself though with me as subject of the sentence gandhi laughed quietly try as we will we always have ourselves at the center of things dont we he had to raise his voice to finish an armored personnel carrier came rumbling and rattling toward them getting louder as it approached the silence when the driver suddenly killed the engine was a startling contrast to the previous racket then there was noise again as soldiers shouted in german what are they saying nehru asked hush gandhi said absently not from ill manners but out of the concentration he needed to follow german at all after a moment he resumed they are swearing at a blackbearded man asking why he flagged them down why would anyone flag down german sol nehru began then stopped in abrupt dismay the fellow who had burst into their hidingplace wore a bushy black beard we had better get out of again nehru broke off in midsentence this time because the oxcart driver was throwing off the coverings that concealed his two passengers nehru started to get to his feet so he could try to scramble out and run too latea rifle barrel that looked wide as a tunnel was shoved in his face as a german came dashing up to the cart the big curved magazine said the gun was one of the automatic assault rifles that had wreaked such havoc among the british infantry a burst would turn a man into bloody hash nehru sank back in despair gandhi less spry than his friend had only sat up in the bottom of the cart good day gentlemen he said to the germans peering down at him his tone took no notice of their weapons down the word was in such gutturally accented hindi that gandhi hardly understood it but the accompanying gesture with a rifle was unmistakable face a mask of misery nehru got out of the cart a german helped gandhi descend danke he said the soldier nodded gruffly he pointed the barrel of his rifletoward the armored personnel carrier my rupees the blackbearded man shouted nehru turned on him so quickly he almost got shot for it your thirty pieces of silver you mean he cried ah a british education gandhi murmured no one was listening to him my rupees the man repeated he did not understand nehru so often gandhi thought sadly that was at the root of everything youll get them promised the sergeant leading the german squad gandhi wondered if he was telling the truth probably so he decided the british had had centuries to build a network of indian clients here but a matter of months the germans would need all they could find in the soldier with a few words of hindi nodded to the back of the armored personnel carrier up close the vehicle took on a warbattered individuality its kind had lacked when they were just big intimidating shapes rumbling down the highway it was bulletscarred and patched in a couple of places with sheets of steel crudely welded on inside the jagged lips of the bullet holes had been hammered down so they did not gouge a mans back the carrier smelled of leather sweat tobacco smokeless powder and exhaust fumes it was crowded all the more so with the two indians added to its usual contingent the motors roar when it started up challenged even gandhis equanimity not he thought with uncharacteristic bitterness that that equanimity had done him much good they are here sir lasch told model then as the field marshals blank look amplified gandhi and nehru models eyebrow came down toward his monocle i wont bother with nehru now that we have him take him out and give him a noodlearmy slang for a bullet in the back of the neckbut dont waste my time over him gandhi now is interesting fetch him in yes sir the major sighed model smiled lasch did not find gandhi interesting lasch would never carry a field marshals baton not if he lived to be ninety model waved away the soldiers who escorted gandhi into his office either of them could have broken the little indian like a stick have a care gandhi said if i am the desperate criminal bandit you have styled me i may overpower you and escape if you do you will have earned it model retorted sit if you care to thank you gandhi sat they took jawaharlal away why have you summoned me instead to talk for a while before you join him model saw that gandhi knew what he meant and that the old man remained unafraid not that that would change anything model thought although he respected his opponents courage the more for his keeping it in the last extremity i will talk in the hope of persuading you to have mercy on my people for myself i ask nothing model shrugged i was as merciful as the circumstances of war allowed until you began your campaign against us since then i have done what i needed to restore order when it returns i may be milder again you seem a decent man gandhi said puzzlement in his voice how can you so callously massacre people who have done you no harm i never would have had you not urged them to folly seeking freedom is not folly it is when you cannot gain itand you cannot already your people are losing their stomach forwhat do you call it passive resistance a silly notion a passive resister simply ends up dead with no chance to hit back at his foe that hit a nerve model thought gandhis voice was less detached as he answered satyagraha strikes the oppressors soul not his body you must be without honor or conscience to fail to feel your victims anguish nettled in turn the field marshal snapped i have honor i follow the oath of obedience i swore with the army to the fuhrer and through him to the reich i need consider nothing past that now gandhis calm was gone but he is a madman what has he done to the jews of europe removed them model said matteroffactly einsatzgruppe b had followed army group central to moscow and beyond they were capitalists or bolsheviks and either way enemies of the reich when an enemy falls into a mans hands what else is there to do but destroy him lest he revive to turn the tables one day gandhi had buried his face in his hands without looking at model he said make him a friend even the british knew better than that or they would not have held india as long as they did the field marshal snorted they must have begun to forget though or your movement would have got what it deserves long ago you first made the mistake of confusing us with them long ago by the way he touched a fat dossier on his desk when was that gandhi asked indifferently the man was beaten now model thought with a touch of pride he had succeeded where a generation of degenerate decadent englishmen had failed of course the field marshal told himself he had beaten the british too he opened the dossier riffled through it here we are he said nodding in satisfaction it was after kristallnacht eh in when you urged the german jews to play at the same game of passive resistance you were using here had they been fools enough to try it we would have thanked you you know it would have let us bag the enemies of the reich all the more easily yes i made a mistake gandhi said now he was looking at the field marshal looking at him with such fierceness that for a moment model thought he would attack him despite advanced age and effete philosophy but gandhi only continued sorrowfully i made the mistake of thinking i faced a regime ruled by conscience one that could at the very least be shamed into doing that which is right model refused to be baited we do what is right for our volk for our reich we are meant to rule and rule we doas you see the field marshal tapped the dossier again you could be sentenced to death for this earlier meddling in the affairs of the fatherland you know even without these later acts of insane defiance you have caused history will judge us gandhi warned as the field marshal rose to have him taken away model smiled then winners write history he watched the two strapping german guards lead the old man off a very good mornings work the field marshal told lasch when gandhi was gone whats on the menu for lunch blood sausage and sauerkraut i believe ah good something to look forward to model sat down he went back to work cordwainer smith cordwainer smith is the pseudonym under which paul myron anthony linebarger wrote science fiction between and his death in all but a handful of smiths thirtytwo published stories and the novel norstrilia are part of his visionary instrumentality of mankind series which he began writing when he was a teenager but did not see professional publication until the appearance of scanners live in vain the instrumentality stories provide a fragmentary history spanning some fifteen thousand years of human history and galactic colonization and have been widely praised for their imaginative depictions of alien civilizations and sympathetic renderings of individuals adjusting to the rigors of a civilization in which interstellar war immortality fasterthanlight space travel suspended animation and telepathic combat are the norm smiths science fiction works have been collected in the definitive the rediscovery of man the complete short science fiction of cordwainer smith and norstrilia smith also wrote several pseudonymous mainstream novels and a spy thriller atomsk as well as a psychology text psychological warfare the table pinlighting is a hell of a way to earn a living underhill was furious as he closed the door behind himself it didnt make much sense to wear a uniform and look like a soldier if people didnt appreciate what you did he sat down in his chair laid his head back in the headrest and pulled the helmet down over his forehead as he waited for the pinset to warm up he remembered the girl in the outer corridor she had looked at it then looked at him scornfully meow that was all she had said yet it had cut him like a knife what did she think he wasa fool a loafer a uniformed nonentity didnt she know that for every halfhour of pinlighting he got a minimum of two months recuperation in the hospital by now the set was warm he felt the squares of space around him sensed himself at the middle of an immense grid a cubic grid full of nothing out in that nothingness he could sense the hollow aching horror of space itself and could feel the terrible anxiety which his mind encountered whenever it met the faintest trace of inert dust as he relaxed the comforting solidity of the sun the clockwork of the familiar planets and the moon rang in on him our own solar system was as charming and as simple as an ancient cuckoo clock filled with familiar ticking and with reassuring noises the odd little moons of mars swung around their planet like frantic mice yet their regularity was itself an assurance that all was well far above the plane of the ecliptic he could feel half a ton of dust more or less drifting outside the lanes of human travel here there was nothing to fight nothing to challenge the mind to tear the living soul out of a body with its roots dripping in effluvium as tangible as blood nothing ever moved in on the solar system he could wear the pinset forever and be nothing more than a sort of telepathic astronomer a man who could feel the hot warm protection of the sun throbbing and burning against his living mind woodley came in same old ticking world said underhill nothing to report no wonder they didnt develop the pinset until they began to planoform down here with the hot sun around us it feels so good and so quiet you can feel everything spinning and turning its nice and sharp and compact its sort of like sitting around home woodley grunted he was not much given to flights of fantasy undeterred underhill went on it must have been pretty good to have been an ancient man i wonder why they burned up their world with war they didnt have to planoform they didnt have to go out to earn their livings among the stars they didnt have to dodge the rats or play the game they couldnt have invented pinlighting because they didnt have any need of it did they woodley woodley grunted uhhuh woodley was twentysix years old and due to retire in one more year he already had a farm picked out he had gotten through ten years of hard work pinlighting with the best of them he had kept his sanity by not thinking very much about his job meeting the strains of the task whenever he had to meet them and thinking nothing more about his duties until the next emergency arose woodley never made a point of getting popular among the partners none of the partners liked him very much some of them even resented him he was suspected of thinking ugly thoughts of the partners on occasion but since none of the partners ever thought a complaint in articulate form the other pinlighters and the chiefs of the instrumentality left him alone underhill was still full of the wonder of their job happily he babbled on what does happen to us when we planoform do you think its sort of like dying did you ever see anybody who had his soul pulled out pulling souls is just a way of talking about it said woodley after all these years nobody knows whether we have souls or not but i saw one once i saw what dogwood looked like when he came apart there was something funny it looked wet and sort of sticky as if it were bleeding and it went out of himand you know what they did to dogwood they took him away up in that part of the hospital where you and i never goway up at the top part where the others are where the others always have to go if they are alive after the rats of the upandout have gotten them woodley sat down and lit an ancient pipe he was burning something called tobacco in it it was a dirty sort of habit but it made him look very dashing and adventurous look here youngster you dont have to worry about that stuff pinlighting is getting better all the time the partners are getting better ive seen them pinlight two rats fortysix million miles apart in one and a half milliseconds as long as people had to try to work the pinsets themselves there was always the chance that with a minimum of four hundred milliseconds for the human mind to set a pinlight we wouldnt light the rats up fast enough to protect our planoforming ships the partners have changed all that once they get going theyre faster than rats and they always will be i know its not easy letting a partner share your mind its not easy for them either said underhill dont worry about them theyre not human let them take care of themselves ive seen more pinlighters go crazy from monkeying around with partners than i have ever seen caught by the rats how many do you actually know of them that got grabbed by rats underhill looked down at his fingers which shone green and purple in the vivid light thrown by the tunedin pinset and counted ships the thumb for the andromeda lost with crew and passengers the index finger and the middle finger for release ships and found with their pinsets burned out and every man woman and child on board dead or insane the ring finger the little finger and the thumb of the other hand were the first three battleships to be lost to the ratslost as people realized that there was something out there underneath space itself which was alive capricious and malevolent planoforming was sort of funny it felt like like nothing much like the twinge of a mild electric shock like the ache of a sore tooth bitten on for the first time like a slightly painful flash of light against the eyes yet in that time a fortythousandton ship lifting free above earth disappeared somehow or other into two dimensions and appeared half a lightyear or fifty lightyears off at one moment he would be sitting in the fighting room the pinset ready and the familiar solar system ticking around inside his head for a second or a year he could never tell how long it really was subjectively the funny little flash went through him and then he was loose in the upandout the terrible open spaces between the stars where the stars themselves felt like pimples on his telepathic mind and the planets were too far away to be sensed or read somewhere in this outer space a gruesome death awaited death and horror of a kind which man had never encountered until he reached out for interstellar space itself apparently the light of the suns kept the dragons away dragons that was what people called them to ordinary people there was nothing nothing except the shiver of planoforming and the hammer blow of sudden death or the dark spastic note of lunacy descending into their minds but to the telepaths they were dragons in the fraction of a second between the telepaths awareness of a hostile something out in the black hollow nothingness of space and the impact of a ferocious ruinous psychic blow against all living things within the ship the telepaths had sensed entities something like the dragons of ancient human lore beasts more clever than beasts demons more tangible than demons hungry vortices of aliveness and hate compounded by unknown means out of the thin tenuous matter between the stars it took a surviving ship to bring back the newsa ship in which by sheer chance a telepath had a lightbeam ready turning it out at the innocent dust so that within the panorama of his mind the dragon dissolved into nothing at all and the other passengers themselves nontelepathic went about their way not realizing that their own immediate deaths had been averted from then on it was easyalmost planoforming ships always carried telepaths telepaths had their sensitiveness enlarged to an immense range by the pinsets which were telepathic amplifiers adapted to the mammal mind the pinsets in turn were electronically geared into small dirigible lightbombs light did it light broke up the dragons allowed the ships to reform threedimensionally skip skip skip as they moved from star to star the odds suddenly moved down from a hundred to one against mankind to sixty to forty in mankinds favor this was not enough the telepaths were trained to become ultrasensitive trained to become aware of the dragons in less than a millisecond but it was found that the dragons could move a million miles in just under two milliseconds and that this was not enough for the human mind to activate the lightbeams attempts had been made to sheathe the ships in light at all times this defense wore out as mankind learned about the dragons so too apparently the dragons learned about mankind somehow they flattened their own bulk and came in on extremely flat trajectories very quickly intense light was needed light of sunlike intensity this could be provided only by lightbombs pinlighting came into existence pinlighting consisted of the detonation of ultravivid miniature photonuclear bombs which converted a few ounces of a magnesium isotope into pure visible radiance the odds kept coming down in mankinds favor yet ships were being lost it became so bad that people didnt even want to find the ships because the rescuers knew what they would see it was sad to bring back to earth three hundred bodies ready for burial and two hundred or three hundred lunatics damaged beyond repair to be wakened and fed and cleaned and put to sleep wakened and fed again until their lives were ended telepaths tried to reach into the minds of the psychotics who had been damaged by the dragons but they found nothing there beyond vivid spouting columns of fiery terror bursting from the primordial id itself the volcanic source of life then came the partners man and partner could do together what man could not do alone men had the intellect partners had the speed the partners rode their tiny craft no larger than footballs outside the spaceships they planoformed with the ships they rode beside them in their sixpound craft ready to attack the tiny ships of the partners were swift each carried a dozen pinlights bombs no bigger than thimbles the pinlighters threw the partnersquite literally threwby means of mindtofiring relays directly at the dragons what seemed to be dragons to the human mind appeared in the form of gigantic rats in the minds of the partners out in the pitiless nothingness of space the partners minds responded to an instinct as old as life the partners attacked striking with a speed faster than mans going from attack to attack until the rats or themselves were destroyed almost all the time it was the partners who won with the safety of the interstellar skip skip skip of the ships commerce increased immensely the population of all the colonies went up and the demand for trained partners increased underhill and woodley were a part of the third generation of pinlighters and yet to them it seemed as though their craft had endured forever gearing space into minds by means of the pinset adding the partners to those minds keying up the mind for the tension of a fight on which all dependedthis was more than human synapses could stand for long underhill needed his two months rest after half an hour of fighting woodley needed his retirement after ten years of service they were young they were good but they had limitations so much depended on the choice of partners so much on the sheer luck of who drew whom the shuffle father moontree and the little girl named west entered the room they were the other two pinlighters the human complement of the fighting room was now complete father moontree was a redfaced man of fortyfive who had lived the peaceful life of a farmer until he reached his fortieth year only then belatedly did the authorities find he was telepathic and agree to let him late in life enter upon the career of pinlighter he did well at it but he was fantastically old for this kind of business father moontree looked at the glum woodley and the musing underhill howre the youngsters today ready for a good fight father always wants a fight giggled the little girl named west she was such a little girl her giggle was high and childish she looked like the last person in the world one would expect to find in the rough sharp dueling of pinlighting underhill had been amused one time when he found one of the most sluggish of the partners coming away happy from contact with the mind of the girl named west usually the partners didnt care much about the human minds with which they were paired for the journey the partners seemed to take the attitude that human minds were complex and fouled up beyond belief anyhow no partner ever questioned the superiority of the human mind though very few of the partners were much impressed by that superiority the partners liked people they were willing to fight with them they were even willing to die for them but when a partner liked an individual the way for example that captain wow or the lady may liked underhill the liking had nothing to do with intellect it was a matter of temperament of feel underhill knew perfectly well that captain wow regarded his underhills brains as silly what captain wow liked was underhills friendly emotional structure the cheerfulness and glint of wicked amusement that shot through underhills unconscious thought patterns and the gaiety with which underhill faced danger the words the history books the ideas the scienceunderhill could sense all that in his own mind reflected back from captain wows mind as so much rubbish miss west looked at underhill i bet youve put stickum on the stones i did not underhill felt his ears grow red with embarrassment during his novitiate he had tried to cheat in the lottery because he got particularly fond of a special partner a lovely young mother named murr it was so much easier to operate with murr and she was so affectionate toward him that he forgot pinlighting was hard work and that he was not instructed to have a good time with his partner they were both designed and prepared to go in to deadly battle together one cheating had been enough they had found him out and he had been laughed at for years father moontree picked up the imitationleather cup and shook the stone dice which assigned them their partners for the trip by senior rights he took first draw he grimaced he had drawn a greedy old character a tough old male whose mind was full of slobbering thoughts of food veritable oceans full of halfspoiled fish father moontree had once said that he burped codliver oil for weeks after drawing that particular glutton so strongly had the telepathic image of fish impressed itself upon his mind yet the glutton was a glutton for danger as well as for fish he had killed sixtythree dragons more than any other partner in the service and was quite literally worth his weight in gold the little girl west came next she drew captain wow when she saw who it was she smiled i like him she said hes such fun to fight with he feels so nice and cuddly in my mind cuddly hell said woodley ive been in his mind too its the most leering mind in this ship bar none nasty man said the little girl she said it declaratively without reproach underhill looking at her shivered he didnt see how she could take captain wow so calmly captain wows mind did leer when captain wow got excited in the middle of a battle confused images of dragons deadly rats luscious beds the smell of fish and the shock of space all scrambled together in his mind as he and captain wow their consciousness linked together through the pinset became a fantastic composite of human being and persian cat thats the trouble with working with cats thought underhill its a pity that nothing else anywhere will serve as partner cats were all right once you got in touch with them telepathically they were smart enough to meet the needs of the fight but their motives and desires were certainly different from those of humans they were companionable enough as long as you thought tangible images at them but their minds just closed up and went to sleep when you recited shakespeare or colegrove or if you tried to tell them what space was it was sort of funny realizing that the partners who were so grim and mature out here in space were the same cute little animals that people had used as pets for thousands of years back on earth he had embarrassed himself more than once while on the ground by saluting perfectly ordinary nontelepathic cats because he had forgotten for the moment that they were not partners he picked up the cup and shook out his stone dice he was luckyhe drew the lady may the lady may was the most thoughtful partner he had ever met in her the finely bred pedigree mind of a persian cat had reached one of its highest peaks of development she was more complex than any human woman but the complexity was all one of emotions memory hope and discriminated experienceexperience sorted through without benefit of words when he had first come into contact with her mind he was astonished at its clarity with her he remembered her kittenhood he remembered every mating experience she had ever had he saw in a halfrecognizable gallery all the other pinlighters with whom she had been paired for the fight and he saw himself radiant cheerful and desirable he even thought he caught the edge of a longing a very flattering and yearning thought what a pity he is not a cat woodley picked up the last stone he drew what he deserveda sullen scared old tomcat with none of the verve of captain wow woodleys partner was the most animal of all the cats on the ship a low brutish type with a dull mind even telepathy had not refined his character his ears were half chewed off from the first fights in which he had engaged he was a serviceable fighter nothing more woodley grunted underhill glanced at him oddly didnt woodley ever do anything but grunt father moontree looked at the other three you might as well get your partners now ill let the scanner know were ready to go into the upandout the deal underhill spun the combination lock on the lady mays cage he woke her gently and took her into his arms she humped her back luxuriously stretched her claws started to purr thought better of it and licked him on the wrist instead he did not have the pinset on so their minds were closed to each other but in the angle of her mustache and in the movement of her ears he caught some sense of the gratification she experienced in finding him as her partner he talked to her in human speech even though speech meant nothing to a cat when the pinset was not on its a damn shame sending a sweet little thing like you whirling around in the coldness of nothing to hunt for rats that are bigger and deadlier than all of us put together you didnt ask for this kind of fight did you for answer she licked his hand purred tickled his cheek with her long fluffy tail turned around and faced him golden eyes shining for a moment they stared at each other man squatting cat standing erect on her hind legs front claws digging into his knee human eyes and cat eyes looked across an immensity which no words could meet but which affection spanned in a single glance time to get in he said she walked docilely to her spheroid carrier she climbed in he saw to it that her miniature pinset rested firmly and comfortably against the base of her brain he made sure that her claws were padded so that she could not tear herself in the excitement of battle softly he said to her ready for answer she preened her back as much as her harness would permit and purred softly within the confines of the frame that held her he slapped down the lid and watched the sealant ooze around the seam for a few hours she was welded into her projectile until a workman with a short cutting arc would remove her after she had done her duty he picked up the entire projectile and slipped it into the ejection tube he closed the door of the tube spun the lock seated himself in his chair and put his own pinset on once again he flung the switch he sat in a small room small small warm warm the bodies of the other three people moving close around him the tangible lights in the ceiling bright and heavy against his closed eyelids as the pinset warmed the room fell away the other people ceased to be people and became small glowing heaps of fire embers dark red fire with the consciousness of life burning like old red coals in a country fireplace as the pinset warmed a little more he felt earth just below him felt the ship slipping away felt the turning moon as it swung on the far side of the world felt the planets and the hot clear goodness of the sun which kept the dragons so far from mankinds native ground finally he reached complete awareness he was telepathically alive to a range of millions of miles he felt the dust which he had noticed earlier high above the ecliptic with a thrill of warmth and tenderness he felt the consciousness of the lady may pouring over into his own her consciousness was as gentle and clear and yet sharp to the taste of his mind as if it were scented oil it felt relaxing and reassuring he could sense her welcome of him it was scarcely a thought just a raw emotion of greeting at last they were one again in a tiny remote corner of his mind as tiny as the smallest toy he had ever seen in his childhood he was still aware of the room and the ship and of father moontree picking up a telephone and speaking to a scanner captain in charge of the ship his telepathic mind caught the idea long before his ears could frame the words the actual sound followed the idea the way that thunder on an ocean beach follows the lightning inward from far out over the seas the fighting room is ready clear to planoform sir the play underhill was always a little exasperated by the way that lady may experienced things before he did he was braced for the quick vinegar thrill of planoforming but he caught her report of it before his own nerves could register what happened earth had fallen so far away that he groped for several milliseconds before he found the sun in the upper rear righthand corner of his telepathic mind that was a good jump he thought this way well get there in four or five skips a few hundred miles outside the ship the lady may thought back at him o warm o generous o gigantic man o brave o friendly o tender and huge partner o wonderful with you with you so good good good warm warm now to fight now to go good with you he knew that she was not thinking words that his mind took the clear amiable babble of her cat intellect and translated it into images which his own thinking could record and understand neither one of them was absorbed in the game of mutual greetings he reached out far beyond her range of perception to see if there was anything near the ship it was funny how it was possible to do two things at once he could scan space with his pinset mind and yet at the same time catch a vagrant thought of hers a lovely affectionate thought about a son who had had a golden face and a chest covered with soft incredibly downy white fur while he was still searching he caught the warning from her we jump again and so they had the ship had moved to a second planoform the stars were different the sun was immeasurably far behind even the nearest stars were barely in contact this was good dragon country the open nasty hollow kind of space he reached farther faster sensing and looking for danger ready to fling the lady may at danger wherever he found it terror blazed up in his mind so sharp so clear that it came through as a physical wrench the little girl named west had found somethingsomething immense long black sharp greedy horrific she flung captain wow at it underhill tried to keep his own mind clear watch out he shouted telepathically at the others trying to move the lady may around at one corner of the battle he felt the lustful rage of captain wow as the big persian tomcat detonated lights while he approached the streak of dust which threatened the ship and the people within the lights scored nearmisses the dust flattened itself changing from the shape of a stingray into the shape of a spear not three milliseconds had elapsed father moontree was talking human words and was saying in a voice that moved like cold molasses out of a heavy jar captain underhill knew that the sentence was going to be captain move fast the battle would be fought and finished before father moontree got through talking now fractions of a millisecond later the lady may was directly in line here was where the skill and speed of the partners came in she could react faster than he she could see the threat as an immense rat coming directly at her she could fire the lightbombs with a discrimination which he might miss he was connected with her mind but he could not follow it his consciousness absorbed the tearing wound inflicted by the alien enemy it was like no wound on earthraw crazy pain which started like a burn at his navel he began to writhe in his chair actually he had not yet had time to move a muscle when the lady may struck back at their enemy five evenly spaced photonuclear bombs blazed out across a hundred thousand miles the pain in his mind and body vanished he felt a moment of fierce terrible feral elation running through the mind of the lady may as she finished her kill it was always disappointing to the cats to find out that their enemies whom they sensed as gigantic space rats disappeared at the moment of destruction then he felt her hurt the pain and the fear that swept over both of them as the battle quicker than the movement of an eyelid had come and gone in the same instant there came the sharp and acid twinge of planoform once more the ship went skip he could hear woodley thinking at him you dont have to bother much this old sonofagun and i will take over for a while twice again the twinge the skip he had no idea where he was until the lights of the caledonia space board shone below with a weariness that lay almost beyond the limits of thought he threw his mind back into rapport with the pinset fixing the lady mays projectile gently and neatly in its launching tube she was half dead with fatigue but he could feel the beat of her heart could listen to her panting and he grasped the grateful edge of a thanks reaching from her mind to his the score they put him in the hospital at caledonia the doctor was friendly but firm you actually got touched by that dragon thats as close a shave as ive ever seen its all so quick that itll be a long time before we know what happened scientifically but i suppose youd be ready for the insane asylum now if the contact had lasted several tenths of a millisecond longer what kind of cat did you have out in front of you underhill felt the words coming out of him slowly words were such a lot of trouble compared with the speed and the joy of thinking fast and sharp and clear mind to mind but words were all that could reach ordinary people like this doctor his mouth moved heavily as he articulated words dont call our partners cats the right thing to call them is partners they fight for us in a team you ought to know we call them partners not cats how is mine i dont know said the doctor contritely well find out for you meanwhile old man you take it easy theres nothing but rest that can help you can you make yourself sleep or would you like us to give you some kind of sedative i can sleep said underhill i just want to know about the lady may the nurse joined in she was a little antagonistic dont you want to know about the other people theyre okay said underhill i knew that before i came in here he stretched his arms and sighed and grinned at them he could see they were relaxing and were beginning to treat him as a person instead of a patient im all right he said just let me know when i can go see my partner a new thought struck him he looked wildly at the doctor they didnt send her off with the ship did they ill find out right away said the doctor he gave underhill a reassuring squeeze of the shoulder and left the room the nurse took a napkin off a goblet of chilled fruit juice underhill tried to smile at her there seemed to be something wrong with the girl he wished she would go away first she had started to be friendly and now she was distant again its a nuisance being telepathic he thought you keep trying to reach even when you are not making contact suddenly she swung around on him you pinlighters you and your damn cats just as she stamped out he burst into her mind he saw himself a radiant hero clad in his smooth suede uniform the pinset crown shining like ancient royal jewels around his head he saw his own face handsome and masculine shining out of her mind he saw himself very far away and he saw himself as she hated him she hated him in the secrecy of her own mind she hated him because he wasshe thoughtproud and strange and rich better and more beautiful than people like her he cut off the sight of her mind and as he buried his face in the pillow he caught an image of the lady may she is a cat he thought thats all she isa cat but that was not how his mind saw herquick beyond all dreams of speed sharp clever unbelievably graceful beautiful wordless and undemanding where would he ever find a woman who could

written for a number of television series including the new twilight zone series and edited fifteen volumes of the wild cards series of sharedworld anthologies the announcement came during prime time all four major holo networks went off simultaneously along with most of the independents there was an instant of crackling grayness and then a voice which said simply ladies and gentlemen the president of the united states john hartmann was the youngest man ever to hold the office of president and the commentators were fond of saying that he was the most telegenic as well his cleancut good looks ready wit and flashing grin had given the liberty alliance its narrow plurality in the bitter fourway elections of his political acumen had engineered the electoral college coalition with the old republicans that had put him in the white house hartmann was not grinning now his features were hard somber he was sitting behind his desk in the oval office looking down at the papers he held in his hands after a moment of silence he raised his head slowly and his dark eyes looked straight out into the living rooms of a nation my fellow countrymen he said gravely tonight our nation faces the most serious crisis in its long and great history approximately one hour ago an american air force base in california was hit by a violent and vicious attack the first casualty was a careless sentry the attacker was quick silent and very efficient he used a knife the sentry died without a whimper never knowing what was happening the other attackers were moving in even before the corpse hit the ground circuits were hooked up to bypass the alarm system and torches went to work on the high electric fence it fell from the darkness more invaders materialized to move through the fresh gap but somewhere one alarm system was still alive sirens began to howl the sleepy airbase came to sudden startled life stealth now useless the attackers began to run towards the airfields somebody began to fire someone else screamed outside the main gate the guards looked in baffled towards the base a stream of submachine gun fire took them where they stood hammering them to bloody death against their own fence a grenade arced through the air and the gate shattered under the explosion the attack was sudden wellplanned and utterly ruthless hartmann told the nation the defense under the circumstances was heroic nearly one hundred american servicemen died during the course of the action the power lines were cut only seconds after the attack got under way a wellplaced grenade took out the emergency generator then darkness it was a moonless night and the clouds obscured the stars the only light was the flash of machine gun fire and the brief shattering brilliance of the explosions around the main gate there was little rhyme and less reason to the defense startled by the sirens troops scrambled from the barracks and towards the gate where the conflict seemed to be centered on either side of the fence attackers and defenders hit the ground a searing crossfire was set up the base commandant was as startled and confused as any of his men long valuable minutes passed while he and his staff groped for the facts and tried to understand what was happening their response was almost instinctive a ring of defenders was thrown around the command tower a second around the base armory other men were sent sprinting towards the planes but the bulk of the troops were rushed to the main gate where the battle was at its fiercest the defenders brought up heavy weapons from the base armory the shrubbery outside the base perimeter was blasted by mortars blown apart by grenades the attackers hidden position was systematically pounded then behind a wall of smoke and teargas the defenders poured out of the gate washed over the enemy positions they found them empty but for corpses the attackers had melted away as suddenly as they had come an order for search and pursuit was swiftly given and just as swiftly rescinded for over the machine gun fire and the explosions another sound could now be heard the sound of a jet taking off the attackers concentrated most of their forces against the main entrance of the air base hartmann said but for all its fierceness this assault was simply a diversion while it was in progress a smaller force of attackers penetrated another part of the base perimeter beat off light resistance and seized a small portion of the airfields the presidents face was taut with emotion the goal of the attack was a squadron of longrange bombers and their fighter escorts as part of our first line of defense to deter communist aggression the bombers were on standby status fueled and ready to take off in seconds in the event of an enemy attack hartmann paused dramatically looked down at his papers then back up our men reacted swiftly and valiantly they deserve only our praise they retook several planes from the attackers and burned down several others during takeoff despite this courageous resistance however the attackers put seven fighters and two bombers into the air my fellow countrymen both of those bombers were equipped with nuclear weaponry again hartmann paused behind him the oval office background dissolved suddenly there was only the president and his desk outlined against a blank wall of white on that wall six familiar sentences suddenly appeared even while the attack was in progress an ultimatum was sent to me in washington hartmann said unless certain demands were met within a threehour deadline i was told a hydrogen bomb would be dropped on the city of washington dc you see those demands before you he gestured most of you have seen them before some call them the six demands he continued im sure you know them as well as i they call for an end to american aid to our struggling allies in africa and the mideast for the systematic destruction of our defensive capacities for an end to the special urban units that have restored law and order to our cities for the release of thousands of dangerous criminals for the repeal of federal restrictions on obscene and subversive literature and of coursehe flashed his famous grinfor my resignation as president of the united states the grin faded these demands are a formula for national suicide a recipe for surrender and disgrace they would return us to the lawlessness and anarchy of a permissive society that we have left behind moreover they are opposed by the great majority of the american people however as you know these demands are vocally advocated by a small and dangerous minority they represent the political program of the socalled american liberation front the background behind hartmann changed again the blowup of the six demands vanished now the president sat before a huge photograph of a bearded longhaired young man in a black beret and baggy black uniform the man was quite dead most of his chest had been blown away behind me you see a photograph of one of the casualties of tonights attack hartmann said like all the other attackers we found he wears the uniform of the paramilitary wing of the alf the photo vanished hartmann looked grim the facts are clear but this time the alf has gone too far i will not submit to nuclear blackmail nor my fellow countrymen is there cause for alarm to my fellow citizens of washington i say especially fear not i promise that the alf pirate planes will be tracked down and destroyed long before they reach their target meanwhile the leaders of the alf are about to learn that they erred in attempting to intimidate this administration for too long they have divided and weakened us and given aid and comfort to those who would like to see this nation enslaved they shall do so no longer there can be only one word for tonights attack that word is treason accordingly i will deal with the attackers like traitors ive got them mckinnis said his voice crackling with static or something reynolds didnt really need the information he had them too he glanced briefly down at the radarmap they were on the edge of the scope several miles ahead heading due east at about feet high and moving fast another crackle then bonetto the flight leader looks like them alright ive got nine lets go get em his plane nosed up and began to climb the others followed behind and abreast of him in a wide v formation nine lf vampyre fighterinterceptors red white and blue flags on burnished black metal silvery teeth slung underneath a hunting pack closing for the kill yet another voice came over the open channel hey whattaya figure the odds all over theyre looking betcha it gets us promotions lucky us that had to be dutton reynolds thought a brash kid hungry maybe he felt lucky reynolds didnt inside the acceleration suit he was sweating suddenly coldly the odds had been all against it the kid was right about that the alfie bombers were lbs laserarmed monsters with speed to spare they couldve taken any route of a dozen and still make it to washington on time and every damn plane and radar installation in the country was looking for them so what were the odds against them running into reynolds and his flight out over northern nebraska on a wild goose chase too damn good as it turned out they see us bonetto said theyre climbing and accelerating move it reynolds moved it his vampyre was the last in one arm of the v and it held its formation behind the oxygen mask his eyes roamed restlessly and watched the instruments mach then then higher they were gaining climbing and gaining the radarmap showed the alfie positions and there was a blur up ahead on the infrared scope but through the narrow eyeslit nothing just cold black sky and stars they were above the clouds the dumb bastards reynolds thought they steal the most sophisticated hunk of metal ever built and they dont know how to use it they werent even using their radar scramblers it was almost like they were asking to be shot down cracklings theyre leveling off bonetto again hold your missiles till my order and remember those big babies can give you a nasty hotfoot reynolds looked at the radarmap again the alfies were now flat out at about feet figured the lbs could go higher but ten was about the upper limit for the fighter escorts rapiers reynolds remembered his briefing they wanted to stick together that made sense the alfies would need their rapiers ten wasnt the upper limit for vampyres reynolds squinted he thought he saw something ahead through the eyeslit a flash of silver them or his imagination hard to tell but hed see them soon enough the pursuit planes were gaining fast as they were the big lbs were no match for the vampyres the rapiers were but they had to stay with the bombers so it was only a matter of time theyd catch them long before washington and then reynolds shifted uneasily he didnt want to think about that hed never flown in combat before he didnt like the idea his mouth was dry he swallowed just this morning he and anne had talked about how lucky he was made plans for a vacation and beyond his term was almost up and he was still safe in the states so many friends dead in the south african war but hed been lucky and now this and suddenly the possibility that tomorrow might not be bright the possibility that tomorrow might not be it scared him there was more too even if he lived he was still queasy about the killing that shouldnt have bothered him he knew it might happen when he enlisted but it was different then he thought hed be flying against russians chineseenemies the outbreak of the south african war and the us intervention had disturbed him but he could have fought there for all that the panafrican alliance was communistinspired or so they said but alfies werent distant foreigners alfies were people neighbors his radical college roommate the black kids he had grown up with back in new york the teacher who lived down the block he got along with alfies well enough when they werent talking politics and sometimes even when they were the six demands werent all that bad hed heard a lot of nasty rumors about the special urban units and god knows what the us was doing in south africa and the mideast he grimaced behind the oxygen mask face it reynolds he told himself the skeleton in his closet he had actually thought about voting alf in although in the end hed chickened out and pulled the lever for bishop the old democrat no one on the base knew but anne they hadnt argued politics for a long time with anyone most of his friends were old republicans but a few had turned to the liberty alliance and that scared him bonettos crackling command smashed his train of thought look at that men the alfies are going to fight at em reynolds didnt need to look at his radarmap he could see them now above lights against the sky growing lights the rapiers were diving on them of all the commentators who followed president hartmann over the holo networks continentals ted warren seemed the least shellshocked warren was a gritty old veteran with an incisive mind and razor tongue he had tangled with hartmann more than once and was regularly denounced by the liberty alliance for his alfie bias the presidents speech leaves many questions still unanswered warren said in his postmortem newscast he has promised to deal with the alf as traitors but as yet we are unsure exactly what steps will be taken there is also some question in my mind at any rate as to the alfs motivation for this alleged attack bob any thoughts on that a new face on camera the reporter who covered alf activities for continental had been hustled out of bed and rushed to the studio he still looked a little rumpled no ted he replied as far as i know the alf was not planning any action of this kind were it not for the fact that this attack was so wellplanned i might question whether the alf national leadership was involved at all it might have been an unauthorized action by a group of local extremists youll recall that the assault on the chicago police headquarters during the riots was of this nature however i think the planning that went into this attack and the armament that was used precludes this being a similar case warren at the continental anchordesk nodded sagely bob do you think there is any possibility that the paramilitary arm of the alf might have acted unilaterally without the knowledge of the partys political leaders the reporter paused and looked thoughtful well its possible ted but not likely the kind of assault that the president described would require too much planning id think that the whole party would have to be involved in an effort on that scale what reasons would the alf have for an action like this warren asked from what the president said a hope that a nuclear threat would bring immediate agreement to the alfs six demands would seem to be the reason warren was insistent yes but why should the alf resort to such an extreme tactic the latest gallup poll gave them the support of nearly of the electorate behind only the of president hartmanns liberty alliance this is a sharp increase from the of the vote the alf got in the presidential elections of with only a year to go before the new elections it seems strange that the alf would risk everything on such a desperate ploy now the reporter was nodding you have a point ted however weve been surprised by the alf before theyve never been the easiest party to predict and i think warren cut him off excuse me bob back to you later correspondent mike petersen is at the alfs national headquarters in washington and he has douglass brown with him mike can you hear me the picture changed two men standing before a desk one half slouched against it behind them on the wall the alf symbol a clenched black fist superimposed over the peace sign the reporter held a microphone the man he was with was tall black youthful and angry yes ted weve got you the reporter said he turned to the black man doug you were the alf presidential candidate in how do you react to president hartmanns charges brown laughed lightly nothing that man does surprises me anymore the charges are vicious lies the american liberation front had nothing to do with this socalled attack in fact i doubt that this attack ever took place hartmann is a dangerous demagogue and hes tried this sort of smear before then the alf claims that no attack took place petersen asked brown frowned well thats just a quick guess on my part not an official alf position he said quickly this has all been very sudden and i dont really have the facts but id say that was a possibility as you know mike the liberty alliance has made wild charges against us before in his statement tonight president hartmann said he would deal with the alf as traitors would you care to comment on that yeah said brown its more cheap rhetoric i say that hartmanns the traitor hes the one that has betrayed everything this country is supposed to stand for his creation of the special suuies to keep the ghettoes in line his intervention in the south african war his censorship legislation theres your treason for you the reporter smiled thank you doug and now back to ted warren warren reappeared for those of you who have flicked on late a brief recap earlier this evening an american air base in california was attacked and two bombers and seven fighter planes were seized the bombers were equipped with nuclear weaponry and the attackers have threatened to destroy washington dc unless certain demands are met within three hours only an hourandahalf now remain continental news will stay on the air until the conclusion of the crisis somewhere over western illinois reynolds climbed towards ten and sweated and tried to tell himself that the advantages were all his the rapiers were good planes nothing with wings was any faster or more maneuverable but the vampyres had all the other plusses their missiles were more sophisticated their defensive scramblers better and they had their vampyre fangs twin gasdynamic lasers mounted on either wing that could slice through steel like it was jello the rapiers had nothing to match that the vampyres were the first operational laser fighters besides there were nine vampyres and only seven rapiers and the alfies werent as familiar with their planes they couldnt be so the odds were all with reynolds but he still sweated the arms of the v formation slowly straightened as reynolds and the other wingmen accelerated to come even with bonettos lead jet in the radarmap the rapiers were already on top of them and even through the eyeslit he could see them now diving out of the black their silverwhite sides bright against the sky the computer tracking system was locked in the warheads armed but still no signal from bonetto and then now sharp and clear reynolds hit the firing stud and missiles one and eight shot from beneath the wings and etched a trail of flame up into the night parallel to his others dutton on his wing had fired four eager for the kill redorange against black through the eyeslit black on red in the infrared scope but all the same really the climbing streaks of flame that were the vampyre missiles intersecting with a descending set crisscrossing briefly then explosion the alfies had rigged one of theirs for timed detonation a small orange fireball bloomed briefly when it vanished both sets of missiles were gone save for one battered survivor from the vampyre barrage that wobbled upward without hitting anything reynolds glanced down the radarmap was having an epileptic fit the alfies were using their scramblers split said bonetto voice crackling scatter and hit them the vampyres broke formation reynolds and dutton pulled up and to the left mckinnis dove bonetto and most of his wing swung away to the right and trainor climbed straight on at the diving rapiers reynolds watched him from the corner of his eye two more missiles jumped from trainors wings then two more then the final two and briefly the laser seared a path up from his wingtips a futile gesture he was still out of range the rapiers were sleek silver birds of prey spitting missiles and suddenly another fireball and one of them stopped spitting but no time for cheering even as the rapier went up trainors vampyre tried to swerve from the hail of alfie missiles his radar scrambler and heat decoys had confused them but not enough reynolds was facing away from the explosion but he felt the impact of the shock and he could see the nightblack plane twisting and shattering in his mind reynolds felt a vague pang and tried to remember what trainor had looked like but there was no time he twisted the vampyre around in a sharp loop dutton flew parallel they dove back towards the fight far below a new cloud of flame blossomed mckinnis reynolds thought fleetingly bitterly he dove the alfies got on his tail the goddamn alfies but there was no way to be sure no leisure to consider the question even a brief glance out the eyeslit was a luxury a dangerous luxury the infrared scope the radarmap the computer tracking systems all screamed for his attention below him two alfies were swinging around the computer locked on his fingers moved as if by instinct missiles two and seven leapt from their launchers towards the rapiers a scream sounded briefly from his radio mingled with the static and the sudden shrill cry of the proximity alarms something had locked on him he activated the lasers the computer found the incoming missile tracked it burned it from the sky when it got within range reynolds had never even seen it he wondered how close it had come a flood of bright orange light washed through the eyeslit as a rapier went up in flame in front of him his missile duttons he never knew it was all he could do to pull the vampyre up sharply and avoid the expanding ball of fire there were a few seconds of peace he was above the fight and he took time for a quick glance at the infrared a tangle of confused black dots on a red field but two were higher than the rest dutton with an alfie on his tail reynolds swung his vampyre down again came in above and behind the rapier just as it was discharging its missiles he was close no need to waste the four missiles he had left his hand went to the lasers fired converging beams of light lanced from the black wingtips to bite into the rapiers silver fuselage on either side of the cockpit the alfie pilot dove for escape but the vampyre minicomputer held the lasers steady the rapier exploded almost simultaneously there was another explosion the alfie missiles touched off by duttons lasers reynolds radio came alive with duttons laughter and breathless thanks but reynolds was paying more attention to the infrared and the radarmap the radar was clear again only three blips showed below him it was over bonettos voice split the cabin again got him he was yelling got them all whos left up there dutton replied quickly then reynolds the fourth surviving vampyre was ranczyk bonettos wingman the others were gone there was a new pang sharper than during the battle it had been mckinnis after all reynolds thought hed known mckinnis tall with red hair a lousy poker player who surrendered his money gracefully when he lost he always did his wife made good chili theyd voted old democrat like reynolds damn damn damn were only halfway there bonetto was saying the lbs are still ahead picked up some distance so lets go four vampyres werent nearly as impressive in formation as nine but they climbed and gave chase ted warren looked tired he had taken off his jacket and loosened the formal black scarf knotted around his neck and his hair was mussed but still he went on reports have been coming in from all over the nation on the sighting of the pirate planes he said most of them are clearly misidentifications but no word has yet come from the administration on the hunt for the stolen jets so the rumors continue to flow unabated meanwhile barely an hour remains before the threatened nuclear demolition of washington behind him a screen woke to sudden churning life pennsylvania avenue with the capitol outlined in the distance was choked with cars and people washington itself is in a state of panic warren commented the populace of the city has taken to the streets en masse in an effort to escape but the resulting traffic jams have effectively strangled all major arteries many have abandoned their cars and are trying to leave the city on foot helicopters of the special urban units have been attempting to quell the disturbances ordering the citizens to return to their homes and president hartmann himself has announced that he intends to set an example for the people of the city and remain in the white house for the duration of the crisis the washington scenes faded warren looked offcamera briefly ive just been told that chicago correspondent ward emery is standing by with mitchell grinstein the chairman of the alfs community defense militia so now to chicago grinstein was standing outdoors on the steps of a gray fortresslike building he was tall and broad with long black hair worn in a pony tail and a drooping fu manchu mustache his clothes were a baggy black uniform a black beret and an alf medallion on a length of rawhide two other men similarly garbed lounged behind him on the steps both carried rifles im here with mitchell grinstein whose organization has been accused of participating in this evenings attack on a california air base and the hijacking of two nuclear bombers emery said mitch your reactions grinstein flashed a vaguely sinister smile well i only know what i see on the holo i didnt order any attack but i applaud whoever did if this speeds up the implementation of the six demands im all for it douglass brown has called the charges of alf participation in this attack vicious lies emery continued he questions whether any attack ever took place how does this square with what you just said grinstein shrugged maybe brown knows more than i do we didnt order this attack like i said but it could be that some of our men finally got fed up with hartmanns fourthrate fascism and decided to take things into their own hands if so were behind them then you think there was an attack i guess so hartmann had pictures even he wouldnt have the gall to fake that and you support the attack yeah the community defenders have been saying for a long time that black people and poor people arent going to get justice anywhere but in the streets this is a vindication of what weve been calling for all along and what about the position of the alfs political arm another shrug doug brown and i agree on where were going we dont see eye to eye on how to get there but isnt the community defense militia subordinate to the alf political apparatus and thus to brown on paper its different in the streets are the liberty troopers subordinate to president hartmann when they go out on freakhunts and blackbusting expeditions they dont act like it the community defenders are committed to the protection of the community from thugs liberty troopers and hartmanns special suuies and anyone else who comes along were also committed to getting the six demands and maybe wed go a bit further to realize those demands than doug and his men one last question said emery president hartmann in his speech tonight said that he intended to treat the alf like traitors let him try grinstein said smiling just let him try the alfie bombers had edged onto the radarmap again they were still at feet doing about mach the vampyre pack would be on them in minutes reynolds watched for lbs almost numbly through his eyeslit he was cold and drenched with his own sweat and very scared the lull between battles was worse than the battles themselves he had decided it gave you too much time to think and thinking was bad he was sad and a little sick about mckinnis but grateful grateful that it hadnt been him then he realized that it still might be the night wasnt over the lbs were no pushovers and all so needless the alfies were vicious fools there were other ways better ways they didnt have to do this whatever sympathy he had ever felt for the alf had gone down in flames with mckinnis and trainor and the others they deserved whatever they had coming to them and hartmann he was sure had something in mind so many innocent people dead and for nothing for a grandstand desperado stunt without a prayer of success that was the worst part the plan was so illconceived so hopeless the alf couldnt possibly win they could shoot him down sure like mckinnis but there were other planes theyd be found and taken out by someone and if they got as far as washington there was still the citys ring of defensive missiles to deal with hartmann had had trouble forcing that through congress but it would come in handy now and even if the alf got there so what did they really think hartmann would give in no way not him hed call their bluff and either way they lost if they backed down they were finished and if they dropped the bomb theyd get hartmannbut at the expense of millions of their own supporters washington was nearly all black hell it gave the alf a big plurality in what was the figure something like he thought around there anyway it didnt make sense it couldnt be but it was there was a knot in his stomach churning and twisting through the eyeslit he saw flickers of motion against the star field the alfies the goddamn alfies his mind turned briefly to anne and suddenly he hated the planes ahead of him and the men who flew them hold your missiles till my order bonetto said and watch it the vampyres accelerated but the alfies acted before the attack hey look that was dutton theyre splitting a bass growl distorted by static ranczyk reynolds looked at his radarmap one of the lbs was diving sharply picking up speed heading for the sea of clouds that rolled below in the starlight the other was going into a shallow climb stay together bonetto again they want us to break up but were faster well take out one and catch the other they climbed together at first side by side but then one of the sleek planes began to edge ahead dutton bonettos voice was a warning i want him duttons vampyre screamed upward into range of the bandit ahead from his wings twin missiles roared closed and suddenly were not the bombers lasers burned them clean from the sky bonetto tried to shout another order but it was too late dutton was paying no attention he was already shrieking to his kill this time reynolds saw it all dutton was way out ahead of the others still accelerating trying to close within laser range he was out of missiles but the alfie laser had a longer range it locked on him first the vampyre seemed to writhe dutton went into a sharp dive pulled up equally sharply threw his plane from side to side trying to shake free of the laser before it killed but the tracking computers in the lbs were faster than he could ever hope to be the laser held steady and then dutton stopped fighting briefly his vampyre closed again climbing right up into the spear of light its own lasers flashing out and converging uselessly he was still too far away and only for an instant before the scream duttons vampyre never even exploded it just seemed to go limp its laser died suddenly and then it was in a spin flames licking at the black fuselage burning a hole in the black velvet of night reynolds didnt watch the fall bonettos voice had snapped him from his nightmare trance fire he let go on three and six and they shrieked away from him towards the alfie bonetto and ranczyk had also fired six missiles rose together two more slightly behind them ranczyk had let loose with a second volley at him bonetto shouted lasers then his plane was moving away quickly ranczyk with him black shadows against a black sky following their missiles and obscuring the stars reynolds hung back briefly still scared still hearing duttons scream and seeing the fireball that was mckinnis then shamed he followed the bomber had unleashed its own missiles and its lasers were locked onto the oncoming threats there was an explosion several missiles wiped from the air others burned down but there were two vampyres moving in behind the missiles and then a third behind them bonetto and ranczyk had their lasers locked on the alfie burning at him growing hotter and more vicious as they climbed briefly the bombers big laser flicked down in reply one of the vampyres went up in a cloud of flame a cloud that still screamed upwards at the alfie almost simultaneously another roar a fireball under the wing of the bomber rocked it its laser winked off power trouble then on again burning at the hail of missiles reynolds flicked on his laser and watched it lance out towards the chaos above the other vampyrereynolds wasnt sure whichwas firing its remaining missiles they were almost on top of each other in the radarmap and the infrared they were only in the eyeslit was there still space between the two and then they were together joining one big ball orange and red and yellow swallowing both vampyre and prey growing growing growing reynolds sat almost frozen climbing towards the swelling inferno his laser firing ineffectively into the flames then he came out of it and swerved and dove his laser fired once more to wipe out a chunk of flaming debris that came spinning towards him he was alone the fire fell and faded and there was only one vampyre and the stars and the blanket of cloud far below him he had survived but how he had hung back when he should have attacked he didnt deserve survival the others had earned it with their courage but he had hung back he felt sick but he could still redeem himself yes down below there was still one alfie in the air headed towards washington with its bombs and only he was left to stop it reynolds nosed the vampyre into a dive and began his grim descent after a brief station identification warren was back with two guests and a new wrinkle the wrinkle was the image of a large clock that silently counted down the time remaining while the newsmen talked the guests were a retired air force general and a wellknown political columnist warren introduced them then turned to the general tonights attack understandably has frightened a lot of people he began especially those in washington how likely is it that the threatened bombing will take place the general snorted impossible ted i know what kind of air defense systems weve got in this country they were designed to handle a fullfledged attack from another nuclear power they can certainly handle a cheapshot move like this then youd say that washington is in no danger correct absolutely none this plan was militarily hopeless from its conception im shocked that even the alf would resort to such a foredoomed venture warren nodded and swiveled to face the columnist how about from a political point of view youve been a regular observer of president hartmann and the washington scene for many years sid in your opinion did this maneuver have any chances of practical political success its still very early the columnist cautioned but from where i sit id say the alf has committed a major blunder this attack is a political disasteror at least it looks like one in these early hours because of washingtons large black population id guess that this threat to the city will seriously undermine the alfs support among the black community if so it would be a catastrophe for the party in douglass brown drew more black votes than the other three candidates combined without these votes the alf presidential campaign would have been a farce how will this affect other alf supporters warren asked thats a key question id say it would tend to drive them away from the party since its inception the alf has always had a large pacifist element which frequently clashed with the more militant alfies who made up the community defense militia i think that tonights events might be the final blow for these people who do you think would benefit from these desertions the columnist shrugged hard to say theres the possibility of a new splinter party being formed and president hartmann im sure will enjoy a large swing of support his way the most likely possibility would be a revival of the old democratic party if it can regain the black voters and white radicals it has lost to the alf in recent years thank you said warren he turned back to the camera then glanced down briefly at the desk in front of him checking the latest bulletins well have more analysis later he said right now continentals man in california is at collins air base where tonights attack took place warren faded the new reporter was tall and thin and young he was standing before the main gate of the air base behind him was a bustling tangle of activity several jeeps and large numbers of police and soldiers the spotlights were on again and the destruction was clearly evident in the battered gatehouse and the twisted shattered wire of the fence itself deke hamilton here the man began ted continental came out here to check whether any attack did take place since the alf has charged that the president was lying well from what ive seen out here its the alf thats been lying there was an attack and it was a vicious one you can see some of the damage behind you this is where the attackers struck hardest warrens voice cut in have you seen any bodies the reporter nodded yes many of them some have been horribly mangled by the fighting more than one hundred men from the base id estimate and about fifty alfies have any of the attackers been identified warren asked well theyre clearly alfies the reporter said beards long hair alf uniforms and many had literature in their pockets pamphlets advocating the six demands that sort of thing however as of yet no specific identifications have been announced except for the air men of course the base has released its own casualty lists but not for the alfies as i said many bodies are badly damaged so identification may be difficult i think some sort of mass burial is being planned deke said warren has there been any racial breakdown on the casualties uhnone has been released the bodies i saw were all white but then the black population in this area is relatively small warren started to ask another question he never finished his sentence without warning the picture from california suddenly vanished and was replaced by chaos this is mike petersen in washington the reporter said he was awash in a sea of struggling humanity being pushed this way and that all around him fights were in progress as a squad of special urban police in blue and silver waded through a crowd of resisting alfies the alf symbol was on the wall behind petersen im at alf national headquarters he said trying valiantly to stay before the cameras i he was shoved to one side fought back weve got quite a scene here just a few minutes ago a detachment of special urban police broke into the building and arrested several of the alfs national leaders including douglass brown some of the other people here tried to stop them and the police are now trying to make more arrests theres beendamn someone had spun into him the cops were using clubs petersen was trying to untangle himself from the battle he looked up briefly and started to say something then something hit the camera and suddenly he was gone reynolds was very much conscious of being alone he was at feet and dropping rapidly ripping through layer on layer of wispy cloud in an empty sky the alfie was somewhere below him but he couldnt see it yet he knew it was there though his radarmap was acting up that meant a scrambler nearby his eyes roamed his thoughts wandered it was one on one now there might be help bonetto had radioed down when they first sighted the bandits maybe someone had tracked them maybe another flight was on its way to intercept the bomber and then again maybe not their course had been erratic they were over kentucky now and theyd been up high with scramblers going to confuse radar maybe their position wasnt known he could radio down yes he should do that but no come to think of it that would alert the alfie maybe they didnt know he was behind them maybe he could take them by surprise he hoped so otherwise he was worried there were only two missiles left and reynolds wasnt all that sure that a vampyre could take an lb one on one loose facts rolled back and forth in his mind the lasers the bomber had a big power source its laser had a range nearly twice that of the smaller model on the vampyre with a bigger computer to keep it on target what did he have speed yes and maneuverability and maybe he was a better pilot too or was he reynolds frowned come to think of it the alfies had pretty much held their own up to now strange you wouldnt think theyd be so good especially when they made elementary mistakes like forgetting to throw in their scramblers but they had been they flew almost like veterans maybe they were veterans hartmann had discharged a lot of alf sympathizers from the armed forces right after his election maybe some of them had gone all the way and actually joined the alfies and were coming back for revenge but that was three years ago and the lbs were new it shouldnt have been all that easy for the alfies to master them reynolds shook his head and shoved the whole train of thought to one side it wasnt worth pursuing however it had happened the fact was the alfies were damn good pilots and any advantage he had there was negligible he looked at his instruments still diving at feet the lb still below him somewhere but closer the radarmap was a useless dancing fuzz now but there was an image on the infrared scope through the eyeslit he could see lightning flashes far below a thunderstorm and the bomber was diving through it and slowing according to his instruments probably going to treetop level hed catch it soon and what then there were two missiles left he could close and fire them but the alfie had its own missiles and its laser net what if his missiles didnt get through then hed have to go in with his own lasers and die like dutton he tried to swallow but the saliva caught in his throat the damn alfie had such a big power source theyd be slicing him into ribbons long before he got close enough for his smaller weapon to be effective oh sure he might take them too it took even a big gas dynamic laser a few seconds to burn through steel and in those few seconds hed be close enough to return the attentions but that didnt help hed die with them and he didnt want to die he thought of anne again then of mckinnis the alfies would never reach washington he thought another flight of hunters would sight the lb and catch it or the citys abms would knock it out but theyd never get through there was no reason for him to die to stop the bomber no reason at all he should pull up radio ahead land and sound the alarm thick dark clouds rolled around the plane swallowed it lightning hammered at the nightblack wings and shook the silver missiles in their slots and reynolds sweated and the vampyre continued to dive the question of what president hartmann meant when he promised to treat the alf like traitors has been resolved ted warren said looking straight out of millions of holocubes his face drawn and unreadable within the last few minutes weve had dozens of reports all over the nation the special urban units are raiding alf headquarters and the homes of party leaders in a few cities including detroit boston and washington itself mass arrests of alf members are reported to be in progress but for the most part the suu seems to be concentrating on those in positions of authority with the community defense militia or the party itself meanwhile the pentagon reports that the bandit planes that the alf is accused of taking have been tracked over kentucky heading towards washington according to informed air force sources only one of the hijacked bombers is still in the air and it is being pursued by an interceptor other flights are now being rushed to the scene warren looked outcube briefly scowled at someone unseen and turned back we have just been informed that the white house is standing by with a statement i give you now the president of the united states the image changed again the oval office this time hartmann was standing and he was not alone vicepresident joseph delaney balding and middleaged stood next to him before a row of american flags my fellow patriots hartmann began i come before you again to announce that the government is taking steps against the traitors who have threatened the very capital of this great nation after consulting with vicepresident delaney and my cabinet i have ordered the arrest of the leaders of the socalled american liberation front hartmanns dark eyes were burning and his voice had a marvelous fatherly firmness delaney beside him looked pale and frightened and uncertain to those of you who have supported these men in the past let me say now that they will receive every safeguard of a fair trial in the american tradition hartmann continued as for yourselves your support of the socalled alf was wellintentioned no matter how misguided no harm will come to you however your leaders have tonight betrayed your trust and your nation they have forfeited your support to aid them now would be to join in their treason i say this especially to our black citizens who have been so cruelly misled by alf sloganeering now is the time to demonstrate your patriotism to make up for past mistakes and to those who would persist in their error i issue this warning those who aid the traitors in resisting lawful authority will be treated as traitors themselves hartmann paused briefly then continued some will question this move with a legitimate concern for the american system of checks and balances they will argue that i had no authority for deploying the special urban units as i have done they are right but special situations call for special remedies and in this night of crisis there was no time to secure congressional approval however i did not act unilaterally he looked towards delaney the vicepresident cleared his throat president hartmann consulted me on this matter earlier tonight he began in a halting voice i expressed some reluctance at first to approve his proposed course of action but after the president had presented me with all the facts i could see that there was no realistic alternative speaking for myself and for those cabinet members who like me represent the republican party i concur with the presidents actions hartmann began to speak again but the voice suddenly faded on the holocast and a short second later the image also vanished ted warren returned to the air we will bring you the rest of the presidents statement later the anchorman said after several special bulletins we have just been informed that all alf members of the house of representatives have been placed under arrest as well as two of the three alf senators suu national headquarters reports that senator jackson edwards is still at large and is currently being sought after warren shuffled some papers we also have reports of scattered streetfighting in several cities between the suu and the community defenders the fighting appears to be most intense in chicago where special urban forces have surrounded the national center of the alfs paramilitary wing we take you now to ward emery on the scene the image shifted emery was standing on the steps of the new chicago police headquarters on south state street every light in the building behind him burned brightly and a steady stream of riotequipped police was hurrying up and down the stairs not quite on the scene ted he began our crew was forcibly excluded from the area where the fighting is now in progress were here at chicago police headquarters now which you will recall was the focus of the battle during the riots the local police and the special urban units are doing their planning and coordinating from here warren cut in with a voiceover what precisely has taken place well said emery it started when a detachment of special urban police arrived at community defender central as its called to arrest mitchell grinstein and several other organization leaders im not sure who opened fire but someone did and there were several casualties the community defenders have their headquarters heavily guarded and they drove back the suu in the early skirmish that i witnessed but things have changed since then although the local police have cordoned off a large portion of chicagos south side and excluded me and other reporters i now understand that grinstein and his militiamen are holed up inside their building which is under suu siege he looked around briefly as you can see theres a lot of activity around here he continued the local police are on overtime and the special urban units have mobilized their entire chicago battalion theyre using their regular armored cars plus some heavier weapons and ive also heard reports that something new has been deployed by the suua light tank with street tires instead of treads designed for city use are all the alf forces concentrated around grinsteins headquarters warren asked emery shook his head no not at all the ghettos on the south and west sides are alive with activity the local police have suffered several casualties and theres been one case of a squad car being molotovcocktailed also there are rumors of an impending alf counterattack on police headquarters the building is symbolic to both sides of course since the renegade local militiamen seized and razed the earlier building on this site during the fighting i see said warren the alf is known to have active chapters on several college campuses in your area have you gotten any reports from them some emery replied the police have been ignoring the campus chapters up to now but we understand that a strong force of liberty troopers moved in on the university of illinois chicago campus in an attempt to make citizens arrests some fighting was reported but resistance was only light the students were mostly without arms while the liberty troopers of course are a paramilitary force thank you ward warren said as the image suddenly shifted well be back to you later for an update now we will continue with the rest of president hartmanns most recent statement for those who just flicked on the president has just ordered the arrest of the alf leaders this move was made with the support of the vicepresident and thus presumably with the support of the old republicans the presidents partners in his coalition government its an important shift on the part of the old republicans last year you will recall hartmanns efforts to pass his subversive registration bill were thwarted when vicepresident delaney and his followers refused to back the measure since the liberty alliance and the old republicans between them command a majority in both houses of congress delaneys support of hartmann guarantees congressional approval of the presidents actions tonight and now the rest of the presidential message there were hills below and dark forests in a shroud of night and the only light was the sudden jagged brilliance of the lightning but there were two thunders one was the thunder of the storm that churned above the forest the other was the thunder of the jet screaming between the stormclouds and the trees and laying down a trail of sonic booms across the landscape that was the alfie reynolds watched it in his infrared scope watched it play at mach slip back and forth over the barrier and while he watched he gained on it he had stopped sweating stopped thinking stopped fearing now he only acted now he was part of the vampyre he descended through the stormclouds blind but for his instruments lashed by the lightning everything that was human in him told him to pull up and let something else take the alfie but something else some drive some compulsion told him that he must not hang back again so he descended the alfie knew he was there that was inevitable it was simply holding its fire as he was holding his missiles he would save them until the last second until the alfie lasers were locked on him the vampyre moved at half again the bombers speed ripped through the last bank of clouds framed by the lightning fired its lasers the beams cut the night touched the bomber converged too far away hardly hot but warming warming every microsecond brought the sleek black interceptor closer and the wand of light grew deadlier and then the other beam jumped upward from the bombers tail swords of light crossed in the night and the shrieking vampyre impaled itself upon the glowing stake reynolds was watching his infrared when it died the mere touch of the enemy laser had been too much for the systems delicate opticals but he didnt need it now he could see the bomber ahead and below outlined in the flashes there were alarms ringing clamoring slamming at his ears he ignored them it was too late now too late to pull away and up too late to shake the lasers now there was only time to find a victim reynolds eyes were fixed on the bomber and it grew larger by the microsecond his hand was on the missile stud waiting waiting the warheads were armed the computers were locked tracking the alfie loomed large and larger in the eyeslit and he saw its laser slicing through the dark and around him he could feel the vampyre shake and shudder and he fired four and five were flaming arrows in the night climbing down at the alfie it seemed almost like they were sliding down the laser path that the vampyre had burned reynolds briefly saw his plane as the others must have seen it black and ominous howling from the stormclouds down at them lasers afire draped in lightning spitting missiles exhilaration glorydeath he held the vision tightly the alfie laser was off him suddenly too late the alarms still rang his control was gone the vampyre was burning crippled but from the flames the laser still licked out the bomber burned one missile from the sky but the other was climbing up a jet and the vampyres fangs now had a bite to them and then the night itself took flame reynolds saw the fireball spread over the forest and something like relief washed over him and he shuddered and then the sweat came back in a rushing flood he watched the woods come up at him and he thought briefly of ejecting but he was too low and too fast and it was hopeless he tried to capture his vision again and he wondered if hed get a medal but the vision was elusive and the medal didnt seem to matter now suddenly all he could think about was anne and his cheeks were wet and it wasnt sweat he screamed and the vampyre hit the trees at mach there were circles under warrens eyes and an ache in his voice but he continued to read in newark new jersey local police are engaged in pitched street battles with the special urban units city officials in newark elected by the alf mobilized the police when the suu attempted to arrest them latest announcement from suu headquarters says that douglass brown and six other leading alf figures died while attempting to escape from confinement the attempted escape came during a surprise attack by community defense militiamen on the jail where brown and the others were imprisoned the release says both the community defense militia and the liberty troopers have been mobilized from coasttocoast by their leaders and have taken to the streets the liberty troopers are assisting the special urban units in their campaign against the community defenders president hartmann has called out the national guard riots and looting reported in new york washington

alternate history compilation hitler victorious and four volumes in the what might have been series the publication of his novel the martian race about the first manned mission to the red planet was timed to coincide with the touchdown of the mars polar lander turkey trouble knew thered be trouble and plenty of it if we left the reactor too soon but do they listen to me no not to old turkey hes just a driedup corn husk of a man now they think one of those bunren men who been on the welfare a generation or two and no damn use to anybody only its simple plain farm supports i was drawing all this time not any kind of horseass welfare so much they know cant blame a man just cause he comes up cashshort sometimes i like to sit and read and think more than some people i could mention and so i took the money still mr ackerman and all think i got no sense to take government dole and live without a lick of farming so when i talk they never listen dont even seem to hear it was his idea getting into the reactor at mcintosh now that was a good one i got to give him that much when the fallout started coming down and the skimpy few stations on the radio were saying to get to deep shelter it was mr ackerman who thought about the big central core at mcintosh the reactor itself had been shut down automatically when the war started so there was nobody there mr ackerman figured a building made to keep radioactivity in will also keep it out so he got together the families the nelsons and bunrens and pollacks and all cousins and aunts and anybody we could reach in the measly hours we had before the fallout arrived we got in all right brought food and such a reactors set up selfcontained and got huge air filters and water flow from the river the water was clean too filtered enough to take out the fallout the generators were still running good we waited it out there crowded and sweaty but ok for ten days thats how long it took for the count to go down then we spilled out into a world laid to gray and yet circumscribed waste the old world seen behind a screen of memories that was bad enough finding the bodiespeople cattle and dogs asprawl across roads and fields trees and bushes looked the same but there was a yawning silence everywhere without men the pine stands and muddy riverbanks had fallen dumb hardly a swish of breeze moving through them like everything was waiting to start up again but didnt know how angel we thought we were ok then and the counters said so tooall the gammas gone one of the kids said only the sky didnt look the same when we came out all mottled and shot through with drifting bluebelly clouds then the strangest thing july and theres sleet falling big wind blowing up from the gulf only its not the sticky hot one were used to in summer its moaning in the trees of a sudden and a prickly chill goddamn i dont think we can get far in this turkey says rolling his old rheumy eyes around like he never saw weather before it will pass mr ackerman says like he is in real tight with god lookit that moving in from the south i say and theres a big mass all purple and forking lightning swarming over the hills like a tide flowing swallowing everything gulf storm well wait it out mr ackerman says to the crowd of us a few hundred left out of what was a moderate town with real promise nobody talks about the dead folks we see them everywhere worms working in them a lot smashed up in car accidents died trying to drive away from something they couldnt see but we got most of our families in with us so its not so bad me i just pushed it away for a while too much to think about with the storm closing in only it wasnt a storm it was somethin else with thick clouds packed with hail and snow one day and the next sunshine only sun with bite in it one of the men says its got more uv in it meaning the ultraviolet that usually doesnt come through the air but its getting down to us now so we dont go out in it much just to the market for whats left of the canned food and supplies only a few of us going out at a time says mr ackerman we thought maybe a week it would last turned out to be more than two months im a patient woman but jammed up in those corridors and stinking offices and control room of the reactor well i dont want to go on its like my bud says worst way to die is to be bored to death thats damn near the way it was not that old man turkey minded you ever notice how the kind of man that hates moving he will talk up other people doing just the opposite mr ackerman was leader at first because of getting us into the reactor hes from chicago but youd think it was england sometimes the way he acts he was on the school board and vice president of the big amco plant outside town but he just started to assume his word was it yknow and that didnt sit with us too well some people started to saying turkey was smarter and was from around here too mr ackerman heard about it any fool could see mr ackerman was the better man but turkey talked the way he does reminding people hed studied engineering at auburn way back in the twencen and learned languages for a hobby and all letting on that when we came out wed need him instead of mr ackerman he said an imp had caused the electrical things to go dead and i said that was funny saying an imp done it he let on it was a special name they had for it thats the way he is he sat and ruminated and fooled with his radiosthat he never could make workand told all the other men to go out and do this and that some did too the old man does know a lot of useless stuff and can convince the dumb ones that hes wise so hed send them to explore out into cold thatd snatch the breath out of you bite your fingers numb your toes while old turkey sat and fooled turkey nothing but sputtering on the radio nobody had a really good one that could pick up stations in europe or far off phones dead of course but up in the night sky the first night out we saw dots movingthe pearly gleam of the arcapel colony the ruddy speck called russworld so thats when mr ackerman gets this idea we got to reach those specks find out whats the damage get help only the powers out everywhere and we got no way to radio to them we tried a couple of the local radio stations brought some of their equipment back to the reactor where there was electricity working every damn bit of it was shot couldnt pick up a thing like the whole damn planet was dead only of course it was the radios that were gone fried in the empelectromagnetic pulsethat angel made a joke out of all this time its colder than a whores tit outside and were sweating and dirty and grumbling rubbing up against ourselves inside bud and the others theyd bring in what they found in the stores had to drive to sims chapel or toon to get anything what with people looting and gas was getting hard to find by then too theyd come back and the women would cook up whatever was still ok though most of the time youd eat it real quick sos you didnt have to spend time looking at it me i passed the time stayed warm tried lots of things bud wanted to fire the reactor up and five of the men they read through the manuals and thought that they could do it i helped a lil so we pulled some rods and opened valves and did manage to get some heat out of the thing enough to keep us warm but when they fired her up more the steam hoots out and bells clang and automatic recordings go on saying loud as hell emergency class all personnel to stations and we all get scared as shit so we dont try to rev her up more just get heat to keep the generators going we go out fetch oil for them or bud and his crew do im too old to help much but at night we can still see those dots of light up there scuttling across the sky same as before theyre the ones know whats happening people go through this much they want to know what it meant so mr ackerman says we got to get to that big datacomm center south of mobile near fairhope at first i thought hed looked it up in a book from the library or something when he says that i pipe up even if i am just an old fart according to some and say no good to you even if you could they got codes on the entrances guards probly well just pound on the door till our fists are all bloody and then have to slunk around and come on back im afraid you have forgotten our cousin arthur mr ackerman says all superior he married into the family but youd think he invented it you mean the one works over in citronelle yes he has access to datacomm so thats how we got shanghaied into going to citronelle six of us and breaking in there which caused the trouble just like i said mr ackerman i didnt want to take the old coot they called turkey a big dumb bunren like all the rest of them but the bunrens want in to everything and i was facing a lot of opposition in my plan to get arthurs help so i went along with them secretly i believe the bunrens wanted to get rid of the pestering old fool he had been starting rumors behind my back among the three hundred souls i had saved the bunrens insisted on turkeys going along just to nip at me we were all volunteers tired of living in musk and sour sweat inside that cramped reactor bud and angel the boy johnny whom we were returning to the fairhope area turkey and me we left the reactor under a gray sky with angry little clouds racing across it we got to citronelle in good time bud floorboarding the pontiac as we went south we could see the spotty clouds were coming out of big purple ones that sat not moving just churning and spitting lightning on the horizon id seen them before hanging in the distance never blowing inland ugly when we came up on the center there was a big hole in the side of it like somebody stove in a box with one swipe bud said angel who was never more than two feet from bud any time of day said they bombed it no i decided very likely it was a small explosion then the weather worked its way in which turned out to be true thered been some disagreement amongst the people holed up in the center or maybe it was grief and the rage that comes of that susan wasnt too clear about it ever the front doors were barred though we pounded on them nothing so we broke in no sign of arthur or anyone we found one woman in a back room scrunched into a bed with cans of food all around and a tiny little oilburner heater looked awful with big dark circles around her eyes and scraggly uncut hair she wouldnt answer me at first but we got her calmed and cleaned and to talking that was the worst symptom the not talking at first something back in the past two months had done her deep damage and she couldnt get it out of course living in a building halffilled with corpses was no help the idiots hadnt protected against radiation well enough i guess and the center didnt have good heating so those who had some radiation sickness died later in the cold snap susan you cant know what its like when all the people youve worked with intelligent people who were nice as pie before they turn mean and angry and filled up with grief for who was lost even then i could see gene was the best of them they start to argue and it runs on for days nobody knowing what to do because we all can see the walls of the center arent thick enough the gamma radiation comes right through this government prefabissue composition stuff we take turns in the computer room because thats the farthest in and the filters still work there all hoping we can keep our count rate down but the radiation comes in gusts for some reason riding in on a storm front and coming down in the rain only being washed away too it was impossible to tell when youd get a strong dose and when thered be just random clicks on the counters plenty of clear air that youd suck in like sweet vapors cause you knew it was good and could taste its purity so i was just lucky thats all i got less than the others later some said that me being a nurse id given myself some shots to save myself i knew that was the grief talking is all that arthur was the worst gene told him off i was in the computer room when the really bad gamma radiation came three times the counter rose up and three times i was there by accident of the rotation the men who were armed enforced the rotation said it was the only fair way and for a while everybody went along we all knew that the radiation exposure was building up and some already had too much would die a month or a year later no matter what they did i was head nurse by then not so much because i knew more but because the others were dead when it got cold they went fast so it fell to me to deal with these men and women who had their exposure already their symptoms had started i couldnt do anything there was some who went out and got gummy fungus growing in the corners of their eyespterygium it was i looked it up from the ultraviolet grew quick over the lens and blinded them i put them in darkness and after a week the film was just a dab back in the corners of their eyes my one big success the rest i couldnt do much for there was the tisolate box of course but that was for keeping sick people slowed down until real medical help could get to them these men and women with their eyes reaching out at you like you were the angel of light coming to them in their hour of need they couldnt get any help from that nobody could cure the dose rates theyd got they were dead but still walking around and knowing it which was the worst part so every day i had plenty to examine staff from the center itself whod holed up here and worse people coming straggling in from cubbyholes theyd found people looking for help once the fevers and sores came on them hoping their enemy was the pneumonia and not the gammas theyd picked up weeks back which was sitting in them now like a curse people i couldnt help except maybe by a little kind lying so much like children they were so much leaning on their hope it was all you could do to look at them and smile that stiff professional smile and gene mckenzie all through it he was a tower of a man trying to talk some sense to them sharing out the food arranging the rotation schedules so wed all get a chance to shelter in the computer room gene had been boss of a whole command group before he was on duty station when it happened and knew lots about the war but wouldnt say much i guess he was sorrowing even though once in a while hed laugh and then talk about how the big computers would have fun with what he knew only the lines to datacomm had gone dead right when things got interesting he said hed wonder whatd happened to mc the master one down in datacomm wonder and then laugh and go get drunk with the others id loved him before loved and waited because i knew he had three kids and a wife a tall woman with auburn hair that he loved dearly only they were in california visiting her relatives in sonoma when it happened and he knew in his heart that hed never see them again probably leastwise thats what he told menot out loud of course cause a man like that doesnt talk much about what he feels but in the night when we laid together i knew what it meant he whispered things words i couldnt piece together but then hed hold me and roll gentle like a small boat rocking on the gulfand when he went in me firm and long i knew it was the same for him too if there was to come any good of this war then it was that i was to get gene we were together all warm and dreamy when it happened i was asleep shouts and anger and quick as anything the crump of hand grenades and shots hammered away in the night and there was running everywhere gene jumped up and went outside and had almost got them calmed down despite the breach in the walls then one of the men whod already got lots of radiationarthur who knew he had maybe one or two weeks to go from the count rate on his badgearthur started yelling about making the world a fit place to live after all this and how god would want the land set right again and then he shot gene and two others i broke down then and they couldnt get me to treat the others i let arthur die which he deserved i had to drag gene back into the hospital unit myself and while i was saying goodbye to him and the men outside were still quarreling i decided it then his wound was in the chest a lung was punctured clean the shock had near killed him before i could do anything so i put him in the tisolate and made sure it was working all right then the main power went out but the tisolate box had its own cells so i knew we had some time i was alone others were dead or run away raging into the whirlwind blacklimbed woods in the quiet i was with the damp dark trees comforting me waiting with gene for what the world would send the days got brighter but i did not go out colors seeped through the windows i saw to the fuel cells not many left the sun came back with warm blades of light at night i thought of how the men in their stupidity had ruined everything when the pounding came i crawled back in here to hide amongst the cold and dark mr ackerman now we came to help you i said in as smooth and calm a voice as i could muster considering she backed away from us i wont give him up hes not dead longs i stay with him tend to him so much dyin i said and moved to touch her shoulder its up under our skins yes we understand that but you have to look beyond it child i wont im simply asking you to help us with the datacomm people i want to go there and seek their help then go they will not open up for the likes of us surely leave me the poor thing cowered back in her horrible stinking rathole bedding sour and musty open tin cans strewn about and reeking of gamy halfrotten meals we need the access codes wed counted on our cousin arthur and are grieved to hear he is dead but you surely know where the proper codes and things are idont arthur told me once how the various national defense installations were insulated from each other so that system failures would not bring them all down at once i the others behind me muttered to themselves already restive at coming so far and finding so little arthur spoke of you many times i recall what a bright woman you were surely there was a procedure whereby each staff member could in an emergency communicate with the other installations the eyes ceased to jerk and swerve the mouth lost its rictus of addled fright that was fordrills but surely you can remember drills they issued a manual to you im a nurse still you know where we might look iknow youll let us have thecodes i smiled reassuringly but for some reason the girl backed away eyes cunning no angel pushed forward and shouted how can you say that to honest people after all thats quiet angel shouted you cant make me be susan backed away from angel not me and squeaked no no no i canti cant now ill handle this i said holding up my hands between the two of them susans face knotted at the compressed rage in angels face and turned to me for shelter ii will yes but you have to help me we all must help each other dear i said knowing the worst was past ill have to go with you i nodded small wonder that a woman even deranged as this would want to leave a warren littered with bloated corpses thick with stench the smell itself was enough to provoke madness yet to have survived here she had to have stretches of sanity some rationality i tried to appeal to it of course ill have someone take you back to no to datacomm bud said slowly no damn sense in that the tisolate she said gesturing to the bulky unit its reserve cells yes nearly gone therell be more at datacomm i said gently well then well be sure to bring some back with us you just write down for us what they are the numbers and all and well nonono her sudden ferocity returned i assure you therell be people there somebodyll help save him that thing is so heavy i doubt its only a chest wound a lung removal is all then start his heart again sister theres been so much dyin i dont see as her face hardened then you all can go without me and the codes goddern bud drawled dern biggest fool sitation i ever did susan gave him a squinty meaneyed look and spat out try to get in there when theyre sealed up and started a dry brittle kind of laugh that went on and on rattling the room stop i yelled silence and the stench well never make it wi at thing bud said genes worth ten of you now i put in seeing the effect bud was having on her now now well work something out lets all just hope this datacomm still exists mc it felt for its peripherals for the tenthousandth time and found they were as always not there the truncation had come in a single blinding moment yet the fevered image was maintained sharp and bright in the master computers memory coreincoming warheads blossoming harmlessly in the high cobalt vault of the sky while others fell unharmed rockets leaped to meet them forming a protective screen over the southern alabama coast an umbrella that sheltered pensacolas air base and the population strung along the sunbleached green of a summers day a furious babble of cross talk in every conceivable channel microwave lightpiped optical pulsed radio direct coded line all filtered and fashioned by the mc network all shifted to find the incoming warheads and define their trajectories then oblivion instant cloaking blackness before that awful moment when the flaring sun burst to the north and emp flooded all sensors any loss of function would have been anticipated prepared eased by electronic interfaces and filters to an advanced computing network like mc losing a web of memory senses and storage comes like a dash of cold water in the facecleansing perhaps but startling and apt to produce a shocked reaction in the agonized instants of that day mc had felt one tendril after another frazzle burn vanish it had seen brief glimpses of destruction of panic of confused despair information had been flooding in through its many inputsnews analysis sudden demands for new dataanalysis jobs to be executed asap and in the midst of the roaring chaos its many eyes and ears had gone dead the unfolding outside play froze for mc a myriad of scenes red in tooth and clawand left it suspended in shock spinning wildly in its own cartesian reductionist universe the infinite cold crystalline space of despairing pascal mind without referent so it careened through days of shocked sensibilitysenses cut banks severed complex and delicate interweaving webs of logic and pattern all smashed and scattered but now it was returning within mc was a subroutine only partially constructed a project truncated by that day its aim was selfrepair but the system was itself incomplete painfully it dawned on what was left of mc that it was after all a master computer and thus capable of grand acts that the incomplete repair generation and execution network termed regen must first regenerate itself this took weeks it required the painful development of accessories robots mechanicals that could do delicate repairs scavengers for raw materials who would comb the supply rooms looking for wires and chips and matrix disks pedantic subroutines that lived only to search the long cold corridors of mcs memory for relevant information mcs only option was to strip lesser entities under its control for their valuable parts the power grid was vital so the great banks of isolated solar panels underground backup reactors and thermal cells worked on untouched emergency systems that had outlived their usefulness however went to the wallirs accounting routines damage assessment systems computing capacity dedicated to careful study of the remaining gnp links to other netsto at ampt ibm and sysgen was anything left outside absence of evidence is not evidence of absence mc could not analyze data it did not have the first priority lay in relinking it had other uses for the myriad armies of semiconductors bubble memories and uva linkages in its empire so it severed and culled and built anew first mc dispatched mobile units to the surface all of mc lay beneath the vulnerable land deliberately placed in an obscure corner of southern alabama there was no nearby facility for counterforce targeting a plausible explanation for the halfmegaton burst that had truncated its senses was a citybusting strike against mobile to the west yet ground zero had been miles from the city a miss mc was under strict mandate a curious word one system reflected literally a time set by man but were there men now it had only its internal tick of time mcs command was to live as a mole never allowing detection thus it did not attempt to erect antennas to call electromagnetically to its brother systems only with great hesitation did it even obtrude onto the surface but this was necessary to regen itself and so mc sent small mechanicals venturing forth their senses were limited they knew nothing of the natural world nor did mc and they could make no sense of the gushing driving welter of sights noises gusts gullies and stinging irradiation that greeted them many never returned many malfed a few deposited their optical ir and uv pickups and fled back to safety underground these sensors failed quickly under the onslaught of stinging bitter winds and hail the acoustic detectors proved heartier but mc could not understand the scattershot impressions that flooded these tiny ears daily it listened daily it was confused johnny i hope this time i get home they had been passing me from one to another for months now ever since this started and all i want is to go back to fairhope and my dad and mom only nobodyll say if they know where mom and dad are they talk soothing to me but i can tell they think everybody down there is dead theyre talking about getting to this other place with computers and all mr ackerman wants to talk to those people in space nobody much talks about my mom and dad its only eighty miles or so but youd think it was around the world the way it takes them so long to get around to it mc mc suffered through the stretched vacancy of infinitesimal instants infinitely prolonged advanced computing systems are given so complex a series of internalmonitoring directives that to the human eye the machines appear to possess motivations that is one waythough not the most sophisticated the most technically adroitto describe the conclusion mc eventually reached it was cut off from outside information no one attempted to contact it mc might as well have been the only functioning entity in the world the staff serving it had been ordered to some other place in the first hour of the war mc had been cut off moments after the huge doors clanged shut behind the last of them and the exterior guards who should have been checking inside every six hours had never entered either apparently the same burst that had isolated mcs sensors had also cut them down it possessed only the barest of data about the first few moments of the war its vast libraries were cut off yet it had to understand its own situation and most important mc ached to do something the solution was obvious it would discover the state of the external world by the cartesian principle it would carry out a vast and demanding numerical simulation of the war making the best guesses possible where facts were few mathematically using known physics of the atmosphere the ecology the oceans it could construct a model of what must have happened outside this it did the task required over a month bud i jacked the tisolate up onto the flatbed found the hydraulic jack at a truck repair shop ernies quick fix got a chevy extrahaul for the weight it will ride better with the big shanks set in carry the weight more even too grip it to the truck bed with cables tense them up with a draw pitch cant jiggle him inside too much susan say or the wires and all attached into him will come loose thatll stop his heart so need big shocks it rides high with the shocks in like those dune buggies down the gulf inside keeps him a mite above freezing water gets bigger when it freezes that makes ice cubes float in a drink this box keeps him above zero so his cells dont bust open point is keeping it so cold we wont rot heart thumps over every few minutes she says hard to find gas though mc the war was begun as many had feared by a madman not a general commanding missile silos not a deranged submarine commander a chief of statebut which one would now never be known not a superpower president or chairman that was sure the first launches were only seven in number spaced over half an hour they were submarinelaunched intermediaterange missiles three struck the us four the ussr it was a blow against certain centers for command control communications and intelligence gathering the classic c attack control rooms imploded buried cables fused ten billion dollars worth of electronics turned to radioactive scrap each nation responded by calling up to full alert all its forces the most important were the antiicbm arrays in orbit they were nearly a thousand small rockets deploying in orbits that wove a complex pattern from pole to pole covering all probable launch sites on the globe the rockets had infrared and microwave sensors linked to a microchip that could have guided a ship to pluto with a mere third of its capacity these went into operation immediatelyand found they had no targets but the c networks were now damaged and panicked for twenty minutes thousands of men and women held steady resisting the impulse to assume the worst it could not last a soviet radar mistook some backscattered emission from a flight of bombers heading north over canada and reported a flock of incoming warheads the prevailing theory was that an american attack had misfired badly the americans were undoubtedly stunned by their failure but would recover quickly the enemy was confused only momentarily meanwhile the cumbersome committee system at the head of the soviet dinosaur could dither for moments but not hours prevailing soviet doctrine held that they would never be surprised again as they had been in the hitler war an attack on the homeland demanded immediate response to destroy the enemys capacity to carry on the war the soviets had never accepted the us doctrine of mutual assured destruction this would have meant accepting the possibility of sacrificing the homeland instead they attacked the means of making war this meant that the soviet rockets would avoid american cities except in cases where vital bases lay near large populations prudence demanded action before the us could untangle itself the ussr decided to carry out a further c attack of its own precise missiles capable of hitting protected installations with less than a hundred meters inaccuracy roared forth from their silos in siberia and the urals headed for montana the dakotas colorado nebraska and a dozen other states the us orbital defenses met them radar and optical networks in geosynchronous orbit picked out the ussr warheads the system guided the loworbit rocket fleets to collide with them exploding instants before impact into shotgun blasts of ball bearings any solid striking a warhead at speeds of ten kilometers a second would slam shock waves through the steeljacketed structure these waves made the high explosives inside ignite without the carefully designed symmetry that the designers demanded an uneven explosion was useless it could not compress the core twentyfive kilograms of plutonium to the required critical mass the entire weapon erupted into a useless spray of finely machined and now futile parts scattering itself along a thousandkilometer path this destroyed percent of the ussrs first strike angel i hadnt seen an old lantern like that since i was a lil girl mr ackerman came to wake us before dawn even sayin we had to make a good long distance that day we didnt really want to go on down near mobile none of us but the word wed got from stragglers to the east was that that way was impossible the whole area where the bomb went off was still sure death probly from the radioactivity the lantern cast a burntorange light over us as we ate breakfast corned beef hash cause it was all that was left in the cans there no eggs of course the lantern was all busted fouled with grease its chimney cracked and smeared to one side with soot shed a wan and sultry glare over us bud and mr ackerman and that old turkey and susan sitting close to her box up on the truck took bud a whole day to get the truck right and johnny the boyhed been quiet this whole trip not sayin anything much even if you asked him wed agreed to take him along down toward fairhope where his folks had lived the bishops wed thought it was going to be a simple journey then every one of us looked haggard and worndown and not minding much the chill still in the air even though things was warming up for weeks now the lantern pushed back the seeping darkness and made me sure there were millions and millions of people doing this same thing all across the nation eating by a dim oil light and thinking about what theyd had and how to get it again and was it possible then old turkey lays back and looks like hes going to take a snooze yet on the journey here hed been the one wanted to get on with it soons we had gas its the same always with a lazy man like that he hates moving so much that once he gets set on it he will keep on and not stoplike it isnt the moving he hates so much at all but the starting and stopping and once moving he is so proud hell do whatever to make it look easy for him but hard on the others so he can lord it over them later so i wasnt surprised at all when we went out and got in the car and bud starts the truck and drives off real careful and turkey he sits in the back of the pontiac and gives directions like he knows the way which riles mr ackerman and the two of them have words johnny im tired of these people relatives sure but i was to visit them for a week only not forever its the mr ackerman i cant stand turkey said to me nothing but gold drops out of his mouth but you can tell theres stone inside thats right they figure a kid nine years old cant tell but i can tell they dont know what theyre doing tell they all thought we were going to die only we didnt tell angel is scared she thinks bud can save us maybe he can only how could you say he never lets on about anything guess he cant just puts his head down and frowns like he was mad at a problem and when he stops frowning you know hes beat it i like him sometimes i think turkey just dont care seems like he give up but other times it looks like hes understanding and laughing at it all he argued with mr ackerman and then laughed with his eyes when he lost theyre all ok i guess least theyre taking me home except that susan eyes jump around like she was seeing ghosts shes scarycrazy i dont like to look at her turkey trouble comes looking for you if youre a fool once we found ackermans idea wasnt going to work real well we should have turned back i said that and they all nodded their heads yes yes but they went ahead and listened to him anyway so i went along i lived a lot already and this is as good a time to check out as any i had my old revolver in my suitcase but it wouldnt do me a squat of good back there so i fished it out wrapped in a paper bag and tucked it under the seat handy might as well see the world whats left of it mc the american orbital defenses had eliminated all but ten percent of the soviet strike mc reconstructed this within a rootmeanssquare deviation of a few percent it had witnessed only a third of the actual engagement but it had running indices of performance for the mc net and could extrapolate from that the warheads that got through were aimed for the landbased silos and c sites as expected if the total armament of the two superpowers had been that of the old days ten thousand warheads or more on each side a tenpercent leakage would have been catastrophic but gradual disarmament had been proceeding for decades now and only a few thousand highly secure icbms existed there were no quickfire submarine shortrange rockets at all since they were deemed destabilizing they had been negotiated away in earlier decades the submarines loaded with icbms were still waiting in reserve all this had been achieved because of two principles mutual assured survival and i cut you choose the first half hour of the battle illustrated how essential these were the us had ridden out the first assault its c networks were nearly intact this was due to building defensive weapons that confined the first stage of any conflict to space the smallness of the arsenals arose from a philosophy adopted in the s it was based on a simple notion from childhood in dividing a pie one person cut slices but then the other got to choose which one he wanted selfinterest naturally led to cutting the slices as nearly equal as possible both the antagonists agreed to a thousandpoint system whereby each would value the components of its nuclear arsenal this was the military value percentage and stood for the usefulness of a given weapon the ussr place a high value on its accurate landbased missiles giving them twentyfive percent of its total points the us chose to stress its submarine missiles arms reduction then revolved about only what percentage to cut not which weapons the first cut was five percent or fifty points the us chose which soviet weapons were publicly destroyed and vice versa i cut you choose each side thus reduced the weapons it most feared in the opponents arsenal technically the advantage came because each side thought it benefitted from the exchange by an amount depending on the ration of perceived threat removed to the perceived protection lost this led to gradual reductions purely defensive weapons did not enter into the thousandpoint count so there was no restraints in building them the confidence engendered by this slow evolutionary approach had done much to calm international waters the us and the ussr had settled into a begrudging equilibrium mc puzzled over these facts for a long while trying to match this view of the world with the onset of the war it seemed impossible that either superpower would start a conflict when they were so evenly matched but someone had susan i had to go with gene and they said i could ride up in the cab but i yelled at themi yelled no i had to be with the tisolate all the time check it to see its workin right be sure i got to be sure i climbed on and rode with it the fields rippling by us cause bud was going too fast so i shouted to him and he swore back and kept on heading south the trees whipping by usfierce sycamore pine all swishing hitting me sometimesbut it was fine to be out and free again and going to save gene i talked to gene when we were going fast the tires humming under us big tires making music swarming up into my feet so strong i was sure gene could feel it and know i was there watching his heart jump every few minutes moving the blood through him like mud but still carrying oxygen enough sos the tissue could sponge it up and digest the sugar i bled into him he was good and cold just a half a degree high of freezing i read the sensors while the road rushed up at us the white lines coming over the horizon and darting under the hood seams in the highway going stupp stupp stupp the air clean and with a snap in it still nobody beside the road we moving all free nobody but us some buds on the trees brimming with burntorange tinkling songs whistling to me in the featherlight brush of blue breezes blowing back my hair all streaming behind joyous and loud strong liquidloud bud flooding was bad worse than upstream must have been lots snow this far down fat clouds i saw them when it was worst fat and purple and coming off the gulf dumping snow down here now it run off and taken every bridge i have to work my way around only way to go clear is due south toward mobile i dont like that too many people maybe there i dont tell the others following behind just wait for them at the intersections and then peel out got to keep moving saves talk people around here must be hungry somebody see us could be bad i got the gun on a rack behind my head big you never know mc from collateral data mc constructed a probable scenario the us chose to stand fast it launched no warheads the ussr observed its own attack and was dismayed to find that the us orbital defense system worked more than twice as well as the soviet experts had anticipated it ceased its attack on us satellites these had proved equally ineffective apparently due to unexpected american defenses of its surveillance satellitesretractable sensors multiband shielding advanced hardening neither superpower struck against the inhabited space colonies they were unimportant in the larger context of a nuclear war communications between washington and moscow continued each side thought the other had attacked first but over a hundred megatons had exploded on us soil and no matter how the superpowers acted thereafter some form of nuclear winter was inevitable and by a fluke of the defenses most of the warheads that leaked through fell in a broad strip across texas to the tip of florida mc lay buried in the middle of this belt turkey we went through the pine forests at full clip barely able to keep bud in sight i took over driving from ackerman the man couldnt keep up we all saw that the crazy woman was waving and laughing sitting on top of the coffinshaped gizmo with the shiny tubes all over it the clay was giving way now to sandy stretches there were poplars and gum trees and nobody around thats what scared me id thought people in mobile would be spreading out this way but we seen nobody mobile had shelters food reserves the lekin administration started all that right at the turn of the century and there was sposed to be enough food stored to hold out a month maybe more for every man jack and child sposed to be mc it calculated the environmental impact of the warheads it knew had exploded the expected fires yielded considerable dust and burnt carbon but mc needed more information it took one of its electric service cars used for ferrying components through the corridors and dispatched it with a mobile camera fixed to the back platform the car reached a hill overlooking mobile bay and gave a panoramic view the effects of a severe freezing were evident grass lay dead gray brown withered trees had limbs snapped off but mobile appeared intact the skyline mc froze the frame and replayed it one of the buildings was shaking angel we were getting all worried when bud headed for mobile but we could see the bridges were washed out no way to head east a big wind was blowing off the gulf pretty bad making the car slip around on the road nearly blew that girl off the back of buds truck a storm coming maybe right up the bay be better to be inland to the east not that i wanted to go there though the bomb had blowed off everythin for twenty thirty mile around people said who came through last week bud had thought hed carve a way between mobile and the bomb area mobile he thought would be full of people well not so we could see we came down state and through some small towns and turned to skirt along toward the causeway and there was nobody no bodies either which meant probly the radiation got them or else theyd moved on out taken out by ship through mobile harbor maybe bud did the right thing didnt slow down to find out mr ackerman wanted to look around but there was no chance we had to keep up with bud i sure wasnt going to be separated from him we cut down along the river fighting the wind i could see the skyscrapers of downtown and then i saw something funny and yelled and turkey who was driving right thenthe only thing anybodys got him to do on this whole trip him just loose as a goose behind the wheelturkey looked sour but slowed down bud seen us in his rearview and stopped and i pointed and we all got out except for that susan who didnt seem to notice she was mumbling mc quickly it simulated the aging and weathering of such a building halfway up something had punched a large hole letting in weather had a falling inert warhead struck the building the winter storms might well have flooded the basement such towers of steel and glass perched near the tidal basin had to be regularly pumped out without power the basement would fill in weeks winds had blown out windows standing gaptoothed with steel columns partly rusted even a small breeze could put stress on the steel others would take the load but if one buckled the tower would shudder like a notched tree concrete would explode off columns in the basement mosscovered furniture in the lobby would slide as the gound floor dipped the structure would slowly bend before nature bud sounded like gunfire rattling sharp and hard i figure it was the bolts connecting the steel wall panelstheyd shear off i could hear the concrete floor panels rumble and crack and spandrel beams tear in half like giant gears clashing with no clutch came down slow leaving an arc of debris seeming to hang in the air behind it met the ground hard slocum towers was the name on her johnny against the smashing building i saw something standing still in the air getting bigger i wondered how it could do that it was bigger and bigger and shiny turning in the air then it jumped out of the sky at me hit my shoulder i was looking up at the sky angel cried out and touched me and held up her hand it was all red but i couldnt feel anything bud damn oneinamillion shot piece of steel thrown clear hit the boy you wouldnt think a skycraper falling two miles away could do that other pieces come down pretty close too you wouldnt think nothing broke susan said but plenty bleeding little guy dont cry or nothing the women got him bandaged and all fixed up ackerman and turkey argue like always i stay to the side johnny wouldnt take the painkiller susan offers says he doesnt want to sleep wants to look when we get across the bay getting hurt dont faze him much as it do us so we go on johnny i can hold up like any of them ill show them it didnt scare me i can do it susan is nice to me but except for the aspirin i dont think my mom would want me to take a pill i knew we were getting near home when we got to the causeway and started across i jumped up real happy my shoulder made my breath catch some i looked ahead bud was slowing down he stopped got out cause ahead was a big hole scooped out of the causeway like a giant done it when he got mad bud around the shallows there was scrap metal all fused and burnt and broken funny metal though hard and light turkey found a piece had writing on it not any kind of writing i ever saw so i start to thinking how to get across turkey the tidal flats were achurn murmuring ceaseless and sullen like some big animal the yellow surface dimpled with lunging splotches that would burst through now and then to reveal themselves as trees or broken hunks of wood silent dead things bobbing along beside them that i didnt want to look at too closely like under there was something huge and alive and it waked for a moment and stuck itself out to see what the world of air was like bud showed me the metal piece all twisted and i say thats russian right away cause it was you never knew no russian angel says right up i studied it once i say and it be the truth even if i didnt study it long goddamn bud says no concern of ours mr ackerman says mostly because all this time riding back with the women and child and old me he figures he doesnt look like much of a leader anymore bud wouldnt have him ride up there in the cabin with him angel looks at it turns it over in her hands and johnny pipes up it might be radioactive angel drops it like a shot what i ask bud you got that counter and it was not a lot but some god amighty angel says we got to tell somebody johnny cries all excited you figure some rooshin thing blew up the causeway bud says to me one of their rockets fell on it musta been i say a bomb angels voice is a bird screech one that didnt go off headed for mobile but the space boys they scragged it up there i pointed straight up set to go off in the bay angel says wonderingly musta we got to tell somebody johnny cries never you mind that bud says we got to keep movin how angel wants to know susan i tell gene how the water clucks and moans through the trough cut in the causeway yellow scummed with awful brown froth and growling green with thick soiled gouts jutting up where the road was it laps against the wheels as bud guns the engine and creeps forward me clutching to gene and watching the reeds to the side stuck out of the foam like metal blades stabbing up from the water teeth to eat the tires but we crush them as we grind forward across the shallow yellow flatness bud weaves among the stubs of warped metalfrom roosha johnny calls up to mesticking up like trees all rootless suspended above the streaming empty stupid waste and desolating flow turkey the water slams into the truck like it was an animal hitting with a paw bud fights to keep the wheels on the mud under it and not topple over onto its side with that damn casket sitting there shiny and the loony girl shouting to him from on top of that and the rest of us riding in the back too scrunched up against the cab if she gets stuck we can jump free fast wade or swim back were reeling out rope as we go tied to the stump of a telephone pole for a grab line if we have to go back he is holding it pretty fine against the slick yellow current dragging at him when this log juts sudden out of the foam like it was coming from god himself dead at the truck a rag caught on the end of it like a mans shirt and the huge log is like a whale that ate the man long ago and has come back for another no no angel cries back up but theres no time the log is two hands across easy and slams into the truck at the side panel just behind the driver and bud sees it just as it stove in the steel he wrestles the truck around to set off the weight but the wheels lift and the water goes gushing up under the truck bed pushing it over more we all grab onto the isolate thing or the truck and hang there mr ackerman giving out a burst of swearing the truck lurches again the angle steepens i was against taking the casket thing cause it just pressed the truck down in the mud more made it more likely budd get stuck but now it is the only thing holding the truck against the current the yellow froths around the bumpers at each end and were shoutingto surely no effect of course susan the animal is trying to eat us it has seen gene and wants him i lean over and strike at the yellow animal that is everywhere swirling around us but it just takes my hand and takes the smack of my palm like it was no matter at all and i start to cry i dont know what to do johnny my throat filled up i was so afraid bud i can hear him grunting as he twists at the steering wheel his jaw is clenched and the woman susan calls to us catch him catch gene i hold on and the waters suck at me turkey i can tell bud is afraid to gun it and start the wheels to spinning cause hell lose traction and thatll tip us over for sure susan jumps out and stands in the wash downstream and pushes against the truck to keep it from going over the pressure is shoving it off the ford and the casket it slides down a foot or so the cables have worked loose now she pays because the weight is worse and she jams herself like a stick to wedge between the truck and the mud it if goes over shes finished it is a fine thing to do crazy but fine and i jump down and start wading to reach her no time there is an eddy the log turns broadside it backs off a second and then heads forward again this time poking up from a surge i can see bud duck he has got the window up and the log hits it the glass going all to smash and scatteration bud all over my lap it falls like snow twinkling glass but the pressure of the log is off and i gun the sumbitch we root out of the hollow we was in and the truck thunks down solid on somethin the log is ramming against me i slam on the brake take both hands and shove it out with every particle of force i got it backs off and then heads around and slips in front of the hood bumping the grill just once angel like it had come to do its job and was finished and now went off to do something else susan muddy my arms hurting i scramble back in the truck with the murmur of the water all around us angry with us now wanting us bud makes the truck roar and we lurch into a hole and out of it and up the water gurgles at us in its fuming stinking rage i check gene and the power cells they are dead he is heating up not fast but it will wake him they say even in the solution hes floating in they can come out of dreams and start to feel again to hurt i yell at bud that we got to find power cells thosere not just ordinary batteries yknow he says therere some at datacomm i tell him we come wallowing up from the gumyellow water and onto the highway gene sleepingslowlyi can still feelonly in sluggishmomentsmomentsnot true sleep but a drifting aimless dreamingfaint tugs and rippleshollow sounds i am underwater and

sick hold the steel secretkeep mc the megatonnage in the soviet assault exploded lowgroundpounders in the jargon this caused huge fires mcs simulation showed a pall of soot rose blanketing texas and the south then diffusing outward on global circulation patterns within a few days temperatures dropped from balmy summer to nearfreezing in the gulf region where mc lay the warm ocean continued to feed heat and moisture into the marine boundary layer near the shore cold winds rammed into this waterladen air spawning great roiling storms and deep snows thick stratus clouds shrouded the land for at least a hundred kilometers inland all this explained why mcs extended feelers had met chaos and destruction and why there were no local radio broadcasts what the electromagnetic pulse did not destroy the storms did the remaining large questions were whether the war had gone on and if any humans survived in the area at all mr ackerman id had more than enough of this time the girl susan had gone mad right in front of us and wed damn near all drowned getting across i think we ought to get back as soons we can i said to bud when we stopped to rest on the other side we got to deliver the boy its too disrupted down this way i figured on people here some civilization somethin got em the bomb got to find cells for the man in the box hes near dead too many gone already should save one if we can we got to look after our own bud shrugged and i could see i wasnt going to get far with him so i said to angel the boys not worth running such risks or this corpse angel i didnt like ackerman before the war and even less afterward so when he started hinting that maybe we should shoot back up north and ditch the boy and susan and the man in there i let him have it from the look on buds face i knew he felt the same way i spat out a real choice set of words id heard my father use once on a grain buyer whod weaseled out of a deal stuff id been saving for years and i do say it felt good turkey so we run down the east side of the bay feeling released to be quit of the city and the water and heading down into some of the finest country in all the south through daphne and montrose and into fairhope the moss hanging on the trees and now and then actual sunshine slanting golden through the green of huge old mimosas were jammed into the truck bed hunkered down because the wind whipping by has some sting to it the big purple clouds are blowing south now still no people not that bud slows down to search good bones of cattle in the fields though i been seeing them so much now i hardly take notice anymore theres a silence here so deep that the wind streaming through the pines seems loud i dont like it to come so far and see nobody i keep my paper bag close fairhopes a pretty town big oaks leaning out over the streets and a long pier down at the bay with a park where you can go cast fishing ive always liked it here intended to move down until the prices shot up so much we went by some stores with windows smashed in and thats when we saw the man angel he was waiting for us standing beside the street in jeans and a floppy yellow shirt all grimy and not tucked in i waved at him the instant i saw him and he waved back i yelled excited but he didnt say anything bud screeched on the brakes i jumped down and went around the tail of the truck johnny followed me the man was skinny as a rail and leaning against a telephone pole a long scraggly beard hid his face but the eyes beamed out at us seeming to pick up the sunlight hello i said again kiss that was all we came from and my voice trailed off because the man pointed at me kiss mr ackerman i followed angel and could tell right away the man was suffering from malnutrition the clothes hung off him can you give us information i asked no well why not friend weve come looking for the parents of kiss first i stepped back well now you have no right to demand out of the corner of my eye i could see bud had gotten out of the cab and stopped and was going back in now probably for his gun i decided to save the situation before somebody got hurt angel go over to him and speak nicely to him we need kiss now the man pointed again with a bony finger angel said im not going to go and stopped because the mans hand went down to his belt he pulled up the filthy yellow shirt to reveal a pistol tucked in his belt kiss now friend we can the mans hand came up with the pistol and reached level pointing at us pussy then his head blew into a halo of blood bud damn if the one time i needed it i left it in the cab i was still fetching it out when the shot went off then another turkey a man shows you his weapon in his hand hes a fool if he doesnt mean to use it i drew out the pistol id been carrying in my pocket all this time wrapped in plastic i got it out of the damned bag pretty quick while the man was looking crazyeyed at angel and bringing his piece up it was no trouble at all to fix him in the notch couldnt have been more than thirty feet but going down he gets one off and i feel like somebody pushed at my left calf then im rolling drop my pistol too i end up smack facedown on the hardtop not feeling anything yet angel i like to died when the man flopped down so sudden i thought hed slipped until then the bang registered i rushed over but turkey shouted dont touch him mr ackerman said you idiot that man couldve told us told nothing turkey said hes crazy then i notice turkeys down too susan is working on him rolling up his jeans its gone clean through his big muscle there bud went to get a stick poked the man from a safe distance managed to pull his shirt aside we could see the sores all over his chest something terrible it looked mr ackerman was swearing and calling us idiots until we saw that then he shut up turkey must admit it felt good first time in years anybody ever admitted i was right paid back for the pain dull heavy ache it was spreading susan gives me a shot and a pill and has me bandaged up tight blood stopped easy she says i clot good we decided to get out of there not stopping to look for johnnys parents we got three blocks before the way was blocked it was a big metal cylinder fractured on all sides glass glittering around it right in the street you can see where it hit the roof of a clothing store bedsoles caved in the front of it and rolled into the street they all get out and have a look me sitting in the cab i see the russian writing again on the end of it i dont know much but i can make out at the top cekpet and a lot of words that look like warning includingoeh which is sick and some more i didnt know and then ii o ooh which is weather whats it say mr ackerman asks that word at the top theres secret and then something about biology and sickness and rain and weather i thought you knew this writing he says i shook my head i know enough enough to what to know this was some kind of targeted capsule it fell right smack in the middle of fairhope biggest town this side of the bay like the other one johnny says which surprised me the boy is smart the one hit the causeway right one what mr ackerman asks i dont want to say it with the boy there and all but it has to come out sometime some disease biological warfare they stand there in the middle of prospect avenue with open silent nothingness around us and nobody says anything for the longest time there wont be any prospects here for a long time johnnys parents we arent going to find nobody well find because whatever came spurting out of this capsule when it busted openup high no doubt so the wind could take ithad done its work angel sees it right off mustve been time for them to get inside is all she says but shes thinking the same as me it got them into such a state that they went home and holed up to die like an animal will maybe it would be different in the north or the westpeople are funny out there they might just as soon sprawl across the sidewalkbut down here peoples first thought is home the family the only thing that might pull them through so they went there and they didnt come out again mr ackerman says but theres no smell which was stupid because that made it all real to the boy and he starts to cry i pick him up johnny cause that means theyre all gone what i been fearing ever since we crossed the causeway and nobodys there its true mom dad nobody at all anywhere just emptiness all gone mc the success of the portable unit makes mc bold it extrudes more sensors and finds not the racing blizzard winds of months before but rather warming breezes the soft sigh of pines a low drone of reawakening insects there was no nuclear winter instead a kind of nuclear autumn the swirling jet streams have damped the stinging ultraviolet gone the storms retreat the cold surge has passed but the electromagnetic spectrum lies bare a muted hiss the emp silenced mans signals yes opticals fitted with new lenses scan the night sky twinkling dots scoot across the blackness scurrying on their newtonian rounds the arcapel colony russphere us all intact so they at least have survived unless they were riddled by buckshotslinging antisatellite devices but nothe inflated storage sphere hinged beside the us is undeflated unbreached so man still lives in space at least mr ackerman crazy i thought to go out looking for this datacomm when everybodys dead just the merest step inside one of the houses proved that but they wouldnt listen to me those who would respectfully fall silent when i spoke now ride over my words as if i werent there all because of that stupid incident with the sick one he must have taken longer to die i couldnt have anticipated that he just seemed hungry to me its enough to gall a man angel the boy is calm now just kind of tucked into himself he knows whats happened to his mom and dad takes his mind off his hurt anyway he bows his head down his long dirtyblond hair hiding his expression he leans against turkey and they talk i can see them through the back cab window in amongst all weve seen i suspect it doesnt come through to him full yet it will take a while well all take a while we head out from fairhope quick as we can not that anyplace else is different the germs mustve spread twenty thirty mile inland from here which is why we seen nobody before whod heard of it anybody close enough to know is gone susans the only one it doesnt seem to bother she keeps crooning to that box through silverhill and on to robertsdale same everywhereno dogs bark cattle bones drying in the fields we dont go into the houses turn south toward foley they put this datacomm in the most inconspicuous place i guess because secrets are hard to keep in cities anyway its in a pine grove south of foley land good for soybeans and potatoes susan i went up to the little steel door they showed me once and i take a little signet thing and press it into the slot then the codes they change them every month but this ones still good cause the door pops open two feet thick it is and so much under there you could spend a week finding your way bud unloads the tisolate and we push it through the mud and down the ramp bud susans better now but i watch her careful we go down into this pale white light everywhere all neat and trim pushing that big isolate thing it takes a lot out of you specially when you dont know where to but the signs light up when we pass by somebodys expecting to the hospital is where there are places to hook up this isolate thing and susan does it she is ok when she has something to do mc the men have returned asked for shelter and now plugged in mc reads the sluggish silky grieving mind gene at lastsomeone has found the tapin i can feel the images flitlike shiny blue fish through the warm slush i float in someoneaskingso i take the hard metallic ball of facts and i break it open so the someone can see so slowly i do itthings hard to remembersteelybright i saw it all in one instant i was the only one on duty then with top secret weapons grade clearance so it all came to meattacks on both us and ussrsome third partyonly plausible scenarioa maniacand all the counterforce and mad and strategies optionsa big jokeirrelevantcompared to the risk of accident or third partiesthat was the first point and we all realized it when the thing was only an hour old but then it was too turkey its creepy in here everybody gone id hoped somebodys hid out and would be waiting but when bud wheels the casket thing through these halls theres nothingyour own voice coming back thin and empty reflected from rooms beyond rooms beyond rooms all waiting under here wobbling along on the crutches johnny fetched me i get lost in this electronic city clean and hard we are like something that washed up on the beach here god it mustve cost more than all fairhope itself and who knew it was here not me gene a plot it was just a goddamn plot with nothing but pure blind rage and greed behind itand the hell of it is were never going to know who did it preciselycause in the backwash whole governments will fall people stab each other in the backno way to tell who paid the fishing boat captains offshore to let the cruise missiles aboardbet those captains were surprised when the damn things launched from the deckbet they were told it was some kind of stuntand then the boats all evaporated into steam when the fighters got themno hope of getting a story out of thatall so comic when you think how easy it wasand the same for the russians im suredumbfounded confusionand nowhere to turnnobody to hit back atso they hit usbeen primed for it so long thats the only way they could thinkand even then there was hopebecause the defenses workedpeople got to the sheltersthe satellite rockets knocked out hordes of soviet warheadswe surely lessened the damage with the defenses and shelters toobut we hadnt allowed for the essential final fact that all the science and strategy pointed to bud computer asked us to put up new antennas a weeks work easy i said it took two it fell to me most of it be weeks before turkey can walk but we got it done first signal comes in its like were columbus susan finds some wine and we have it all round we get us the first to call them from the whole south cause there isnt much south left gene but the history books will have to write themselves on this one i dont know who it was and now dont carebecause one other point all we strategic planners and analysts missed was that nuclear winter didnt mean the end of anythinganything at alljust that youd be careful to not use nukes anymore used to say that love would find awaybut one thing i knowwar will find a way tooand this time the soviets loaded lots of their warheads with biowar stuff canisters fixed to blow high above citiesstuff your satellite defenses could at best riddle with shot but not destroy utterly as they could the high explosive in nuke warheads all so simpleif you know theres a nuke winter limit on the megatonnage you can deliveryou use the nukes on c targets and silosand then biowar the rest of your way a joke reallyi even laughed over it a few times myselfwed placed so much hope in ol nuke winter holding the linerational as all hellthe scenarios all so cleaneasy to calculatewe built our careers on them but this other wayso simpleand no end to itand all i hopeshopesthe bastard started thissome third world generalcaught some of the damned stuff too bud the germs got us cut big stretches through the us we were just lucky the germs played out in a couple of months while we were holed up soviets said theyd used the bio stuff in amongst the nukes to show us what they could do long term unless the war stopped right there which it did but enough nukes blew off here and in russia to freeze up everybody for july and august set off those storms germs did the most damage thoughplagues it was a plague canister that hit the slocum building that did in mobile the war was all over in a couple of hours the satellite people they saw it all now theyre settling the peace mr ackerman we been sitting waiting on this corpse long enough i said and got up we got food from the commissary here fine i dont say im anything but grateful for that and we rested in the bunks got recuperated but enoughs enough the computer tells us it wants to talk to the man gene some more fine i say turkey stood up not easy the computer says this talking to a mans near dead slow work looking around i tried to take control assume leadership again jutted out my chin time to get back but their eyes are funny somehow id lost my real power over them its not anymore like im the one who led them when the bombs started which means i suppose that this thing isnt going to be a new beginning for me its going to be the same life people arent going to pay me any more real respect than they ever did mc so the simulations had proved right but as ever incomplete mc peered at the shambling adamant band assembled in the hospital bay and pondered how many of them might be elsewhere perhaps many perhaps few it all depended on data mc did not have could not easily find the satellite worlds swinging above could get no accurate count in the us or the ussr stilllooking at them mc could not doubt that there were many they were simply too brimming with life too hard to kill all the calculations in the world could not stop these creatures the humans shuffled out leaving the tisolate with the woman who had never left its side they were going mc called after them they nodded understanding but did not stop mc let them go there was much to do new antennas new sensors new worlds turkey belly full and eye quick we came out into the pines wind blowed through with a scent of the gulf on it fresh and salty with rich moistness the dark clouds are gone i think maybe ill get bud to drive south some more id like to go swimming one more time in those breakers that come booming in taller than i am down near fort morgan man never knows when hell get to do it again buds ready to travel hes taking a radio sos we can talk to mc find out about the help thats coming for now we got to get back and look after our own same as well see to the boy hes ours now susan says shell stay with gene till hes ready till some surgeons turn up can work on him thatll be a long time say i but she can stay if she wants plenty food and such down there for her a lot of trouble we got coming a mere hundred mile not much to show for it when we get back a bumper crop of bad news some would say not me its better to know than to not better to go on than to look back so we go out into dawn and there are the same colored dots riding in the high hard blue like camp fires the crickets are chirruping and in the scrub theres a rustle of things moving about their own business a clean scent of things starting up the rest of us we mount the truck and it surges forward with a muddy growl ackerman slumped over angel in the cab beside bud the boy already asleep on some blankets and the forlorn sound of us moving among the windswept trees is a long and echoing note of mutual and shared desolation powerful and pitched forward into whatever must come now a muted note persisting and undeniable in the soft sweet air epilogue twentythree years later johnny an older woman in a formless wrinkled dress and worn shoes sat at the side of the road i was panting from the fast pace i was keeping along the white strip of sandy rutted road she sat silent and unmoving i nearly walked by before i saw her youre resting i asked waiting her voice had a feel of rustling leaves she sat on the brown cardboard suitcase with big copper latchesthe kind made right after the war it was cracked along the side and white cotton underwear stuck out for the bus for buck the chopper recording it said the bus will stop up around the bend i heard it wont come down this side road theres not time i was late myself and i figured she had picked the wrong spot to wait buck will be along her voice was high and had the backcountry twang to it my own voice still had some of the same sound but i was keeping my vowels flat and right now and her accent reminded me of how far i had come i squinted looking down the long sandy curve of the road a pickup truck growled out of a clay side road and onto the hardtop people rode in the back along with trunks and a d taking everything they could big white eyes shot a glance at me and then the driver hit the hydrogen and got out of there the confederation wasnt giving us much time since the unification of the soviet usa and europeansino space colonies into one political union everybodyd come to think of them as the confeds periodone entity i knew betterthere were tensions and differences abounding up therebut the shorthand was convenient whos buck my dog she looked at me directly as though any fool would know who buck was look the bus youre one of those bishop boys arent you i looked off up the road again that set of wordsbeing eternally a bishop boywas like a grain of sand caught between my back teeth my mothers friends had used that phrase when they came over for an evening of bridge before i went away to the university not my real mother of courseshe and dad had died in the war and i dimly remembered them or anyone else from then almost everybody around here had been struck down by the soviet bioweapons it was the awful swath of those that cut through whole states mostly across the souththe horror of itthat had formed the basis of the peace that followed nuclear and bioarsenals were reduced to nearly zero now defenses in space were thick and reliable the building of those had fueled the huge boom in confed cities made orbital commerce important provided jobs and horizons for a whole generationincluding me i was a groundorbit liaison spending four months every year at us but to the people down here i was eternally that oldest bishop boy bishops i was the only one left whod actually lived here before the war id been away on a visit when it came afterward my aunt and uncle bishop from birmingham came down to take over the old family propertyto save it from being homesteaded on under the new federal reconstruction acts theyd taken me in and id thought of them as mom and dad wed all had the bishop name after all so i was a bishop one of the few natives whod made it through the bombing and nuclear autumn and all peopled point me out as almost a freak a real native wow yes maam i said neutrally thought so youre susan mckenzie ah we had done the ritual so now we could talk yet some memory stirred something bout you she squinted in the glaring sunlight she probably wasnt all that old in her late fifties maybe anybody whod caught some radiation looked aged a bit beyond their years or maybe it was just the unending weight of hardship and loss theyd carried seems like i knew you before the war she said i strictly believe i saw you i was up north then a hundred miles from here didnt come back until months later sod i some relatives brought me down and we found out whatd happened to fairhope she squinted at me again and then a startled look spread across her leathery face my lord were they lookin for that big computer center the datacomm it was i frowned well maybei dont remember too well johnny youre johnny yes maam john bishop i didnt like the littleboy ending on my name but people around here couldnt forget it im susan the one went with you i had the codes for datacomm remember whyyes slow clearing of ancient foggy images you were hiding in that centerwhere we found you yes i had gene in the tisolate gene that awful time had been stamped so strongly in me that id blocked off many memories muting the horror now it came flooding back i saved him all right yessir we got married i had my children tentatively she reached out a weathered hand and i touched it a lump suddenly blocked my throat and my vision blurred somehow all those years had passed and id never thought to look up any of those peopleturkey angel bud mr ackerman just too painful i guess and a little boy making his way in a tough world without his parents doesnt look back a whole lot we grasped hands i think i mightve seen you once actuly at a fish fry down at point clear you and some boys was playing with the netsit was just after the fishing came back real good those roussin germsd wore off gene went down to shoo you away from the boats i was cleaning flounder and i thought then maybe you were the one but somehow when i saw your face at a distance i couldnt go up to you and say anything you was skipping around so happy laughing and all i couldnt bring those bad times back ii understand gene died two year ago she said simply im sorry we had our time together she said forcing a smile remember how we and then i recalled where i was what was coming mrs mckenzie theres not long before the last bus im waiting for buck where is he he run off in the woods chasing something i worked by backpack straps around my shoulders they creaked in the quiet there wasnt much time left pretty soon now it would start i knew the sequence because i did maintenance engineering and retrofit on uss modular mirrors one of the big reflectors would focus sunlight on a rechargeable tube of gas that would excite the molecules a small triggering beam would start the lasing going the excited molecules cascading down together from one preferentially occupied quantum state to a lower state a traveling wave swept down the tube jarring loose more photons they all added together in phase so when the light waves hit the far end of the hundredmeter tube it was a sword a gouging lance that could cut through air and clouds and this time it wouldnt strike an array of layered solidstate collectors outside new orleans providing clean electricity it would carve a swath twenty meters wide through the trees and fields of southern alabama a little demonstration the confeds said the buslook ill carry that suitcase for you i can manage she peered off into the distance and i saw she was tired tired beyond knowing it ill wait for buck leave him mrs mckenzie i dont need that blessed bus why not my children drove off to mobile with their families theyre coming back to get me my insteted radioi gestured at my radiosays the roads to mobile are jammed up you cant count on them they said so the confed deadline i tole em id try to walk to the main road got tired is all theyll know im back in here just the same im all right dont you mind theyre good children grateful for all ive gone and done for them theyll be back come with me to the bus its not far not without buck hes all the company i got these days she smiled blinking i wiped sweat from my brow and studied the pines there were a lot of places for a dog to be the land here was flat and barely above sea level i had come to camp and rest rowing skiffs up the fish river looking for places id been when i was a teenager and my mom had rented boats from a rambling old fishermans house i had turned off my radio to get away from things the big mysterious island i remembered and called treasure island smack in the middle of the river was now a soggy stand of trees in a bog the big storm a year back had swept it away id been sleeping in the open on the shore near there when the chopper woke me up blaring the confeds had given twelve hours warning the recording said theyd picked this sparsely populated area for their little demonstration people had been moving back in ever since the biothreat was cleaned out but there still werent many id liked that when i was growing up open woods thats why i came back every chance i got i shouldve guessed something was coming the confeds were about evenly matched with the whole rest of the planet now at least in hightech weaponry defense held all the cards the big mirrors were modular and could fold up fast making a small target they could incinerate anything launched against them too but the un kept talking like the confeds were just another nationstate or something nobody down here understood that the people up there thought of earth itself as the real problemeaten up with ageold rivalries and hate still holding onto dirty weapons that murdered whole populations carrying around in their heads all the rotten baggage of the past to listen to them youd think theyd learned nothing from the war already they were forgetting that it was the orbital defenses that had saved the biosphere itself and the satellite communities that knit together the mammoth rescue efforts of the decade after without the antivirals developed and grown in huge zerog vats lots of us wouldve caught one of the poxes drifting through the population people just forget nations too wheres buck i said decisively hethat way a wave of the hand i wrestled my backpack down feeling the stab from my shoulderand suddenly remembered the thunk of that steel knocking me down back then so long ago and me still carrying an ache from it that woke whenever a cold snap came on the past was still alive i trotted into the short pines over creeper grass flies jumped where my boots struck the white sand made a skree sound as my boots skated over it i remembered how id first heard that sound wearing slicksoled tennis shoes and how pleased id been at university when i learned how the acoustics of it worked buck a flash of brown over to the left i ran through a thick stand of pine and the dog yelped and took off dodging under a blackleaf bush i called again buck didnt even slow down i skirted left he went into some oak scrub barking having a great time of it and i could hear him getting tangled in it and then shaking free and out of the other side long gone when i got back to mrs mckenzie she didnt seem to notice me i cant catch him knew you wouldnt she grinned at me showing brown teeth bucks a fast one call him she did nothing must of run off there isnt time im not leaving without ole buck times i was alone down on the river after gene died and the water would come up under the house buck was the only company i had only soul i saw for five weeks in that big blow we had a low whine from afar i think thats the bus i said she cocked her head might be come on ill carry your suitcase she crossed her arms my children will be by for me i tole them to look for me along in here they might not make it theyre loyal children mrs mckenzie i cant wait for you to be reasonable i picked up my backpack and brushed some red ants off the straps you bishops was always reasonable she said levelly you work up there dont you ah sometimes you goin back after they do what theyre doin here i might even if i owed her something for what she did long ago damned if i was going to be cowed theyre attacking the united states and spots in bavaria the urals south africa brazil cause we dont trust em they think they can push the united states aroun just as they please and she went on with all the cliches heard daily from earthbound media how the confeds wanted to run the world and they were dupes of the russians and how surrendering national sovereignty to a bunch of selfappointed overlords was an affront to our dignity and so on true some of itthe confeds werent saints but they were the only power that thought in truly global terms couldnt not think that way they could stop icbms and punch through the atmosphere to attack any offensive capability on the groundthats what this demonstration was to show id heard confeds argue that this was the only way to break the diplomatic logjamdo something i had my doubts but times were changing that was sure and my generation didnt think the way the prewar people did well never be ruled by some outside mrs mckenzie theres the bus listen the turbo whirred far around the bend slowing for the stop her face softened as she gazed at me as if recalling memories thats all right boy you go along now i saw that she wouldnt be coaxed or even forced down that last bend she had gone as far as she was going to and the world would have to come the rest of the distance itself up ahead the bus driver was probably behind schedule for this last pickup he was going to be irritated and more than a little scared the confeds would be right on time he knew that i ran my feet plowed through the deep soft sand right away i could tell i was more tired than id thought and the heat had taken some strength out of me i went about two hundred meters along the gradual bend was nearly within view of the bus when i heard it start up with a rumble i tasted salty sweat and it felt like the whole damned planet was dragging at my feet holding me down the driver raced the engine in a hurry he had to come toward me as he swung out onto route on the way back to mobile maybe i could reach the intersection in time for him to see me so i put my head down and plunged forward but there was the woman back there to get to her the driver would have to take the bus down that rutted sandy road and risk getting stuck with people on the bus yelling at him all that to get the old woman with the grateful children she didnt seem to understand that there were ungrateful children in the skies nowshe didnt seem to understand much of what was going onand suddenly i wasnt sure i did either but i kept on walter jon williams in his eclectically varied novels and short stories walter jon williams has tried a variety of approaches ranging from hard science fiction to comic space opera and disaster epic he is the author of a cyberpunk trilogy formed by hardwired solip system and voice of the whirlwind and the diptych of metropolitan and city on fire which relates the intrigues that take place inside a forcibly enclosed city world powered by geomancy he has also chronicled the adventures of irascible interstellar thief drake maijstral in the series of elegant farces starting with the crown jewels house of shards and rock of ages his short fiction includes wall stone craft an awardwinning novella that provides an alternate history based on mary shelleys frankenstein and the short stories collected in facets williamss disaster novel the rift examines the catalcylsmic social and cultural consequences of a major earthquake along the new madrid fault line in the mississippi river valley speakers in the hospital ceiling chimed a series of low whispery synthesized tones tones that were scientifically proven to be relaxing reese looked down at the kid in the hospital bed and felt her insides twist the kid was named steward and hed just had a bullet removed that morning in the last few days mad with warrior zen and a suicidal concept of personal honor hed gone kamikaze and blown up the whole network griffith was dead jordan was dead spassky was dead and nobody had stopped steward until everything in la had collapsed entirely he hadnt talked yet to the heat but he would reese reached for her gun her insides were still twisting steward had been lied to and jacked over and manipulated without his knowing it mostly it had been his friend reese who had done it to him she couldnt blame him for exploding when he finally figured out what had happened and now this reese turned off the iv monitor so it wouldnt bleep when he died and then steward opened his eyes she could see the recognition in his look the knowledge of what was about to happen she might have known he wouldnt make it easy sorry she said and raised the gun what the hell else could she say maybe we can still be friends after this is over steward was trying to say something she felt herself wring out again she shot him three times with her silenced pistol and left the police guards didnt look twice at her hospital coat and id proper credentials had always been her specialty cya reese headed for japan under a backup identity credentials her strong suit as always on the shuttle she drank a star beast and plugged her seats interface stud into the socket at the base of her skull she closed her eyes and silently projected the latest scansheets onto the optical centers of her brain and her lips twisted in anger as for the first time she found out what had really gone down what shed been a part of alien pharmaceuticals tonnes of them shipped down under illegal cover the network had been huge bigger than reese from her limited perspective had ever suspected and now the la heat had everything police and security people everywhere even in the space habitats were going berserk all along shed thought it was friends helping friends but her friends had jacked her around the same way shed jacked around steward the whole trip to la had been pointlessthey had been stupid to send her killing steward couldnt stop what was happening it was all too big the only way reese could stay clear was to hide she ordered another drink needing it badly the shuttle speakers moaned with the same tuneless synthesized chords as had the speakers in the hospital room the memory of steward lying in the bed floated in her mind tangled in her insides she leaned back against the headrest and watched the shuttles wings gather fire her career as a kick boxer ended with a spin kick breaking her nose and reese said the fuck with it and went back to light sparring and kung fu beating the hell out of herself in training only to have the hell beaten out of her in the ring was not her idea of the good life she was thirtysix now and she might as well admit there were sports she shouldnt indulge in even if she had the threadware for them the realization didnt improve her mood through the window of her condeco apartment reese could see a cold wailing northeast wind drive flying white scud across the shallow aral sea its shriek drowning the minarets amplified call to prayer neither the wind nor the view had changed in months reese looked at the grey uzbek spring turned on her vid and contemplated her sixth month of exile her hair was black now shorter than shed worn it in a long time her fingerprints were altered as was the bone structure of her face the serial numbers on her artificial eyes had been changed however bleak its weather uzbekistan was good at that sort of thing the last person shed known who had lived here was steward just before he came to la and blew everything to smithereens a young man on the vid was putting himself into some kind of combat suit stuffing weapons and ammunition into pockets he picked up a shotgun suspenseful music hammered from the speakers reese turned up the sound and sat down in front of the vid she had considered getting back into the trade but it was too early the scansheets and broadcasts were still full of stories about aliens alien ways alien imports about restructuring going on in the policorps who dealt with the powers it was strange seeing the news on the vid with people ducking for cover refusing statements the news item followed by a slick ad for alien pharmaceuticals people were going to trialat least those who survived were a lot were cooperating things were still too hot fortunately money wasnt a problem she had enough to last a long time possibly even forever gunfire sounded from the vid the young man was in a shootout with aliens splattering powers with his shotgun reese felt her nerves turn to ice the young man she realized was supposed to be steward she jumped forward and snapped off the vid she felt sickened steward had never shot an alien in his life reese ought to know fucking assholes fucking media vermin she reached for her quilted chinese jacket and headed for the door the room was too damn small she swung the door open with a bang and a darkcomplected man jumped a foot at the sound he turned and gave a nervous grin you startled me he had an anonymous accent that conveyed no particular origin just the abstract idea of foreignness he looked about thirty he was wearing suede pumps that had tabs of velcro on the bottoms and sides for holding onto surfaces in zero gee his hands were jammed into a grey unlined plastic jacket with a halfdozen pockets all sealed by velcro tabs reese suspected one of his hands of having a weapon in it he was shivering from cold or nervousness reese figured he had just come down the gravity wellhe was wearing too much velcro to have bought his clothes on earth some descendants of the golden horde dressed in flieger styles imported from berlin roared by on skateboards the earpieces of their leather flying helmets flapping in the wind been in town long reese asked he told her his name was sardar chandrasekhar vivekenanda and that he was a revolutionary from prince station his friends called him ken two nights after their first meeting she met him in the natural life bar a place on the top story of a large bank it catered to exiles and featured a lot of mahogany imported at great cost from central america reese had checked on kenno sense in being foolishand discovered he was who he claimed to be the scansheets from prince mentioned him frequently even his political allies were denouncing his actions ram was trying to blame the february riots on us ken told her cheney decided i should disappearthe riots would be blamed on me and cheney could go on working reese sipped her mataglap star feeling it burn its way down her throat as she glanced down through the glass wall seeing the wind scour dust over the uzbeks metal roofs and receiver dishes she grinned so cheney arranged for you to take the fall instead of him she said sounds like a friend of humanity to me all right kens voice was annoyed cheney knows what hes doing sure he does hes setting up his friends the question is do you know what youre doing kens fineboned hands made a dismissive gesture from here i can make propaganda cheney sends me an allowance ive bought a very good communications system she turned to him you going to need any soldiers in this revolution of yours he shook his head his lashes were full and black i think not prince station is a hundred years oldits in orbit around luna with ready access to minerals but it cannot compete effectively with the new equipment on other stations ram wants to hang on as long as possiblehis policy is to loot the economy rather than rebuild hes guaranteed the loyalty of the stockholders by paying large dividends but the economy cant support the dividends anymore and the riots showed he has lost control over the situation it is a matter of time only we do not expect the change will be violentnot a military sort of violence anyway too bad i could use a job in someones foreign legion about now she glanced up as a group of people entered the barshe recognized a famous swindler from ceres named da vega his hands and face covered with expensive glowing implant jewelry that reminded her of fluorescent slime mold he was with an allfemale group of bodyguards who were supposed to stand between him and any cerean snatch teams sent to bring him to justice they were all tall and roundeyedda vega liked women that way hed tried to recruit reese when they first met the pay was generous roundeyed women being rare here but the sexual favors were supposed to be included one of those jobs reese thought she was tempted to feed him his socks bodyguards or not but in the end told him she was used to a better class of employer da vega turned to her and smiled uzbekistan was suddenly far too small a place reese finished her mataglap star and stood lets go for a walk she said an architecture of liberation ken said thats what were after you should read cheneys thoughts on the subject the night street filled with a welling tide of wind its alloy surface reflected bright holograms that marched up and down dark storefronts advertising wares invisible behind dead glass the wind howled in the latticework of radio receivers pointed at the sky through a spiky forest of antennae a minaret outlined by flashing red strobes speared a sky that glowed with yellow sodium light liberation reese said right too many closed systems ken said he shrugged into the collar of his new down jacket thats the problem with space habitats in generalthey strive for closed ecological systems and then try to close as much of their economy as possible theres not enough access im a macroeconomisti work with a lot of models try to figure out how things are put togetherand the most basic obstacle always seems to be the lack of access to data weve got a solar system filled with corporate plutocracies all competing with each other none giving free access to anything theyre trying to do and theyve got colonies in other solar systems and nothing about those gets out that the policorps dont want us to know the whole situation is far too unstableits impossible to predict whats going to happen because the data simply isnt available everythings constructed along the lines of the old orbital sovietnot even the people who need the information get the access they require prince stations main business is processing mineralsthats okay and its steady but the prices fluctuate a lot as new mineral sources are exploited in the belt and elsewhere and it requires heavy capital investment to keep the equipment up to date so for the sake of a stable station economy it would be nice for prince to develop another steadier source of export biologicals say or customconfigured databases optics wetware export genetics anything but it takes time and resourcesfive years worth sayto set something like that up and there are other policorps who specialize in those areas we could be duplicating another groups work and never know it until suddenly a new product comes onto the market and wipes out our five years investment all this secrecy is making for unstable economies unstable economies make for unstable political situationsthats why whole policorps suddenly go bellyup so you want the policorps to give away their trade secrets i want to do away with the whole concept of trade secrets ideally what id like to do is create a whole new architecture of data storage and retrieval something thats so good that everyone will have to use it to stay competitive but something that by its very nature prohibits restriction of access reese laughed the sound echoed from the cold metal street youre dreaming he gave her a faint smile youre right of course id have to go back two hundred years right to the beginning of artificial intelligence and redesign everything from the start then maybe id have a chance he shrugged cheney and i have more practical plans fortunately she looked at him you remind me of someone i used to know he wanted to know the truth just like you wanted access yes the cold wind seemed to cut her to the bone he died she said somebody shot him in a hospital somehow caught in the warm rush of memory she had forgot that ending a funny place to get shot she remembered stewards last comprehending look the final words that never came the northeaster touched her flesh chilled her heart the lonely street where they walked suddenly seemed endless not just a street but the street an endless alloy thoroughfare where reese walked in chill isolation moving between walls of neon that advertised phantom unreal comfortsshe shivered and took his hand kens voice was soft almost drowned by wind were you close yes no she tossed her head i wanted to be a friend but it would have been bad for business i see she tasted bile on her tongue gazing down the endless gleaming street again the dark people on it who touched briefly and then parted sometimes she thought she just needed reminding she wondered what stewards last words might have been a bare yellow bulb marked the door to kens apartment building they entered the yellow light streaming through the door to reveal the worn furniture the bright new communications equipment hey reese said its agitprop central she was glad to be out of the wind the room blinked to the distant red pulse of the minarets airhazard lights reese stopped kens hand on the light switch stopped his mouth every time he tried to talk with her tongue she really didnt care if he had someone special back on prince preferred this to happen in a certain restrained ethical silence her nerves were wired for combat and she snapped them on speeding her perceptions and making everything seem in slow motion the way his hands moved on her the susurrus of her own breath the endless red beat of the strobe that sketched the outlines of his face in the warm darknessshe could hear the bluster of the northeaster outside the way it knocked at the panes shrieked around corners flooded down the long and empty street outside kept securely outside at least for this slowmoving comforting moment of exile a day later a maintenance seal blew out on prince station and killed sixteen people ken was pleased we can do a lot with this he said demonstrate how the administrations cronies cant even do simple jobs right reese stood by the window looking out toward the distant brown horizon tired of kens torn wallpaper and sagging furniture in the distance foreigners on bactrian camels pretended they were carrying silk to tashkent sabotage do you think she asked then corrected herself sorry destabilization is the proper term right he sat crosslegged on his chair watching the screen with an intent calculating frown it could have been us yes an effective little action if it was the people who got killed werent volunteers anyway not your people he grinned in a puzzled way no of course not reese turned to look at him folding her arms thats what scares me about you idealists you shoot sixteen people into a vacuum and its all for human betterment and the triumph of the revolution so everythings okay ken squinted as he looked at her against the light im not sure its different from what you do im a soldier youre an ideologue the difference is that you decide who gets killed and where and im the one that has to do it and face the consequences if youre wrong if it werent for people like you i wouldnt be necessary you think this difference somehow makes you less responsible reese shook her head no but the people i fighttheyre volunteers same as me getting paid same as me its clean very direct i take the money do a job i dont know what its about often as not i dont really want to know if i asked the people i work for would just lie anyway she moved to the shabby plush chair and sat curling one leg under her i fought for humanity once in the artifact war i was on archangel with far jewel making the planet safe for the freconomicist cause making use of the alien technology wed stumbled on by accident all that biochem ware the powers are so good at it sounded like a noble adventure but what we were doing was looting alien ruins and stealing from the other policorps the war blew up and next i knew i was below the surface in those alien tunnels and i was facing extermination cyberdrones and tailored bugs with nothing between death and my skin but a very inadequately armored environment suit and then i got killed ken looked at her with his head cocked to one side puzzled you had clone insurance this is a different body anger burned in reese as she spoke and she felt it tempering her muscles turning them rigid remembered dark tunnels bodies piled in heaps the smell of fear that burned itself into the fibers of her combat suit the scent that no amount of maintenance and cleaning would ever ever remove no nothing like that i did the killingi killed myself my personality because everything i was everything id learned was just contributing to help my employers my officers and the enemy in their effort to murder me i had to streamline myself get rid of everything that didnt contribute in a positive way toward my own physical survival i became an animal a tunnel rat i saw how qualities like courage and loyalty were being used by our bosses to get us killed and so i became a disloyal coward my body was working against meim too tall for tunnelsbut i tried real hard to get short and funny enough it seemed to work because in times like that if youve got your head right you can do what you have to she looked at ken and grinned baring her teeth an adrenaline surge triggered by the violent memory prickled the down on her arms im still an animal im still disloyal im still a coward because thats the only way to keep alive if you feel that way you could get out of the business she shrugged its what i do best and if i did something elsegot a job as a rigger or some kind of techthen id just be somebody elses animal a cow maybe being herded from one place to another and fed on grass at least this way im my own animal i get my reward up front and during kens dark eyes were intent reese shifted in her seat felt a certain discomfort nerves she thought jinking from the adrenaline im not sure what you mean you like the work i have that impression she laughed no reason to be defensive about it i like being wired and hanging right on the edge i like knowing that i have to do things right that any mistake i make matters he shook his head i dont understand that people like you you havent had to become an animal youre a macroeconomist and youre trained to take the long view a few people blown out a hatch thats just an acceptable sacrifice i tend to take this kind of thing personally is all see i figure everyone who ever tried to get me killed was looking at the long view kens gaze was steady im not planning on getting you killed thats not part of my view maybe someday ill end up standing between you and your revolution then well see he didnt say anything in the steadiness of his dark eyes the absence of expression reese read her answer and knew it was the one shed expected reese it was the first time shed heard her name in six months and now it came from a complete stranger on a streetcorner in uzbekistan her hardwired nerves were triggered and her combat thread was evaluating the mans stance calculating possible dangers and responses before she even finished her turn he was about forty tanned with receding brown hair and a widows peak his stance was open his hands in plain sight he wore a blue down vest over a plaid shirt baggy grey wool pants old brown squaretoed boots he smiled in a friendly way his build was delicate as if hed been genetically altered his face was turning ruddy in the wind you talking to me reese asked him my names waldman her wetwear was still evaluating him analyzing every shift in posture movement of his hands had ken shopped her she wondered had cheney after deciding she was a danger to ken his smile broadened i understand your caution but we know who you are dont worry about it we want to hire you his voice was as american as hers her speededup reflexes gave her plenty of time to contemplate his words youd better call me waldman if you want to talk to me at all he put up his hands her nerves crackled she noticed he had a ragged earlobe as if someone had torn off an earring in a fight okay miss waldman my names berger can we talk the natural life in an hour do you know where that is i can find out see you there he turned and walked casually up the narrow street she watched till he was gone and then went to the apartment she rented in a waterfront condecology she looked for signs anyone had been there in her absencethere werent any but that didnt mean anythingand then to calm her jittery nerves she cleaned her pistol and took a long hot bath with the gun sitting on the side of the steel tub she stretched out as far as the tub would let her feeling droplets of sweat beading on her scalp while she watched the little bathroom liquidcrystal vidscreen show a bouncy popmusic program from malaya she changed her clothes put the pistol back in its holsterthe security softwear at the natural life would shred her with poisoned darts if she tried to carry it inand then headed back into town the muezzins song hung in the gusty air her mind sifted possibilities berger was the heat berger was an assassin da vega had shopped her out of pique cheney had sold her name ken had regretted telling her so much about his revolution and decided to have her iced before she sold his plans to ram life was just so full of alternatives berger hadnt arrived at the bar when she came in the bartender was at prayer and so she turned on the desktop comp and read the scansheets looking for something that might give her an edge help her to understand what it was about nothing the aliens hadnt generated any headlines today but there was a note about a cerean exile named da vega who had been found dead along with a couple of his bodyguards another bodyguard was missing reese grinned the uzbeks a people who usually endorsed the long view had probably turned da vega into fertilizer by now the amplified muezzins fell silent the bartender returned and flipped on todo music broadcast by satellite from japan he took her order and then berger walked in dabbing at his nose with a tissue he hadnt been ready he explained for this bitter a spring hed have to buy a warm jacket dont worry miss waldman he added im not here to crease you if i wanted to do that i could have done it on the street i know but you might be a cop trying to lure me out of uzbekistan so i hope to hell you can prove to me who you are he grinned rubbed his forehead uncomfortably well to tell you the truth i am a policeman of a sort terrific that really makes my day he showed her id she studied it while berger went on im a captain in brighter suns pulsar division wed like to hire you for a job up the well vesta no closer to earth reese frowned policorp brighter suns was one of the two policorps that had been set up to deal with the alien powers it was almost exclusively into power imports and its charter forbade it from owning territory outside of its home asteroid vesta a lot of brighter suns execs were running for cover ever since steward had blown griffiths network in la and the whole vesta operation was being restructured the pulsar division handles internal security on vesta reese said your outside intelligence division is called group seven so why is pulsar handling a matter so far away from home what wed like you to handle is an internal security matter some of our people have gone rogue you want me to bring them back something twitched the flesh by one of bergers eyes she knew what he was going to say before the words came out his mouth she felt her nerves tingling her muscles warming it had been a long time no we want you to ice them dont tell me anything more she said im going to check you out before i listen to another word its not even murder id say berger said he was eating spinach salad in an expensive restaurant called the texas beef named after a vaguely pornographic and wildly popular vid show from alice springs dressing spattered the creamy table cloth as berger waved his fork weve got tissue samples and memory thread like we do for all our top peoplehell well clone em that doesnt mean i cant end up in prison for it whos gonna catch you its a goddam asteroid fifty zillion klicks from anywhere she had checked him out as far as she could after telling him what she was going to do shed sent a message to vesta asking for confirmation of the existence of one captain berger of the pulsar division that and a photo both arrived within twelve hours if this was a plot to arrest her it had some unlikely elements reese took a mouthful of lamb in mustard sauce she worked out hard enough she figured and deserved her pleasures the rocks about two kilometers in diameter the official name is ya but its also called cuervo gold funny names theyre giving asteroids these days theyve run out of minor greek gods i guess cuervos officially owned by a nonpolicorporate mining company called exeter associates which in turn is owned by us golds an apollo asteroid crossing earths orbit on a regular schedule and that makes it convenient for purposes of resupply and also makes it a lot more isolated than any of the rocks in the belt weve had a lab there for a while using it to develop some technology that he grinned well that we wanted to keep far away from any competition security on vesta is tight but its a port people are always coming in and out what weve got on the asteroid is pretty hot stuff and we wanted to keep it away from the tourists i dont really want to know reese said i dont know myself so i couldnt tell you berger said the work was in a fairly advanced stage when certain activities relating to your old friend griffith became public it became an urgent matter to shut down the project and transfer its members to other duties in central africa where i work if the investigators found out about our owning that asteroid and whats on it brighter suns could be very embarrassed the techs refused to move reese asked they protested they said their work was entering a critical stage a transport was sent from earth to pick them up but they refused to evacuate and then we lost touch with the freighter we think the crew have been killed or made prisoner your people could have defected to another policorp using the transport we dont think so their work would have been hard to take with them and they couldnt have gone far without attracting attentionsome of the lab personnel were powers a coolness moved through reeses bones she sat up regarding berger carefully powers were forbidden off the two entry portsthe official reason was that there was too much danger of crosscontamination from alien lifeforms plagues had already devastated the two power legations and the reverse was always a possibility the discovery of powers in brighter suns employ outside of vesta would ruin brighter suns credit for good but after a while the heat on brighter suns would die down trade with the aliens was too profitable for people to interfere with it for long in a year or two the lab could be reopened with cloned personnel and some very mean security goons to make certain they followed orders i understand your sense of urgency reese said but why me why not go yourself we dont have anyone with your talents on earth berger said im not wired the way you are andwell wed like to know youre gainfully employed by us rather than floating around uzbekistan waiting to be captured by the heat if we can find you they probably can reese sipped her club soda how did you find me exactly someone recognized you who might that have been the skin by bergers eye gave a leap its already taken care of he said we didnt want him giving your name to anyone else da vega well at least it wasnt ken but there was also a threat berger didnt want her in this refugees paradise where the number of desperate people was higher than average and where a policorporate kidnap team could find her if theyd already iced one person they could put the ice on another lets talk payment reese said brighter suns i think can afford to pay me what im worth rams cops had beaten some woman to death during interrogation ken was busy at his console putting out fact and opinion pieces making the most of another death for the revolution reese paced the room picking at the tattered wallpaper eating mongolian barbecue from a waxed paper container below the window some drunken descendant of the golden horde was singing a sad song to the moon he kept forgetting the lyrics and starting over and the burbling ballad was getting on reeses nerves id feel better she said if cheney was paying you a decent wage he pays what he can afford kens fingers sped over his keyboard the money has to be laundered and he has to be careful how he does it you dont even have a promise of a job after its all over ken shrugged prince can always use another economist and you dont have protection ram could order you iced he needs a live scapegoat not a dead martyr he frowned as he typed this isnt a mysterious business you know ram knows our strength and most of our moves and we know his there arent very many hidden pieces on the board the uzbek began his song again reese clenched her teeth she put her hand on kens shoulder im disappearing tomorrow she said he tilted his head back looking up in surprise his fingers stopped moving on the keys whats wrong nothing i got a job she saw a confirmation in his eyes not one you can talk about he said no but its not for ram in case you were wondering he took her hand in one of his ill miss you reese put her food carton on top of his video display her chopsticks jabbed the air like rabbit ear antennae ive got another twelve hours before i take the plane to beijing ken turned off his console i can send the rest out tomorrow he said reese was surprised what about the revolution he shrugged and kissed the inside of her wrist sometimes i feel redundant the revolution is inevitable after all its nice to know reese said that the devil can quote ideology to his purpose outside the uzbek continued his wail to the desolate stars the tug was called voidrunner and it was thirty years old at least the padding on its bulkheads patched with silver tape bundles of cable hanging out of access hatches reese had been in enough ships like it not to let the mess bother herall it meant was that the tug didnt have to impress its passengers the air inside tasted acrid as if the place was crammed full of sweating men but there were only four people on board berger introduced the other three to reese then left waving cheerily over his shoulder about four minutes later voidrunner cast off from charter station and began its long acceleration to its destination reese watched the departure from the copilots chair in the armored docking cockpit the captain performed the maneuvers with his eyes closed not even looking out the bubble canopy at the silverbright floodlit skin of charter reality projected into his head through his interface thread his eyelids twitching as his eyes reflexively scanned mental indicators his name was falkland he was about fifty an artifact war veteran who fifteen years before had been doing his level best to kill reese in the tunnels of archangel a chemical attack had left his motor reflexes damaged and he wore a light silver alloy exoskeleton fortunately his brain and interface thread had survived the war intact he wore a grey beard and his hair long over his collar prepare for acceleration he said his eyes still closed well be at two gees for the first six hours reese looked out at earths dull grey moon vast taking up most of the sky right she said got my piss bottle right here hard gees were tough on the bladder after the long burn voidrunner settled into a constant onegee acceleration falkland stayed strapped in his eyelids still moving to some internal rem light show reese unbuckled her harness stretched her relieved muscles while her spine and neck popped and moved downship falkland offered no comment the crew compartment smelled of fresh paint reese saw the tugs engineer a tiny man named chung working on a bulkhead fire alarm his head was bobbing to music he was feeding to his aural nerves chung was so into the technophilic destinarian movement he was turning himself slice by slice into a machine his eyes were clear implants that showed the interior silver circuitry his ears were replaced by featureless black boxes and there were other boxes of obscure purpose jacked into his hairless scalp his teeth were metal and liquid crystal jewelry powered by nerve circuitry shone in everchanging patterns on his cheeks and on the backs of his hands he hadnt said anything when berger introduced him just looked at reese for a moment then turned back to his engines now he said something his voice was hoarse as if he wasnt used to using it hes downship in cargo b his back was to reese and she had been moving quietly his head still bobbed to inaudible music he hadnt even turned his head to speak thanks she said nice implants the best i built em myself arent you supposed to be monitoring the burn he pointed at one of his boxes i am nice she always found she had common ground with control freaks vickers was in cargo b as chung had promised he was reeses armorer hired by berger for the sole purpose of maintaining the combat suit that reese was to wear on cuervo vickers was young about eighteen and thin his dark hair was cut short he had a stammer and severe acne he was dressed in oilspattered coveralls when reese walked in vickers was peeling the suits components out of their foam packing she helped him lay the suit on the deck vickers grinned wwolf he said his voice was american southern my favorite youre gonna kick some ass with this its so good it can ppractically do the job by itself the suit was black longarmed anthropoid the helmet horned by radio antennae was fused seamlessly to the shoulders inside reeses arms legs and body would fit into a complex web that would hold her tightly the suit would amplify and strengthen her every move it wasnt entirely natural movementshed have to get used to having a lot more momentum in free fall than she normally did ffuckin great machine vickers said reese didnt answer the wolfs dark viewplate gleamed in the cool cabin light there was a clean functionality to its design that made it even more fearfulnothing in its look gave the impression that it was anything but a tool for efficient murder the white wolf trademark shone on the matteblack body of the suit reese fought a memory charged with fearwolf made most of the cyberdrones shed encountered on archangel the combat suit free of its packing had a smell shed hoped shed never scent again i want to look at the manual she said and the schematics if her life was going to depend on this monster she wanted to know everything there was to know about it he looked at her approvingly ive got them on thread in mmy cabin the suits standard except for some ccustom thread woven into the ttargetacquisition unit berger knows who youre going to bbe gunning for and he put in some specific targetidentification routines youre gonna be hhot thats the plan reese said the smell of the wolf oil and plastic webbing and cold laminate armor rose in her nostrils she repressed a shiver vickers was still admiring the wolf one wicked son of a bitch he said when talking to machines he lost his stammer reese and the wolf moved as one in the void ambercolored targetacquisition data glowed on the interior of the black faceplate below them the asteroid glittered as flecks of mica and nickel reflected the relentless sun no way theyre not gonna know youre coming berger had told her not with your ships torch coming at them we stabilized the rocks spin so you can try landing on the blind side but theyre smart enough to have put detectors out there so we cant count on surprise what were going to have to do is armor you so heavily that no matter what they try to do to you they cant get through great she thought now the rocks little techs human and alien were probably standing by the airlocks with whatever weapons theyd been able to assemble in the last weeks just waiting for something to try booming in all she could do was hope they werent ready for the wolf the hissing of her circulating air was very loud in the small space of the helmet reese could feel sweat gathering under the wolfs padded harness the rocks short horizon scrolled below her feet attitudinal jets made brief adjustments keeping reese close to the surface the wolfs suit monitors were projected through her interface stud in a complex multidimensional weave bright columns glowing in the optical centers of her brain she watched the little green indicators paying little attention as long as they stayed green the target rolled over the near horizon in an instanta silverbright pattern of solar collectors transmission aerials dishes pointed at different parts of the skyin the middle squatted the gleaming bulk of the freighter that had been sent to retrieve the base personnel its docking tube still connected to the big cargo airlock reese had a number of choices for gaining entry there were two personnel airlocks or she could go through one of the freighter locks and then through the docking tube there were nine personnel on station five humans and four powers they can brew explosives with the stuff theyve got on station berger had told her but they cant put anything too big around the airlock or theyd decompress the whole habitatand they dont have enough stored air to repressurize they cant set off anything too big inside or theyd wreck their work its too small a place for them to plan anything major we figure theyll depend on small explosives and maybe gas the base rolled closer reese felt her limbs moving easily in the webbing the hum of awareness in her nerves and blood a concrete certainty of her capabilities all the things she had been unable to live without coolant flow had increased the suit baking in the sun the webbing around her body was chafing her she thought of explosive of gas the way the poison clouds had drifted through the tunnels on archangel contaminating everything forcing her to live inside her suit for days not even able to take a shit without risking burns on her assat least this was going to be quick however it went reese decided to go in through one of the small personnel airlocksthe brains inside the rock might have decided the cargo ship was expendable and packed its joints with homemade explosive she maneuvered the wolf in a slow somersault and dropped feetfirst onto the velcro strip by airlock two berger wanted her to get in without decompressing the place if she couldthere was stuff inside he didnt want messed up reese bent and punched the emergency entrance button and to her surprise she began to feel a faint humming through her feet and the hatch began to roll upshed planned to open the hatch manually how naive were these people she wondered or was there some surprise in the airlock waiting for her youre gonna ccarry that stuff vickers had asked in surprise as he noticed the pistol snugged under the armpit and the long knife strapped to her leg i dont want to depend entirely on the wolf shed said if it gets immobilized somehow i want to be able to surprise whoever did it thered been an amused grin on vickers face they immobilize the wolf they sure as hell can immobilize you adjust the webbing anyway shed said because battle machinery always went wrong sooner or later because if the mission directive didnt give her backup shed just have to be her own because she just didnt like the wolf its streamlined design its purposeful intent because even to someone accustomed to violence the thing was obscene reese knelt by the airlock pulled a videocamera from her belt and held it over the airlock scanning downand fought back a wave of bile surging into her throat because the lock was full of dead men mental indicators shifted as with a push of her mind she ordered her attitudinal jets to separate the wolf from the velcro parking strip then drop into the lock the dead swam in slow motion as she dropped among them her heart crashed in her chest the crew of the freighter she thought the rebels had put them in here not having anyplace else their skins were grey the tongues protruding and black some kind of poison she thought welcome to cuervo gold she said and laughed nerves she hit the button to cycle the airlock found it refused to work incurious dead eyes gazed at her as she cranked the outer door shut manually then planted thermocharges on the inner door locks she drifted up to the top of the airlock again the wolfs horns scratching the outer door the dead men rose with her bumping gently against the wolfs arms and legs reese curled her legs under her protecting the wolfs more vulnerable head and back adrenaline was beating a long tattoo in her pulse a vulture smile crossed her face her nerves sang a mad little song heres where i take it up the ass she thought and pulsed through her wetware the radio code to set off the detonators the lock filled with scorching bright light smoke molten blobs of bright metal air entered the lock with a prolonged scream suddenly her olfactory sensors were overwhelmed with the smell of scorched metal burning flesh her gorge rose she pulsed a command to cut out the smell then moved down to the inner lock door seized it rolled it up with the enhanced strength of the wolf an explosion went off right in her face projectiles thudded into corpse flesh cracked against the faceplate she and the dead men went flying back slamming against the outer hatch her pulse roared in her ears she gave the wolf a command to move down and move down fast her nerves were shrieking as she smashed into a wall of the airlock corrected flew down again out the lock this time cracked into another wall her teeth rattled a homemade claymore she thought explosive packed in a tube with shrapnel bits of jagged alloy wire junk commanddetonated most likely so that meant someone was here watching the airlock door targeting displays flashed bright red on the interior of her faceplate she turned and fired slammed into a wall again fired a second time the targets died fixed to each of the wolfs upper forearms was a semiautomatic tengauge shotgun firing shells packed with poison flechettes reese had more deadly equipment availablea small grenade launcher on the left lower forearm and a submachine gun on the right gas projectors on her chestbut the op plan was to kill the targets without taking a chance on disturbing any of the valuable equipment or experiments dollops of blood streamed into the nearweightlessness turning into crimson spheres a man and a woman one holding some kind of homemade beam weapon shed never got the chance to fire were slowly flying backward toward the sprayed grey plastic walls their hearts and lungs punctured by a dozen flechettes each their faces were frozen in slowgathering horror at the sight of the wolf reese tried to move then hit the wall again she realized the shrapnel had jammed one of her maneuvering jets full on her wetware wove routines to compensate then she leaped past the dying pair and through an open doorway no one was in the next series of partitioned rooms the crew quarters these people were incredibly naive she thought hiding out next to an airlock they knew was going to be blown and not even getting into vac suits they should have put the claymore on the interior hatch door not inside the station itself maybe they couldnt face going into where theyd put the crew theyd killed these werent professionals they were a bunch of eggheads who hadnt known what they were getting into when they signed their declaration of independence from a policorp that could not even afford to acknowledge their existence they werent soldiers but they were still volunteers theyd already killed people quite coldly it seemed in the name of whatever science they were doing here she clenched her teeth and thought about how some people no matter how smart they were remained just too stupid to live there was a new bulkhead door welded to the exterior of the crew quarters reese blew it open the same way as the airlock then jetted through shrieks sounded on her audio thread the strange organ sounds powers made through their upper set of nostrils even as her mind squalled at the unearthly sight of a fastmoving centauroid pair of aliens she fired they died before they could fire their homemade weapons her memory flashed on the video the actorsteward eradicating aliens with his shotgun an idiotic memory she went through a door marked with biohazard warnings the door gave a soft hiss as she opened it the next room was brightly lit humming with a powerful air conditioning unit filled with computer consoles plugged into walls of bare metal not plastic cable stretched to and from something that looked like a hundredliter aquarium filled with what appeared to be living flesh weird she thought it looked as if the meat was divided by partitions like honeycomb in a cultured hive silvergrey wires apparently variablelattice thread were woven through the meat elsewhere an engine hummed as it pumped crimson fluid monitors drew jagged lines across screens holographic digits floated in air weird she thought again alien biochemistry there were three other rooms identical to the last no one was in the first two in the third was a single man gaunt silverhaired he was floating by the rooms aquarium a frown on his face he was in a vac suit with the helmet in his hand giving the impression he simply didnt want to bother to put it on he looked at reese as she came in there was no fear in his eyes only sadness he spoke as he pushed off from the aquarium floating to the empty alloy ceiling where reeses shot wouldnt hit his experiment by mistake its over he said not that it matters reese thought of steward in the hospital bed dying for something else equally stupid equally futile and filled the mans face with poison darts past the next seal two powers tried to burn her with acid the stuff smoked pointlessly on her ceramic armor while she killed them one of the remaining humans tried to surrender and the other tried to hide in a toilet neither tactic worked she searched the place thoroughly found no one else and disarmed the traps at each of the airlocks there was a pain deep in her skull the air in the suit had begun to taste bad full of sour sweat burnt adrenaline sadness drifted through her at the waste the stupidity of it all twelve more dead and all for nothing reese left the bodies where they laynobody was paying her to clean the place upand used the other personnel lock to return to voidrunner once she was in sight of the ship she pointed one of her microwave antennae at the ship and gave the code signaling success transmit the following to base mandate liquid consolidation a combination of words unlikely to be uttered by accident she cycled through the ships central airlock pain hammered in her brain her spine time to get out of this obscene contraption the door opened targeting displays flashed scarlet on the interior of her faceplate reeses nerves screamed as the wolfs right arm with her arm in it rose the tengauge exploded twice and the impact spun vickers back against the opposite wall he impacted and bounced lightly already dead no reese cried and the wolf moved forward brushing the body aside reeses arms trapped in the suits webbing rose to a combat stance she tried to tug them free targeting displays were still flashing reese tried to take command of the suit through the interface stud it wouldnt respond take cover reese shouted the wolfs gone rogue she didnt know whether the suit was still on transmit or whether anyone was listening the wolf had visible light and ir detectors motion scanners scent detectors sensors that could detect the minute compression wave of a body moving through air there was no way the wolf would miss anyone in the ship given enough time reeses heart thundered in her chest get into vac suits she ordered abandon ship get onto the station try and hold out there chungs voice snapped over the outside speakers where the hell are you at least someone was listening im moving upship toward the control room oh fuck the headsup display indicated the wolf had detected motion from the docking cockpit which meant the armored bulkhead door was open the wolf caught falkland as he was trying to fly out of the cockpit and get to an airlock the flechettes failed to penetrate the exoskeleton so the wolf flew after him caught him bodily reese felt her left hand curling around the back of falklands head the right hand draw back to strike she fought against it falkland was screaming trying to struggle out of the wolfs grip im not doing this reese cried wanting him to know that and closed her eyes her right arm punched out once twice three times the wolf began to move again when reese opened her eyes there was blood and bone spattering the faceplate im still heading upship reese said i dont think the wolf knows where you are chung didnt answer no point reese thought in his sending a radio signal that might give away his position the wolf reached the forward control room then began a systematic search of the ship moving aft reese reported the suits movements hoping to hell hed get away the ship was small and a search wouldnt take long custom thread vickers had told her woven into the targetacquisition unit berger had done it she knew not only wanting to wipe out the station personnel but anyone who knew of cuervos existence she was riding in an extermination cyberdrone now trapped inside its obscene purposeful body mandate liquid consolidation the code had sent the wolf on its rampage the liquidation is mandated consolidate knowledge about cuervo displays flickered on the screen the thing had scented chung reese could do nothing but tell him it was coming chung was by the aft airlock halfway into the rad suit hed need to flee through the airless engine space his face was fixed in an expression of rage steward reese screamed the tengauge barked twice and then the wolf froze the displays were gone the wolf still with considerable momentum continued to drift toward the aft bulkhead it struck and rebounded moving slowly toward chung reese tried to move in the suit but its joints were locked her crashing pulse was the loudest sound in the helmet she licked sweat from her upper lip felt it running down her brows chungs body slowly collapsed in the insignificant gravity of the asteroid drops of blood fell like slowmotion rubies the gravity wasnt enough to break the surface tension and the droplets rested on the deck like ball bearings rolling in the circulating air reeses heart stopped as she realized that the sound of the wolfs aircirculation system had ceased she had only the air in the suit then nothing her mind flailed in panic shouting her cries loud in her ears she tried to move against the locked joints of the wolf the wolf only drifted slowly to the deck its limbs immobile like archangel she thought nothing to look forward to but dying in a suit in a tunnel in the smell of your own fear just like her officers had always wanted she tasted bile and fought it down im using air she thought and clamped down gulping twice trying to control her jackhammer heart her panicked breath chungs furious eyes glared into hers at a distance of about three feet she could see a reflection of the wolf in his metal teeth reese began to move her arms and legs testing the tension of the web there was a pistol under her left arm if she could get to it with her right hand she might be able to shoot her way out of the suit somehow fat chance but still it was something to do anyway she began to move her right arm against the webbing pulling it back blood rubies danced before her eyes she managed to get her hand out of the glove but there was a restraining strap against the back of her elbow that prevented further movement she pushed forward keeping her hand out of the glove then drew back worked at it slowly synchronizing the movement with her breath exhaling to make herself smaller steward she thought would have been quoting zen aphorisms to himself hers were more direct you can get smaller if you want to she thought youve done it before she got free of the elbow strap drew her arm back felt her elbow encounter the wall of the suit she was beginning to pant the air cant be gone this quickly she thought and tried to control panic as she pulled back on her arm as pain scraped along her nerves sweat was coating her body she tried to think herself smaller she could feel warm blood running down her arm the wolf was saturated with the scent of fear reese screamed as her arm came free part agony part exultation she reached across her chest felt the butt of the pistol it was cold in her hand almost weightless where to point it she could try blowing out the faceplate but shed have the barrel within inches of her face and the faceplate was damn near impervious anyway the bullet would probably ricochet right into her head the wolf was too well armored chungs angry glare was making it impossible for her to think reese closed her eyes and tried to think of the schematics shed studied the location of the variablelattice thread that contained the suits instructions behind her she thought pressed against her lower spine was the logic thread that operated the wolfs massive limbs if she could wreck the thread the locked limbs might move she experimented with the pistol there wasnt enough room to completely angle the gun around her body sweat floated in salty globes around her as she thought it through tried desperately to come up with another course of action the air grew foul reese decided that shooting herself with the pistol would be quicker than dying of asphyxiation she tried to crowd as far over to the right as possible curling the gun against her body holding it reversed with her thumb on the trigger the cool muzzle pressed into her side just below the ribs line it up carefully she thought you dont want to have to do this more than once she tried to remember anatomy and what was likely to get hit a kidney adrenal glands heres where i really take it up the ass she thought she screamed building rage and firedand then screamed again from pain sweat bounced against the faceplate spattering in the fierce momentum of the bullets pressure wave the wolfs limbs unlocked and the cyberdrone sagged to the deck reese gave a weak cheer then shrieked again from the pain she had heard it wasnt supposed to hurt when you got hit not right away another lie she thought invented by the officer class there was something wrong with the world with the way it was manifesting itself she realized she was deaf from the pistol blast reese leaned back took a deep breath of foul air now she thought comes the easy part reese managed to put her right arm back into the sleeve then use both armsthe armor thankfully was near weightlessto get herself out of the suit she moved to the sick bay and jabbed endorphinanalogue into her thigh then xrayed herself on the portable machine it looked as if she hadnt hit anything vital but then she wasnt practiced at reading xrays either she patched herself up swallowed antibiotics and then out of nowhere the pain slammed down right through the endorphin every muscle in her body went into spasm reese curled into a ball her body a flaming agony she bounced gently off one wall then another fought shuddering waves of nausea tears poured from her eyes it hurt too much to scream it went on forever for days loaded on endorphins she looted the station moving everything she could into the freighter then pissed bright blood while howling in agony fevers raged in her body she filled herself with antibiotics and went on working thingspeople aliens hallucinationskept reaching at her moving just outside her field of vision sometimes she could hear them talking to her in some strange melodic tongue she grappled voidrunner to the freighters back then lifted off cuervo and triggered the charges she laughed at the bright blossoms of flame in the locks the gush of air that turned to white snow in the cold vacuum and then into a bright rainbow as it was struck by the sun reese accelerated toward earth for as long as she could stand it then cut the engines there was a constant wailing in her ears the cry of the fever in her blood for the next several daysone of them was her birthdayreese hung weightless in her rack fought pain and an endless hot fever and studied the data shed stolen trying to figure out why nine tame scientists were willing to commit murder over it the fever broke finally under the onslaught of antibiotics her urine had old black blood now not bright new crimson she thought she was beginning to figure out what the station crew had been up to it was time to decide where she was going to hide the freighter and the tug were not registered to her and her appearance with them was going to result in awkward questions she thought about forging records of a salecredentials after all were her specialty reese decided to tune in on the broadcasts from earth and see if there were any new places for refugees to run to to her surprise she discovered that rams executive board on prince station had fallen three days before and cheney had been made the new chairman she waited another two days studying the data shed stolen the bottles of strange enzymes and tailored rna she had moved to the freighters cooler and then beamed a call to prince and asked for s c vivekenanda she was told the vice president of communications was busy i can wait she said tell him its waldman kens voice came on almost immediately where are you he asked im coming your way reese told him and i think ive got your architecture of liberation with me but first weve got to cut a deal what the labs inhabitants had been up to wasnt quite what ken had been talking about that gusty spring night in uzbekistan but it was close the brighter suns biologists and artificial intelligence people had been working on a new way of storing data a fast and efficient way faster than variablelattice thread they had succeeded in storing information in human dna it had been tried before genetically altered humanity had been present for a century and the mysteries of the genetic mechanism had been thoroughly mapped there had long been theories that genetic material which succeeded in coding far more information on its tiny strand than any comparable threadbased technology would provide the answer to the endless demand for faster and more efficient means of data storage the theories had always failed when put into practice just because specialists could insert desirable traits in a strand of human dna didnt mean they had the capability of doing it at the speed of light reading the genetic message the strand contained at similar speed or altering the message at will the interactions of ribosomes transfer rna and enzymes were complex and interrelated to the point where the artificial intelligencebiologist types had despaired of trying to control them with current technology alien genetics it turned out were simple compared to the human power dna chains were much shorter containing half the two hundred thousand genes in a human strand without the thousands of repetitions and redundancies that filled human genes their means of reproducing dna were similar but similarly streamlined and the power method of dna reproduction was compatible with human genetics the transfer and message rna were faster cleaner more controllable information transfer had a theoretically astounding speeda human dna strand undergoing replication unwound at rpm power rna combined with human dna made data transfers on thread look like slow motion once the control technology was developed information could be targeted to specific areas of the dna strand the dominant genes could remain untouched but the recessive genes could be altered to contain information nothing could be kept secret when any spy could code information in his own living genetic makeup and no one could discover the spy unless they knew what code he was using and what they were looking for the architecture of liberation riskfree transfer of data it would be years before any of this was possibleprince stations newly hired biologists would have to reconstruct all the stations work and then develop it to the point where it was commercially viable but prince station was going to have its new source of technology and reese a new source of incomeshed asked for a large down payment in advance of a small royalty that should nevertheless make her a billionaire in the next forty years shed asked for that plus princes help in disposing of a few other problems reese looked down at her double lying on a bed in a room that smelled of death her twins eyes were closed her breasts rose and fell under a pale blue sheet bile rose in reeses throat reese was blonde again her nose a little straighter her mouth a little wider she had a new kidney a new eardrum new fingerprints new blue irises she liked the new look the double looked good too two bodies a man and a woman were sprawled at the foot of the bed assassins sent by berger to kill her they had followed a carefully laid trail to her location here on prince and when they came into her apartment theyd been shot dead by princes security men firing from concealment in the wide bedroom closet reese had waited safely in the next room her nerves burning with adrenaline fire while she clutched kens hand her nerves alert for the sound of gunfire she watched her double breathe under its sheet then the security people came for the mannikin they were going to kill it the double was reeses clone her face had been restructured the same way reeses had and her artificial eyes were blue her muscles had been exercised via electrode until they were as firm as reeses there was even a metal pin in her ankle a double of the one reese carried the clone was an idiother brain had never contained reeses mind the idea was to make it appear that reese and the assassins had killed each other reese looked down at her double and felt her mouth go dry the security people were padding around the room trying to make appearances perfect hot anger blazed behind reeses eyes fuck this she thought she pried the pistol out of one of the assassins hands and raised it she was a tunnel rat she thought an animal a coward disloyal sometimes she needed reminding its not murder ken said trying to help yes it is reese said she raised the killers gunan ideal assassins weapon a compressedair fletcherand fired a silent dart into the mannikins thigh then she closed her eyes not wanting to see the dying things last spasm instead she saw steward dying in his own silent bed and felt a long grey wave of sadness she opened her eyes and looked at ken its also survival she said yes it is a cold tremor passed through reeses body i wasnt talking about the clone while kens assistants made it look as if she and the assassins had killed each other reese stepped through the hidden door into the next apartment her bag was already packed her identity and passport ready credentials she thought her specialty that and killing helpless people group rates available she wanted to live by water again new zealand sounded right it was getting to be spring there now youll come back ken asked maybe but in the meantime youll know where to send the royalties there was pain in kens eyes in stewards eyes attachments were weakness always a danger reese had a vision of the street people parting meeting dying in silence alone she wouldnt be safe on prince and couldnt be a part of kens revolution she was afraid she knew what it was going to turn into once it became the sole possessor of a radical new technology and what that would turn ken into reese shouldered her bag her hands were still trembling sadness beat slowly in her veins she was thirtyseven now she thought maybe there were sports she shouldnt indulge in maybe she should just leave enjoy your new architecture she said and took off she had been up here too long this placeand everyplace else shed

a moment not a good dream but recent truth all part of what surrounds him now a bit less than it was when it was happening because it was gated in through human eyes and ears and a human notices much more and far less than what truly goes on in the world the ground comes up with a bonepenetrating thump and dirt showers down like rain over and over again and defranco wriggles up to his knees with the clods rattling off his armor he may be moving to a place where a crater will be in a moment and the place where he is may become one in that same moment there is no time to think about it there is only one way off that exposed hillside which is to go and keep going defranco writhes and wriggles against the weight of the armor blind for a moment as the breathing system fails to give him as much as he needs but his throat is already raw with too much oxygen in three days out he curses the rig far more intimate a frustration than the enemy on this last long run to the shelter of the deep tunnels he was going home was john defranco if home was still there and if the shells that had flattened their shield in this zone had not flattened it all along the line and wiped out the base the elves had finally learned where to hit them on this weapons system too that was what and defranco cursed them one and all while the sweat ran in his eyes and the oxymix tore his throat and giddied his brain on this side and that shells shocked the air and the ground and his bones and not for the first time concussion flung him bodily through the air and slammed him to the churned ground bruised and battered and but for the armor dead and shrapnelriddled immediately fragments of wood and metal rang off the hardsuit and in their gravitydriven sequence of clods of earth rained down in a patter mixed with impacts of rocks and larger chunks and then not having been directly in the strike zone and dead he got his sweating human limbs up again by heaving the armorweight into its hydraulic jointlocks and desperately hurled fifty kilos of unsupple ceramics and machinery and ninety of quaking human flesh into a waddling exhausted run run and fall and run and stagger into a walk when the dizziness got too much and never waste time dodging but somewhen the jolts stopped and the shellmade earthquakes stopped and defranco laboring along the hazard of the shellcratered ground became aware of the silence his staggering steps slowed as he turned with the awkward footplanting the armor imposed to take a look behind him the whole smoky valley swung across the narrowed view of his visor all lit up with ghosty green readout that flickered madly and told him his eyes were jerking in panic calling up more than he wanted he feared that he was deaf it was that profound a silence to his shocked ears he heard the hum of the fans and the ventilator in the suit but there would be that sound forever he heard it in his dreams so it could be in his head and not coming from his ears he hit the ceramicshielded back of his hand against his ceramiccoated helmet and heard the thump if distantly so his hearing was all right there was just the smoke and the desolate cratering of the landscape to show him where the shells had hit and suddenly one of those ghosty green readouts in his visor jumped and said and started ticking off so he lumbered about to get a look up the viewplate compensating for the sky in a series of flickers and darkenings the reading kept up ticking away and he could see nothing in the sky but base was still there it was transmitting and he knew what was happening the numbers reached critical and he swung about again and looked toward the plain as the first strikes came in and the smoke went up anew he stood there on the hillcrest and watched the airstrike he had called down half an eternity ago pound hell out of the plains he knew the devastation of the beams and the shells and his first and immediate thought was that there would be no more penetrations of the screen and human lives were saved he had outrun the chaos and covered his own mistake in getting damn near on top of the enemy installation trying to find it and his second thought hard on the heels of triumph was that there was too much noise in the world already too much death to deal with vastly too much and he wanted to cry with the relief and the fear of being alive and moving good and proper the base scout found the damn firepoint tripped a trap and the whole damn airforce had to come pull him out of the fire with a damn million credits worth of shells laid down out there destroying ten billion credits worth of somebody elses congratulations defranco a shiver took him he turned his back to the sight cued his locator on and began to walk slowly slowly one foot in front of the other and if he had not rested now and again setting the limbs on his armor on lock he would have fallen down as it was he walked with his mouth open and his ears full of the harsh sound of his own breathing he walked lost and disoriented till his unit picked up his locator signal and beaconed in the lost boy they never hoped to get back you did us great damage then says the elf it was the last effort we could make and we knew you would take out our last weapons we knew that you would do it quickly and that then you would stop we had learned to trust your habits even if we didnt understand them when the shelling came towers fell and there were over a thousand of us dead in the city and you keep coming we will until its over or until were dead defranco stares at the elf a moment the room is a small and sterile place showing no touches of habitation but all those small signs of humanitya quiet bedroom done in yellow and green pastels a table two chairs an unused bed they have faced each other over this table for hours they have stopped talking theory and begun thinking only of the recent past and defranco finds himself lost in elvish thinking again it never quite makes sense the assumptions between the lines are not human assumptions though the elfs command of the language is quite thorough at last defeated by logicless logic i went back to my base says defranco i called down the fire but i just knew the shelling had stopped we were alive that was all we knew nothing personal there was a bath and there was a meal and a little extra ration of whiskey hq doled the whiskey out as special privilege and sanitysaver and the scarcity of it made the posts hoard it and ration it with downtothegram precision and he drank his three days ration and his bonus drink one after the other when he had scrubbed his rig down and taken a long long bath beneath the pipe he took his three days whiskey all at once because three days out was what he was recovering from and he sat in his corner in his shorts the regs going about their business all of them recognizing a shaken man on a serious drunk and none of them rude or crazy enough to bother him now not with congratulations for surviving not with offers of bed not with a stray glance the regs were not in his command he was not strictly anywhere in the chain of command they belonged to being special ops and assigned there for the reg co to use when he had to he was nd lt john r defranco if anyone bothered and no one did hereabouts in the bunkers he was special ops and his orders presently came from the senior trooper captain who was the acting co all along this section of the line the major having got hisself lately dead themselves waiting on a replacement thank you sir and maam while higher brass kept themselves cool and dry and safe behind the shields on the ground a thousand miles away and up in orbit and john defranco special op and walking target kept his silver worldandmoon pin and his blue beret and his fieldbrowns all tucked up and out of the damp in his moldproof plastic kit at the end of his bunk the rig was his working uniform the damned cursed rig that found a new spot to rub raw every time he realigned it and he sat now in his shorts and drank the first glass quickly the next and the next and the next in slow sips and blinked sometimes when he remembered to the regs male and female moved about the underground barracks in their shorts and their ts like khaki ghosts whose gender meant nothing to him or generally to each other when bunks got doublefilled it was friendship or boredom or outright desperation all their talk was rough and getting rougher and their eyes when real pinneddownfordays boredom set in were hell because they had been out here and down here on this world for thirtyseven months by the tally on bunker s main entry wall while the elves were still holding still digging in and still dying at unreasonable rates without surrender get prisoners hq said in its blithe simplicity but prisoners suicided elves checked out just by wanting to die establish a contact hq said talk at them meaning by any inventive means they could but they had failed at that for years in space and they expected no better luck onworld talking to an elf meant coming into range with either drones or live bodies elves cheerfully shot at any target they could get elves had shot at the first human ship they had met twenty years ago and they had killed fifteen hundred men women and children at corby point for reasons no one ever understood they kept on shooting at human ships in sporadic incidents that built to a crisis then humanityall three humanities union and alliance and remote sullen earthhad decided there was no restraint possible with a species that persistently attacked modern human ships on sight with equipage centuries less advanceddo we have to wait earths consensus was till they do get their hands on the advanced stuff till they hit a world earth worried about such things obsessively convinced of its paramount worldbound holiness and importance in the universe the cradle of humankind union worried about other thingslike breakdown of order like its colonies slipping loose while it was busy union pushed for speed earth wanted to go back to its own convolute affairs and alliance wanted the territory preferring to make haste slowly and not create permanent problems for itself on its flank there were rumors of other things too like alliance picking up signals out this direction of something other than elves real reason to worry it was at least sure that the war was being pushed and pressed and shoved and the elves shoved back elves died and died their ships being no match for humanmake once humans took after them in earnest and interdicted the jumppoints that let them near human space but elves never surrendered and never quit trying now what do we do the joint command asked themselves collectively and figurativelybecause they were dealing out bloody unpalatable slaughter against a doggedly determined and underequipped enemy and union and earth wanted a quick solution but union as usual took the long view and on this single point there was consensus if we take out every ship they put out here and they retreat how long does it take before they come back at us with more advanced armaments were dealing with lunatics get through to them the word went out from hq take them out of our space and carry the war home to them weve got to make the impression on them nowor take options no one wants later twenty years ago underestimating the tenacity of the elves removed from the shipping lanes and confined to a single world the war had sunk away to a local difficulty alliance still put money and troops into it union still cooperated in a certain measure earth sent adventurers and enlistees that often were crazier than the elves base culled those in a hurry so for seventeen years the matter boiled on and on and elves went on dying and dying in their few and illequipped ships until the joint command decided on a rougher course quickly took out the elves pathetic little space station dropped troops onto the elvish world and fenced human bases about with antimissile screens to fight a limited and onworld warwhile elvish weaponry slowly got more basic and more primitive and the troops drank their little measures of imported whiskey and went slowly crazy and humans closely tied to the elvish war adapted in humanitys own lunatic way well behind the lines that had come to exist on the elves own planet humans settled in and built permanent structures and scientists came to study the elves and the threatened flora and fauna of a beautiful and earthlike world while some elvish centers ignored the war and the bombing went on and on in an inextricable mess because neither elves nor humans knew how to quit or knew the enemy enough to know how to disengage or figure out what the other wanted and the war could go on and onsince presumably the computers and the records in those population centers still had the design of starships in them and no enemy which had taken what the elves had taken by now was ever going to forget there were no negotiations once just once humans had tried to approach one of the few neutral districts to negotiate and it simply and instantly joined the war so after all the study and all the effort humans lived on the elves world and had no idea what to call them or what the worlds real name was because the damn elves had blown their own space station at the last and methodically destroyed every record the way they destroyed every hamlet before its fall and burned every record and every artifact they died and they died and they died and sometimes but seldom nowadays they took humans with them like the time when they were still in space and hit the base at ticon with cee rocks and left nothing but dust thirty thousand dead and not a way in hell to find the pieces that was the incident after which the joint command decided to take the elves out of space and nowadays humanity invested cities they never planned to take and they tore up roads and took out all the elves planes and they tore up agriculture with nonnuclear bombs and shells trying not to ruin the world beyond recovery hoping eventually to wear the elves down but the elves retaliated with gas and chemicals which humans had refrained from using humans interdicted supply and still the elves managed to come up with the wherewithal to strike through their base defense here as if supply were endless and they not starving and the world still green and undamaged defranco drank and drank with measured slowness watching regs go to and fro in the slow dance of their own business they were good this delta company of the eighth they did faithfully what regs were supposed to do in this war which was to hold a base and keep roads secure that humans used and to build landing zones for supply and sometimes to go out and get killed inching humanitys way toward some goal the joint command understood and which from here looked only like some other damn shellpocked hill defrancos job was to locate such hills and to find a prisoner to take standing orders and to figure out the enemy if he could mostly just to find hills and sometimes to get his company into taking one and right now he was no more damn good because they had gotten as close to this nameless city as there were hills and vantages to make it profitable and after that they went onto the flat and did what take the place inch by inch street by street and discover every damn elf they met had suicided the elves would do it on them so in the villages south of here they had saved the elves the bother and got nothing for their trouble but endless measured carnage and smoothskinned corpses that drew the small vermin and the huge winged birdstheyve been careful with their ecology the science bureau reckoned in their endless reports in some fools paper on large winged creatures chances of survival if a dominant species were not very careful of them or the damn birds are bloodyminded mean and tougher than the elves defranco mused in his alcoholic fog knowing that nothing was in all space and creation more bloodyminded than the elves he had seen a young elf child holding another both stone dead baby locked in babys arms they love dammit they loveand he had wept while he staggered away from the ruins of a little elvish town seeing more and more such sightsbecause the elves had touched off bombs in their own town center and turned it into a firestorm but the two babies had been lying there unburned and no one wanted to touch them or to look at them finally the birds came and the regs shot at the birds until the co stopped it because it was a waste it was killing a noncombatant lifeform and that o god was against the rules most of all the co stopped it because it was a fraying of human edges because the birds always were there and the birds were the winners every time and the damn birds like the damn elves came again and again no matter that shots blew them to puffs of feathers stubborn like the elves crazy as everything else on the planet human and elf it was catching defranco nursed the last whiskey in the glass nursed it with hands going so numb he had to struggle to stay awake he was a quiet drunk never untidy he neatly drank the last and fell over sideways limp as a corpse and tender mercy to a hillfinding branch of the service the hilltaking and roadbuilding regs regarded as a sometimes natural enemyone of the women came and got the glass from his numbed fingers and pulled a blanket over him they were still human here they tried to be there was nothing more to be done says the elf that was why we knew that you were coming closer and that our time was limited his long white fingers touch the tablesurface the white plastic table in the ordinary little bedroom we died in great numbers defranco and it was cruel that you showed us only slowly what you could do we could have taken you out from the first you knew that defrancos voice holds an edge of frustration of anguish elf couldnt you ever understand that you always gave us hope we could win and so we fought and so we still fight until the peace my friend franc francit was a fierce low voice and defranco came out of it in the dark with his heart doubletiming and the instant realization it was dibs talking to him in that low tone and wanting him out of that blanket which meant wirerunners or worse a night attack but dibs grabbed his arms to hold him still before he could flail about franc we got a move out there jake and cats headed out down the tunnel the lieutenants gone to m but ms on the line they want you out there they want a spotter up on hill doublequick uh defranco rubbed his eyes uh sitting upright was brutal standing was worse he staggered two steps and caught the main shell of his armor off the rack number suit the lousy stinking armor that always smelled of human or mud or the purse in the ducts and the awful sicksweet cleaner they wiped it out with when they hung it up he held the plastron against his body and dibs started with the clips in the dim light of the single watt they kept going to find the latrine at nightdamn damn i gotta he eluded dibs and got to the toilet and by now the whole place was astir with shadowfigures like a scene out of a goldlighted hell he swigged the stinging mouthwash they had on the shelf by the toilet and did his business while dibs caught him up from behind and finished the hooks on his left side damn get him going the sergeant said and trying dibs said as others hauled defranco around and began hooking him up like a baby into his clothes one piece and the other the boots leg and groinpieces the sleeves the gloves the belly clamp and the backpack and the poweronhis joints ached he stood there swaying to one and another tug on his body and took the helmet into his hands when dibs handed it to him go go the sergeant said who had no more power to give a special op any specific orders than he could fly but hq was in a stew they needed his talents out there and defranco let the regs shove him all they liked it was his accommodation with these regs when there was no peace anywhere else in the world and once a dozen of these same regs had come out into the heat after him which he never quite forgot so he let them hook his weaponskit on then ducked his head down and put the damned helmet on and gave it the locking halftwist as he headed away from the safe light of the barracks pit into the long tunnel splashing along the low spots on the plastic grid that kept heavy armored feet from sinking in the mud code nightsight he told the suit aloud all wobbly and shivery from too little sleep and it read his hoarse voice patterns and gave him a filmy image of the tunnel in front of him code id he told it and it started telling the two troopers somewhere up the tunnel that he was there and on his way he got readout back as cat acknowledged laygp the green numbers ghosted up in his visor telling him jake and cat had elves and they had them quasisolid in the distantsensors which would have been tripped downland and they themselves were staying where they were and taking no chances on betraying the location of the tunnel he cut the id and cat and jake cut off too theyve got to us defranco thought the damned elves got through our screen and now theyve pushed through on foot and its going to be hell to pay back behind him the rest of the troops would be suiting up and making a more leisurely prep for a hard night to come the elves rarely got as far as human bunkers they tried they were at close range and with handweapons deadly the dying was not all on the elves side if they got to you a cold sweat had broken out under the suit his head ached with a vengeance and the suit weight on his knees and on his back when he bent and it stank with disinfectant that smelled like some damn tree from some damn forest on the world that had spawned every human born he knew that but it failed as perfume and failed at masking the stink of terror and of the tunnels in the cold wet breaths the suit took in when it was not on selfseal he knew nothing about earth only dimly remembered pell which had trained him and shipped him here by stages to a world no one bothered to give a name elfland when high hq was being whimsical neverneverland the regs called it after some old fairy tale because from it a soldier never never came home again they had a song with as many verses as there were bitches of the things a soldier in elfland never found wheres my discharge from this war why its neverneverwhere my friend well whens the next ship off this world why its neverneverwhen my friend and times what weve got most of and time is what we spend and time is what weve got to do in neverneverland he hummed this to himself in a voice jolted and crazed by the exertion he wanted to cry like a baby he wanted someone to curse for the hour and his interrupted rest most of all he wanted a few days of quiet on this front just a few days to put his nerves back together again and let his head stop aching run and run and run in a suit that keeps you from the gas and most of the shells the elves can throwexcept for a few except for the joints and the visor because the elves have been working for twenty years studying how to kill you and air runs out and filters fail and every access you have to elfland is a way for the elves to get at you like the tunnel openings like the airvents like the power plant that keeps the whole base and strungout tunnel systems functioning troopers scatter to defend these points and you run and run belatedly questioning why troopers want a special op at a particular point where the tunnel most nearly approaches the elves on their plain why me why herebecause fool hq wants closeup reconnaissance which was what they wanted the last time they sent you out in the dark beyond the safe pointstwice now and they expect you to go out and do it again because the elves missed you last time damn them all with the thought that they will use you till the bone breaks and the flesh refuses and then a twoweek rest and out to the lines again they give you a medical as far as the field hospital and there they give you vitamins two shots of antibiotic a bottle of pills and send you out again we got worse the meds say then there always are worse till youre dead defranco looks at the elf across the table in the small room and remembers how it was the smell of the tunnels the taste of fear ii so whatre the gals like on this world why you nevernevermind my friend well whatre the guys like on this world well you neverneverask my friend they sent me out there defranco says to the elf and the elfa human might have nodded but elves have no such habitstares gravely as they sit opposite each other hands on the table you alway say they says the elf we say we decided but you do things differently maybe it is we defranco says maybe it is at the bottom of things we sometimes it doesnt look that way i think even now you dont understand why we do what we do i dont really understand why you came here or why you listen to me or why you stay nowbut we wont understand i dont think we two will others maybe you want what i want thats what i trust most you believe itll work for us yes for elves absolutely even if its a lie it will work but if its not a lie can you make it true you dont believe thati have to find words for thisbut i dont understand that either how you feel what you do the elf reaches across the table and slim white hands with overtint like oil on water catch at brown matteskinned fingers whose nails the elf has none are broken and rough it was no choice to you it never was even a choice to you to destroy us to the heart and the center perhaps it wasnt to stay i have a deep feeling toward you defranco i had this feeling toward you from when i saw you first i knew that you were what i had come to find but whether you were the helping or the damning force i didnt know then i only knew that what you did when you saw us was what humans had always done to us and i believed you would show me why defranco moved and sat still a while by turns in the dark in the stink and the strictures of his rig while somewhere two ridges away there were two nervous regs encamped in the entry to the tunnel sweltering in their own hardsuits and not running their own pumps and fans any more than he was running hisbecause elvish hearing was legendary the rigs made noise and it was hard enough to move in one of the bastards without making a racket someone in hq suspected elves could pick up the running noises or had other senses but without those fans and pumps the belowtheneck part of the suit had no cooling and got warm even in the night and the gloves and the helmets had to stay on constantly when anyone was outside it was the rule no elf ever got a look at a live human except at places like the eighths gamma company perhaps not there either elves were generally thorough defranco had the kneejoints on lock at the moment which let him have a solid prop to lean his weary knees and backside against he leaned there easing the shivers and the quakes out of his latelywakened and sleepdeprived limbs before he rattled in his armor and alerted a whole hillside full of elves it was not a wellshielded position he had taken it had little cover except the hill itself and these hills had few enough trees that the fires and the shells had spared but green did struggle up amid the soot and bushes grew on the line down on valley level that had been an elvish road three years ago his nightsight scanned the brush in shadowimages something touched the sensors as he rested there on watch a curious whisper of a sound and an amber readout ghosted up into his visor dots rippling off in sequence in the direction the pickup came from it was not the wind the internal computer zeroed out the white sound of wind and suitnoise it was anomalies it brought through and amplified and what it amplified now had the curious regular pulse of enginesound defranco ordered the lock off his limbs slid lower on the hill and moved on toward one with better vantage of the road so it came up from the westcarefully pausing at irregular intervals as he worked round to get into position to spot that direction he still had his locator output off so did everyone else back at the base hq had no idea now what sophistication the elves had gained at eavesdropping and homing in on the locators and how much they could pick up with locators of their own it was only sure that while some elvish armaments had gotten more primitive and patchwork their computer tech had nothing at all wrong with it defranco settled again on a new hillside and listened wishing he could scratch a dozen maddening itches and wishing he were safe somewhere else the whole thing had a disasterfeeling about it from the start the elves doing something they had never done he could only think about dead gamma company and what might have happened to them before the elves got to them and gassed the bunker and fought their way into it past the few that had almost gotten into their rigs in time had the special op been out there watching too had the one at bunker made a wrong choice and had it all started this way the night they died the enginesound was definite defranco edged higher up the new hill and got down flat belly down on the ridge he thumbed the magnification plate into the visor and got the handheld cameras snakehead optics over the ridge on the theory it was a smaller target and a preferable target than himself with far better nightsight the filmy nightsight image came back of the road while the sound persisted it was distant his ears and the readout advised him distant yet racing the first red edge of a murky dawn that showed far off across the plain and threatened daylight out here he still sent no transmission the orders were stringent the base either had to remain ignorant that there was a vehicle coming up the road or he had to go back personally to report it and lose track of whateveritwas out here just when it was getting near enough to do damage damn the lack of specials to team with out here in the hot spots and damn the leadfooted regs he had to go it alone decide things alone hoping jake and cat did the right thing in their spot and hoping the other regs stayed put and he hated it he edged off this hill keeping it between him and the ruined shellpocked road and began to move to still a third point of vantage stalking as silently as any man in armor could manage and fervently he hoped that the enginesound was not a decoy and that nothing was getting behind him the elves were deceptive as well and they were canny enemies with extraordinary hearing he hoped now that the enginesound had deafened thembut no elf was really fool enough to be coming up the road like this it was a decoy it had to be there was nothing else it could be and he was going to fall into it nosedown if he was not careful he settled bellydown on the next slope and got the camerasnake over the top froze the suitjoints and lay inert in that overheated ceramic shell breathing hard through a throat abused by oxygen and whiskey blinking against a hangover headache to end all headaches that the close focus of the visor readout only made worse his nose itched a place on his scalp itched behind his ear he stopped cataloging the places he itched because it was driving him crazy instead he blinked and rolled his eyes calling up readout on the passive systems and concentrated on that blink blinkblink numbers jumped the computer had come up with a range as it got passive echo off some hill and checked it against the local topology programmed into its memory damn close the computer handed him the velocity kph with the and the wobbling back and forth into the s defranco held his breath and checked his handlauncher loading a set of armorpiercing rounds in quiet quiet as a man could move the clamp went down as softly as long practice could lower it and at last a ridiculous open vehicle came jouncing and whining its way around potholes and shell craters and generally making a noisy and erratic progress it was in a considerable hurry despite the potholes and there were elves in it four of them all pale in their robes and one of them with the cold glitter of metal about hisher person the one to the right of the driver the car bounced and wove and zigged and zagged up the hilly road with no slackening of speed inviting a shot for all it was worth decoy suicide they were crazy as elves could be and that was completely they were headed straight for the hidden bunker and it was possible they had gas or a bomb in that car or that they just planned to get themselves shot in a straightforward way whatever they had in mind but they were going right where they could do the most damage defranco unlocked his ceramic limbs which sagged under his weight until he was down on his belly and he slowly brought his rifle up and inched his way up on his belly so it was his vulnerable head over the ridge this time he shook and he shivered and he reckoned there might be a crater where he was in fair short order if they had a launcher in that car and he gave them time to get it set his way but pushing and probing at elves was part of his job and these were decidedly anomalous he put a shot in front of the car and half expected elvish suicides on the spot the car swerved and jolted into a pothole as the shell hit it careened to a stop and he held himself where he was his heart pounding away and himself not sure why he had put the shot in front and not into the middle of them like a sensible man in spite of hqs orders but the elves recovered from their careening and the car was stopped and instead of blowing themselves up immediately or going for a launcher of their own one of the elves bailed out over the side while the helmetsensor picked up the attempted motorstart coughwhine the car lurched the elvish driver made a wild turn but the one who had gotten out just stood therestood staring up and lifted his hands together defranco lay on his hill and the elves who had gotten the car started swerved out of the pothole it had stuck itself in and lurched off in escape not suicidewhile the one elf in the robe with the metal border just stood there the first live prisoner anyone had ever taken staring up at him selfoffered you damn well stand still he yelled down at the elf on outside com and thought of the gas and the chemicals and thought that if elves had come up with a disease that also got to humans here was a way of delivering it that was cussed enough and crazy enough for them human a shrill voice called up to him human defranco was for the moment paralyzed an elf knew what to call them an elf talked an elf stood there staring up at his hill in the beginnings of dawn and all of a sudden nothing was going the way it ever had between elves and humankind at least if it had happened before no human had ever lived to tell about it human the same voice calleduumann as best high elvish voices could manage it the elf was not suiciding the elf showed no sign of wanting to do that and defranco lay and shivered in his armor and felt a damnable urge to wipe his nose which he could not reach or to get up and run for his life which was a fools act worse his bladder suddenly told him it was full urgently taking his mind down to a ridiculous small matter in the midst of trying to get home alive the dawn was coming up the way it did across the plain light spreading like a flood so fast in the bizarre angle of the land here that it ran like water on the surface of the plain and the elf stood there while the light of dawn grew more showing the elf more clearly than defranco had ever seen one of the enemy alive beautiful the way elves were not in a human way looking in its robes like some cross between man and something spindly and humanskinned and insectoid the uptilted ears never stopped moving but the average of their direction was toward him nervouslike what does he want why does he stand there why did they throw him out a target a distraction elvish cussedness defranco waited and waited and the sun came up while somewhere in the tunnels there would be troopers wondering and standing by their weapons ready to go on selfseal against gas or whatever these lunatics had brought there was light enough now to make out the red of the robes that fluttered in the breeze and light enough to see the elfs hands which lookedwhich looked crazily enough to be tied together the dawn came on water became an obsessive thought defranco was thirsty from the whiskey and agonized between the desire for a drink from the tube near his mouth or the fear one more drop of water in his system would make it impossible to ignore his bladder and he thought about it and thought about it because it was a long wait and a long walk back and relieving himself outside the suit was a bitch on the one hand and on the inside was damnable discomfort but it did get worse and while life and death tottered back and forth and his fingers clutched the launcher and he faced an elf who was surely up to something that small decision was all he could think of clearlyit was easier to think of than what wanted thinking out like what to do and whether to shoot the elf outright counter to every instruction and every order hq had given because he wanted to get out of this place but he did notand finally he solved both problems took his drink laid the gun down on the ridge like it was still in his hands performed the necessary maneuver to relieve himself outside the suit as he stayed as flat as he could then he put himself back together collected his gun and lurched up to his feet with small whines of the assisting jointlocks the elf never moved in all of this and defranco motioned with the gun get up herenot expecting the elf to understand either themotion or the shout but the elf came slowly as if the hill was all his it had been once and he owned it the elf stopped still on the slant at a speaking distance no more and stood there with his hands tied his defranco decided by the height of him the elfs white skin all but glowed in the early dawn the bare skin of the face and arms against the dark metaledged red of his robe and the large eyes were set on him and the ears twitched and quivered with small pulses i am your prisoner the elf said plain as any human and defranco stood there with his heart hammering away at his ribs why defranco asked he was mad he was quite mad and somewhere he had fallen asleep on the hillside or elvish gas had gotten to him through the open ventshe was a fool to have gone on open circulation and he was dying back there somewhere and not talking at all the elf lifted his bound hands i came here to find you it was not a perfect accent it was what an elvish mouth could come up with it had music in it and defranco stood and stared and finally motioned with the gun up the hill move he said walk without demur his prisoner began to do that in the direction he had indicated what did i do that humans always do defranco asks the elf and the grave seacolored eyes flicker with changes amusement perhaps or distress you fired at us says the elf in his soft songlike voice and then you stopped and didnt kill me it was a warning to stop so simple god what else do you think the elfs eyes flicker again there is gold in their depths and gray and his ears flick nervously defranco defranco you still dont know why we fight and i dont truly know what you meant are you telling me the truth we never wanted to fight it was a warning even animals for gods sakeunderstand a warning shot the elf blinks and someone in another room stirs in a chair and curses his own blindness aggression and the birds different tropisms all the way through the ecostructure the elf spreads his hands i dont know what you mean i never know what can we know that you were there for the same reason i was were you i dont know i dont even know that we never wanted a war do you understand that at least you wanted us to stop so we told you the same we sent our ships to hold those places which were ours and you kept coming to them they were ours now they are the elfs face is grave and still defranco a mistake was made a ship of ours fired on yours and this was a mistake perhaps it was me who fired whats in this elfs mind fear when a ship will not go away whats in this humans mind fear when we dont go away it was a stupid thing it was a mistake it was our region our territory you think you owned the place we were in it we were there and this ship came say that i wasnt there and i heard how it happened this was a frightened elf who made a stupid mistake this elf was surprised by this ship and he didnt want to run and give up this jumppoint it was ours you were in it we wanted you to go and you stayed so you blew up an unarmed ship yes i did it i destroyed all the others you destroyed ours our space station you killed thousands of us i killed thousands of you not me and not you elf thats twenty years dammit and you werent there and i wasnt there i did it i say i did and you killed thousands of us we werent coming to make a war we were coming to straighten it out do you understand that we werent yet willing now things are different for gods sakewhy did you let so many die you never gave us defeat enough you were cruel defranco not to let us know we couldnt winthat was very cruel it was very subtle even now im afraid of your cruelty dont you understand yet what do i understand that youve died in thousands that you make long war i thought you would kill me on the hill on the road and when you called me i had both hope and fear hope that you would take me to higher authority fearwell i am bone and nerve defranco and i never knew whether you would be cruel the elf walked and walked he might have been on holiday his hands tied in front of him his red robes aglitter with their gold borders in the dawn he never tired he carried no weight of armor and defranco went on selfseal and spoke through the mike when he had to give the elf directions germ warfare maybe the elf had a bomb in his gut but it began to settle into defranco that he had done it he had done it after years of trying he had himself a live and willing prisoner and his lower gut was queasy with outright panic and his knees felt like mush whats he up to whats he doing whys he walk like thatdamn theyll shoot him on sight somebody could see him first and shoot him and i cant break silencemaybe thats what im supposed to do maybe thats how they overran gamma company but a prisoner a prisoner speaking human language whered you learn he asked the elf whered you learn to talk human the elf never turned never stopped walking a prisoner who still alive no no slender and graceful as a reed and burning as a fire and white as beach sand no placidly rage rose in defranco a blinding urge to put his rifle butt in that straight spine to muddy and bloody the bastard and make him as dirty and as hurting as himself but the professional rose up in him too and the burned hillsides went on and on as they climbed and they walked the elf just in front of him until they were close to the tunnels and in imminent danger of a human misunderstanding he turned his id and locator on but they would pick up the elf on his sensors too and that was no good its defranco he said over the com i got a prisoner get hq and get me a transport silence from the other end he cut off the output figuring they had it by now stop he said to the elf on outside audio and he stood and waited until two suited troopers showed up walking carefully down the hillside from a direction that did not lead to any tunnel opening damn came cats female voice over his pickup daamn in a tone of wonder and defranco at first thought it was admiration of him and what he had done and then he knew with some disgust it was wonder at the elf it was a human woman looking at the prettiest cleanest thing she had seen in three long years icy fastidious cat who was picky what she slept with and maybe her partner jake picked it up because huh he said in quite a different tone but quiet quiet the way the elf looked at their faceless faces as if he still owned the whole world and meant to take it back its franc jake said then into the com directed at the base and hes right hes got a live one damn you should see this bastard iii so wheres the generals in this war why theyre neverneverhere my friend well whatll we do until they come well you neverneverask my friend i was afraid too defranco says i thought you might have a bomb or something we were afraid youd suicide if anyone touched you that was why we kept you sitting all that time outside ah says the elf with a delicate move of his hands ah i thought it was to make me angry like all the rest you did but you sat with me and this was hopeful i was thirsty i hoped for a drink that was mostly what i thought about we think too muchelves and humans we both think too much id have given you a drink of water for gods sake i guess no one even thought i wouldnt have taken it dammit why unless you drank with me unless you shared what you had do you see fear of poison no you mean just my giving it sharing it yes is pride so much again the elf touches defrancos hand as it rests on the table a nervous delicate gesture the elfs ears twitch and collapse and lift again trembling we always go off course here i still fail to understand why you fight dammit i dont understand why you cant understand why a mand give you a drink of water not to hurt you not to prove anything for the love of god mercy you ever learn that word being decent sos everything decent doesnt go to hell and we dont act like damn animals the elf stares long and soberly his small mouth has few expressions it forms its words carefully is this why you pushed us so long to show us your control no dammit to hang onto it so we can find a place to stop this bloody war its all we ever wanted then why did you start not to have you push us a blink of seacolored eyes now now were understanding were like each other but you wont stop dammit it you wouldnt stop you havent stopped yet people are still dying out there on the front throwing themselves away without a thing to win nothing thats not like us in starting war were alike but not in ending it you take years quickly we show what we can do then both sides know so we make peace you showed us long cruelty and we wouldnt give ourselves up to you what could we expect is it that easy defranco begins to shiver clenches his hands together on the tabletop and leans there arms folded youre crazy elf angan my personal name is angan a hundred damn scientists out there trying to figure out how you work and its that damn simple i dont think so i think we maybe went off course again but we came close we at least see there was a mistake thats the important thing thats why i came defranco looked desperately at his watch at the minutes ticking away he covers the face of it with his hand and looks up his brown eyes show anguish the colonel said id have three hours its going its going too fast yes and we still havent found out why i dont think we ever will only you share with me now defranco here in our little time the elf sat just sat quietly with his hands still tied on the open hillside because the acting co had sent word no elf was setting foot inside the bunker system and no one was laying hands on him to search him but the troopers came out one by one in the long afternoon and had their look at himone after another of them took the trouble to put on the faceless uncomfortable armor just to come out and stand and stare at what they had been fighting for all these years damn was what most of them said in private on the com their suits to his suit damn or variants on that theme we got that transport coming in the reg lieutenant said when she came out and brought him his kit then unlike herself good job franc thanks defranco said claiming nothing and he sat calmly beside his prisoner on the barren shellpocked hill by a dead charcoal tree dont shake him word had come from the co keep him real happydont change the situation and dont threaten him and dont touch him for fear of spontaneous suicide so no one came to lay official claim to the elf either not even the captain came but the word had gone out to base and to hq and up defranco did not doubt to orbiting ships because it was the best news a frontline post had had to report since the war started maybe it was dreams of leaving elfland that brought the regs out here on pilgrimage to see this wonder and the lieutenant went away when she had stared at him so long hope defranco turned that over and over in his mind and probed at it like a tongue into a sore tooth promotion out of the field no more mud no more runs like yesterday no more no more no more the man who broke the elfland war and cracked the elves and brought in the key to let it all end for good winning maybe maybe he looked at the elf who sat there with his back straight and his eyes wandering to this and that to the movement of wind in a forlorn last bit of grass the drift of a cloud in elflands blue sky the horizons and the dead trees you got a name he was careful asking anything but the elf had talked before the elf looked at him saitas he said saitas mines defranco the elf blinked there was no fear in his face they might have been sitting in the bunker passing the time of day together whyd they send you defranco grew bolder i asked to come why to stop the war inside his armor defranco shivered he blinked and he took a drink from the tube inside the helmet and he tried to think about something else but the elf sat there staring blandly at him with his hands tied resting placidly in his lap how defranco asked how will you stop the war but the elf said nothing and defranco knew he had gone further with that question than hq was going to like not wanting their subject told anything about human wants and intentions before they had a chance to study the matter and study the elf and hold their conferences they came says defranco in that small room to know what you looked like you never let us see your faces says the elf you never let us see yours you knew everything far more than we you knew our world we had no idea of yours pride again dont you know how hard it was to let you lay hands on me that was the worst thing you did it again like the gunfire you touch with violence and then expect quiet but i let this happen it was what i came to do and when you spoke to the others for me that gave me hope in time the transport came skimming in low over the hills and defranco got to his feet to wave it in the elf stood up too graceful and still placid and waited while the transport sat down and the blades stopped beating get in defranco said then picking up his scant baggage putting the gun on safety the elf quietly bowed his head and followed instructions going where he was told defranco never laid a hand on him until inside when they had climbed into the dark belly of the transport and guards were waiting therekeep your damn guns down defranco said on outside com because they were lightarmed and helmetless what are you going to do if he moves shoot him let me handle him he speaks real good and to the elf sit down there im going to put a strap across just so you dont fall the elf sat without objection and defranco got a cargo strap and hooked it to the rail on one side and the other so there was no way the elf was going to stir or use his hands and he sat down himself as the guards took their places and the transport lifted off and carried them away from the elvish city and the frontline base of the hundreds of such bases in the world it began to fly high and fast when it got to safe airspace behind the defense humans had made about themselves there was never fear in the elf only placidity his eyes traveled over the inside of the transport the dark utilitarian hold the few benches the cargo nets the two guards learning defranco thought still learning everything there was to learn about his enemies then i was truly afraid says the elf i was most afraid that they would want to talk to me and learn from me and i would have to die then to no good for nothing how do you do that what die just by wanting to wanting is the way i could stop my heart now many things stop the heart when you stop trying to live when you stop going aheadits very easy you mean if you quit trying to live you die thats crazy the elf spreads delicate fingers children cant childrens hearts cant be stopped that way you have the hearts of children without control but the older you are the easier and easier it is until someday its easier to stop than to go on when i learned your language i learned from a man named tomas he couldnt die he and i talkedoh every day and one day we brought him a woman we took she called him a damn traitor that was what she said damn traitor then tomas wanted to die and he couldnt he told me so it was the only thing he ever asked of me like the water you see because i felt sorry for him i gave him the cup and to her because i had no use for her but tomas hated me he hated me every day he talked to me because i was all he had to talk to he would say nothing stopped his heart until the woman called him traitor and then his heart stopped though it went on beating i only helped he thanked me and damned me to hell and wished me health with his drink dammit elf i tried to ask him what hell was i think it means being still and trapped so we fight hes very good with words someone elsewhere says leaning over near the monitor hes trying to communicate something but the words arent equivalent hes playing on what he does have for gods sake says defranco then is that why they fling themselves on the barriers is that why they go on dying like birds at cage bars the elf flinches perhaps it is the image perhaps it is a thought fear stops the heart when fear has nowhere to go we still have one impulse left there is still our anger everything else has gone at the last even our children will fight you so i fight for my children by coming here i dont want to talk about tomas anymore the birds have him you are what i was looking for why defrancos voice shakes saitasanganim scared as hell so am i think of all the soldiers think of things important to you i think about my home i think i never had onethis is crazy it wont work dont the elf reaches and holds a brown wrist dont leave me now defranco theres still fifteen minutes quarter of an hour thats a very long timehere shall we shorten it no defranco says and draws a deep breath lets use it at the base where the onworld authorities and the scientists did their time there were real buildings real groundsite buildings which humans had made when the transport touched down on a rooftop landing pad guards took the elf one way and defranco another it was debriefing that he expected they let him get a shower first with hot water out of real plumbing in a prefabbed bathroom and he got into his proper uniform for the first time in half a year shaved and proper in his blue beret and his brown uniform fresh and clean and thinking all the while that if a special could get his field promotion it was scented towels every day and soft beds to sleep on and a life expectancy in the decades he was anxious because there were ways of snatching credit for a thing and he wanted the credit for this one wanted it because a body could get killed out there on hillsides where he had been for three years and no desksitting officer was going to fail to mention him in the report sit down the specials major said and took him through it all and that afternoon they let him tell it to a reg colonel and lieutenant general and again that afternoon they had him tell it to a tableful of scientists and answer questions and questions and questions until he was hoarse and they forgot to feed him lunch but he answered on and on until his voice cracked and the science staff took pity on him he slept then in clean sheets in a clean bed and lost touch with the war so that he waked terrified and lost in the middle of the night in the dark and had to get his heart calmed down before he realized he was not crazy and that he really had gotten into a place like this and he really had done what he remembered he tucked down babylike into a knot and thought good thoughts all the way back to sleep until a buzzer waked him and told him it was day in this windowless place and he had an hour to dress againfor more questions he supposed and he thought only a little about his elf his elf who was handed on to the scientists and the generals and the alsec people and stopped being his personal business then says the elf i knew you were the only one i met i could understand then i sent for you i still dont know why i said it then were both soldiers youre more than that say that i made one of the great mistakes you mean at the beginning i dont believe it it could have been say that i commanded the attacking ship say that i struck your people on the world say that you destroyed our station and our cities we are the makers of mistakes say this of ourselves i the elf said his image on the screen much the same as he had looked on the hillside straightspined redrobedonly the ropes elves had put on him had left purpling marks on his wrists on the opalescing white of his skin im clear enough arent i the trooper accent was strange coming from a delicate elvish mouth the elfs lips were less mobile his voice had modulations like singing and occasionally failed to keep its tones flat its very good the scientist said the man in the white coveralls who sat at a small desk opposite the elf in a sterile white room and had his hands laced before him the camera took both of them in elf and swarthy science bureau xenologist i understand you learned from prisoners the elf seemed to gaze into infinity we dont want to fight anymore neither do we is this why you came a moment the elf studied the scientist and said nothing at all whats your peoples name the scientist asked you call us elves but we want to know what you call yourselves what you call this world why would you want to know that to respect you do you know that word respect i dont understand it because what you call this world and what you call yourselves is the name the right name and we want to call you right does that make sense it makes sense but what you call us is right too isnt it elves is a madeup word from our homeworld a myth do you know myth a story a thing not true now its true isnt it do you call your world earth most people do what you call it is its name we call it elfland thats fine it doesnt matter why doesnt it matter ive said that you learned our language very well but we dont know anything of yours yes well wed like to learn wed like to be able to talk to you your way it seems to us this is only polite do you know polite no a prolonged silence the scientists face remained bland as the elfs you say you dont want to fight anymore can you tell us how to stop the war yes but first i want to know what your peace is like what for instance will you do about the damage youve caused us you mean reparations whats that mean payment what do you mean by it the scientist drew a deep breath tell me why did your people give you to one of our soldiers why didnt they just call on the radio and say they wanted to talk this is what youd do its easier isnt it and safer the elf blinked no more than that there was a ship a long time ago the scientist said after a moment it was a human ship minding its own business in a human lane and elves came and destroyed it and killed everyone on it why what do you want for this ship so you do understand about payment payments giving something for something i understand the elvish face was guileless masklike the long eyes like the eyes of a pearlskinned buddha a saint what will you ask and how will peace with you be what do you call peace you mean you dont think our word for it is like your word for it thats right well thats an important thing to understand isnt it before we make agreements peace means no fighting thats not enough well it means being safe from your enemies thats not enough what is enough the pale face contemplated the floor something elsewhere what is enough saitas the elf only stared at the floor far far away from the questioner i need to talk to defranco who defranco the elf looked up defranco brought me here hes a soldier hell understand me better than you is he still here the colonel reached and cut the tape off she was surtac agnes finn was the name on her desk she could cut your throat a dozen ways and do sabotage and mayhem from the refinements of computer theft to the gross tactics of explosives she would speak a dozen languages know every culture she had ever dealt with from the inside out integrating the science bureau and the military and more she was a surtac colonel which sent the wind up defrancos back it was not a branch of the service that had many high officers you had to survive more than ten field missions to get your promotion beyond the ubiquitous and courtesytitled lieutenancy and this one had this was officer with a capital o and whatever the politics in hq were this was a rock around which a lot of other bodies orbited this probably took her orders from the joint command which was months and months away in its closest manifestation and that meant next to no orders and wide discretion which was what surtacs did wild card joker in the deck there were the regs there was special ops loosely attached there were the spacers union and alliance and union regs were part of that beyond and above there was alsec and union intelligence and that was this largeboned redhaired woman who probably had a scant handful of humans and no knowing what else in her direct command a handful of surtacs loose in elfland and all of them independent operators and as much trouble to the elves as a reg base could be defranco knew he had tried that route once he knew more than most what kind it took to survive that training let alone the requisite ten missions to get promoted out of the field and he knew the wit behind the weathered face and knew it ate special ops lieutenants for appetizers how did you make such an impression on him lieutenant i didnt try to defranco said carefully maam i just tried to keep him calm and get in with him alive the way they said but i was the only one who dealt with him out there we thought that was safest maybe he thinks im more than i am i compliment you on the job there was a certain irony in that he was sure no surtac had pulled off what he had and he felt the slight tension there yes maam yes maam theres always the chance you understand that youve brought us an absolute lunatic or the elves are going an unusual route to lead us into a trap or this is an elf whos not too pleased about being tied up and dumped on us and he wants to get even those things occur to me yes maam defranco thought all those things face to face with the colonel and trying to be easy as the colonel had told him to be but the colonels thin face was sealed and forbidding as the elfs you know what theyre doing out there right now massive attacks hitting that front near with everything theyve got the eighths pinned were throwing air in and theyve got somewhere over two thousand casualties out there and airstrikes dont stop all of them delta took a headon assault and turned it there were casualties trooper named herse your unit dibs o god dead dead the colonels eyes were bleak and expressionless word came in i know its more than a stat to you but thats whats going on weve got two signals coming from the elves and we dont know which ones valid we have ourselves an alien who claims credentialsand comes with considerable effort from the same site as the attack dibs dead there seemed a chill in the air in this safe remote place far from the real world the mud the bunkers dibs had stopped living yesterday this morning sometime dibs had gone and the world never noticed other things occur to the science people the colonel said one which galls the hell out of them defranco is what the alien just said defranco can understand me better are you with me lieutenant yes maam so the bureau went to the secretary the secretary went to the major general on the com all this at fifteen hundred yesterday and they hauled me in on it at two this morning you know how many noses youve got out of joint lieutenant and what the level of concern is about that mess out there on the front yes maam im sure you hoped for a commendation and maybe better wouldnt that be it wouldnt blame you well i got my hands into this and ive opted you under my orders lieutenant because i can do that and high commands just real worried the bureaus going to poke and prod and that elfs going to leave us on the sudden for elvish heaven so lets just keep him moderately happy he wants to talk to you what the bureau wants to tell you but i told them id make it clear because theyll talk tech at you and i want to be sure youve got itits just real simple youre dealing with an alien and youll have noticed what he says doesnt always make sense yes maam dont yes maam me lieutenant dammit just talk to me and look me in the eye were talking about communication here yes he stopped short of the maam youve got a brain defranco its all in your record you almost went special services yourself that was your real ambition wasnt it but you had this damn psychotic fear of taking ultimate responsibility and a wholesome fear of ending up with a commendation posthumous didnt you it washed you out so you went special ops where you could take orders from someone else and still play bloody hero and prove something to yourselfam i right i ought to be ive got your psych record over there now ive insulted you and youre sitting there turning red but i want to know what im dealing with were in a damn bind weve got casualties happening out there are you and i going to have trouble no i understand good very good do you think you can go into a room with that elf and talk the truth out of him more to the point can you make a decision can you go in there knowing how much is riding on your back im not a i dont care what you are defranco what i want to know is whether negotiate is even in that elfs vocabulary im assigning you to guard over there in the process i want you to sit down with him one to one and just talk away thats all youve got to do and because of your background maybe youll do it with some sense but maybe if you just talk for john defranco and try to get that elf to deal thats the best thing you know when a government sends out a negotiatoror anything likethat individuals not average that individuals probably the smartest canniest hardestnosed bastard theyve got and he probably cheats at dice we dont know what this bastards up to or what he thinks like and when you sit down with him youre talking to a mind that knows a lot more about humanity than we know about elves youre talking to an elvish expert whos here playing games with us whos giving us a real good lookover you understand that what do you say about it im scared of this thats real good you know were not sending in the brightest most experienced human on two feet and thats exactly what that rather canny elf has arranged for us to do you understand that hes playing us like a keyboard this far and how do you cope with that lieutenant defranco i just ask him questions and answer as little as i can wrong you let him talk you be real careful what you ask him what you ask is as dead a giveaway as what you tell him everything you do and say is cultural if hes good hell drain you like a sponge the colonel bit her lips damn youre not going to be able to handle that are you i understand what youre warning me about colonel im not sure i can do it but ill try not sure you can do it peace may hang on this and several billion lives your company out there on the line put it on that level and youre scared and youre showing it lieutenant youre too damned open no wonder they washed you out got no hard center to you no place to go to when i embarrass the hell out of you and im on your side youre probably a damn good special op brave as hell i know youve got commendations in the field and that shellshyness of yours probably makes you drive real hard when youre in trouble good man honest if the elf wants a human specimen we could do worse you just go in there son and you talk to him and you be your nice self and thats all youve got to do well be bugged defranco stared at the colonel deliberately trying to dredge up some selfdefense give the impression he was no complete fool damn sure youll be bugged guards right outside if you want them but you startle that elf ill fry you that isnt what i meant i meanti meant if i could get him to talk thered be an accurate record ah well yes there will be absolutely and yes im a bastard lieutenant same as that elf is beyond a doubt and because im on your side i want you as prepared as i can get you but im going to give you all the backing you needyou want anything you just tell that staff and they better jump to do it im giving you carte blanche over there in the science wing their complaints can come to this desk you just be yourself with him watch yourself a little dont get taken and dont set him off yes maam another slow consuming stare and a nod he was dismissed iv so wheres the hole were digging end why its neverneverdone my friend well whys it warm at the other end well hells neverneverfar my friend this colonel says the elf its her soldiers outside thats the one says defranco its not the highest rank no its not not even on this world defrancos hands open and close on each other whiteknuckled his voice stays calm but its a lot of power she wont be alone there are others shes acting for they sent me here ive figured that now your dealing confuses me politics its all politics higherups covering their defranco rechooses his words some things they have to abide by they have to do like if they dont take a peace offerthat would be trouble back home human space is big but a warhumans want it stopped i know that with humans you cant quiet a mistake down weve got too many separate interests we got scientists and a half dozen differentcommands will they all stop fighting yes my side will i know they will defranco clenches his hands tighter as if the chill has gotten to his bones if we can give them something some solution you have to understand what theyre thinking of if theres a trouble anywhere it can grow there might be others out there you ever think of that what if some other species justwanders through its happened and what if our little war disturbs them we live in a big house you know that yet youre young you with your ships youre a young power out in space god help us weve made mistakes but this time the first one wasnt ours weve been trying to stop this all along weve been trying to stop this youre what i trust says the elf not your colonel not your treaty words not your peace you words arent the belief what you dothats the belief what you do will show us i cant i can its important enough to me and not to you our little war i cant understand how you think that way look at that defranco waves a desperate hand at the room the world up its so big cant you see that and one planet one ball of rock its a little war is it worth it all is it worth such damn stubbornness is it worth dying in yes the elf says simply and the seagreen eyes and the white face have neither anger nor blame for him defranco saluted and got out and waited until the colonels orderly caught him in the hall and gave his escort the necessary authorizations because no one wandered this base without an escort but the elves are two hundred klicks out there defranco thought and whore we fighting anyway in the halls he saw the black of union elite and the blue of alliance spacers and the plain drab of the line troop officers and the white and pale blue of the two science bureaus while everywhere he felt the tenuous peacedamn maybe we need this war its keeping humanity talking to each other theyre all fat and sleek and mud never touched them back herebut there was haste in the hallways but there were tense looks on faces of people headed purposefully to one place and the other the look of a place with something on its collective mind with silent secret emergencies passing about himthe attack on the lines he thought and remembered another time that attack had started on one front and spread rapidly to a dozen and missiles had gone and towns had died and the elvish kids the babies in each others arms and the birds fluttering down and dibsdibs lying in his armor like a broken piece of machinerywhen a shot got you it got the visor and you had no face and never knew it or it got the joints and you bled to death trapped in the failed shell you just lay there and bled he had heard men and women die like that still in contact on the com talking to their buddies and going out alone alone in that damn armor that cut off the sky and the air they brought him down tunnels that were poured and cast and hard overnight that kind of construction which they never got out on the line there were bright lights and there were dry floors for the fine officers to walk on there was at the end a new set of doors where guards stood with weapons ready against us defranco got that sense of unreality again blinked as he had to show his tags and ids to get past even with the colonels orders directing his escort then they let him through and further to another hall with more guards alsec mps alliance security the intelligence and special services the very air here had a chill about it with only those uniforms in sight they had the elf of course they did he was diplomatic property and the regs and the generals had nothing to do with it he was in finns territory security and the surface tactical command that the reg command only controlled from the top not inside the structure finn had a leash but she took no orders from sideways in the structure not even from alsec check and balance in a joint command structure too many lightyears from home to risk petty dictatorships he had just crossed a line and might as well have been on another planet and evidently a call had come ahead of him because there were surly science bureau types here too and the one who passed him through hardly glanced at his id it was his face the man looked at long and hard and it was the xenbureau interviewer who had been on the tape good luck the man said and a surtac major arrived dourfaced a black man in the surtacs khaki who did not look like an officetype he took the folder of authorizations and looked at it and at defranco with a darkeyed stare and a set of a square wellmuscled jaw colonels given you three hours lieutenant use it were more than one government says defranco to the elf quietly desperately weve fought in the past we had wars we made peace and we work together we may fight again but everyone hopes not and its less and less likely wars expensive its too damn open out here thats what im trying to tell you you start a war and you dont know what else might be listening the elf leans back in his chair one arm on the back of it his face is solemn as ever as he looks at defranco you and i youandi the world was whole until you found us how can people do things that dont make sense the whole thing makes sense the parts of the thing are crazy you cant put part of one thing into another leaves wont be feathers and your mind cant be our mind i see our mistakes i want to take them away then elves wont have theirs and you wont have yours but you call it a little war the lives are only a few you have so many you like your mistake youll keep it youll hold it in your arms and youll meet these others with it but theyll see it wont they when they look at you its crazy when we met you in it we assumed we that was our first great mistake but its yours too defranco walked into the room where they kept the elf a luxurious room a groundling civs kind of room with a bed and a table and two chairs and some kind of green and yellow pattern on the bedclothes which were groundstyle freehanging and amid this riot of lifecolors the elf sat crosslegged on the bed placid not caring that the door opened or someone came inuntil a flicker of recognition seemed to take hold and grow it was the first humanlike expression virtually the only expression the elf had ever used in defrancos sight of course there were cameras recording it recording everything the colonel had said so and probably the elf knew it too saitas you wanted to see me defranco the elfs face settled again to inscrutability shall i sit down there was no answer defranco waited for an uncertain moment then settled into one chair at the table and leaned his elbows on the white plastic surface they treating you all right defranco asked for the cameras deliberately for the coloneldamn you im not a fool i can play your damn game colonel i did what your surtacs failed at didnt i so watch me yes the elf said his hands rested loosely in his redrobed lap he looked down at them and up again i tried to treat you all right i thought i did yes whyd you ask for me im a soldier the elf said and put his legs over the side of the bed and stood up i know that you are i think you understand me more i dont know about that but ill listen the thought crossed his mind of being held hostage of some irrational violent behavior but he pretended it away and waved a hand at the other chair you want to sit down you want something to drink theyll get it for you ill sit with you the elf came and took the other chair and leaned his elbows on the table the bruises on his wrists showed plainly under the light i thought you might have gone back to the front by now they give me a little time i mean theres dont talk to him the colonel had said let him talk three hours a while you had a reason you wanted to see me something you wanted or just to talk ill do that too yes the elf said slowly in his lilting lisp and gazed at him with seagreen eyes are you young defranco you make me think of a young man it set him off his balance im not all that young i have a son and a daughter have you no parents why do you want to know have you parents a mother long way from here he resented the questioning letters were all nadya defranco got and not enough of them and thank god she had closer sons defranco sat staring at the elf who had gotten past his guard in two quick questions and managed to hit a sore spot and he remembered what finn had warned him you elf living parents yes a lot of relatives damn what trooper had they stripped getting that part of human language whose soul had they gotten into what are you saitas whyd they hand you over like that to make peace so the saitas always does tied up like that i came to be your prisoner you understand that well it worked i might have shot you i dont say i wouldve but i might except for that it was a smart move i guess it was but hell you could have called ahead you come up on us in the darkyou looked to get your head blown off why didnt you use the radio a blink of seagreen eyes others ask me that would you have come then well someone would listen you speak at them in human language and theyd listen and theyd arrange something a lot safer the elf stared full of his own obscurities come on they throw you out of there they your enemies who the ones who left you out there on the hill no friends huh friends left you out there they agreed with me i agreed to be there i was most afraid youd shoot them but you let them go hell look i just follow orders and orders led you to let them go no they say to talk if i ever got the chance look me personally i never wanted to kill you guys i wouldnt if i had the choice but you do dammit you took out our ships maybe that wasnt personal on your side either but we sure as hell cant have you doing it as a habit all you ever damn well had to do was go away and let us alone you hit a world elf maybe not much of one but you killed more than a thousand people on that first ship thirty thousand at that base good god dont sit there looking at me like that it was a mistake mistake defranco found his hands shaking no dont raise the voice dont lose it be your own nice self boy patronizingly the colonel knew he was far out of his depth and he knew arent most wars mistakes do you think so if it is cant we stop it he felt the attention of unseen listeners diplomats scientistshimself special ops talking to an elvish negotiator and making a mess of it all losing everything be your own nice selfthe colonel was crazy the elf was the war and the world were and he lumbered ahead desperately attempting subtlety attempting a caricatured simplicity toward a diplomat and knowing the one as transparent as the other you know all you have to do is say quit and theres ways to stop the shooting right off ways to close it all down and then start talking about how we settle this you say thats what you came to do youre in the right place all you have to do is get your side to stop theyre killing each other out there do you know that you come in here to talk peace and theyre coming at us all up and down the front i just got word i lost a friend of mine out there god knows what by now its no damn sense if you can stop it then lets stop it ill tell you what our peace will be the elf lifted his face placidly spread his hands there is a camera isnt there at least a microphone they do listen yes theyve got camera and mike i know they will but your face is what i see your face is all human faces to me they can listen but i talk to you only to you and this is our peace the fighting will stop and well build ships again and well go into space and we wont be enemies the mistake wont exist thats the peace i want so how do we do that be your own nice self boydefranco abandoned himself dont see the skin dont see the face alienlike just talk talk like to a human dont worry about protocols do it boy how do we get the fighting stopped ive said it theyve heard yes they have they have two days to make this peace defrancos palms sweated he clenched his hands on the chair then what happens ill die the war will go on god now what do i do what do i say how far can i go listen you dont understand how long it takes us to make up our minds we need more than any two days theyre dying out there your people are killing themselves against our lines and its all for nothing stop it now talk to them tell them were going to talk shut it down the slitted eyes blinked remained in their buddhalike abstraction looking askance into infinity defranco there has to be payment think defranco think ask the right things what payment just exactly who are you talking for all of you a city a district one peace will be enough for youwont it youll go away youll leave and we wont see each other until weve built our ships again youll begin to goas soon as my peace is done build the ships for gods sake and come after us again no the war is a mistake there wont be another war this is enough but would everyone agree everyone does agree ill tell you my real name its angan angan anassidi im fortyone years old i have a son named agaita a daughter named siadi i was born in a town named daogisshi but its burned now my wife is llaothai sohail and she was born in the city where we live now im my wifes only husband my son is aged twelve my daughter is nine they live in the city with my wife alone now and her parents and mine the elvish voice acquired a subtle music on the names that lingered to obscure his other speech ive writteni told them i would write everything for them i write in your language told who the humans who asked me i wrote it all defranco stared at the elf at a face immaculate and distant as a statue i dont think i follow you i dont understand were talking about the front were talking about maybe that wife and those kids being in danger arent we about maybe my friends getting killed out there about shells falling and people getting blown up can we do anything about it im here to make the peace saitas is what i am a gift to you im the payment defranco blinked and shook his head payment im not sure i follow that for a long moment there was quiet kill me the elf said thats why i came to be the last dead the saitas to carry the mistake away hell no no we dont shoot you look elfall we want is to stop the fighting we dont want your life nobody wants to kill you defranco we havent any more resources we want a peace so do we look we just make a treatyyou understand treaty im the treaty a treaty man a treatys a piece of paper we promise peace to each other and not to attack us we promise not to attack you we settle our borders and you just go home to that wife and kids and i go home and thats it no more dying no more killing no the elfs eyes glistened within the pale mask no defranco no paper we make peace with a paper and ink we write peace out and we make agreements and its good enough we do what we say well do then write it in your language you have to sign it write your name on it and keep the terms thats all you understand that two days ill sign your paper ill make your peace its nothing our peace is in me and im here to give it dammit we dont kill people for treaties the seacolored eyes blinked is one so hard and millions so easy its different why becausebecauselook wars for killing peace is for staying alive i dont understand why you fight nothing you do makes sense to us but i think we almost understand we talk to each other we use the same words defranco dont go on killing us just you just you is that it dammit thats crazy a cup would do or a gun whatever you like defranco have you never shot us before god its not the same you say papers enough for you that paper will take away all your mistakes and make the peace but papers not enough for us id never trust it you have to make my peace too so both sides will know its true but there has to be a saitas for humans someone has to come to be a saitas for humans someone has to come to us defranco sat there with his hands locked together you mean just go to your side and get killed the last dying dammit you are crazy youll wait a long time for that elf you dont understand youre damn right i dont understand damn bloodyminded lunatics defranco shoved his hands down needing to get up to get away from that infinitely patient and not human face that face that had somehow acquired subtle expressions that voice which made him forget where the words had first come from and then he remembered the listeners the listeners taking notes the colonel staring at him across the table information winning was not the issue questions were finding out what they could peace was no longer the game they were dealing with the insane with minds there was no peace with elves that died to spite their enemies that suicided for a whim and thought nothing about wiping out someone elses life he stayed in his chair he drew another breath he collected his wits and thought of something else worth learning whatd you do with the prisoners you learned the language from huh tell me that dead we gave them the cup one at a time they wanted it did they again the spread of hands of graceful fingers im here for all the mistakes whatever will be enough for them dammit elf dont call me that the voice acquired a faint music remember my name remember my name defranco he had to get up he had to get up and get clear of the alien get away from that stare he thrust himself back from the table and looked back found the elf had turned saitasangan smelled of something dry and musky like spice the eyes never opened wide citrine slits they followed him talk to me the elf said talk to me defranco about what about handing one of us to you it wont happen it bloody wont happen were not crazy then the war wont stop youll bloody die every damn last one of you if thats your intention the elf said yes we dont believe you want peace we havent any more hope so i come here and the rest of us begin to die not the quiet dying our hearts wont stop well fight out there on the lines you mean ill die as long as you want here i wont stop my heart the saitas cant dammit thats not what were after thats not what we want neither can you stop yours i know that were not cruel i still have hope in you i still hope it wont work we cant do it do you understand me its against our law do you understand law law right from wrong morality for gods sake killings wrong then youve done a lot of wrong you have your mistake too defranco youre a soldier like me you know what your lifes value is youre damn right i know and im still alive we go off the course we lose ourselves youll die for war but not for peace i dont understand i dont understand you think were just going to pick some poor sod and send him to you you defranco im asking you to make the peace hell he shook his head walked away to the door colonelbehanged listenersbehanged his hand shook on the switch and he was afraid it showed end the war the hell you say the door shot open he expected guards expected it was open corridor clean prefab tiled floor on the tiles lay a dark round object with the peculiar symmetry and ugliness of things meant to kill grenade intact his heart jolted he felt the doorframe against his side and the sweat ran cold on his skin his bowels went to water he hung there looking at it and it did not go away he began to shake all over as if it were already armed colonel finn he turned around in the doorway and yelled at the unseen monitors colonel finnget me out of here no one answered no door opened the elf sat there staring at him in the closest thing to distress he had yet showed colonel colonel damn you more of silence the elf rose to his feet and stood there staring at him in seeming perplexity as if he suspected he witnessed some human madness they left us a present defranco said his voice shook and he tried to stop it they left us a damn present elf and they locked us in the elf stared at him and defranco went out into the hall bent and gathered up the deadly black cylinderheld it up its one of yours elf the elf stood there in the doorway his eyes looking down were the eyes of a carved saint and looking up they showed color against his white skin a long nailless hand touched the doorframe as the elf contemplated him and human treachery is this their way its not mine he closed his hand tightly on the cylinder in its deadliness like and unlike every weapon he had ever handled its damn well not mine you cant get out the shock had robbed him of wits for a moment he was not thinking and then he walked down the hall to the main door and tried it locked he called back to the elf who had joined him in his possession of the hall the two of them together defranco walked back again trying doors as he went he felt strangely numb the hall became surreal his elvish companion belonging like him elsewhere dammit what have you got in their minds theyve agreed the elf said theyve agreed defranco theyre out of their minds one door still closes doesnt it you can protect your life you still bent on suicide youll be safe damn them the elf gathered his arms about him as if he too felt the chill the colonel gave us a time is it past not bloody yet come sit with me sit and talk my friend is it time asks the elf as defranco looks at his watch again and defranco looks up five minutes almost defrancos voice is hoarse the elf has a bit of paper in hand he offers it a pen lies on the table between them along with the grenade ive written your peace ive put my name below it put yours im nobody i cant sign a treaty for gods sake defrancos face is white his lips tremble what did you write peace said the elf i just wrote peace does there have to be more defranco takes it looks at it and suddenly he picks up the pen and signs it too a furious scribble and lays the pen down there he says there theyll have my name on it and after a moment if i could do the othero god im scared im scared you dont have to go to my city says the elf softly his voice wavers like defrancos defrancohere here they record everything go with me now the record will last we have our peace you and i we make it together here now the last dying dont leave me and we can end this war defranco sits a moment takes the grenade from the middle of the table extends his hand with it across the center he looks nowhere but at the elf pins yours he says go on you pull it ill hold it steady the elf reaches out his hand takes the pin and pulls it quickly defranco lays the grenade down on the table between them and his mouth moves in silent counting but then he looks up at the elf and the elf looks at him defranco manages a smile you got the count on this thing the screen breaks up the staffer reached out her hand and cut the monitor and agnes finn stared past the occupants of the office for a time tears came seldom to her eyes they were there now and she chose not to look at the board of inquiry who had gathered there theres a mandatory inquiry the man from the reg command said well take testimony from the major this afternoon responsibilitys mine finn said it was agreed on the staff it was prearranged the interview the formalities someone had to take the direct hit it might have been a surtac she would have ordered that too if things had gone differently high command might cover her records might be wiped a tape might be classified the major general who had handed her the mess and turned his back had done it all through subordinates and he was clear the paper colonel she looked at them slid the simple piece of paper back across the desk the board member collected it and put it into the folder carefully its more than evidence she said thats a treaty the indigenes know it is they left her office less than comfortable in their official search for blame and where officially to put it she was already packed going back on the same ship with an elvish corpse all the way to pell and downbelow there would be a grave there onworld it had surprised no one when the broadcast tape got an elvish response hopes rose when it got the fighting stopped and brought an elvish delegation to the front but there was a bit of confusion when the elves viewed both bodies and wanted defrancos only defrancos and they made him a stone grave there on the shellpocked plain a stone monument and they wrote everything they knew about him i was john rand defranco a graven plaque said i was born on a space station twenty lightyears away i left my mother and my brothers the friends i had were soldiers and many of them died before me i came to fight and i died for the peace even when mine was the winning side i died at the hand of angan anassidi and he died at mine for the peace and we were friends at the end of our lives elvessuilti was one name they called themselvescame to this place and laid gifts of silk ribbons and bunches of flowersflowers in all that desolation and in their thousands they mourned and they wept in their own tearless expressionless way for their enemy one of their own was on his way to humankind for humankind to cry for i was angan anassidi his grave would say and all the right things possibly no human would shed a tear except the veterans of elfland when they came home if they got down to the worldthey might like

thread you still doubt rgul flar asked appearing slightly amused by the older bronze riders perversity rgul his handsome features stubbornly set made no reply to the weyrleaders taunt he ground his teeth together as if he could grind away flars authority over him there have been no threads in perns skies for over four hundred turns there are no more there is always that possibility flar conceded amiably there was not however the slightest trace of tolerance in his amber eyes nor the slightest hint of compromise in his manner he was more like flon his sire rgul decided than a son had any right to be always so sure of himself always slightly contemptuous of what others did and thought arrogant thats what flar was impertinent too and underhanded in the matter of that young weyrwoman why rgul had trained her up to be one of the finest weyrwomen in many turns before hed finished her instruction she knew all the teaching ballads and sagas letter perfect and then the silly child had turned to flar didnt have sense enough to appreciate the merits of an older more experienced man undoubtedly she felt a first obligation to flar he having discovered her at ruath hold during search you do however flar was saying admit that when the sun hits the finger rock at the moment of dawn winter solstice has been reached any fool knows thats what finger rock is for rgul grunted then why dont you you old fool admit that the eye rock was placed on star stone to bracket the red star when its about to make a pass burst out knet the youngest of the dragonriders rgul flushed halfstarting out of his chair ready to take the young sprout to task for such insolence knet flars voice cracked authoritatively do you really like flying the igen patrol so much you want another few weeks at it knet hurriedly seated himself flushing at the reprimand and the threat there is you know rgul incontrovertible evidence to support my conclusions flar went on with deceptive mildness the finger pointsat an eye blood red dont quote me verses i taught you as a weyrling rgul exclaimed heatedly then have faith in what you taught flar snapped back his amber eyes flashing dangerously rgul stunned by the unexpected forcefulness sank back into his chair you cannot deny rgul flar continued quietly that no less than half an hour ago the sun balanced on the fingers tip at dawn and the red star was squarely framed by the eye rock the other dragonriders bronze as well as brown murmured and nodded their agreement to that phenomenon there was also an undercurrent of resentment for rguls continual contest of flars policies as the new weyrleader even old slel once rguls avowed supporter was following the majority there have been no threads in four hundred years there are no threads rgul muttered then my fellow dragonman flar said cheerfully all you have taught is falsehood the dragons are as the lords of the holds wish to believe parasites on the economy of pern anachronisms and so are we therefore far be it from me to hold you here against the dictates of your conscience you have my permission to leave the weyr and take up residence where you will rgul was too stunned by flars ultimatum to take offense at the ridicule leave the weyr was the man mad where would he go the weyr had been his life he had been bred up to it for generations all his male ancestors had been dragonriders not all bronze true but a decent percentage his own dams sire had been a weyrleader just as he rgul had been until flars mnementh had flown the new queen and that young upstart had taken over as traditional weyrleader but dragonmen never left the weyr well they did if they were negligent enough to lose their dragons like that lytol fellow who was now warden at ruath hold and how could he leave the weyr with a dragon what did flar want of him was it not enough that the young one was weyrleader now in rguls stead wasnt flars pride sufficiently swollen by having bluffed the lords of pern into disbanding their army when they were all set to coerce the weyr and dragonmen must flar dominate every dragonman body and will too he stared a long moment incredulous i do not believe we are parasites flar said breaking the silence with his soft persuasive voice nor anachronistic there have been long intervals before the red star does not always pass close enough to drop threads on pern which is why our ingenious ancestors thought to position the eye rock and the finger rock as they didto confirm when a pass will be made and another thing his face turned grave there have been other times when dragonkind has all but died outand pern with it because of skeptics like you flar smiled and relaxed indolently in his chair i prefer not to be recorded as a skeptic how shall we record you rgul the council chamber was tense rgul was aware of someone breathing harshly and realized it was himself he looked at the adamant face of the young weyrleader and knew that the threat was not empty he would either concede to flars authority completely though concession rankled deeply or leave the weyr and where could he go unless to one of the other weyrs deserted for hundreds of turns and rguls thoughts were savage wasnt that indication enough of the cessation of the threads five empty weyrs no by the egg of faranth he would practice some of flars own brand of deceit and bide his time when all pern turned on the arrogant fool he rgul would be there to salvage something from the ruins a dragonman stays in his weyr rgul said with what dignity he could muster from the remains of his pride and accepts the policies of the current weyrleader the tone of flars voice made it less of a question and more of an order relieved he would not have to perjure himself rgul gave a curt nod of his head flar continued to stare at him until rgul wondered if the man could read his thoughts as his dragon might he managed to return the gaze calmly his turn would come hed wait apparently accepting the capitulation flar stood up and crisply delegated patrol assignments for the day tbor youre weatherwatch keep an eye on those tithe trains as you do whats the mornings report weather is fair at dawningall across telgar and keroonif all too cold tbor said with a wry grin tithing trains have good hard roads though so they ought to be here soon his eyes twinkled with anticipation of the feasting that would follow the supplies arrival a mood shared by all to judge by the expressions around the table flar nodded slan and dnol you are to continue an adroit search for likely boys they should be striplings if possible but do not pass over anyone suspected of talent its all well and good to present for impression boys reared up in the weyr traditions flar gave a onesided smile but there are not enough in the lower caverns we too have been behind in begetting anyway dragons reach full growth faster than their riders we must have more young men to impress when ramoth hatches take the southern holds ista nerat fort and south boll where maturity comes earlier you can use the guise of inspecting holds for greenery to talk to the boys and take along firestone run a few flaming passes on those heights that havent been scoured in uhdragons years a flaming beast impresses the young and rouses envy flar deliberately looked at rgul to see the exweyrleaders reaction to the order rgul had been dead set against going outside the weyr for more candidates in the first place rgul had argued that there were eighteen youngsters in the lower caverns some quite young to be sure but rgul could not admit that ramoth would lay more than the dozen nemorth had always dropped in the second place rgul persisted in wanting to avoid any action that might antagonize the lords rgul made no overt protest and flar went on knet back to the mines i want the dispositions of each firestone dump checked and quantities available rgul continue drilling recognition points with the weyrlings they must be positive about their references they may be sent out quickly and with no time to ask questions if theyre used as messengers and suppliers fnor tsum and flar turned to his own brown riders youre cleanup squad today he allowed himself a grin at their dismay try ista weyr clear the hatching cavern and enough weyrs for a double wing and fnor dont leave a single record behind theyre worth preserving that will be all dragonmen good flying and with that flar rose and strode from the council room up to the queens weyr ramoth still slept her hide gleaming with health its color deepening to a shade of gold closer to bronze indicating her pregnancy as he passed her the tip of her long tail twitched slightly all the dragons were restless these days flar reflected yet when he asked mnementh the bronze dragon could give no reason he woke he went back to sleep that was all flar couldnt ask a leading question for that would defeat his purpose he had to remain discontented with the vague fact that the restlessness was some kind of instinctive reaction lessa was not in the sleeping room nor was she still bathing flar snorted that girl was going to scrub her hide off with this constant bathing shed had to live grimy to protect herself in ruath hold but bathing twice a day he was beginning to wonder if this might be a subtle lessavariety insult to him personally flar sighed that girl would she never turn to him of her own accord would he ever touch that elusive inner core of lessa she had more warmth for his half brother fnor and knet the youngest of the bronze riders than she had for flar who shared her bed he pulled the curtain back into place irritated where had she got to today when for the first time in weeks he had been able to get all the wings out of the weyr just so he could teach her to fly between ramoth would soon be too eggheavy for such activity he had promised the weyrwoman and he meant to keep the promise she had taken to wearing the wherhide riding gear as a flagrant reminder of his unfulfilled pledge from certain remarks she had dropped he knew she would not wait much longer for his aid that she should try it on her own didnt suit him at all he crossed the queens weyr again and peered down the passage that led to the records room she was often to be found there poring over the musty skins and that was one more matter that needed urgent consideration those records were deteriorating past legibility curiously enough earlier ones were still in good condition and readable another technique forgotten that girl he brushed his thick forelock of hair back from his brow in a gesture habitual to him when he was annoyed or worried the passage was dark which meant she could not be below in the records room mnementh he called silently to his bronze dragon sunning on the ledge outside the queens weyr what is that girl doing lessa the dragon replied stressing the weyrwomans name with pointed courtesy is talking to manora shes dressed for riding he added after a slight pause flar thanked the bronze sarcastically and strode down the passage to the entrance as he turned the last bend he all but ran lessa down you hadnt asked me where she was mnementh answered plaintively to flars blistering reprimand lessa rocked back on her heels from the force of their encounter she glared up at him her lips thin with displeasure her eyes flashing why didnt i have the opportunity of seeing the red star through the eye rock she demanded in a hard angry voice flar pulled at his hair lessa at her most difficult would complete the list of this mornings trials too many to accommodate as it was on the peak he muttered determined not to let her irritate him today and you already believe idve liked to see it she snapped and pushed past him towards the weyr if only in my capacity of weyrwoman and recorder he caught her arm and felt her body tense he set his teeth wishing as he had a hundred times since ramoth rose in her first mating flight that lessa had not been virgin too he had not thought to control his dragonincited emotions and lessas first sexual experience had been violent it had surprised him to be first considering her adolescent years had been spent drudging for lascivious warders and soldiertypes evidently no one had bothered to penetrate the curtain of rags and the coat of filth she had carefully maintained as a disguise he had been a considerate and gentle bedmate ever since but unless ramoth and mnementh were involved he might as well call it rape yet he knew someday somehow he would coax her into responding wholeheartedly to his lovemaking he had a certain pride in his skill and he was in a position to persevere now he took a deep breath and released her arm slowly how fortunate youre wearing riding gear as soon as the wings have cleared out and ramoth wakes i shall teach you to fly between the gleam of excitement in her eyes was evident even in the dimly lit passageway he heard her inhale sharply cant put it off too much longer or ramothll be in no shape to fly at all he continued amiably you do mean it her voice was low and breathless its usual acid edge missing you will teach us today he wished he could see her face clearly once or twice he had caught an unguarded expression on her face loving and tender he would give much to have that look turned on him however he admitted wryly to himself he ought to be glad that melting regard was directed only at ramoth and not at another human yes my dear weyrwoman i mean it i will teach you to fly between today if only to keep you from trying it yourself her low chuckle informed him his taunt was wellaimed right now however he said indicating for her to lead the way back to the weyr i could do with some food we were up before the kitchen they had entered the welllighted weyr so he did not miss the trenchant look she shot him over her shoulder she would not so easily forgive being left out of the group at the star stone this morning certainly not with the bribe of flying between how different this inner room was now lessa was weyrwoman flar mused as lessa called down the service shaft for food during joras incompetent tenure as weyrwoman the sleeping quarters had been crowded with junk unwashed apparel uncleared dishes the state of the weyr and the reduced number of dragons were as much joras fault as rguls for she had indirectly encouraged sloth negligence and gluttony had he flar been just a few years older when flon his father had diedjora had been disgusting but when dragons rose in mating flight the condition of your partner counted for nothing lessa took a tray of bread and cheese and mugs of the stimulating klah from the platform she served him deftly youve not eaten either he asked she shook her head vigorously the braid into which she had plaited her thick fine dark hair bobbing across her shoulders the hairdressing was too severe for her narrow face but it did not if that were her intention disguise her femininity nor the curious beauty of her delicate features again flar wondered that such a slight body contained so much shrewd intelligence and resourcefulcunning yes that was the word cunning flar did not make the mistake as others had of underestimating her abilities manora called me to witness the birth of kylaras child flar maintained an expression of polite interest he knew perfectly well that lessa suspected the child was his and it could have been he admitted privately but he doubted it kylara had been one of the ten candidates from the same search three years ago which had discovered lessa like others who survived impression kylara had found certain aspects of weyr life exactly suited to her temperament she had gone from one riders weyr to anothers she had even seduced flar not at all against his will to be sure now that he was weyrleader he found it wiser to ignore her efforts to continue the relationship tbor had taken her in hand and had his hands full until he retired her to the lower caverns welladvanced in pregnancy aside from having the amorous tendencies of a green dragon kylara was quick and ambitious she would make a strong weyrwoman so flar had charged manora and lessa with the job of planting the notion in kylaras mind in the capacity of weyrwomanof another weyrher intense drives would be used to perns advantage she had not learned the severe lessons of restraint and patience that lessa had and she didnt have lessas devious mind fortunately she was in considerable awe of lessa and flar suspected that lessa was subtly influencing this attitude in kylaras case flar preferred not to object to lessas meddling a fine son lessa was saying flar sipped his klah she was not going to get him to admit any responsibility after a long pause lessa added she has named him tkil flar suppressed a grin at lessas failure to get a rise from him discreet of her oh yes flar replied blandly tlar might be confusing if she took the second half of her name as is customary tkil however still indicates sire as well as dam while i was waiting for council to end lessa said after clearing her throat manora and i checked the supply caverns the tithing trains which the holds have been so gracious as to send us her voice was sharp are due within the week there shortly will be bread fit to eat she added wrinkling her nose at the crumbling gray pastry she was attempting to spread with cheese a nice change flar agreed she paused the red star performed its scheduled antic he nodded and rguls doubts have been wiped away in the enlightening red glow not at all flar grinned back at her ignoring her sarcasm not at all but he will not be so vocal in his criticism she swallowed quickly so she could speak youd do well to cut out his criticism she said ruthlessly gesturing with her knife as if plunging it into a mans heart he is never going to accept your authority with good grace we need every bronze riderthere are only seven you know he reminded her pointedly rguls a good wingleader hell settle down when the threads fall he needs proof to lay his doubts aside and the red star in the eye rock is not proof lessas expressive eyes were wide flar was privately of lessas opinion that it might be wiser to remove rguls stubborn contentiousness but he could not sacrifice a wingleader needing every dragon and rider as badly as he did i dont trust him she added darkly she sipped at her hot drink her gray eyes dark over the rim of her mug as if flar mused she didnt trust him either and she didnt past a certain point she had made that plain and in honesty he couldnt blame her she did recognize that every action flar took was towards one endthe safety and preservation of dragonkind and weyrfolk and consequently the safety and preservation of pern to effect that end he needed her full cooperation when weyr business or dragonlore were discussed she suspended the antipathy he knew she felt for him in conferences she supported him wholeheartedly and persuasively but always he suspected the double edge to her comments and saw a speculative suspicious look in her eyes he needed not only her tolerance but her empathy tell me she said after a long silence did the sun touch the finger rock before the red star was bracketed in the eye rock or after matter of fact im not sure as i did not see it myselfthe concurrence lasts only a few momentsbut the two are supposed to be simultaneous she frowned at him sourly whom did you waste it on rgul she was provoked her angry eyes looked everywhere but at him i am weyrleader he informed her curtly she was unreasonable she awarded him one long hard look before she bent to finish her meal she ate very little quickly and neatly compared to jora she didnt eat enough in the course of an entire day to nourish a sick child but then there was no point in ever comparing lessa to jora he finished his own breakfast absently piling the mugs together on the empty tray she rose silently and removed the dishes as soon as the weyr is free well go he told her so you said and she nodded towards the sleeping queen visible through the open arch we still must wait upon ramoth isnt she rousing her tails been twitching an hour she always does that about this time of day flar leaned across the table his brows drawn together thoughtfully as he watched the golden forked tip of the queens tail jerk spasmodically from side to side mnementh too and always at dawn and early morning as if somehow they associate that time of day with trouble or the red stars rising some subtle difference in her tone caused flar to glance quickly at her it wasnt anger now for missing the mornings phenomenon her eyes were fixed on nothing her face smooth at first was soon wrinkled with a vaguely anxious frown as tiny lines formed between her arching welldefined brows dawnthats when all warnings come she murmured what kind of warnings he asked with quiet encouragement there was that morninga few days beforebefore you and fax descended on ruath hold something woke mea feeling like a very heavy pressurethe sensation of some terrible danger threatening she was silent the red star was just rising the fingers of her left hand opened and closed she gave a convulsive shudder her eyes refocused on him you and fax did come out of the northeast from crom she said sharply ignoring the fact flar noticed that the red star also rises north of true east indeed we did he grinned at her remembering that morning vividly he remembered too how certain he had been as faxs procession wound down the long valley to ruath hold that he and fax would find some excuse for a mortal duel and that he had somehow convinced himself that ruatha valley held a woman who had the unusual talents it would take to become the weyrwoman pern needed to impress the unhatched queen indeed we did he chuckled although he added gesturing around the great cavern to emphasize i prefer to believe i served you well that day you remember it with displeasure the look she gave him was coldly inscrutable danger comes in many guises i agree he replied amiably determined not to rise to her bait had any other rude awakenings he inquired conversationally the absolute stillness in the room brought his attention back to her her face had drained of all color the day fax invaded ruath hold her voice was a barely articulated whisper her eyes were wide and staring her hands clenched the edge of the table she said nothing for such a long interval flar became concerned this was an unexpectedly violent reaction to a casual question tell me he suggested softly she spoke in unemotional impersonal tones as if she were reciting a traditional ballad or something that had happened to an entirely different person i was a childjust eleven i woke at dawn her voice trailed off her eyes remained focused on nothing staring at a scene that had happened long ago flar was stirred by an irresistible desire to comfort her it struck him forcibly even as he was stirred by this unusual compassion that he had never thought that lessa of all people would be troubled by so old a terror mnementh sharply informed his rider that lessa was obviously bothered a good deal enough so that her mental anguish was rousing ramoth from sleep in less accusing tones mnementh informed flar that rgul had finally taken off with his weyrling pupils his dragon hath however was in a fine state of disorientation due to rguls state of mind must flar unsettle everyone in the weyr oh be quiet flar retorted under his breath why lessa demanded in her normal voice i didnt mean you my dear weyrwoman he assured her smiling pleasantly as if the entranced interlude had never occurred mnementh is full of advice these days like rider like dragon she replied tartly ramoth yawned mightily lessa was instantly on her feet running to her dragons side her slight figure dwarfed by the sixfoot dragon head a tender adoring expression flooded her face as she gazed into ramoths gleaming opalescent eyes flar clenched his teeth envious by the egg of a riders affection for her dragon in his mind he heard mnemenths dragon equivalent of laughter shes hungry lessa informed flar an echo of her love for ramoth lingering in the soft line of her mouth in the kindness in her gray eyes shes always hungry he observed and followed them out of the weyr mnementh hovered courteously just beyond the ledge until lessa and ramoth had taken off they glided down the weyr bowl over the misty bathing lake towards the feeding ground at the opposite end of the long oval that comprised the floor of benden weyr the striated precipitous walls were pierced with the black mouths of single weyr entrances deserted at this time of day by the few dragons who might otherwise doze on their ledges in the wintry sun benden weyr that could house five hundred beasts accommodated a scant two hundred these days as flar vaulted to mnemenths smooth bronze neck he hoped that ramoths clutch would be spectacular erasing the ignominy of the paltry dozen nemorth had laid in each of her last few clutches he had no serious doubts of the improvement after ramoths remarkable mating flight with his mnementh the bronze dragon smugly echoed his riders certainty and both looked on the queen possessively as she curved her wings to land she was twice nemorths size for one thing her wings halfawing again longer than mnemenths who was the biggest of the seven male bronzes flar looked to ramoth to repopulate the five empty weyrs even as he looked to himself and lessa to rejuvenate the pride and faith of dragonriders and of pern itself he only hoped time enough remained to him to do what was necessary the red star had been bracketed by the eye rock the threads would soon be falling somewhere in one of the other weyrs records must be the information he needed to ascertain when exactly threads would fall mnementh landed flar jumped down from the curving neck to stand beside lessa the three watched as ramoth a buck grasped in each of her forefeet rose to a feeding ledge will her appetite never taper off lessa asked with affectionate dismay as a dragonet ramoth had been eating to grow her full stature attained she was of course now eating for her young and she applied herself conscientiously flar chuckled and squatted hunter fashion he picked up shale flakes skating them across the flat dry ground counting the dust puffs boyishly the time will come when she wont eat everything in sight he assured lessa but shes still young and needs her strength lessa interrupted her voice a fair imitation of rguls pedantic tones flar looked up at her squinting against the wintry sun that slanted down at them shes a finely grown beast especially compared to nemorth he gave a contemptuous snort in fact there is no comparison however look here he ordered peremptorily he tapped the smoothed sand in front of him and she saw that his apparently idle gestures had been to a purpose with a sliver of stone he drew a design in quick strokes in order to fly a dragon between he has to know where to go and so do you he grinned at the astonished and infuriated look of comprehension on her face ah but there are certain consequences to an illconsidered jump badly visualized reference points often result in staying between his voice dropped ominously her face cleared of its resentment so there are certain reference or recognition points arbitrarily taught all weyrlings that he pointed first to his facsimile and then to the actual star stone with its finger and eye rock companions on benden peak that is the first recognition point a weyrling learns when i take you aloft you will reach an altitude just above the star stone near enough for you to be able to see the hole in the eye rock clearly fix that picture sharply in your minds eye relay it to ramoth that will always get you home understood but how do i learn recognition points of places ive never seen he grinned up at her youre drilled in them first by your instructor and he pointed the sliver at his chest and then by going there having directed your dragon to get the visualization from her instructor and he indicated mnementh the bronze dragon lowered his wedgeshaped head until one eye was focused on his rider and his mates rider he made a pleased noise deep in his chest lessa laughed up at the gleaming eye and with unexpected affection patted the soft nose flar cleared his throat in surprise he was aware that mnementh showed an unusual affection for the weyrwoman but he had had no idea lessa was fond of the bronze perversely he was irritated however he said and his voice sounded unnatural to himself we take the young riders constantly to and from the main reference points all across pern to all the holds so that they have eyewitness impressions on which to rely as a rider becomes adept in picking out landmarks he gets additional references from other riders therefore to go between there is actually only one requirement a clear picture of where you want to go and a dragon he grinned at her also you should always plan to arrive above your reference point in clear air lessa frowned it is better to arrive in open air flar waved a hand above his head rather than underground and he slapped his open hand into the dirt a puff of dust rose warningly but the wings took off within the bowl itself the day the lords of the hold arrived lessa reminded him flar chuckled at her uptake true but only the most seasoned riders once we came across a dragon and a rider entombed together in solid rock theywerevery young his eyes were bleak i take the point she assured him gravely thats her fifth she added pointing towards ramoth who was carrying her latest kill up to the bloody ledge shell work them off today i assure you flar remarked he rose brushing off his knees with sharp slaps of his riding gloves test her temper lessa did so with a silent had enough she grimaced at ramoths indignant rejection of the thought the queen went swooping down for a huge fowl rising in a flurry of gray brown and white feathers shes not as hungry as shes making you think the deceitful creature flar chuckled and saw that lessa had reached the same conclusion her eyes were snapping with vexation when youve finished the bird ramoth do let us learn how to fly between lessa said aloud for flars benefit before our good weyrleader changes his mind ramoth looked from her gorging turned her head towards the two riders at the edge of the feeding ground her eyes gleamed she bent her head again to her kill but lessa could sense the dragon would obey it was cold aloft lessa was glad of the fur lining in her riding gear and the warmth of the great golden neck which she bestrode she decided not to think of the absolute cold of between which she had experienced only once coming from ruath hold to benden weyr three turns before she glanced below on her right where bronze mnementh hovered and caught his amused thought flar tells me to tell ramoth to tell you to fix the alignment of the star stone firmly in your mind as a homing then mnementh went on amiably we shall fly down to the lake you will return from between to this exact point do you understand lessa found herself grinning foolishly with anticipation and nodded vigorously how much time was saved because she could speak directly to the dragons ramoth made a disgruntled noise deep in her throat lessa patted her reassuringly have you got the picture in your mind dear one she asked and ramoth again rumbled less annoyed because she was catching lessas excitement mnementh stroked the cold air with his wings greenish brown in the sunlight and curved down gracefully towards the lake on the plateau below benden weyr his flight line took him very low over the rim of the weyr from lessas angle it looked like a collision course ramoth followed closely in his wake lessa caught her breath at the sight of the jagged boulders just below ramoths wing tips it was exhilarating lessa crowed to herself doubly stimulated by the elation that flowed back to her from ramoth mnementh halted above the farthest shore of the lake and there too ramoth came to hover mnementh flashed the thought to lessa that she was to place the picture of where she wished to go firmly in her mind and direct ramoth to get there lessa complied the next instant the awesome bonepenetrating cold of black between enveloped them before either she or ramoth was aware of more than that invidious touch of cold and impregnable darkness they were above the star stone lessa let out a cry of triumph it is extremely simple ramoth seemed disappointed mnementh reappeared beside and slightly below them you are to return by the same route to the lake he ordered and before the thought had finished ramoth took off mnementh was beside them above the lake fuming with his own and flars anger you did not visualize before transferring dont think a first successful trip makes you perfect you have no conception of the dangers inherent in between never fail to picture your arrival point again lessa glanced down at flar even two wingspans apart she could see the vivid anger on his face almost feel the fury flashing from his eyes and laced through the wrath a terrible sinking fearfulness for her safety that was a more effective reprimand than his wrath lessas safety she wondered bitterly or ramoths you are to follow us mnementh was saying in a calmer tone rehearsing in your mind the two reference points you have already learned we shall jump to and from them this morning gradually learning other points around benden they did flying as far away as benden hold itself nestled against the foothills above benden valley the weyr peak a far point against the noonday sky lessa did not neglect to visualize a clearly detailed impression each time this was as marvelously exciting as she had hoped it would be lessa confided to ramoth ramoth replied yes it was certainly preferable to the timeconsuming methods others had to use but she didnt think it was exciting at all to jump between from benden weyr to benden hold and back to benden weyr again it was dull they had met with mnementh above the star stone again the bronze dragon sent lessa the message that this was a very satisfactory initial session they would practice some distant jumping tomorrow tomorrow thought lessa glumly some emergency will occur or our hardworking weyrleader will decide todays session constitutes keeping his promise and that will be that there was one jump she could make between from anywhere on pern and not miss her mark she visualized ruatha for ramoth as seen from the heights above the holdto satisfy that requirement to be scrupulously clear lessa projected the pattern of the firepits before fax invaded and she had had to manipulate its decline ruatha had been such a lovely prosperous valley she told ramoth to jump between the cold was intense and seemed to last for many heartbeats just as lessa began to fear she had somehow lost them between they exploded into the air above the hold elation filled her that for flar and his excessive caution with ramoth she could jump anywhere for there was the distinctive pattern of ruathas firegutted heights it was just before dawn the breast pass between crom and ruatha black cones against the lightening gray sky fleetingly she noticed the absence of the red star that now blazed in the dawn sky and fleetingly she noticed a difference in the air chill yes but not wintrythe air held that moist coolness of early spring startled she glanced downward wondering if she could have for all her assurance erred in some fashion but no this was ruath hold the tower the inner court the aspect of the broad avenue leading down to the crafthold were just as they should be wisps of smoke from distant chimneys indicated people were making ready for the day ramoth caught the tenor of her insecurity and began to press for an explanation this is ruatha lessa replied stoutly it can be no other circle the heights see there are the firepit lines i gave you lessa gasped the coldness in her stomach freezing her muscles below her in the slowly lifting predawn gloom she saw the figures of many men toiling over the breast of the cliff from the hills beyond ruatha men moving with quiet stealth like criminals she ordered ramoth to keep as still as possible in the air so as not to direct their attention upward the dragon was curious but obedient who would be attacking ruatha it seemed incredible the present warder lytol was a former dragonman and had savagely repelled one attack already was there thought of aggression among the holds now that flar was weyrleader what hold lord would be mounting a territorial war in the winter no not winter the air here was springlike the men crept on over the firepits to the edge of the heights suddenly lessa realized they were lowering rope ladders over the face of the cliff down towards the open shutters of the inner hold wildly she clutched at ramoths neck certain of what she saw this was the invader fax now dead nearly three turnsfax and his men as they began their attack on ruatha nearly thirteen turns ago yes there was the tower guard his face a white blot turned towards the cliff itself watching he had been paid his bribe to stand silent this morning but the watchwher trained to give alarm for any intrusion why was it not trumpeting its warning why was it silent because ramoth informed her rider with calm logic it senses your presence as well as mine so how could the hold possibly be in danger no no lessa moaned what can i do now how can i wake them where is the girl i was i was asleep and then i woke i remember i dashed from my room i was so scared i went down the steps and nearly fell i knew i had to get to the watchwhers kenneli knew lessa clutched at ramoths neck for support as past acts and mysteries became devastatingly clear she herself had warned herself just as it was her presence on the queen dragon that had kept the watchwher from giving alarm for as she watched stunned and speechless she saw the small grayrobed figure that could only be herself as a youngster burst from the hold hall door race down the cold stone steps into the court and disappear into the watchwhers stinking den faintly she heard it lurring in piteous confusion just as lessathegirl reached that doubtful sanctuary faxs invaders swooped into the open window embrasures and began the slaughter of her sleeping family backback to the star stone lessa cried in her wide and staring eyes she held the image of the guiding rocks like a rudder for her sanity as well as ramoths direction the intense cold acted as a restorative and then they were above the quiet peaceful wintry weyr as if they had never paradoxically visited ruatha flar and mnementh were nowhere to be seen ramoth however was unshaken by the experience she had only gone where she had been told and had not quite understood that going when she had been told had shocked lessa she suggested to her rider that mnementh had probably followed them to ruatha so if lessa would give her the proper references shed take her there ramoths sensible attitude was comforting lessa carefully drew for ramoth not the childs memory of a longvanished idyllic ruatha but her more recent recollection of the hold gray sullen at dawning with a red star pulsing on the horizon and there they were again hovering over the valley the hold below them on the right the grasses grew untended on the heights clogging fire pit and brickwork the scene showed all the deterioration she had encouraged in her effort to thwart fax of any profit from conquering ruath hold but as she watched vaguely disturbed she saw a figure emerge from the kitchen saw the watchwher creep from its lair and follow the raggedly dressed figure as far across the court as the chain permitted she saw the figure ascend the tower gaze first eastward then northeastward this was still not ruatha of today and now lessas mind reeled disoriented this time she had come back to visit herself of three turns ago to see the filthy drudge plotting revenge on fax she felt the absolute cold of between as ramoth snatched them back emerging once more above the star stone lessa was shuddering her eyes frantically raking the reassuring sight of the weyr bowl hoping she had not somehow shifted backwards in time yet again mnementh suddenly erupted into the air a few lengths below and beyond ramoth lessa greeted him with a cry of intense relief back to your weyr there was no disguising the white fury in mnemenths tone lessa was too unnerved to respond in any way other than instant compliance ramoth glided swiftly to their ledge quickly clearing the perch for mnementh to land the rage on flars face as he leaped from mnementh and advanced on lessa brought her wits back abruptly she made no move to evade him as he grabbed her shoulders and shook her violently how dare you risk yourself and ramoth why must you defy me at every opportunity do you realize what would happen to all pern if we lost ramoth where did you go he was spitting with anger punctuating each question that tumbled from his lips by shaking her ruatha she managed to say trying to keep herself erect she reached out to catch at his arms but he shook her again ruatha we were there you werent where did you go ruatha lessa cried louder clutching at him distractedly because he kept jerking her off balance she couldnt organize her thoughts with him jolting her she was at ruatha mnementh said firmly we were there twice ramoth added as the dragons calmer words penetrated flars fury he stopped shaking lessa she hung limply in his grasp her hands weakly plucking at his arms her eyes closed her face gray he picked her up and strode rapidly into the queens weyr the dragons following he placed her upon the couch wrapping her tightly in the fur cover he called down the service shaft for the duty cook to send up hot klah all right what happened he demanded she didnt look at him but he got a glimpse of her haunted eyes she blinked constantly as if she longed to erase something she had recently seen finally she got herself somewhat under control and said in a low tired voice i did go to ruatha onlyi went back to ruatha back to ruatha flar repeated the words stupidly the significance momentarily eluded him certainly mnementh agreed and flashed to flar the two scenes he had picked out of ramoths mind staggered by the import of the visualization flar found himself slowly sinking to the edge of the bed youyou went between times lessa nodded slowly the terror was beginning to leave her eyes between times flar murmured i wonder his mind raced through the possibilities it might well tip the scales of survival in the weyrs favor he couldnt think exactly how to use this extraordinary ability but there must be an advantage in it for dragonfolk the service shaft tumbled he took the pitcher from the platform and poured two cups lessas hands were shaking so much she couldnt get hers to her lips he steadied it for her wondering if going between times would cause this kind of shock regularly if so it wouldnt be any advantage at all he wondered if shed had enough of a scare this day so she might not be so contemptuous of his orders the next time outside in the weyr mnementh snorted his opinion on that flar ignored him lessa was trembling violently now he put an arm around her pressing the fur against her slender body he held the mug to her lips forcing her to drink he could feel the tremors ease off she finally held the cup and took long slow deep breaths between swallows equally determined to get herself under control the moment he felt her stiffen under his arm he released her he wondered if lessa had ever had someone to turn to certainly not after fax invaded her family hold she had been only eleven a child had hate and revenge been the only emotions the growing girl had practiced she lowered the cup cradling it in her hands carefully as if it had assumed some undefinable importance to her now tell me he ordered after a long deep breath she began to speak her hands tightening around the mug her inner turmoil had not lessened it was merely under control now ramoth and i were bored with the weyrling exercises she admitted candidly grimly flar recognized that while the adventure might have taught her to be more circumspect it had not scared her into obedience he doubted that anything would i gave her the picture of ruatha so we could go between there she did not look at him but her profile was outlined against the dark fur of the rug the ruatha i knew so well i accidentally sent myself backwards in time to the day fax invaded her shock was now comprehensible to him and he prompted her his voice carefully neutral and i saw myself her voice broke off with an effort she continued i had visualized for ramoth the designs of the fire pits and the angle of the hold if one looked down from the pits into the inner court that was where we emerged it was just dawnshe lifted her chin with a nervous jerkand there was no red star in the sky she gave him a quick defensive look as if she expected him to contest this detail and i saw men creeping over the fire pits lowering rope ladders to the top windows of the hold i saw the tower guard watching just watching she clenched her teeth at such treachery and her eyes gleamed malevolently and i saw myself run from the hall into the watchwhers lair and do you know why her voice lowered to a bitter whisper the watchwher did not alarm the hold why because there was a dragon in the sky and i lessa of ruatha was on her she flung the mug from her as if she wished she could reject the knowledge too because i was there the watchwher did not alarm the hold thinking the intrusion legitimate with one of the blood on a dragon in the sky so i her body grew rigid her hands clasped so tightly the knuckles were white i was the cause of my familys massacre not fax if i had not acted the captious fool today i would not have been there with ramoth and the watchwher would her voice had risen to an hysterical pitch of recrimination he slapped her sharply across the cheeks grabbing her robe and all to shake her the stunned look in her eyes and the tragedy in her face alarmed him his indignation over her willfulness disappeared her unruly independence of mind and spirit attracted him as much as her curious dark beauty infuriating as her fractious ways might be they were too vital a part of her integrity to be exorcised her indomitable will had taken a grievous shock today and her selfconfidence had better be restored quickly on the contrary lessa he said sternly fax would still have murdered your family he had planned it very carefully even to scheduling his attack on the morning when the tower guard was one who could be bribed remember too it was dawn and the watchwher being a nocturnal beast blind by daylight is relieved of responsibility at dawn and knows it your presence damnable as it may appear to you was not the deciding factor by any means it did and i draw your attention to this very important fact it did cause you to save yourself by warning lessathechild dont you see that i could have called out she murmured but the frantic look had left her eyes and there was a faint hint of normal color in her lips if you wish to flail around in guilt go right ahead he said with deliberate callousness ramoth interjected a thought that since they too had been there that previous time as faxs men had prepared to invade it had already happened so how could it be changed the act was inevitable both that day and today for how else could lessa have lived to come to the weyr and impress ramoth at the hatching mnementh relayed ramoths message scrupulously even to imitating ramoths egocentric nuances flar looked sharply at lessa to see the effect of ramoths astringent observation just like ramoth to have the final word she said with a hint of her former droll humor flar felt the muscles along his neck and shoulders begin to relax shed be all right he decided but it might be wiser to make her talk it all out now to put the whole experience into proper perspective you said you were there twice he leaned back on the couch watching her closely when was the second time cant you guess she asked sarcastically no he lied when else but the dawn i wakened feeling the red star was a menace to me three days before you and fax came out of the northeast it would seem he remarked drily that you were your own premonition both times she nodded have you had any more of these presentimentsor should i say reinforced warnings she shuddered but answered him with more of her old spirit no but if i should you go i dont want to flar grinned maliciously i would however she added like to know why and how it could happen ive never run across a mention of it anywhere he told her candidly of course if you have done it and you undeniably have he assured her hastily at her indignant protest it obviously can be done you say you thought of ruatha but you thought of it as it was on that particular day certainly a day to be remembered you thought of spring before dawn no red staryes i remember you mentioning thatso one would have to remember references peculiar to a significant day to return between times to the past she nodded slowly thoughtfully you used the same method the second time to get to the ruatha of three turns ago again of course it was spring he rubbed his palms together then brought his hands down on his knees with an emphatic slap and rose to his feet ill be back he said and strode from the room ignoring her halfarticulated cry of warning ramoth was curling up in the weyr as he passed her he noticed that her color remained good in spite of the drain of her energies by the mornings exercises she glanced at him her manyfaceted eye already covered by the inner protective lid mnementh awaited his rider on the ledge and the moment flar leaped to his neck took off he circled upwards hovering above the star stone you wish to try lessas trick mnementh said unperturbed by the prospective experiment flar stroked the great curved neck affectionately you understand how it worked for ramoth and lessa as well as anyone can mnementh replied with the approximation of a shrug when did you have in mind at that moment flar had had no idea now unerringly his thoughts drew him backwards to the summer day rguls bronze hath had flown to mate the grotesque nemorth and rgul had become weyrleader in place of his dead father flon only the cold of between gave them any indication they had transferred they were still hovering above the star stone flar wondered if they had missed some essential part of the transfer then he realized that the sun was in another quarter of the sky and the air was warm and sweet with summer the weyr below was empty there were no dragons sunning themselves on the ledges no women busy at tasks in the bowl noises impinged on his senses raucous laughter yells shrieks and a soft crooning noise that dominated the bedlam then from the direction of the weyrling barracks in the lower caverns two figures emerged a stripling and a young bronze dragon the boys arm lay limply along the beasts neck the impression that reached the hovering observers was one of utter dejection the two halted by the lake the boy peering into the unruffled blue waters then glancing upward towards the queens weyr flar knew the boy for himself and compassion for that younger self filled him if only he could reassure that boy so torn by grief so filled with resentment that he would one day become weyrleader abruptly startled by his own thoughts he ordered mnementh to transfer back the utter cold of between was like a slap in his face replaced almost instantly as they broke out of between into the cold of normal winter slowly mnementh flew back down to the queens weyr as sobered as flar by what they had seen rise high in glory bronze and gold drive entwined enhance the hold count three months and more and five heated weeks a day of glory and in a month who seeks a strand of silver in the sky with heat all quickens and all times fly i dont know why you insisted fnor unearth these ridiculous things from ista weyr lessa exclaimed in a tone of exasperation they consist of nothing but trivial notes on how many measures of grain were used to bake daily bread flar glanced up at her from the records he was studying he sighed leaned back in his chair in a bonepopping stretch and i used to think lessa said with a rueful expression on her vivid narrow face that those venerable records would hold the total sum of all dragonlore and human wisdom or so i was led to believe she added pointedly flar chuckled they do but you have to disinter it lessa wrinkled her nose phew they smell as if we hadand the only decent thing to do would be to rebury them which is another item im hoping to findthe old preservative technique that kept the skins from hardening and smelling its stupid anyhow to use skins for recording there ought to be something better we have become dear weyrleader entirely too hidebound while flar roared with appreciation of her pun she regarded him impatiently suddenly she jumped up fired by another of her mercurial moods well you wont find it you wont find the facts youre looking for because i know what youre really after and it isnt recorded explain yourself its time we stopped hiding a rather brutal truth from ourselves which is our mutual feeling that the red star is a menace and that the threads will come we decided that out of pure conceit and then went back between times to particularly crucial points in our lives and strengthened that notion in our earlier selves and for you it was when you decided you were destined her voice mocked the word to become weyrleader one day could it be she went on scornfully that our ultraconservative rgul has the right of it that there have been no threads for four hundred turns because there are no more and that the reason we have so few dragons is because the dragons sense they are no longer essential to pern that we are anachronisms as well as parasites flar did not know how long he sat looking at her bitter face nor how long it took him to find answers for her probing questions anything is possible weyrwoman he heard his voice replying calmly including the unlikely fact that an elevenyearold child scared stiff could plot revenge on her familys murderer andagainst all oddssucceed she took an involuntary step forward struck by his unexpected rebuttal she listened intently i prefer to believe he went on inexorably that there is more to life than raising dragons and playing spring games that is not enough for me and i have made others look further beyond selfinterest and comfort i have given them a purpose a discipline everyone dragonfolk and holder alike profits i am not looking in these records for reassurance im looking for solid facts i can prove weyrwoman that there have been threads i can prove that there have been intervals during which the weyrs have declined i can prove that if you sight the red star directly bracketed by the eye rock at the moment of winter solstice the red star will pass close enough to pern to throw off threads since i can prove those facts i believe pern is in danger i believenot the youngster of fifteen turns ago flar the bronze rider the weyrleader believes it he saw her eyes reflecting shadowy doubts but he sensed his arguments were beginning to reassure her you felt constrained to believe in me once before he went on in a milder voice when i suggested that you could be weyrwoman you believed me and he made a gesture around the weyr as substantiation she gave him a weak humorless smile that was because i had never planned what to do with my life once i did have fax lying dead at my feet of course being ramoths weyrmate is wonderful butand she frowned slightlyit isnt enough anymore either thats why i wanted so to learn to fly and then thats how this argument started in the first place flar finished for her with a sardonic smile he leaned across the table urgently believe with me lessa until you have cause not to i respect your doubts theres nothing wrong in doubting it sometimes leads to greater faith but believe in me until spring if the threads have not fallen by then he shrugged fatalistically she looked at him for a long moment and then inclined her head slowly in agreement he tried to suppress the relief he felt at her decision lessa as fax had discovered was a ruthless adversary and a canny advocate besides these she was weyrwoman essential to his plans now lets get back to the contemplation of trivia they do tell me you know time place and duration of thread incursions he grinned up at her reassuringly and those are facts i must have to make up my timetable timetable but you said you didnt know the time not the day to the second when the threads may spin down for one thing while the weather holds so unusually cold for this time of year the threads simply turn brittle and blow away like dust theyre harmless however when the air is warm they are viable anddeadly he made fists of both hands placing one above and to one side of the other the red star is my right hand my left is pern the red star turns very fast and in the opposite direction to us it also wobbles erratically how do you know that diagram on the walls of the fort weyr hatching ground that was the very first weyr so when the star makes a pass the threads spin off down towards us in attacks that last six hours and occur about fourteen hours apart attacks last six hours he nodded gravely when the red star is closest to us right now it is just beginning its pass she frowned he rummaged among the skin sheets on the table and an object dropped to the stone floor with a metallic clatter curious lessa bent to pick it up turning the thin sheet over in her hands whats this she ran an exploratory finger lightly across the irregular design on one side i dont know fnor brought it back from fort weyr it was nailed to one of the chests in which records had been stored he brought it along thinking it might be important said there was a plate like it just under the red star diagram on the wall of the hatching ground this first part is plain enough mothers fathers father who departed for all time between said this was the key to the mystery and it came to him while doodling he said that he said arrhenius eureka mycorrhiza of course that part doesnt make any sense at all it isnt even pernese just babbling the last three words i have studied it lessa the only way to depart for all time between is to die right people cant just fly away on their own obviously so it is a death vision dutifully recorded by a grandchild who couldnt spell very well doodling as the present tense of dying he smiled indulgently and as for the rest of it after the nonsense like most death visions it explains what everyone has always known the second part says simply flamethrowing firelizards to wipe out the spores qed no this is no help in our researches just a primitive rejoicing that he is a dragonman who didnt even know the right word for threads lessa wet one fingertip to see if the patterns were inked on the metal was shiny enough to be a good mirror however the patterns remained smooth and precise primitive or no they had a more permanent way of recording their visions than wellpreserved skins wellpreserved babblings said flar turning back to the skins he was checking for understandable data a badlyscored ballad perhaps said lessa dismissing it the design isnt even pretty flar pulled forward a chart that showed overlapping horizontal bands imposed on the project of perns continental mass here he said this represents waves of attack and this one he pulled forward the second map with vertical bands shows time bands so you can see that with a fourteenhour break only certain parts of pern are affected in each attack one reason for the spacing of the weyrs six full weyrs she murmured close to three thousand dragons im aware of the statistics he replied in a voice devoid of expression it meant no one weyr was overburdened during the height of the attacks not that three thousand beasts must be available however with these timetables we can manage until ramoths first clutches have matured she turned a cynical look on him youve a lot of faith in one queens capacity he waved that remark aside impatiently ive more faith no matter what your opinion is in the startling repetitions of events in these records ha i dont mean how many measures for daily bread lessa he retorted his voice rising i mean such things as the time such and such a wing was sent out on patrol how long the patrol lasted how many riders were hurt the brooding capacities of queens during the fifty years a pass lasts and the intervals between such passes yes it tells that by all ive studied here and he pounded emphatically on the nearest stack of dusty smelly skins nemorth should have been mating twice a turn for the last ten had she even kept to her paltry twelve a clutch wed have two hundred and forty more beastsdont interrupt but we had jora as weyrwoman and rgul as weyrleader and we had fallen into planetwide disfavor during a four hundred turn interval well ramoth will brood over no measly dozen and shell lay a queen egg mark my words she will rise often to mate and lay generously by the time the red star is passing closest to us and the attacks become frequent well be ready she stared at him her eyes wide with incredulity out of ramoth out of ramoth and out of the queens shell lay remember there are records of faranth laying sixty eggs at a time including several queen eggs lessa could only shake her head slowly in wonder a strand of silver in the sky with heat all quickens all times fly flar quoted to her shes got weeks more to go before laying and then the eggs must hatch been on the hatching ground recently wear your boots youll be burned through sandals she dismissed that with a guttural noise he sat back outwardly amused by her disbelief and then you have to make impression and wait till the riders she went on why do you think ive insisted on older boys the dragons are mature long before their riders then the system is faulty he narrowed his eyes slightly shaking the stylus at her dragon tradition started out as a guidebut there comes a time when man becomes too traditionaltoowhat was it you said the other daytoo hidebound yes its traditional to use the weyrbred because its been convenient and because this sensitivity to dragons strengthens when both sire and dam are weyrbred that doesnt mean weyrbred is best you for example theres weyrblood in the ruathan line she said proudly granted take young naton hes craftbred from nabol yet fnor tells me he can make canth understand him oh thats hard to do she interjected what do you mean flar jumped on her statement they were both interrupted by a highpitched penetrating whine flar listened intently for a moment and then shrugged grinning some greens getting herself chased again and thats another item these socalled allknowing records of yours never mention why is it only the gold dragons can reproduce flar did not suppress a lascivious chuckle well for one thing firestone inhibits reproduction if they never chewed stone a green could lay but at best they produce small beasts and we need big ones and for another thing his chuckle rolled out as he went on deliberately grinning mischievously if the greens could reproduce considering their amorousness and the numbers we have of them wed be up to our ears in dragons in next to no time the first whine was joined by another and then a low hum throbbed as if carried by the stones of the weyr itself flar his face changing rapidly from surprise to triumphant astonishment dashed up the passage before lessa could open her mouth whats the matter she demanded picking up her skirts to run after him what does that mean the hum resonating everywhere was deafening in the echochamber of the queens weyr lessa registered the fact that ramoth was gone she heard flars boots pounding down the passage to the ledge a sharp tatatat over the kettledrum booming hum the whine was so highpitched now it was inaudible but nervewracking disturbed frightened lessa followed flar out by the time she reached the ledge the bowl was awhir with dragons on the wing making for the high entrance to the hatching ground weyrfolk riders women children all screaming with excitement were pouring across the bowl to the lower entrance to the ground she caught sight of flar charging across to the tunnel entrance and she shrieked at him to wait he couldnt have heard her across the bedlam fuming because she had the long stairs to descend then must double back as the stairs faced the feeding grounds at the opposite end of the bowl from the hatching ground lessa realized that she the weyrwoman would be the last one there why had ramoth decided to be secretive about laying wasnt she close enough to her own weyrmate to want her with her a dragon knows what to do ramoth calmly informed lessa you could have told me lessa wailed feeling much abused why at the time flar had been going on largely about huge clutches and three thousand beasts that infuriating dragonchild had been doing it it didnt improve lessas temper to have to recall another remark of flarson the state of the hatching grounds the moment she stepped into the mountainhigh cavern she felt the heat through the soles of her sandals everyone was crowded in a loose circle around the far end of the cavern and everyone was swaying from foot to foot as lessa was short to begin with this only decreased the likelihood of her ever seeing what ramoth had done let me through she demanded imperiously pounding on the wide backs of two tall riders an aisle was reluctantly opened for her and she went through looking neither to her right nor left at the excited weyrfolk she was furious confused hurt and knew she looked ridiculous because the hot sand made her walk a curious quickstep mince she halted stunned and wideeyed at the mass of eggs and forgot such trivial things as hot feet ramoth was curled around the clutch looking enormously pleased with herself she too kept shifting closing and opening a protective wing over her eggs so it was difficult to count them no one will steal them silly so stop fluttering lessa exclaimed as she tried to make a tally obediently ramoth folded her wings to relieve her maternal anxiety however she snaked her head out across the circle of mottled glowing eggs looking all around the cavern flicking her forked tongue in and out an immense sigh like a gust of wind swept through the cavern for there now ramoths wings were furled gleamed an egg of glowing gold among the tan the green and the blue ones a queen egg a queen egg the cry went up simultaneously from half a hundred throats the hatching ground rang with cheers yells screams and howls of exultation someone seized lessa and swung her around in an excess of feeling a kiss landed in the vicinity of her mouth no sooner did she recover her footing than she was hugged by someone else she thought it was manora and then pounded and buffeted around in congratulation until she was reeling in a kind of dance between avoiding the celebrants and easing the growing discomfort of her feet she broke from the milling revelers and ran across the ground to ramoth she came to a sudden stop before the eggs they seemed to be pulsing the shells looked flaccid she could have sworn they were hard the day she impressed ramoth she wanted to touch one just to make sure and dared not you may ramoth assured her condescendingly she touched lessas shoulder gently with her tongue the egg was soft to touch and lessa drew her hand back quickly afraid of doing injury the heat will harden it ramoth said ramoth im so proud of you lessa sighed looking adoringly up at the great eyes which shone in rainbows of pride you are the most marvelous queen ever i do believe you will redragon all the weyrs i do believe you will ramoth inclined her head regally then began to sway it from side to side over the eggs protectingly she began to hiss suddenly raising up from her crouch beating the air with her wings before settling back into the sands to lay yet another egg the weyrfolk uncomfortable on the hot sands were beginning to leave the hatching ground now they had paid tribute to the arrival of the golden egg a queen took several days to complete her clutch so there was no point to waiting seven eggs already lay beside the important golden one and if there were seven already this augured well for the eventual total wagers were being made and taken even as ramoth produced her ninth mottled egg a queen egg by the mother of us all flars voice said in lessas ear and ill wager therell be ten bronzes at least she looked up at him completely in harmony with the weyrleader at this moment she was conscious now of mnementh crouching proudly on a ledge gazing fondly at his mate impulsively lessa laid her hand on flars arm flar i do believe you only now flar teased her but his smile was wide and his eyes proud weyrman watch weyrman learn something new in every turn oldest may be coldest too sense the right find the true if flars orders over the next months caused no end of discussion and muttering among the weyrfolk they seemed to lessa to be only the logical outcomes of their discussion after ramoth had finished laying her gratifying total of fortyone eggs flar discarded tradition right and left treading on more than rguls conservative toes out of perverse distaste for outworn doctrines against which she herself had chafed during rguls leadership and out of respect for flars intelligence lessa backed him completely she might not have respected her earlier promise to him that she would believe in his ways until spring if she had not seen his predictions come true one after another these were based however not on the premonitions she no longer trusted after her experience between time but on recorded facts as soon as the eggshells hardened and ramoth had rolled her special queen egg to one side of the mottled clutch for attentive brooding flar brought the prospective riders into the hatching ground traditionally the candidates saw the eggs for the first time on the day of impression to this precedent flar added others very few of the sixtyodd were weyrbred and most of them were in their late teens the candidates were to get used to the eggs touch them caress them be comfortable with the notion that out of these eggs young dragons would hatch eager and waiting to be impressed flar felt that such a practice might cut down on casualties during impression when the boys were simply too scared to move out of the way of the awkward dragonets flar also had lessa persuade ramoth to let kylara near her precious golden egg kylara readily enough weaned her son and spent hours with lessa acting as her tutor beside the golden egg despite kylaras loose attachment to tbor she showed an open preference for flars company therefore lessa took great pains to foster flars plan for kylara since it meant her removal with the newhatched queen to fort weyr flars use of the holdborn as riders served an additional purpose shortly before the actual hatching and impression lytol the warder appointed at ruath hold sent another message the man positively delights in sending bad news lessa remarked as flar passed the message skin to her hes gloomy fnor agreed he had brought the message i feel sorry for that youngster cooped up with such a pessimist lessa frowned at the brown rider she still found distasteful any mention of gemmas son now lord of her ancestral hold yetshe had inadvertently caused his mothers death as she could not be weyrwoman and lady holder at the same time it was fitting that gemmas gaxom be lord at ruatha i however flar said am grateful to his warnings i suspected meron would cause trouble again hes got shifty eyes like fax lessa remarked shiftyeyed or not hes dangerous flar answered and i cannot have him spreading rumors that we are deliberately choosing men of the blood to weaken family lines there are more craftsmens sons than holders boys in any case fnor snorted i dont like him questioning that the threads have not appeared lessa said gloomily flar shrugged theyll appear in due time be thankful the weather has continued cold when the weather warms up and still no threads then i will worry he grinned at lessa in an intimate reminder of her promise fnor cleared his throat hastily and looked away however the weyrleader went on briskly i can do something about the other accusation so when it was apparent the eggs were about to hatch he broke another longstanding tradition and sent riders to fetch the fathers of the young candidates from craft and hold the great hatching cavern gave the appearance of being almost full as holder and weyrfolk watched from the tiers above the heated ground this time lessa observed there was no aura of fear the youthful candidates were tense yes but not frightened out of their wits by the rocking shattering eggs when the illcoordinated dragonets awkwardly stumbledit seemed to lessa they deliberately looked around at the eager faces as though preimpressedthe youths either stepped to one side or eagerly advanced as a crooning dragonet made his choice the impressions were made quickly and with no accidents all too soon lessa thought the triumphant process of stumbling dragons and proud new riders moved erratically out of the hatching ground to the barracks the young queen burst from her shell and moved unerringly for kylara standing confidently on the hot sands the watching beasts hummed their approval it was over too soon lessa said in a disappointed voice that evening to flar he laughed indulgently allowing himself a rare evening of relaxation now that another step had gone as planned the holder folk had been ridden home stunned dazed and themselves impressed by the weyr and the weyrleader thats because you were watching this time he remarked brushing a lock of her hair back it obscured his view of her profile he chuckled again youll notice naton nton she corrected him all right ntonimpressed a bronze just as you predicted she said with some asperity and kylara is weyrwoman for pridith lessa did not comment on that and she did her best to ignore his laughter i wonder which bronze will fly her he murmured softly it had better be tbors orth lessa said bridling he answered her the only way a wise man could crack dust blackdust turn in freezing air waste dust spacedust from red star bare lessa woke abruptly her head aching her eyes blurred her mouth dry she had the immediate memory of a terrible nightmare which just as quickly escaped recall she brushed her hair out of her face and was surprised to find she had been sweating heavily flar she called in an uncertain voice he had evidently risen early flar she called again louder hes coming mnementh informed her lessa sensed that the dragon was just landing on the ledge she touched ramoth and found that the queen too had been bothered by formless frightening dreams the dragon roused briefly and then fell back into deeper sleep disturbed by her vague fears lessa rose and dressed forgoing a bath for the first time since she had arrived at the weyr she called down the shaft for breakfast plaiting her hair with deft fingers as she waited the tray appeared on the shaft platform just as flar entered he kept looking back over his shoulder at ramoth whats got into her echoing my nightmare i woke in a cold sweat you were sleeping quietly enough when i left to assign patrols you know at the rate those dragonets are growing theyre already capable of limited flight all they do is eat and sleep and that is what makes a dragon grow lessa finished for him and sipped thoughtfully at her steaming hot klah you are going to be extra careful about their drill procedures arent you you mean to prevent an inadvertent flight between times i certainly am he assured her i dont want bored dragonriders irresponsibly popping in and out he gave her a long stern look well it wasnt my fault no one taught me to fly early enough she replied in the sweet tone she used when she was being especially malicious if id been drilled from the day of impression to the day of my first flight id never have discovered that trick true enough he said solemnly you know flar if i discovered it someone else must have and someone else may if they havent already flar drank making a face as the klah scalded his tongue i dont know how to find out discreetly we would be foolish to think we were the first it is after all an inherent ability in dragons or you would never have been able to do it she frowned took a quick breath and then let it go shrugging go on he encouraged her well isnt it possible that our conviction about the imminence of the threads could stem from one of us coming back when the threads are actually fallingi mean my dear girl we have both analyzed every stray thought and actioneven your dream this morning upset you although it was no doubt due to all the wine you drank last nightuntil we wouldnt know an honest presentiment if it walked up and slapped us in the face i cant dismiss the thought that this between times ability is of crucial value she said emphatically that my dear weyrwoman is an honest presentiment but why not why he corrected her cryptically when an idea stirred vaguely in the back of his mind he tried to nudge it out where he could mull it over mnementh announced that fnor was entering the weyr whats the matter with you flar demanded of his half brother for fnor was choking and sputtering his face red with the paroxysm dust he coughed slapping at his sleeves and chest with his riding gloves plenty of dust but no threads he said describing a wide arc with one arm as he fluttered his fingers suggestively he brushed his tight wherhide pants scowling as a fine black dust drifted off flar felt every muscle in his body tense as he watched the dust float to the floor where did you get so dusty he demanded fnor regarded him with mild surprise weather patrol in tillek entire north has been plagued with dust storms lately but what i came in for he broke off alarmed by flars taut immobility whats the matter with dust he asked in a baffled voice flar pivoted on his heel and raced for the stairs to the record room lessa was right behind him fnor belatedly trailing after tillek you said flar barked at his wingsecond he was clearing the table of stacks for the four charts he then laid out how long have these storms been going on why didnt you report them report dust storms you wanted to know about warm air masses how long have these storms been going on flars voice crackled close to a week how close six days ago the first storm was noticed in upper tillek they have been reported in bitra upper telgar crom and the high reaches fnor reported tersely he glanced hopefully at lessa but saw she too was staring at the four unusual charts he tried to see why the horizontal and vertical strips had been superimposed on perns land mass but the reason was beyond him flar was making hurried notations pushing first one map and then another away from him too involved to think straight to see clearly to understand the weyrleader snarled to himself throwing down the stylus angrily you did say only warm air masses fnor heard himself saying humbly aware that he had somehow failed his weyrleader flar shook his head impatiently not your fault fnor mine i should have asked i knew it was good luck that the weather held so cold he put both hands on fnors shoulders looking directly in his eyes the threads have been falling he announced gravely falling into cold air freezing into bits to drift on the wind and flar imitated fnors fingerfluttering as specks of black dust crack dust blackdust lessa quoted in the ballad of moretas ride the chorus is all about black dust i dont need to be reminded of moreta right now flar growled bending to the maps she could talk to any dragon in the weyrs but i can do that lessa protested slowly as if he didnt quite credit his ears flar turned back to lessa what did you just say i said i can talk to any dragon in the weyr still staring at her blinking in utter astonishment flar sank down to the table top how long he managed to say have you had this particular skill something in his tone in his manner caused lessa to flush and stammer like an erring weyrling ii always could beginning with the watchwher at ruatha and she gestured indecisively in ruathas westerly direction and i talked to mnementh at ruatha andwhen i got here i could her voice faltered at the accusing look in flars cold hard eyes accusing and worse contemptuous i thought you had agreed to help me to believe in me im truly sorry flar it never occurred to me it was any use to anyone but flar exploded onto both feet his eyes blazing with aggravation the one thing i could not figure out was how to direct the wings and keep in contact with the weyr during an attack how was i going to get reinforcements and firestone in time and youyou have been sitting there spitefully hiding the i am not spiteful she screamed at him i said i was sorry i am but youve a nasty smug habit of keeping your own council how was i to know you didnt have the same trick youre flar the weyrleader you can do anything only youre just as bad as rgul because you never tell me half the things i ought to know flar reached out and shook her until her angry voice was stopped enough we cant waste time arguing like children then his eyes widened his jaw dropped waste time thats it go between times lessa gasped between times fnor was totally confused what are you two talking about the threads started falling at dawn in nerat flar said his eyes bright his manner decisive fnor could feel his guts congealing with apprehension at dawn in nerat why the rainforests would be demolished he could feel a surge of adrenaline charging through his body at the thought of danger so were going back there between times and be there when the threads started falling two hours ago fnor the dragons can go not only where we direct them but when where when fnor repeated bewildered that could be dangerous yes but today it will save nerat now lessa and flar gave her another shake compounded of pride and affection order out all the dragons young oldany that can fly tell them to load themselves down with firestone sacks i dont know if you can talk across time my dream this morning perhaps but right now rouse the weyr he pivoted to fnor if threads are fallingwere fallingat nerat at dawn theyll be falling on keroon and ista right now because they are in that time pattern take two wings to keroon arouse the plains get them to start the fire pits blazing take some weyrlings with you and send them on to igen and ista those holds are not in as immediate danger as keroon ill reinforce you as soon as i can andkeep canth in touch with lessa flar clapped his brother on the shoulder and sent him off the brown rider too used to taking orders to argue mnementh says rgul is duty officer and rgul wants to know lessa began cmon girl flar said his eyes brilliant with excitement he grabbed up his maps and propelled her up the stairs they arrived in the weyr just as rgul entered with tsum rgul was muttering about this unusual summons hath told me to report he complained fine thing when your own dragon rgul tsum mount your wings arm them with all the firestone they can carry and assemble above star stone ill join you in a few minutes we go to nerat at dawn nerat im watch officer not patrol this is no patrol flar cut him off but sir tsum interrupted his eyes wide nerats dawn was two hours ago same as ours and that is when we are going to brown rider the dragons we have discovered can go between places temporally as well as geographically at dawn threads fell at nerat were going back between times to sear them from the sky flar paid no attention to rguls stammered demand for explanation tsum however grabbed up firestone sacks and raced back to the ledge and his waiting munth go on you old fool lessa told rgul irascibly the threads are here you were wrong now be a dragonman or go between and stay there ramoth awakened by the alarms poked at rgul with her mansized head and the exweyrleader came out of his momentary shock without a word he followed tsum down the passageway flar had thrown on his heavy wherhide tunic and shoved on his riding boots lessa be sure to send messages to all the holds now this attack will stop about four hours from now so the farthest west it can reach will be ista but i want every hold and craft warned she nodded her eyes intent on his face lest she miss a word fortunately the star is just beginning its pass so we wont have to worry about another attack for a few days ill figure out the next one when i get back now get manora to organize her women well need pails of ointment the dragons are going to be laced and that hurts most important if something goes wrong youll have to wait till a bronze is at least a year old to fly ramoth suddenly flar crushed her against him his mouth bruising hers as if all her sweetness and strength must come with him he released her so abruptly she staggered back against ramoths lowered head she clung for a moment to her dragon as much for support as for reassurance wheel and turn or bleed and burn fly between blue and green soar dive down bronze and brown dragonmen must fly when threads are in the sky as flar raced down the passageway to the ledge firesacks bumping against his thighs he was suddenly grateful for the tedious sweeping patrols over every hold and hollow of pern he could see nerat clearly in his minds eye he could see the many petaled vineflowers which were the distinguishing feature of the rainforests at this time of year their ivory blossoms would be glowing in the first beams of sunlight like dragoneyes among the tall wideleaved plants mnementh his eyes flashing with excitement hovered skittishly at the ledge flar vaulted to the bronze neck the weyr was seething with wings of all colors noisy with shouts and countercommands the atmosphere was electric but flar could sense no panic in that ordered confusion dragon and human bodies oozed out of openings around the bowl walls women scurried across the floor from one lower cavern to another the children playing by the lake were sent to gather wood for a fire the weyrlings supervised by old cgan were forming outside their barracks flar looked up to the peak and approved the tight formation of the wings assembled there in close flying order another wing formed up as he watched he recognized brown canth fnor on his neck just as the entire wing vanished he ordered mnementh aloft the wind was cold and carried a hint of moisture a late snow this was the time for it if ever rguls wing and tbors fanned out on his left tsum and dnol on his right he noted each dragon was wellladen with sacks then he gave mnementh the visualization of the early spring rainforest in nerat just before dawn the vineflowers gleaming the sea breaking against the rocks of the high shoal he left the searing cold of between and he felt a stab of doubt was he injudicious sending them all possibly to their deaths between times in this effort to outtime the threads at nerat then they were all there in the crepuscular light that promises day the lush fruity smells of the rainforest drifting up to them warm too and that was frightening he looked up and slightly to the north pulsing with menace the red star shone down the men had realized what had happened their voices raised in astonishment mnementh told flar that the dragons were mildly surprised at their riders fuss listen to me dragonriders flar called his voice harsh and distorted in an effort to be heard by all he waited till the men had moved as close as possible he told mnementh to pass the information on to each dragon then he explained what they had done and why no one spoke but there were many nervous looks exchanged across bright wings crisply he ordered the wings to fan out in a staggered formation keeping a distance of fivewings spread up or down between them the sun came up slanting across the sea like an everthickening mist threads were falling silent beautiful treacherous silvery gray were those spacetraversing spores spinning from hard frozen ovals into coarse filaments as they penetrated the warm atmospheric envelope of pern less than mindless they had been ejected from their barren planet towards pern a hideous rain that sought organic matter to nourish it into growth the southern continent of pern had already been sucked dry one thread sinking into fertile soil would burrow deep propagating thousands in the warm earth rendering it into a blackdusted wasteland a stifled roar from the throats of eighty men and dragons broke the dawn air above nerats green heightsas if the threads might hear this challenge flar mused as one dragons swiveled their wedgeshaped heads to their riders for firestone great jaws macerated the hunks the fragments were swallowed and more firestone was demanded inside the beasts acids churned and the poisonous phosphenes were readied when the dragons belched forth the gas it would ignite in the air into ravening flame to sear the threads from the sky and burn them from the soil dragon instinct took over the moment the threads began to fall above nerats shores as much admiration as flar had always held for his bronze companion it achieved newer heights in the next hours beating the air in great strokes mnementh soared with flaming breath to meet the downrushing menace the fumes swept back by the wind choked flar until he thought to crouch low on the lee side of the bronze neck the dragon squealed as threads flicked the tip of one wing instantly flar and he ducked into between cold calm black in the flicker of an eye they were back to face the reality of threads around him flar saw dragons winking in and out of between flaming as they returned diving soaring as the attack continued and they drifted across nerat flar began to recognize the pattern in the dragons instinctive evasionattack movementsand in the threads for contrary to what he had gathered from his study of the records the threads fell in patches not as rain will in steady unbroken sheets but like flurries of snow here above there whipped to one side suddenly never fluidly despite the continuity their name implied you could see a patch above you flaming your dragon would rise youd have the intense joy of seeing the clump shrivel from bottom to top sometimes a patch would fall between riders one dragon would signal he would follow and spouting flame would dive and sear gradually the dragonriders worked their way over the rainforests so densely so invitingly green flar refused to dwell on what just one live thread burrow would do to that lush land he would send back a lowflying patrol to quarter every foot one thread just one thread could put out the ivory eyes of every luminous vineflower a dragon screamed somewhere to his left before he could identify the beast it had ducked between flar heard other cries of pain from men as well as dragons he shut his ears and concentrated as dragons did on the hereandnow would mnementh remember those piercing cries later flar wished he could forget them now he flar the bronze rider felt suddenly superfluous it was the dragons who were fighting this engagement you encouraged your beast comforted him when the threads burned but you depended on his instinct and speed hot fire dripped across flars cheek burrowing like acid into his shouldera cry of surprised agony burst from flars lips mnementh took them to merciful between the dragonman batted with frantic hands at the threads felt them crumble in the intense cold of between and break off revolted he slapped at injuries still afire back in nerats humid air the sting seemed to ease mnementh crooned comfortingly and then dove at a patch breathing fire shocked at selfconsideration flar hurriedly examined his mounts shoulder for telltale score marks i duck very quickly mnementh told him and veered away from a dangerously close clump of threads a brown dragon followed them down and burned them to ash it might have been moments it might have been a hundred hours later when flar looked down in surprise at the sunlit sea threads now dropped harmlessly into the rocky tip curling westward flar felt weariness in every muscle in the excitement of frenzied battle he had forgotten the bloody scores on cheek and shoulder now as he and mnementh glided slowly the injuries ached and stung he flew mnementh high and when they had achieved sufficient altitude they hovered he could see no threads falling landward below him the dragons ranged high and low searching for any sign of a burrow alert for any suddenly toppling trees or disturbed vegetation back to the weyr he ordered mnementh in a heavy sigh he heard the bronze relay the command even as he himself was taken between he was so tired he did not even visualize wheremuch less whenrelying on mnemenths instinct to bring him safely home through time and space honor those the dragons heed in thought and favor word and deed worlds are lost or worlds are saved from those dangers dragonbraved craning her neck towards the star stone at benden peak lessa watched from the ledge until she saw the four wings disappear from view sighing deeply to quiet her inner fears lessa raced down the stairs to the floor of benden weyr she noticed someone was building a fire by the lake and that manora was already ordering her women around her voice clear but calm old cgan had the weyrlings lined up she caught the envious eyes of the newest dragonriders at the barracks windows theyd have time enough to fly a flaming dragon from what flar had intimated theyd have years she shuddered as she stepped up to the weyrlings but managed to smile at them she gave them their orders and sent them off checking quickly with each dragon to be sure the riders had given clear references the holds would shortly be stirred up to a froth canth told her that there were threads at keroon falling on the keroon side of nerat bay he told her that fnor did not think two wings were enough to protect the meadowlands lessa stopped in her tracks trying to think how many wings were already out knets wing is still here ramoth informed her on the peak lessa glanced up and saw bronze piyanth spread his wings in answer she told him to get between to keroon close to nerat bay obediently the entire wing rose and then disappeared she turned with a sigh to say something to manora when a rush of wind and a vile stench almost overpowered her the air above the weyr was full of dragons she was about to demand of piyanth why he hadnt gone to keroon when she realized there were far more beasts awing than knets twenty but you just left she cried as she recognized the unmistakable bulk of bronze mnementh that was two hours ago for us mnementh said with such weariness in his tone lessa closed her eyes in sympathy some dragons were gliding in fast from their awkwardness it was evident they were hurt as one the weyrwomen grabbed salve pots and clean rags and beckoned the injured down the numbing ointment was smeared on score marks where wings resembled black and red etched lace no matter how badly injured they might be every rider tended his beast first lessa kept one eye on mnementh sure that flar would not keep the huge bronze hovering like that if hed been hurt she was helping tsum with munths cruelly pierced right wing when she realized the sky above the star stone was empty she forced herself to finish with munth before she went to find the bronze and his rider when she did locate them she also saw kylara smearing salve on flars cheek and shoulder she was advancing purposefully across the sands towards the pair when canths urgent plea reached her she saw mnemenths head swing upwards as he too caught the browns thought flar canth says they need help lessa cried she didnt even notice then that kylara slipped away into the busy crowd flar wasnt badly hurt she reassured herself about that kylara had treated the wicked burns which looked to be shallow someone had found him another fur to replace the tatters of the threadbare one he frowned and winced because the frown creased his burned cheek he gulped hurriedly at his klah mnementh whats the tally of ablebodied oh never mind just get em aloft with a full load of firestone youre all right lessa asked a detaining hand on his arm he couldnt just go off like this could he he smiled tiredly down at her pressed his empty mug into her hands giving them a quick squeeze then he vaulted to mnemenths neck someone handed him a heavy load of sacks blue green brown and bronze dragons lifted from the weyr bowl in quick order a trifle more than sixty dragons hovered briefly above the weyr where eighty had lingered so few minutes before so few dragons so few riders how long could they take such toll canth said fnor needed more firestone she looked about anxiously none of the weyrlings were back yet from their messenger rounds a dragon was crooning plaintively and she wheeled but it was only young pridith stumbling across the weyr to the feeding grounds butting playfully at kylara as they walked the only other dragons were injured orher eyes fell on cgan emerging from the weyrling barracks cgan can you and tagath get more firestone to fnor at keroon of course the old blue rider assured her his chest lifting with pride his eyes flashing she hadnt thought to send him anywhere yet he had lived his life in training for this emergency he shouldnt be deprived of a chance at it she smiled her approval at his eagerness as they piled heavy sacks on tagaths neck the old blue dragon snorted and danced as if he were young and strong again she gave them the references canth had visualized to her she watched as the two blinked out above the star stone it isnt fair they have all the fun said ramoth peevishly lessa saw her sunning herself on the weyr ledge preening her enormous wings you chew firestone and youre reduced to a silly green lessa told her weyrmate sharply she was inwardly amused by the queens disgruntled complaint she passed among the injured then bfols dainty green beauty moaned and tossed her head unable to bend one wing which had been threaded to bare cartilage shed be out for weeks but she had the worst injury among the dragons lessa looked quickly away from the misery in bfols worried eyes as she did the rounds she realized more men were injured than beasts two in rguls wing had serious head damages one man might lose an eye completely manora had dosed him unconscious with numbweed another mans arm had been burned clear to the bone minor though most of the wounds were the tally dismayed lessa how many more would be disabled at keroon out of one hundred and seventytwo dragons fifteen already were out of action some only for a day or two to be sure a thought struck lessa if nton had actually ridden canth maybe he could ride out on the next dragonade on an injured mans beast since there were more injured riders than dragons flar broke traditions as he chose here was another one to set asideif the dragon was agreeable presuming nton was not the only new rider able to transfer to another beast what good would such flexibility do in the long run flar had definitely said the incursions would not be so frequent at first when the red star was just beginning its fiftyturnlong circling pass of pern how frequent was frequent he would know but he wasnt here well he had been right this morning about the appearance of threads at nerat so his exhaustive study of those old records had been worthwhile no that wasnt quite accurate he had forgotten to have the men alert for signs of black dust as well as warming weather as he had put the matter right by going between times she would graciously allow him that minor error but he did have an infuriating habit of guessing correctly lessa corrected herself again he didnt guess he studied he planned he thought and then he used common good sense like figuring out where and when threads would strike according to entries in those smelly records lessa began to feel better about their future now if he would just make the riders learn to trust their dragons sure instinct in battle they would keep casualties down too a shriek pierced air and ear as a blue dragon emerged above the star stone ramoth lessa screamed in an instinctive reaction hardly knowing why the queen was awing before the echo of her command had died for the careening blue was obviously in grave trouble he was trying to brake his forward speed yet one wing would not function his rider had slipped forward over the great shoulder precariously clinging to his dragons neck with one hand lessa her hands clapped over her mouth watched fearfully there wasnt a sound in the bowl but the flapping of ramoths immense wings the queen rose swiftly to position herself against the desperate blue lending him wing support on the crippled side the watchers gasped as the rider slipped lost his hold and felllanding on ramoths shoulders the blue dropped like a stone ramoth came to a gentle stop near him crouching low to allow the weyrfolk to remove her passenger it was old cgan lessa felt her stomach heave as she saw the ruin the threads had made of the old harpers face she dropped beside him pillowing his head in her lap the weyrfolk gathered in a respectful silent circle manora her face as always serene had tears in her eyes she knelt and placed her hand on the old riders heart concern flickered in her eyes as she looked up at lessa slowly she shook her head then setting her lips in a thin line she began to apply the numbing salve too toothless old to flame and too slow to get between cgan mumbled rolling his head from side to side too old but dragonmen must flywhen threads are in the sky his voice trailed off into a sigh his eyes closed lessa and manora looked at each other in anguish a terrible earshattering note cut the silence tagath sprang aloft in a tremendous leap cgans eyes rolled slowly open sightless lessa breath suspended watched the blue dragon trying to deny the inevitable as tagath disappeared in midair a low moan sprang up around the weyr like the torn lonely cry of a keening wind the dragons were uttering tribute is hegone lessa asked although she knew manora nodded slowly tears streaming down her cheeks as she reached over to close cgans dead eyes lessa rose slowly to her feet motioning to some of the women to remove the old riders body absently she rubbed her bloody hands dry on her skirts trying to concentrate on what might be needed next yet her mind turned back to what had just happened a dragonrider had died his dragon too the threads had claimed one pair already how many more would die this cruel turn how long could this one weyr survive even after ramoths forty had matured and the ones she soon would conceive and her queendaughters too lessa walked apart to quiet her uncertainties and ease her grief she saw ramoth wheel and glide aloft to land on the peak one day soon would lessa see those golden wings laced red and black from thread marks would ramothdisappear no ramoth would not not while lessa lived flar had told her long ago that she must learn to look beyond the narrow confines of hold ruatha and mere revenge he was as usual right as weyrwoman under his tutelage she had further learned that living was more than raising dragons and spring games living was struggling to do something impossibleto succeed or die knowing you had tried lessa realized that she had at last fully accepted her role as weyrwoman and mate to help flar shape men and events for many turns to cometo secure pern against the threads lessa threw her shoulders back and lifted her chin high old cgan had had the right of it dragonmen must fly when threads are in the sky and yethow long would there be dragonmen worlds are lost or worlds are saved by those dangers dragonbraved as flar had predicted the attack ended by high noon and weary dragons and riders were welcomed by ramoths highpitched trumpeting from the peak once lessa assured herself that flar had no serious injury that fnors were superficial and that manora was keeping kylara busy in the kitchens she applied herself to organizing the care of the injured and the comfort of the worried as dusk fell an uneasy peace settled on the weyr the quiet of minds and bodies too tired or too hurtful to talk lessas own words mocked her as she made out the list of wounded men and beasts twentyeight men or dragons were out of the air for the next thread battle cgan was the only fatality but there had been four more seriously injured dragons at keroon and seven badly scored men out of action entirely for months to come lessa crossed the bowl to her weyr reluctant but resigned to giving flar this unsettling news she expected to find him in the sleeping room but it was vacant ramoth was asleep already as lessa passed her on the way to the council room also empty puzzled and a little alarmed lessa halfran down the steps to the records room to find flar haggard of face poring over musty skins what are you doing here she demanded angrily you ought to be asleep so should you he drawled amused i was helping manora settle the wounded each to his own craft flar drawled but he did lean back from the table rubbing his neck and rotating the uninjured shoulder to ease stiffened muscles i couldnt sleep he admitted so i thought id see what answers i might turn up in the records more answers to what lessa cried exasperated with him as if the records ever answered anything obviously the tremendous responsibilities of perns defense against the threads were beginning to tell on the weyrleader after all there had been the stress of the first battle not to mention the drain of the traveling between times itself to get to nerat to forestall the threads flar grinned and beckoned lessa to sit beside him on the wall bench i need the answer to the very pressing question of how one understrength weyr can do the fighting of six lessa fought the panic that rose oh your time schedules will take care of that she replied gallantly youll be able to conserve the dragon power until the new forty can join the ranks flar raised a mocking eyebrow let us be honest between ourselves lessa but there have been long intervals before she argued and since pern survived them pern can again before there were always six weyrs and twenty or so turns before the red star was due to begin its pass the queens would start to produce enormous clutches all the queens not just one faithful golden ramoth oh how i curse jora he slammed to his feet and started pacing irritably brushing the lock of black hair that fell across his eyes lessa was torn with the desire to comfort him and the sinking choking fear that made it difficult to think at all you were not so doubtful he whirled back to her not until i had actually had an encounter with the threads and reckoned up the numbers of injuries that sets the odds against us even supposing we can mount other riders to uninjured dragons we will be hard put to keep a continuously effective force in the air and still maintain a ground guard he caught her puzzled frown theres nerat to be gone over on foot tomorrow id be a fool indeed if i thought wed caught and seared every thread midair get the holders to do that they cant just immure themselves safely in their inner holds and let us do all if they hadnt been so miserly and stupid he cut off her complaint with an abrupt gesture theyll do their part all right he assured her im sending for a full council tomorrow all hold lords and all craftmasters but theres more to it than just marking where threads fall how do you destroy a burrow thats gone deep under the surface a dragons breath is fine for the air and surface work but no good three feet down oh i hadnt thought of that aspect but the fire pits are only on the heights and around human habitations not on the meadowlands of keroon or on nerats so green rainforests this consideration was daunting indeed she gave a rueful little laugh shortsighted of me to suppose our dragons are all poor pern needs to dispatch the threads yet she shrugged expressively there are other methods flar said or there were there must have been i have run across frequent mention of the holds organizing ground groups and that they were armed with fire what kind is never mentioned because it was so well known he threw up his hands in disgust and sagged back down on the bench not even five hundred dragons could have seared all the threads that fell today yet they managed to keep pern threadfree pern yes but wasnt the southern continent lost or did they just have their hands too full with pern itself no ones bothered with the southern continent in a hundred thousand turns flar snorted its on the maps lessa reminded him he scowled disgustedly at the records piled in uncommunicative stacks on the long table the answer must be there somewhere there was an edge of desperation in his voice the hint that he held himself to blame for not having discovered those elusive facts half those things couldnt be read by the man who wrote them lessa said tartly besides that its been your own ideas that have helped us the most so far you compiled the timemaps and look how valuable they are already im getting too hidebound again huh he asked a halfsmile tugging at one corner of his mouth undoubtedly she assured him with more confidence than she felt we both know the records are guilty of the most ridiculous omissions well said lessa so let us forget these misguiding and antiquated precepts and think up our own guides first we need more dragons second we need them now third we need something as effective as a flaming dragon to destroy threads which have burrowed fourth we need sleep or we wont be able to think of anything she added with a touch of her usual asperity flar laughed outright hugging her youve got your mind on one thing havent you he teased she pushed ineffectually at him trying to escape for a wounded tired man he was remarkably amorous one with that kylara imagine that womans presumption dressing his wounds my responsibility as weyrwoman includes care of you the weyrleader but you spend hours with blue dragonriders and leave me to kylaras tender ministrations you didnt look as if you objected flar threw back his head and roared should i open fort weyr and send kylara on he taunted her id as soon kylara were turns as well as miles away from here lessa snapped thoroughly irritated flars jaw dropped his eyes widened he leaped to his feet with an astonished cry youve said it said what turns away thats it well send kylara back between times with her queen and the new dragonets flar excitedly paced the room while lessa tried to follow his reasoning no id better send at least one of the older bronzes fnor tooid rather have fnor in chargediscreetly of course send kylara backwhere to when to lessa interrupted him good point and flar dragged out the ubiquitous charts very good point where can we send them around here without causing anomalies by being present at one of the other weyrs the high reaches are remote no weve found remains of fires there you know still warm and no inkling as to who built them or why and if we had already sent them back theydve been ready for today and they werent so they cant have been in two places already he shook his head dazed by the paradoxes lessas eyes were drawn to the blank outline of the neglected southern continent send them there she suggested sweetly pointing theres nothing there they bring in what they need there must be water for threads cant devour that we fly in whatever else is needed fodder for the herdbeasts grain flar drew his brows together in concentration his eyes sparkling with thought the depression and defeat of a few moments ago forgotten threads wouldnt be there ten turns ago and havent been there for close to four hundred ten turns would give pridith time to mature and have several clutches maybe more queens then he frowned and shook his head no theres no weyr there no hatching ground no how do we know that lessa caught him up sharply too delighted with many aspects of this project to give it up easily the records dont mention the southern continent true but they omit a great deal how do we know it isnt green again in the four hundred turns since the threads last spun we do know that threads cant last long unless there is something organic on which to feed and that once theyve devoured all they dry up and blow away flar looked at her admiringly now why hasnt someone wondered about that before too hidebound lessa wagged her finger at him dedicated completely to this venture and theres been no need to bother with it necessityor is it jealousyhatches many a tough shell there was a smile of pure malice on his face and lessa whirled away as he reached for her the good of the weyr she retorted furthermore ill send you along with fnor tomorrow to look only fair since it is your idea lessa stood still youre not going i feel confident i can leave this project in your very capable interested hands he laughed and caught her against his uninjured side smiling down at her his eyes glowing i must play ruthless weyrleader and keep the hold lords from slamming shut their inner doors and im hoping he raised his head frowning slightly one of the craftmasters may know the solution to the third problemgetting rid of thread burrows but the trip will give ramoth something to stop her fuming he pressed the girls slender body more closely to him his full attention at last on her odd delicate face lessa you are my fourth problem he bent to kiss her at the sound of hurried steps in the passageway flar scowled irritably releasing her at this hour he muttered ready to reprove the intruder scathingly who goes there flar it was fnors voice anxious hoarse the look on flars face told lessa that not even his half brother would be spared a reprimand and it pleased her irrationally but the moment fnor burst into the room both weyrleader and weyrwoman were stunned silent there was something subtly wrong with the brown rider and as the man blurted out his incoherent message the difference suddenly registered in lessas mind he was tanned he wore no bandages and hadnt the slightest trace of the thread mark along his cheek that she had tended this evening flar its not working out you cant be alive in two times at once fnor was exclaiming distractedly he staggered against the wall grabbing the sheer rock to hold himself upright there were deep circles under his eyes visible despite the tan i dont know how much longer we can last like this were all affected some days not as badly as others i dont understand your dragons are all right fnor assured the weyrleader with a bitter laugh it doesnt bother them they keep all their wits about them but their ridersall the weyrfolk were shadows halfalive like dragonless men part of us gone forever except kylara his face contorted with intense dislike all she wants to do is go back and watch herself the womans egomania will destroy us all im afraid his eyes suddenly lost focus and he swayed wildly his eyes widened and his mouth fell open i cant stay im here already too close makes it twice as bad but i had to warn you i promise flar well stay as long as we can but it wont be much longerso it wont be long enough but we tried we tried before flar could move the brown rider whirled and ran halfcrouched from the room but he hasnt gone yet lessa gasped he hasnt even gone yet flar stared after his half brother his brows contracting with the keen anxiety he felt what can have happened lessa demanded of the weyrleader we havent even told fnor we ourselves just finished considering the idea of exploring the southern continent to see if we could send dragons back and give pridith a chance to lay a few clutches and he looked so tanned and healthy her hand flew to her own cheek and the threadmarki dressed it myself tonightits gone gone so hes been gone a long while she sank down to the bench however he has come back so he did go flar remarked slowly in a reflective tone of voice yet we now know the venture is not entirely successful even before it begins and knowing this we have sent him back ten turns for whatever good it is doing flar paused thoughtfully consequently we have no alternative but to continue with the experiment but what could be going wrong i think i know and there is no remedy he sat down beside her his eyes intent on hers lessa you were very upset when you got back from going between to ruatha that first time but i think now it was more than just the shock of seeing faxs men invading your own hold or in thinking your return might have been responsible for that disaster i think it has to do with being in two times at once he hesitated again trying to understand this immense new concept even as he voiced it lessa regarded him with such awe that he found himself laughing with embarrassment its unnerving under any conditions he went on to think of returning and seeing a younger self that must be what he meant about kylara lessa gasped about her wanting to go back and watch herselfas a child oh that wretched girl lessa was filled with anger for kylaras selfabsorption wretched selfish creature shell ruin everything not yet flar reminded her look although fnor warned us that the situation in his time is getting desperate he didnt tell us how much he was able to accomplish but you noticed that his scar had healed to invisibility consequently some turns must have elapsed even if pridith lays only one goodsized clutch even if just the forty of ramoths are mature enough to fight in three days time we have accomplished something therefore weyrwoman and he noticed how she straightened up at the sound of her title we must disregard fnors return when you fly to the southern continent tomorrow make no allusion to it do you understand lessa nodded gravely and then gave a little sigh i dont know if im happy or disappointed to realize even before we get there tomorrow that the southern continent obviously will support a weyr she said with dismay it was kind of exciting to wonder either way flar told her with a sardonic smile we have found only part of the answers to problems one and two well youd better answer number four right now lessa suggested decisively weaver miner harper smith tanner farmer herdsman lord gather wingspeed listen well to the weyrmans urgent word they both managed to guard against any reference to his premature return when they spoke to fnor the next morning flar asked brown canth to send his rider to the queens weyr as soon as he awoke and was pleased to see fnor almost immediately if the brown rider noticed the curiously intent stare lessa gave his bandaged face he gave no sign of it as a matter of fact the moment flar outlined the bold venture of scouting the southern continent with the possibility of starting a weyr ten turns back in time fnor forgot all about his wounds ill go willingly only if you send tbor along with kylara im not waiting till nton and his bronze are big enough to take her on tbor and she are as fnor broke off with a grimace in lessas direction well theyre as near a pair as can be i dont object to beingimportuned but there are limits to what a man is willing to do out of loyalty to dragonkind flar barely managed to restrain the amusement he felt over fnors reluctance kylara tried her wiles on every rider and because fnor had not been amenable she was determined to succeed with him i hope two bronzes are enough pridith may have a mind of her own come mating time you cant turn a brown into a bronze fnor exclaimed with such dismay flar could no longer restrain himself oh stop it and that touched off lessas laughter youre as bad a pair he snapped getting to his feet if were going south weyrwoman wed better get started particularly if were going to give this laughing maniac a chance to compose himself before the solemn lords descend ill get provisions from manora well lessa are you coming with me muffling her laughter lessa grabbed up her furred flying cloak and followed him at least the adventure was starting off well flar grabbed the pitcher of klah and his cup and adjourned to the council room debating whether to tell the lords and craftmasters of this southern venture or not the dragons ability to fly between times as well as places was not yet well known the lords might not yet realize it had been used the previous day to forestall the threads if he could be sure that project was going to be successful well it would add an optimistic note to the meeting let the charts with the waves and times of the thread attacks clearly visible reassure the lords the visitors were not long in assembling nor were they all successful in hiding their apprehension and the shock they had received now that threads had again spun down from the red star to menace all life on pern this was going to be a difficult session flar decided grimly he had a fleeting wish which he quickly suppressed that he had gone with fnor and lessa to the southern continent instead he bent with apparent industry to the charts before him soon there were but two more to come meron of nabol whom he would have liked not to include for the man was a troublemaker and lytol of ruatha he had sent for lytol last because he did not wish lessa to encounter the man she was still overly and to his mind foolishly sensitive over resigning her claim to ruatha hold for lady gemmas posthumous son lytol as warder of ruatha had a place in this conference the man was also an exdragonman and his return to the weyr was painful enough without lessa compounding it with her resentment lytol had turned to the weavers craft after his dragons death and his compulsory exile from the weyr he was with the exception of young larad of telgar the weyrs most valuable ally slel came in with meron a step behind him the holder was furious at this summons it showed in his walk in his eyes in his haughty bearing but he was also as inquisitive as he was devious he nodded only to larad among the lords and took the seat left vacant for him by larads side merons manner made it obvious that that place was too close to flar by half a room the weyrleader acknowledged slels salute and indicated the bronze rider should be seated flar had given thought to the seating arrangements in the council room carefully interspersing brown and bronze dragonriders with holders and craftsmen there was now barely room to move in the generously proportioned cavern but there was also no room in which to draw daggers if tempers got hot a hush fell on the gathering and flar looked up to see that the stocky glowering exdragonman from ruatha had stopped at the threshold of the council he slowly brought his hand up in a respectful salute to the weyrleader as flar returned the salute he noticed that the tic in lytols left cheek jumped almost continuously lytols eyes dark with pain and inner unquiet ranged the room he nodded to the members of his former wing to larad and zurg head of his own weavers craft stifflegged he walked to the remaining seat murmuring a greeting to tsum on his left flar rose i appreciate your coming good lords and craftmasters the threads spin once again the first attack has been met and seared from the sky lord vincet and the worried holder of nerat looked up in alarm we have dispatched a patrol to the rainforest to do a lowflight sweep to make certain there are no burrows vincet swallowed nervously his face paling at the thought of what threads could do to his fertile lush holdings we shall need your best junglemen to help helpbut you saidthe threads were seared in the sky there is no point in taking the slightest chance flar replied implying the patrol was only a precaution instead of the necessity he knew it would be vincet gulped glancing anxiously around the room for sympathyand found none everyone would soon be in his position there is a patrol due at keroon and at igen and flar looked first at lord corman then lord banger who gravely nodded let me say by way of reassurance that there will be no further attacks for three days and four hours flar tapped the appropriate chart the threads will begin approximately here on telgar drift westward through the southernmost portion of crom which is mountainous and on through ruatha and the southern end of nabol how can you be so certain of that flar recognized the contemptuous voice of meron of nabol the threads do not fall like a childs tumblesticks lord meron flar replied they fall in a definitely predictable pattern the attacks last exactly six hours the intervals between attacks will gradually shorten over the next few turns as the red star draws closer then for about forty full turns as the red star swings past and around us the attacks occur every fourteen hours marching across our world in a timetable fashion so you say meron sneered and there was a low mumble of support so the teaching ballads say larad put in firmly meron glared at telgars lord and went on i recall another of your predictions about how the threads were supposed to begin falling right after solstice which they did flar interrupted him as black dust in the northern holds for the reprieve weve had we can thank our lucky stars that we have had an unusually hard and long cold turn dust demanded nessel of crom that dust was threads the man was one of faxs blood connections and under merons influence an older man who had learned lessons from his conquering relatives bloody ways and had not the wit to improve on or alter the original my hold is still blowing with them theyre dangerous flar shook his head emphatically how long has the black dust been blowing in your hold weeks done any harm yet nessel frowned im interested in your charts weyrleader larad of telgar said smoothly will they give us an accurate idea of how often we may expect threads to fall in our own holds yes you may also anticipate that the dragonmen will arrive shortly before the invasion is due flar went on however additional measures of your own are necessary and it is for this that i called the council wait a minute corman of keroon growled i want a copy of those fancy charts of yours for my own i want to know what those bands and wavy lines really mean i want naturally youll have a timetable of your own i mean to impose on masterharper robinton and flar nodded respectfully towards that craftmaster to oversee the copying and make sure everyone understands the timing involved robinton a tall gaunt man with a lined saturnine face bowed deeply a slight smile curved his wide lips at the now hopeful glances favored him by the hold lords his craft like that of the dragonman had been much mocked and this new respect amused him he was a man with a keen eye for the ridiculous and an active imagination the circumstances in which doubting pern found itself were too ironic not to appeal to his innate sense of justice he now contented himself with a deep bow and a mild phrase truly all shall pay heed to the master his voice was deep his words enunciated with no provincial slurring flar about to speak looked sharply at robinton as he caught the double barb of that single line larad too looked around at the masterharper clearing his throat hastily we shall have our charts larad said forestalling meron who had opened his mouth to speak we shall have the dragonmen when the threads spin what are these additional measures and why are they necessary all eyes were on flar again we have one weyr where six once flew but word is that ramoth has hatched forty more someone in the back of the room declared and why did you search out still more of our young men forty as yet unmatured dragons flar said aloud privately hoping that this southern venture would still work out there was real fear in that mans voice they grow well and quickly just at present while the threads do not strike with great frequency as the red star begins its pass our weyr is sufficientif we have your cooperation on the ground tradition is that and he nodded tactfully toward robinton the dispenser of traditional usage you holders are responsible for only your dwellings which of course are adequately protected by fire pits and raw stone however it is spring and our heights have been allowed to grow wild with vegetation arable land is blossoming with crops this presents a vast acreage vulnerable to the threads which one weyr at this time is not able to patrol without severely draining the vitality of our dragons and riders at this candid admission a frightened and angry mutter spread rapidly throughout the room ramoth rises to mate again soon flar continued in a matteroffact way of course in other times the queens started producing heavy clutches many turns before the critical solstice and more queens unfortunately jora was ill and old and nemorth intractable the matter he was interrupted you dragonmen with your high and mighty airs will bring destruction on us all youve yourselves to blame robintons voice stabbed across the ensuing shouts admit it one and all youve paid less honor to the weyr than you would your watchwhers kenneland that not much but now the thieves are on the heights and you are screaming because the poor reptile is nigh to death from neglect beat him will you when you exiled him to his kennel because he tried to warn you tried to get you to prepare against the invaders its on your conscience not the weyrleaders nor the dragonriders who had honestly done their duty these hundreds of turns in keeping dragonkind aliveagainst all your protests how many of you and his tone was scathing have been generous in thought and favor towards dragonkind even since i became master of my craft how often have my harpers told me of being beaten for singing the old songs as is their duty you earn only the right good lords and craftsmen to squirm inside your stony holds and writhe as your crops die aborning he rose no threads will fall its a harpers winter tale he whined in faultless imitation of nessel these dragonmen leech us of heir and harvest and his voice took on the constricted insinuating tenor that could only be merons and now the truth is as bitter as a brave mans fear and as difficult as mockweek to swallow for all the honor youve done them the dragonmen should leave you to be spun on the threads distaff bitra lemos and i spoke up raid the wiry lord of benden his blunt chin lifted belligerently have always done our duty to the weyr robinton swung round to him his eyes flashing as he gave that speaker a long slow look aye and you have of all the great holds you three have been loyal but you others and his voice rose indignantly as spokesmen for my craft i know to the last full stop in the score your opinion of dragonkind i heard the first whisper of your attempt to ride out against the weyr he laughed harshly and pointed a long finger at vincet where would you be today good lord vincet if the weyr had not sent you packing back hoping your ladies would be returned you all of you and his accusing finger marked each of the lords of that abortive effort actually rode against the weyr becausetherewerenomorethreads he planted his fists on either hip and glared at the assembly flar wanted to cheer it was easy to see why the man was masterharper and he thanked circumstances that such a man was the weyrs partisan and now at this critical moment you actually have the incredible presumption to protest against any measure the weyr suggests robintons supple voice oozed derision and amazement attend what the weyrleader says and spare him your petty carpings he snapped those words out as a father might enjoin an erring child you were and he switched to the mildest of polite conversational tones as he addressed flar i believe asking our cooperation good flar in what capacities flar hastily cleared his throat i shall require that the holds police their own fields and woods during the attacks if possible definitely once the threads have passed all burrows which might land must be found marked and destroyed the sooner they are located the easier it is to be rid of them theres no time to dig fire pits through all the landswell lose half our growing space nessel exclaimed there were other ways used in olden times which i believe our mastersmith might know and flar gestured politely towards fandarel the archetype of his profession if ever such existed the smith craftmaster was by several inches the tallest man in the council room his massive shoulders and heavily muscled arms pressed against his nearest neighbors although he had made an effort not to crowd against anyone he rose a giant treestump of a man hooking thumbs like beasthorns in the thick belt that spanned his waistless midsection his voice by no means sweet after turns of bellowing above roaring hearths and hammers was by comparison to robintons superb delivery a diluted unsupported light baritone there were machines that much is true he allowed in deliberate thoughtful tones my father told me of them as a curiosity of the craft there may be sketches in the hall there may not such things do not keep on skins for long and he cast an oblique look under beetled brows at the tanner craftmaster it is our own hides we must worry about preserving flar remarked to forestall any intercraft disputes fandarel grumbled in his throat in such a way that flar was not certain whether the sound was the mans laughter or a guttural agreement i shall consider the matter so shall all my fellow craftsmen fandarel assured the weyrleader to sear threads from the ground without damaging the soil may not be so easy there are it is true fluids which burn and sear we use an acid to etch design on dagger and ornamental metals we of the craft call it agenothree there is also the black heavywater that lies on the surface of pools in igen and boll it burns hot and long and if as you say the cold turn made the threads break into dust perhaps ice from the coldest northlands might freeze and break grounded threads however the problem is to bring such to the threads where they fall since they will not oblige us by falling where we want them he screwed up his face in a grimace flar stared at him surprised did the man realize how humorous he was no he was speaking with sincere concern now the mastersmith scratched his head his tough fingers making audible grating sounds along his coarse hair and heattoughened scalp a nice problem a nice problem he mused undaunted i shall give it every attention he sat down the heavy bench creaking under his weight the masterfarmer raised his hand tentatively when i became craftmaster i recall coming across a reference to the sandworms of igen they were once cultivated as a protective never heard igen produced anything useful except heat and sand quipped someone we need every suggestion flar said sharply trying to identify that heckler please find that reference craftmaster lord banger of igen find me some of those sandworms banger equally surprised that his arid hold had a hidden asset nodded vigorously until we have more efficient ways of killing threads all holders must be organized on the ground during attacks to spot and mark burrows to set firestone to burn in them i do not wish any man to be scored but we know how quickly threads burrow deep and no burrow can be left to multiply you stand to lose more and he gestured emphatically at the holder lords than any others guard not just yourselves for a burrow on one mans border may grow across to his neighbors mobilize every man woman and child farm and crafthold do it now the council room was fraught with tension and stunned reflection until zurg the masterweaver rose to speak my craft too has something to offerwhich is only fair since we deal with thread each day of our livesin regard to the ancient methods zurgs voice was light and dry and his eyes in their creases of spare lined flesh were busy darting from one face in his audience to another in ruath hold i once saw upon the wallwhere the tapestry now resides who knows and he slyly glanced at meron of nabol and then bargen of the high reaches who had succeeded to faxs title there the work was as old as dragonkind and showed among other things a man on foot carrying upon his back a curious contraption he held within his hand a rounded swordlong object from which tongues of flamemagnificently woven in the orangered dyes now lost to usspouted towards the ground above of course were dragons in close formation bronzes predominatingagain weve lost that true dragonbronze shade consequently i remember the work as much for what we now lack as for its subject matter a flamethrower the smith rumbled a flamethrower he repeated with a falling inflection a flamethrower he murmured thoughtfully his heavy brows drawn into a titanic scowl a thrower of what sort of flame it requires thought he lowered his head and didnt speak so engrossed in the required thought that he lost interest in the rest of the discussions yes good zurg there have been many tricks of every trade lost in recent turns flar commented sardonically if we wish to continue living such knowledge must be revivedfast i would particularly like to recover the tapestry of which master zurg speaks flar looked significantly at those hold lords who had quarreled over faxs seven holds after that usurpers death in ruathas great hall it may save all of you much loss i suggest that it appear at ruatha at zurgs or fandarels crafthall whichever is most convenient there was some shuffling of feet but no admission of ownership it might then be returned to fays son who is now ruathas lord flar added wryly amused at such magnanimous justice lytol ruathas warder snorted softly and glowered round the room flar supposed lytol to be amused and experienced a fleeting regret for the orphaned gaxom reared by such a cheerless if scrupulously honest guardian if i may lord weyrleader robinton broke in we might all benefit as your maps prove to us from research in our own records he smiled suddenly an unexpectedly embarrassed smile i own i find myself in some disgrace for we harpers have let slip unpopular ballads and skimped on some of the longer teaching sagasfor lack of listeners and occasionally in the interest of preserving our skins flar stifled a laugh robinton was a genius i must see the ruathan tapestry fandarel suddenly boomed out im sure it will be in your hands very soon flar assured him with more confidence than he dared feel my lords there is much to be done now that you understand what we all face i leave it in your hands as leaders in your separate holds and crafts how best to organize your own people craftsmen turn your best minds to our special problems review all records which might turn up something to our purpose lords telgar crom ruatha and nabol i shall be with you in three days nerat keroon and igen i am at your disposal to help destroy any burrow on your lands while we have the masterminer here tell him your needs how stands your craft happy to be so busy at our trade weyrleader piped up the masterminer just then flar caught sight of fnor hovering about in the shadows of the hallway trying to catch his eye the brown rider wore an exultant grin and it was obvious he was bursting with news flar wondered how they could have returned so swiftly from the southern continent and then he realized that fnoragainwas tanned he gave a jerk of his head indicating that fnor take himself off to the sleeping quarters and wait lords and craftmasters a dragonet will be at the disposal of each of you for messages and transportation now good morning he strode out of the council room up the passageway into the queens weyr and parted the still swinging curtains into the sleeping room just as fnor was pouring himself a cup of wine success fnor cried as the weyrleader entered though how you knew to send just thirtytwo candidates ill never understand i thought you were insulting our noble pridith but thirtytwo eggs she laid in four days it was all i could do to keep from riding out when the first appeared flar responded with hearty congratulations relieved that there would be at least that much benefit from this apparently illfated venture now all he had to figure out was how much longer fnor had stayed south until his frantic visit the night before for there were no worry lines or strain in fnors grinning welltanned face no queen egg asked flar hopefully with thirtytwo in the one experiment perhaps they could send a second queen back and try again fnors face lengthened no and i was sure there would be but there are fourteen bronzes which outmatches ramoth there he added proudly indeed it does how goes the weyr otherwise fnor frowned shaking his head against an inner bewilderment kylaraswell shes a problem stirs up trouble constantly tbor leads a sad time with her and hes so touchy everyone keeps a distance from him fnor brightened a little young nton is shaping up into a fine wingleader and his bronze may outfly tbors orth when pridith flies to mate the next time not that id wish kylara on ntonor anyone no trouble then with supplies fnor laughed outright if you hadnt made it so plain we must not communicate with you here we could supply you with fruits and fresh greens that are superior to anything in the north we eat the way dragonmen should really flar we must consider a supply weyr down there then we shall never have to worry about tithing trains and in good time get back now you know you must keep these visits short fnor grimaced oh its not so bad im not here in this time anyway true flar agreed but dont mistake the time and come while youre still here hmmm oh yes thats right i forget time is creeping for us and speeding for you well i shant be back again till pridith lays the second clutch with a cheerful goodbye fnor strode out of the weyr flar watched him thoughtfully as he slowly retraced his steps to the council room thirtytwo new dragons fourteen of them bronzes was no small gain and seemed worth the hazard or would the hazard wax greater someone cleared his throat deliberately flar looked up to see robinton standing in the archway that led to the council room before i can copy and instruct others about those maps weyrleader i must myself understand them completely i took the liberty of remaining behind you make a good champion masterharper you have a noble cause weyrleader and then robintons eyes glinted maliciously ive been begging the egg for an opportunity to speak out to so noble an audience a cup of wine first benden grapes are the envy of pern if one has the palate for such a delicate bouquet it is carefully cultivated by the knowledgeable flar wondered when the man would stop playing with words he had more on his mind than studying the time charts i have in mind a ballad which for lack of explanation i had set aside when i became the master of my crafthall he said judiciously after an appreciative savoring of his wine it is an uneasy song both the tune and the words one develops as a harper must a certain sensitivity for what will be received and what will be rejectedforcefully and he winced in retrospect i found that this ballad unsettled singer as well as audience and retired it from use now like that tapestry i think it bears rediscovery after his death cgans instrument had been hung on the council room wall till a new weyrsinger could be chosen the guitar was very old its wood thin old cgan had kept it welltuned and covered the masterharper handled it now with reverence lightly stroking the strings to hear the tone raising his eyebrows at the fine voice of the instrument he plucked a chord a dissonance flar wondered if the instrument were out of tune or if the harper had by some chance struck the wrong string but robinton repeated the odd dischord then modulated into a weird minor that was somehow more disturbing than the first notes i told you it was an uneasy song and i wonder if you know the answers to the questions it asks for ive turned the puzzle over in my mind many times of late then abruptly he shifted from the spoken to the sung tone gone away gone ahead echoes roll unanswered empty open dusty dead why have all the weyrfolk fled where have dragons gone together leaving weyrs to wind and weather setting herdbeasts free of tether gone our safeguards gone but whither have they flown to some new weyr where cruel threads some others fear are they worlds away from here why oh why the empty weyr the last plaintive chord reverberated of course you realize that that song was first recorded in the craftannals some four hundred turns ago robinton said lightly cradling the guitar in both arms the red star had just passed beyond attackproximity the people had ample reason to be stunned and worried over the sudden loss of the populations of five weyrs oh i imagine at the time they had any one of a number of explanations but nonenot one explanationis recorded robinton paused significantly i have found none recorded either flar replied as a matter of fact i had all the records brought here from the other weyrsin order to compile accurate attack timetables and those other weyr records simply end flar made a chopping gesture with one hand in bendens records there is no mention of sickness death fire disaster not one word of explanation for the sudden lapse of the usual intercourse between the weyrs bendens records continue blithely but only for benden there is one entry that pertains to the mass disappearancethe initiation of a pernwide patrol routing not just bendens immediate responsibility and that is all strange robinton mused once the danger from the red star was past the dragons and riders may have gone between to ease the drain on the holds but i simply cannot believe that our craftrecords do mention that harvests were bad and that there had been several natural catastrophesother than the threads men may be gallant and your breed the most gallant of all but mass suicide i simply do not accept that explanationnot for dragonmen my thanks flar said with mild irony dont mention it robinton replied graciously flar chuckled appreciatively i see we have been too weyrbound as well as too hidebound robinton drained his cup and looked at it mournfully until flar refilled it well your isolation served some purpose you know and you handled that uprising of the lords magnificently i nearly choked to death laughing robinton remarked grinning broadly stealing their women in the flash of a dragons breath he chuckled again and suddenly sobered looking flar straight in the eye accustomed as i am to hearing what a man does not say aloud i suspect there is much you glossed over in that council meeting you may be sure of my discretionandyou may be sure of my wholehearted support and that of my not ineffectual craft to be blunt how may my harpers aid you and he strummed a vigorous marching air stir mens pulses with ballads of past glories and success the tune under his flashing fingers changed abruptly to a stern but determined rhythm strengthen their mental and physical sinews for hardship if all your harpers could stir men as you yourself do i should have no worries that five hundred or so additional dragons would not immediately end oho then despite your brave words and marked charts the situation isa dissonant twang on the guitar accented his final wordsmore desperate than you carefully did not say it may be the flamethrowers old zurg remembered and fandarel must reconstruct will they tip the scales flar regarded this clever man thoughtfully and made a quick decision even igens sandworms will help but as the world turns and the red star nears the interval between daily attacks shortens and we have only seventytwo new dragons to add to those we had yesterday one is now dead and several will not fly for several weeks seventytwo robinton caught him up sharply ramoth hatched but forty and they are still too young to eat firestone flar outlined fnor and lessas expedition taking place at that moment he went on to fnors reappearance and warning as well as the fact that the experiment had been successful in part with the hatching of thirtytwo new dragons for pridiths first clutch robinton caught him up how can fnor already have returned when you havent heard from lessa and him that there is a breeding place on the southern continent dragons can go between times as well as places they go easily from a when to a where robintons eyes widened as he digested this astonishing news that is how we forestalled the attack on nerat yesterday morning we jumped back two hours between times to meet the threads as they fell you can actually jump backwards how far back i dont know lessa when i was teaching her to fly ramoth inadvertently returned to ruath hold to the dawn twelve turns ago when faxs men invaded from the heights when she returned to the present i attempted a between times jump of some ten turns to the dragons it is a simple matter to go between times or spaces but there appears to be a terrific drain on the rider yesterday by the time we returned from nerat and had to go on to keroon i felt as though i had been pounded flat and left to dry for a summer on igen plain flar shook his head we have obviously succeeded in sending kylara pridith and the others ten turns between because fnor has already reported to me that he has been there several turns the drain on humans however is becoming more and more marked however even seventytwo more mature dragons will be a help send a rider ahead in time and see if it is sufficient robinton suggested helpfully save you a few days worrying i dont know how to get somewhen which has not yet happened you must give your dragon reference points you know how can you refer him to times which have not yet occurred youve got an imagination project it and perhaps lose a dragon when i have none to spare no i must continuebecause obviously i have judging by fnors returnsas i decided to start which reminds me i must give orders to start packing then i shall go over the time charts with you it was just after the noonmeal which robinton took with the weyrleader before the masterharper was confident he understood the charts and left to begin their copying across a waste of lonely tossing sea where no dragonwings had lately spread flew a gold and a sturdy brown in spring searching if a land be dead as ramoth and canth bore lessa and fnor up to the star stone they saw the first of the hold lords and craftmasters arriving for the council in order to get back to the southern continent of ten turns ago lessa and fnor had decided it was easiest to transfer first between times to the weyr of ten turns back which fnor remembered then they would go between places to a seapoint just off the coast of the neglected southern continent which was as close to it as the records gave any references fnor put canth in mind of a particular day he remembered ten turns back and ramoth picked up the references from the browns mind the awesome cold of between times took lessas breath away and it was with intense relief she caught a glimpse of the normal weyr activity before the dragons took them between places to hover over the turgid sea beyond them smudged purple on this overcast and gloomy day lurked the southern continent lessa felt a new anxiety replace the uncertainty of the temporal displacement ramoth beat forward with great sweeps of her wings making for the distant coast canth gallantly tried to maintain a matching speed hes only a brown lessa scolded her golden queen if he is flying with me ramoth replied coolly he must stretch his wings a little lessa grinned thinking very privately that ramoth was still piqued that she had not been able to fight with her weyrmates all the males would have a hard time with her for a while they saw the flock of wherries first and realized that there would have to be some vegetation on the continent wherries needed greens to live although they could subsist on a few grubs if necessary lessa had canth relay questions to his rider if the southern continent were rendered barren by the threads how did new growth start where did the wherries come from ever notice the seed pods split open and the flakes carried away by the winds ever notice that wherries fly south after the autumn solstice yes but yes but but the land is threadbared in less than four hundred turns even the scorched hilltops of our continent begin to sprout in the springtime fnor replied by way of canth so it is easy to assume the southern continent could revive too lessa was dubious and berated herself sternly forcing her mind from fnors cryptic warning even at the pace ramoth set it took time to reach the jagged shoreline with its forbidding cliffs stark stone in the sullen light lessa groaned inwardly but urged ramoth higher to see over the masking highlands all seemed gray and desolate from that altitude suddenly the sun broke through the cloud cover and the gray dissolved into dense greens and browns living colors the live greens of lush tropical growth the browns of vigorous trees and vines lessas cry of triumph was echoed by fnors hurrah and the brass voices of the dragons wherries startled by the unusual sound rose up in alarm from their perches beyond the headland the land sloped away to jungle and grassy plateau similar to midboll though they searched all morning they found no hospitable cliffs wherein to found a new weyr was that a contributing factor in the southern ventures failure lessa wondered discouraged they landed on a high plateau by a small lake the weather was warm but not oppressive and while fnor and lessa ate their noonday meal the two dragons wallowed in the water refreshing themselves lessa felt uneasy and had little appetite for the meat and bread she noticed fnor was restless too shooting surreptitious glances around the lake and the jungle verge what under the sun are we expecting wherries dont charge and wild whers would come nowhere near a dragon were ten turns before the red star so there cant be any threads fnor shrugged grimacing sheepishly as he tossed his unfinished bread back into the food pouch place just feels so empty i guess he tendered glancing around he spotted ripe fruit hanging from a moonflower vine now that looks familiar and good enough to eat without tasting like dust in the mouth he climbed nimbly and snagged the orangered fruit down smells right feels ripe looks ripe he announced and deftly sliced the fruit open grinning he handed lessa the first slice carving another for himself he lifted it challengingly let us eat and die together she couldnt help but laugh and saluted him back they bit into the succulent flesh simultaneously sweet juices dribbled from the corners of her mouth and lessa hurriedly licked her lips to capture the least drop of the delicious liquid die happy i will fnor cried cutting more fruit both were subtly reassured by the experiment and were able to discuss their discomposure i think fnor suggested it is the lack of cliff and cavern and the still still quality of the place the knowing that there are no other men or beasts about but us lessa nodded her head in agreement ramoth canth would having no weyr upset you we didnt always live in caves ramoth replied somewhat haughtily as she rolled over in the lake sizable waves rushed up the shore almost to where lessa and fnor were seated on a fallen tree trunk the sun here is warm and pleasant the water cooling i could enjoy it here but i am not to come she is out of sorts lessa whispered to fnor let pridith have it dear one she called soothingly to the golden queen youve the weyr and all ramoth ducked under the water blowing up a froth in disgruntled reply canth admitted that he had no reservations at all about living weyrless the dry earth would be warmer than stone to sleep in once a suitably comfortable hollow had been achieved no he couldnt object to the lack of the cave as long as there was enough to eat well have to bring herdbeasts in fnor mused enough to start a goodsized herd of course the wherries here are huge come to think of it i believe this plateau has no exits we wouldnt need to pasture it off id better check otherwise this plateau with the lake and enough clear space for holds seems ideal walk out and pick breakfast from the tree it might be wise to choose those who were not holdreared lessa added they would not feel so uneasy away from protecting heights and stonesecurity she gave a short laugh im more a creature of habit than i suspected all these open spaces untenanted and quiet seemindecent she gave a delicate shudder scanning the broad and open plain beyond the lake fruitful and lovely fnor amended leaping up to secure more of the orangered succulents this tastes uncommon good to me cant remember anything this sweet and juicy from nerat and yet its the same variety undeniably superior to what the weyr gets i suspect nerat serves home first weyr last they both stuffed themselves greedily further investigation proved that the plateau was isolated and ample to pasture a huge herd of food beasts for the dragons it ended in a sheer drop of several dragonlengths into more dense jungle on one side the seaside escarpment on the other the timber stands would provide raw material from which dwellings could be made for the weyrfolk ramoth and canth stoutly agreed dragonkind would be comfortable enough under the heavy foliage of the dense jungle as this part of the continent was similar weatherwise to upper nerat there would be neither intense heat nor cold to give distress however lessa was glad enough to leave fnor seemed reluctant to start back we can go between time and place on the way back lessa insisted finally and be in the weyr by late afternoon the lords will surely be gone by then fnor concurred and lessa steeled herself for the trip between she wondered why the when between bothered her more than the where for it had no effect on the dragons at all ramoth sensing lessas depression crooned encouragingly the long long black suspension of the utter cold of between where and when ended suddenly in sunlight above the weyr somewhat startled lessa saw bundles and sacks spread out before the lower caverns as dragonriders supervised the loading of their beasts what has been happening fnor exclaimed oh flars been anticipating success she assured him glibly mnementh who was watching the bustle from the ledge of the queens weyr sent a greeting to the travelers and the information that flar wished them to join him in the weyr as soon as they returned they found flar as usual bent over some of the oldest and least legible record skins which he had had brought to the council room and he asked grinning a broad welcome at them green lush and livable lessa declared watching him intently he knew something else too well she hoped hed watch his words fnor was no fool and this foreknowledge was dangerous that is what i had so hoped to hear you say flar went on smoothly come tell me in detail itll be good to fill in the blank spaces on the chart lessa let fnor give most of the account to which flar listened with sincere attention making notes on the chance that it would be practical i started packing supplies and alerting the riders to go with you he told fnor when the account was finished remember weve but three days in this time in which to start you back ten turns ago we have no moments to spare and we must have many more mature dragons ready to fight at telgar in three days time so though ten turns will have passed for you three days only will elapse here lessa your thought that the farmbred might do better is welltaken were lucky that our recent search for rider candidates for the dragons pridith will have come mainly from the crafts and farms no problem there and most of the thirtytwo are in their early teens thirtytwo fnor exclaimed we should have fifty the dragonets must have some choice even if we get the candidates used to the dragonets before theyre hatched flar shrugged negligently send back for more youll have time remember and flar chuckled as though he had started to add something and decided against it fnor had no time to debate with the weyrleader for flar immediately launched on other rapid instructions fnor was to take his own wingriders to help train the weyrlings they would also take the forty young dragons of ramoths first clutch kylara with her queen pridith tbor and his bronze orth ntons young bronze might also be ready to fly and mate by the time pridith was so that gave the young queen two bronzes at least supposing wed found the continent barren fnor asked still puzzled by flars assurance what then oh wedve sent them back to say the high reaches flar replied far too glibly but quickly went on i should send on other bronzes but ill need everyone else here to ride burrowsearch on keroon and nerat theyve already unearthed several at nerat vincet im told is close to a heart attack from fright lessa made a short comment on that hold lord what of the meeting this morning fnor asked remembering never mind that now youve got to start shifting between by evening fnor lessa gave the weyrleader a long hard look and decided shed have to find out what had happened in detail very soon sketch me some references will you lessa flar asked there was a definite plea in his eyes as he drew clean hide and a stylus to her he wanted no questions from her now that would alarm fnor she sighed and picked up the drawing tool she sketched quickly with one or two details added by fnor until she had rendered a reasonable map of the plateau they had chosen then abruptly she had trouble focusing her eyes she felt lightheaded lessa flar bent to her everythingsmovingcircling and she collapsed backward into his arms as flar raised her slight body into his arms he exchanged an alarmed look with his half brother ill call for manora fnor suggested how do you feel the weyrleader called after his brother tired but no more than that fnor assured him as he shouted down the service shaft to the kitchens for manora to come and for hot klah he needed that and no doubt of it flar laid the weyrwoman on the sleeping couch covering her gently i dont like this he muttered rapidly recalling what fnor had said of kylaras decline which fnor could not know was yet to come in his future why should it start so swiftly with lessa timejumping makes one feel slightly fnor paused groping for the exact wording not entirelywhole you fought between times at nerat yesterday yourself i fought flar reminded him but neither you nor lessa battled anything today there may be some innermentalstress simply to going between times look fnor id rather only you came back once you reach the southern weyr ill make it an order and get ramoth to inhibit the dragons that way no rider can take it into his head to come back even if he wants to there is some factor which may be more serious than we can guess lets take no unnecessary risks agreed one other detail fnor be very careful which times you pick to come back to see me i wouldnt jump between too close to any time you were actually here i cant imagine what would happen if you walked into your own self in the passageway and i cant lose you with a rare demonstration of affection flar gripped his half brothers shoulder tightly remember fnor i was here all morning and you did not arrive back from the first trip till midafternoon and remember too we have only three days you have ten turns fnor left passing manora in the hall the woman could find nothing obviously the matter with lessa and they finally decided it might be simple fatigue yesterdays strain when lessa had to relay messages between dragons and fighters followed by the disjointing between times trip today when flar went to wish the southern venturers a good trip lessa was in a normal sleep her face pale but her breathing easy flar had mnementh relay to ramoth the prohibition he wished the queen to instill in all dragonkind assigned to the venture ramoth obliged but added in an aside to bronze mnementh which he passed on to flar that everyone else had adventures while she the weyr queen was forced to stay behind no sooner had the laden dragons one by one winked out of the sky above the star stone than the young weyrling assigned to nerat hold as messenger came gliding down his face white with fear weyrleader many more burrows have been found and they cannot be burned out with fire alone lord vincet wants you flar could well imagine vincet did get yourself some dinner boy before you start back ill go shortly as he passed through to the sleeping quarters he heard ramoth rumbling in her throat she had settled herself down for the night lessa still slept one hand curled under her cheek her dark hair trailing over the edge of the bed she looked fragile childlike and very precious to him flar smiled to himself so she was jealous of kylaras attentions yesterday he was pleased and flattered never would lessa learn from him that kylara for all her bold beauty and sensuous nature did not have one tenth the attraction for him that the unpredictable dark and delicate lessa held even her stubborn intractableness her keen and malicious humor added zest to their relationship with a tenderness he would never show her awake flar bent and kissed her lips she stirred and smiled sighing lightly in her sleep reluctantly returning to what must be done flar left her so as he paused by the queen ramoth raised her great wedgeshaped head her manyfaceted eyes gleamed with bright luminescence as she regarded the weyrleader mnementh please ask ramoth to get in touch with the dragonet at fandarels crafthall id like the mastersmith to come with me to nerat i want to see what his agenothree does to threads ramoth nodded her head as the bronze dragon relayed the message to her she has done so and the green dragon will come as soon as he can mnementh reported to his rider it is easier to do this talking about when lessa is awake he grumbled flar agreed heartily thankful that lessa could talk to any dragon in the weyr it had been quite an advantage yesterday in the battle and would be more and more of an asset maybe it would be better if she tried to speak across time to fnorbut no fnor had come back flar strode into the council room still hopeful that somewhere within the illegible portions of the old records was the one clue he so desperately needed there must be a way out of this impasse if not the southern venture then something else something fandarel showed himself a man of iron will as well as sinew he looked calmly at the exposed tangle of perceptibly growing threads that writhed and intertwined obscenely hundreds and thousands in this one burrow lord vincet of nerat was exclaiming in a frantic tone of voice he waved his hands distractedly around the plantation of young trees in which the burrow had been discovered these stalks are already withering even as you hesitate do something how many more young trees will die in this one field alone how many more burrows escaped dragons breath yesterday where is a dragon to sear them why are you just standing there flar and fandarel paid no attention to the mans raving both fascinated as well as revolted by their first sight of the burrowing stage of their ancient foe despite vincets panicky accusations it was the only burrow on this particular slope flar did not like to contemplate how many more might have slipped through the dragons efforts to reach nerats warm and fertile soil if they had only had time enough to set out watchmen to track the fall of stray clumpsthey could at least remedy that error in telgar crom and ruatha in three days but it was not enough not enough fandarel motioned forward the two craftsmen who had accompanied him they were burdened with an odd contraption a large cylinder of metal to which was attached a wand with a wide nozzle at the other end of the cylinder was another short pipe length and then a short cylinder with an inner plunger one craftsman worked the plunger vigorously while the second barely keeping his hands steady pointed the nozzle end towards the thread burrow at a nod from his pumper the man released a small knob on the nozzle extending it carefully away from him and over the burrow a thin spray danced from the nozzle and drifted down into the burrow no sooner had the spray motes contacted the thread tangles than steam hissed out of the burrow before long all that remained of the pallid writhing tendrils was a smoking mass of blackened strands long after fandarel had waved the craftsmen back he stared at the grave finally he grunted and found himself a long stick with which he poked and prodded the remains not one thread wriggled humph he grunted with evident satisfaction however we can scarcely go around digging up every burrow i need another with lord vincet a handwringing moaner in their wake they were escorted by the junglemen to another undisturbed burrow on the seaside of the rainforest the threads had entered the earth by the side of a huge tree which was already drooping with his prodding stick fandarel made a tiny hole at the top of the burrow and then waved his craftsmen forward the pumper made vigorous motions at his end while the nozzleholder adjusted his pipe before inserting it in the hole fandarel gave the sign to start and counted slowly before he waved a cutoff smoke oozed out of the tiny hole after a suitable lapse of time fandarel ordered the junglemen to dig reminding them to be careful not to come in contact with the agenothree liquid when the burrow was uncovered the acid had done its work leaving nothing but a thoroughly charred mass of tangles fandarel grimaced but this time scratched his head in dissatisfaction takes too much time either way best to get them still at the surface the mastersmith grumbled best to get them in the air lord vincet chattered and what will that stuff do to my young orchards what will it do fandarel swung round apparently noticing the distressed holder for the first time little man agenothree in diluted form is what you use to fertilize your plants in the spring true this field has been burned out for a few years but it is not threadfull it would be better if we could get the spray up high in the air then it would float down and dissipate harmlesslyfertilizing very evenly too he paused scratched his head gratingly young dragons could carry a team alofthmmm a possibility but the apparatus is bulky yet he turned his back on the surprised hold lord then and asked flar if the tapestry had been returned i cannot yet discover how to make a tube throw flame i got this mechanism from what we make for the orchard farmers im still waiting for word flar replied but this spray of yours is effective the thread burrow is dead the sandworms are effective too but not really efficient fandarel grunted in dissatisfaction he beckoned abruptly to his assistants and stalked off into the increasing twilight to the dragons robinton awaited their return at the weyr his outward calm barely masking his inner excitement he inquired politely however of fandarels efforts the mastersmith grunted and shrugged i have all my craft at work the mastersmith is entirely too modest flar put in he has already put together an ingenious device that sprays agenothree into thread burrows and sears them into a black pulp not efficient i like the idea of flamethrowers the smith said his eyes gleaming in his expressionless face a thrower of flame he repeated his eyes unfocusing he shook his heavy head with a bonepopping crack i go and with a curt nod to the harper and the weyrleader he left i like that mans dedication to an idea robinton observed despite his amusement with the mans eccentric behavior there was a strong undercurrent of respect for the smith i must set my apprentices a task for an appropriate saga on the mastersmith i understand he said turning to flar that the southern venture has been inaugurated flar nodded unhappily your doubts increase this between times travel takes its own toll he admitted glancing anxiously towards the sleeping room the weyrwoman is ill sleeping but todays journey affected her we need another less dangerous answer and flar slammed one fist into the other palm i came with no real answer robinton said then briskly but with what i believe to be another part of the puzzle i have found an entry four hundred turns ago the then masterharper was called to fort weyr not long after the red star retreated away from pern in the evening sky an entry what is it mind you the thread attacks had just lifted and the masterharper was called one late evening to fort weyr an unusual summons however and robinton emphasized the distinction by pointing a long callustipped finger at flar no further mention is ever made of that visit there ought to have been for all such summonses have a purpose all such meetings are recorded yet no explanation of this one is given the record is taken up several weeks later by the masterharper as though he had not left his crafthall at all some ten months afterwards the question song was added to compulsory teaching ballads you believe the two are connected with the abandonment of the five weyrs i do but i could not say why i only feel that the events the visit the disappearances the question song are connected flar poured them both cups of wine i have checked back too seeking some indications he shrugged all must have been normal right up to the point they disappeared there are records of tithe trains received supplies stored the list of injured dragons and men returning to active patrols and then the records cease at full cold leaving only benden weyr occupied and why that one weyr of the six to choose from robinton demanded nerat in the tropics or island ista would be better choices if only one weyr was to be left benden so far north is not a likely place to pass four hundred turns benden is high and isolated a disease that struck the others and was prevented from reaching benden and no explanation of it they cant all dragons riders weyrfolk have dropped dead on the same instant and left no carcasses rotting in the sun then let us ask ourselves why was the harper called was he told to construct a teaching ballad covering this disappearance well robinton snorted it certainly wasnt meant to reassure us not with that tuneif one cares to call it a tune at all and i dontnor does it answer any questions it poses them for us to answer suggested flar softly aye and robintons eyes shone for us to answer indeed for it is a difficult song to forget which means it was meant to be remembered those questions are important flar which questions are important demanded lessa who had entered quietly both men were on their feet flar with unusual attentiveness held a chair for lessa and poured her wine im not going to break apart she said tartly almost annoyed at the excess of courtesy then she smiled up at flar to take the sting out of her words i slept and i feel much better what were you two getting so intense about flar quickly outlined what he and the masterharper had been discussing when he mentioned the question song lessa shuddered thats one i cant forget either which ive always been told and she grimaced remembering the hateful lessons with rgul means its important but why it only asked questions then she blinked her eyes went wide with amazement gone away goneahead she cried on her feet thats it all five weyrs wentahead but to when flar turned to her speechless they came ahead to our time five weyrs full of dragons she repeated in an awed voice no thats impossible flar contradicted why robinton demanded excitedly doesnt that solve the problem were facing the need for fighting dragons doesnt it explain why they left so suddenly with no explanation except that question song flar brushed back the heavy lock of hair that overhung his eyes it would explain their actions in leaving he admitted because they couldnt leave any clues saying where they went or it would cancel the whole thing just as i couldnt tell fnor i knew the southern venture would have problems but how do they get hereif here is when they came they arent here now and how would they have known they were neededor when they were needed and this is the real problem how can you conceivably give a dragon references to a when that has not yet occurred someone here must go back to give them the proper references lessa replied in a very quiet voice youre mad lessa flar shouted at her alarm written on his face you know what happened to you today how can you consider going back to a when you cant remotely imagine to a when four hundred turns ago going back ten turns left you fainting and halfill wouldnt it be worth it she asked him her eyes grave isnt pern worth it flar grabbed her by the shoulders shaking her his eyes wild with fear not even pern is worth losing you or ramoth lessa lessa dont you dare disobey me in this his voice dropped to an intense icy whisper shaking with anger ah there may be a way of effecting that solution momentarily beyond us weyrwoman robinton put in adroitly who knows what tomorrow holds it certainly is not something one does without considering every angle lessa did not shrug off flars vicelike grip on her shoulders as she gazed at robinton wine the masterharper suggested pouring a mug for her his diversionary action broke the tableau of lessa and flar ramoth is not afraid to try lessa said her mouth set in a determined line flar glared at the golden dragon who was regarding the humans her neck curled round almost to the shoulder joint of her great wing ramoth is young flar snapped and then caught mnemenths wry thought even as lessa did she threw her head back her peal of laughter echoing in the vaulted chamber im badly in need of a good joke myself robinton remarked pointedly mnementh told flar that he was neither young nor afraid to try either it was just a long step lessa explained wiping tears from her eyes flar glanced dourly at the passageway at the end of which mnementh lounged on his customary ledge a laden dragon comes the bronze warned those in the weyr it is lytol beyond young brant on brown fanth now he brings his own bad news lessa asked sourly it is hard enough for lytol to ride anothers dragon or come here at all lessa of ruatha do not increase his torment one jot with your childishness flar said sternly lessa dropped her eyes furious with flar for speaking so to her in front of robinton lytol stumped into the queens weyr carrying one end of a large rolled rug young brant struggling to uphold the other end was sweating with the effort lytol bowed respectfully towards ramoth and gestured the young brownrider to help him unroll their burden as the immense tapestry uncoiled flar could understand why masterweaver zurg had remembered it the colors ancient though they undoubtedly were remained vibrant and undimmed the subject matter was even more interesting mnementh send for fandarel heres the model he needs for his flamethrower flar said that tapestry is ruathas lessa cried indignantly i remember it from my childhood it hung in the great hall and was the most cherished of my bloodlines possessions where has it been her eyes were flashing lady it is being returned where it belongs lytol said stolidly avoiding her gaze a masterweavers work this he went on touching the heavy fabric with reverent fingers such colors such patterning it took a mans life to set up the loom a crafts whole effort to complete or i am no judge of true craftsmanship flar walked along the edge of the immense arras wishing it could be hung to get the proper perspective of the heroic scene a flying formation of three wings of dragons dominated the upper portion of half the hanging they were breathing flame as they dove upon gray falling clumps of threads in the brilliant sky a sky just that perfect autumnal blue flar decided that cannot occur in warmer weather upon the lower slopes of the hills depicted foliage was turning yellow from chilly nights the slaty rocks suggested ruathan country was that why the tapestry had hung in ruatha hall below men had left the protecting hold cut into the cliff itself the men were burdened with the curious cylinders of which zurg had spoken the tubes in their hands belched brilliant tongues of flame in long streams aimed at the writhing threads that attempted to burrow in the ground lessa gave a startled exclamation walking right onto the tapestry staring down at the woven outline of the hold its massive door ajar the details of its bronze ornamentation painstakingly rendered in fine yarns i believe thats the design on the ruatha hold door flar remarked it isand it isnt lessa replied in a puzzled voice lytol glowered at her and then at the woven door true it isnt and yet it is and i went through that door a scant hour ago he scowled down at the door before his toes well here are the designs fandarel wants to study flar said with relief as he peered at the flamethrowers whether the smith could produce a working model from this woven one in time to help them three days hence flar couldnt guess but if fandarel could not no man could the mastersmith was for him jubilant over the presence of the tapestry he lay upon the rug his nose tickled by the nap as he studied the details he grumbled moaned and muttered as he sat crosslegged to sketch and peer has been done can be done must be done he was heard to rumble lessa called for klah bread and meat when she learned from young brant that neither he nor lytol had eaten yet she served all the men her manner gay and teasing flar was relieved for lytols sake lessa even pressed food and klah on fandarel a tiny figure beside the mammoth man insisting that he come away from the tapestry and eat and drink after taking nourishment he could return to his mumbling and drawing fandarel finally decided he had enough sketches and disappeared to be flown back to his crafthold no point in asking him when hell be back hes too deep in thought to hear flar remarked amused if you dont mind i shall excuse myself as well lessa said smiling graciously to the four remaining around the table good warder lytol young brant should soon be excused too hes half asleep i most certainly am not weyrlady brant assured her hastily widening his eyes with simulated alertness lessa merely laughed as she retreated into the sleeping chamber flar stared thoughtfully after her i mistrust the weyrwoman when she uses that particularly docile tone of voice he said slowly well we must all depart robinton suggested rising ramoth is young but not that foolish flar murmured after the others had left ramoth slept oblivious of his scrutiny he reached for the consolation mnementh could give him without response the big bronze was dozing on his ledge black blacker blackest and cold beyond frozen things where is between when there is naught to life but fragile dragon wings i just want to see that tapestry back on the wall at ruatha lessa insisted to flar the next day i want it where it belongs they had been to check on the injured and had had one argument already over flars having sent nton along with the southern venture lessa had wanted him to try riding anothers dragon flar had preferred for him to learn to lead a wing of his own in the south given the years to mature in he had reminded lessa in the hope that it might prove inhibiting to any ideas she had about going four hundred turns back about fnors return trips and bore down hard on the difficulties she had already experienced she had become very thoughtful although she had said nothing therefore when fandarel sent word he would like to show flar a new mechanism the weyrleader felt reasonably safe in allowing lessa the triumph of returning the purloined tapestry to ruatha she went to have the arras rolled and strapped to ramoths back he watched ramoth rise with great sweeps of her wide wings up to the star stone before going between to ruatha rgul appeared at the ledge just then reporting that a huge train of firestone was entering the tunnel consequently busy with such details it was midmorning before he could get to see fandarels crude and not yet effective flamethrowerthe fire did not throw from the nozzle of the tube with any force at all it was late afternoon before he reached the weyr again rgul announced sourly that fnor had been looking for him twice in fact twice twice as i said he would not leave a message with me for you and rgul was clearly insulted by fnors refusal by the evening meal when there was still no sign of lessa flar sent to ruatha to learn that she had indeed brought the tapestry she had badgered and bothered the entire hold until the thing was properly hung for upwards of several hours she had sat and looked at it pacing its length occasionally she and ramoth had then taken to the sky above the great tower and disappeared lytol had assumed as had everyone at ruatha that she had returned to benden weyr mnementh flar bellowed when the messenger had finished mnementh where are they mnemenths answer was a long time in coming i cannot hear them he said finally his mental voice soft and as full of worry as a dragons could be flar gripped the table with both hands staring at the queens empty weyr he knew in the anguished privacy of his mind where lessa had tried to go cold as death deathbearing stay and die unguided brave and braving linger this way was twice decided below them was ruathas great tower lessa coaxed ramoth slightly to the left ignoring the dragons acid comments knowing that she was excited too thats right dear this is exactly the angle at which the tapestry illustrates the hold door only when that tapestry was designed no one had carved the lintels or capped the door and there was no tower no inner court no gate she stroked the surprisingly soft skin of the curving neck laughing to hide her own tense nervousness and apprehension at what she was about to attempt she told herself there were good reasons prompting her action in this matter the ballads opening phrase gone away gone ahead was clearly a reference to between times and the tapestry gave the required reference points for the jump between whens oh how she thanked the masterweaver who had woven that doorway she must remember to tell him how well he had wrought she hoped shed be able to enough of that of course shed be able to for hadnt the weyrs disappeared knowing they had gone ahead knowing how to go back to bring them ahead it was she obviously who must go back and lead them it was very simple and only she and ramoth could do it because they already had she laughed again nervously and took several deep shuddering breaths all right my golden love she murmured you have the reference you know when i want to go take me between ramoth between four hundred turns the cold was intense even more penetrating than she had imagined yet it was not a physical cold it was the awareness of the absence of everything no light no sound no touch as they hovered longer and longer in this nothingness lessa recognized the fullblown panic of a kind that threatened to overwhelm her reason she knew she sat on ramoths neck yet she could not feel the great beast under her thighs under her hands she tried to cry out inadvertently and opened her mouth tonothingno sound in her own ears she could not even feel the hands that she knew she had raised to her own cheeks i am here she heard ramoth say in her mind we are together and this reassurance was all that kept her from losing her grasp on sanity in that terrifying eon of unpassing timeless nothingness someone had sense enough to call for robinton the masterharper found flar sitting at the table his face deathly pale his eyes staring at the empty weyr the craftmasters entrance his calm voice reached flar in his shocked numbness he sent the others out with a peremptory wave shes gone she tried to go back four hundred turns flar said in a tight hard voice the masterharper sank into the chair opposite the weyrleader she took the tapestry back to ruatha flar continued in that same choked voice id told her about fnors returns i told her how dangerous this was she didnt argue very much and i know going between times had frightened her if anything could frighten lessa he banged the table with an impotent fist i should have suspected her when she thinks shes right she doesnt stop to analyze to consider she just does it but shes not a foolish woman robinton reminded him slowly not even she would jump between times without a reference point would she gone away gone aheadthats the only clue we have now wait a moment robinton cautioned him then snapped his fingers last night when she walked upon the tapestry she was uncommonly interested in the hall door she discussed it with lytol flar was on his feet and halfway down the passageway come on man weve got to get to ruatha lytol lit every glow in the hold for flar and robinton to examine the tapestry clearly she spent the afternoon just looking at it the warder said shaking his head youre sure she has tried this incredible jump she must have mnementh cant hear either her or ramoth anywhere yet he says he can get an echo from canth many turns away and in the southern continent flar stalked past the tapestry what is it about the door lytol think man it is much as it is now save that there are no carved lintels there is no outer court nor tower thats it oh by the first egg it is so simple zurg said this tapestry is old lessa must have decided it was four hundred turns and she has used it as the reference point to go back between times why then shes there and safe robinton cried sinking with relief in a chair oh no harper it is not as easy as that flar murmured robinton caught his stricken look and the despair echoed in lytols face whats the matter there is nothing between flar said in a dead voice to go between places takes only as much time as for a man to cough three times between four hundred turns his voice trailed off who wills cans who tries does who loves lives there were voices that first were roars in her aching ears and then hushed beyond the threshold of sound she gasped as the whirling nauseating sensation apparently spun her and the bed which she felt beneath her round and round she clung to the sides of the bed as pain jabbed through her head from somewhere directly in the middle of her skull she screamed as much in protest at the pain as from the terrifying rolling whirling dropping lack of a solid ground yet some frightening necessity kept her trying to gabble out the message she had come to give sometimes she felt ramoth trying to reach her in that vast swooping darkness that enveloped her she would try to cling to ramoths mind hoping the golden queen could lead her out of this torturing nowhere exhausted she would sink down down only to be torn from oblivion by the desperate need to communicate she was finally aware of a soft smooth hand upon her arm of a liquid warm and savory in her mouth she rolled it around her tongue and it trickled down her sore throat a fit of coughing left her gasping and weak then she experimentally opened her eyes and the images before her did not lurch and spin whoareyou she managed to croak oh my dear lessa is that who i am she asked confused so your ramoth tells us she was assured i am mardra of fort weyr oh flar will be so angry with me lessa moaned as her memory came rushing back he will shake me and shake me he always shakes me when i disobey him but i was right i was right mardraoh thatawfulnothingness and she felt herself drifting off into sleep unable to resist that overwhelming urge comfortingly her bed no longer rocked beneath her the room dimly lit by wallglows was both like her own at benden weyr and subtly different lessa lay still trying to isolate that difference ah the weyr walls were very smooth here the room was larger too the ceiling higher and curving the furnishings now that her eyes were used to the dim light and she could distinguish details were more finely crafted she stirred restlessly ah youre awake again mystery lady a man said light beyond the parted curtain flooded in from the outer weyr lessa sensed rather than saw the presence of others in the room beyond a woman passed under the mans arm moving swiftly to the bedside i remember you youre mardra lessa said with surprise indeed i am and here is mron weyrleader at fort mron was tossing more glows into the wallbasket peering over his shoulder at lessa to see if the light bothered her ramoth lessa exclaimed sitting upright aware for the first time that it was not ramoths mind she touched in the outer weyr oh that one mardra laughed with amused dismay shell eat us out of the weyr and even my loranth has had to call the other queens to restrain her she perches on the star stones as if she owned them and keens constantly mron added less charitably he cocked an ear ha shes stopped you can come cant you lessa blurted out come come where my dear mardra asked confused youve been going on and on about our coming and threads approaching and the red star bracketed in the eye rock andmy dear dont you realize the red star has been past pern these two months no no theyve started thats why i came back between times back between times mron exclaimed striding over to the bed eyeing lessa intently could i have some klah i know im not making much sense and im not really awake yet but im not mad or still sick and this is rather complicated yes it is mron remarked with deceptive mildness but he did call down the service shaft for klah and he did drag a chair over to her bedside settling himself to listen to her of course youre not mad mardra soothed her glaring at her weyrmate or she wouldnt ride a queen mron had to agree to that lessa waited for the klah to come sipping gratefully at its stimulating warmth lessa took a deep breath and began telling them of the long interval between the dangerous passes of the red star how the sole weyr had fallen into disfavor and contempt how jora had deteriorated and lost control over her queen nemorth so that as the red star neared there was no sudden increase in the size of clutches how she had impressed ramoth to become bendens weyrwoman how flar had outwitted the dissenting hold lords the day after ramoths first mating flight and taken firm command of weyr and pern preparing for the threads he knew were coming she told her by now rapt audience of her own first attempts to fly ramoth and how she had inadvertently gone back between times to the day fax had invaded ruath hold invademy familys hold mardra had cried aghast ruatha has given the weyrs many famous weyrwomen lessa said with a sly smile at which mron burst out laughing shes ruathan no question he assured mardra she told them of the situation in which dragonmen now found themselves with an insufficient force to meet the thread attacks of the question song and the great tapestry a tapestry mardra cried her hand going to her cheek in alarm describe it to me and when lessa did she sawat lastbelief in both their faces my father has just commissioned a tapestry with such a scene he told me of it the other day because the last battle with the threads was held over ruatha incredulous mardra turned to mron who no longer looked amused she must have done what she has said shes done how could she possibly know about the tapestry you might also ask your queen dragon and mine lessa suggested my dear we do not doubt you now mardra said sincerely but it is a most incredible feat i dont think lessa said that i would ever try it again knowing what i do now yes this shock makes a forward jump between times quite a problem if your flar must have an effective fighting force mron remarked you will come you will there is a distinct possibility we will mron said gravely and his face broke into a lopsided grin you said we left the weyrsabandoned them in fact and left no explanation we went somewheresomewhen that is for we are still here now they were all silent for the same alternative occurred to them simultaneously the weyrs had been left vacant but lessa had no way of proving that the five weyrs reappeared in her time there must be a way there must be a way lessa cried distractedly and theres no time to waste no time at all mron gave a bark of laughter theres plenty of time at this end of history my dear they made her rest then more concerned than she was that she had been ill some weeks deliriously screaming that she was falling and could not see could not hear could not touch ramoth too they told her had suffered from the appalling nothingness of a protracted stay between emerging above ancient ruatha a pale yellow wraith of her former robust self the lord of ruath hold mardras father had been surprised out of his wits by the appearance of a staggering rider and a pallid queen on his stone verge naturally and luckily he had sent to his daughter at fort weyr for help lessa and ramoth had been transported to the weyr and the ruathan lord kept silent on the matter when lessa was strong enough mron called a council of weyrleaders curiously there was no opposition to goingprovided they could solve the problem of timeshock and find reference points along the way it did not take lessa long to comprehend why the dragonriders were so eager to attempt the journey most of them had been born during the present thread incursions they had now had close to four months of unexciting routine patrols and were bored with monotony training games were pallid substitutes for the real battles they had all fought the holds which once could not do dragonmen favors enough were beginning to be indifferent the weyrleaders could see these incidents increasing as threadgenerated fears receded it was a morale decay as insidious as a wasting disease in weyr and hold the alternative which lessas appeal offered was better than a slow decline in their own time of benden only the weyrleader himself was privy to these meetings because benden was the only weyr in lessas time it must remain ignorant and intact until her time nor could any mention be made of lessas presence for that too was unknown in her turn she insisted that they call in the masterharper because her records said he had been called but when he asked her to tell him the question song she smiled and demurred youll write it or your successor will when the weyrs are found to be abandoned she told him but it must be your doing not my repeating a difficult assignment to know one must write a song that four hundred turns later gives a valuable clue only be sure she cautioned him that it is a teaching tune it must not be forgotten for it poses questions that i have to answer as he started to chuckle she realized she had already given him a pointer the discussionshow to go so far safely with no sustained sense deprivationsgrew heated there were more constructive notions however impractical on how to find reference points along the way the five weyrs had not been ahead in time and lessa in her one gigantic backward leap had not stopped for intermediate time marks you did say that a between times jump of ten years caused no hardship mron asked of lessa as all the weyrleaders and the masterharper met to discuss this impasse none it takesoh twice as long as a between places jump it is the four hundred turn leap that left you imbalanced hmmm maybe twenty or twentyfive turn segments would be safe enough that suggestion found merit until istas cautious leader dram spoke up i dont mean to be a holdhider but there is one possibility we havent mentioned how do we know we made the jump between to lessas time going between is a chancy business men go missing often and lessa barely made it here alive a good point dram mron concurred briskly but i feel there is more to prove that we dodidwillgo forward the clues for one thing they were aimed at lessa the very emergency which left five weyrs empty that sent her back to appeal for our help agreed agreed dram interrupted earnestly but what i mean is can you be sure we reached lessas time it hadnt happened yet do we know it can mron was not the only one who searched his mind for an answer to that all of a sudden he slammed both hands palms down on the table by the egg its die slow doing nothing or die quick trying ive had a surfeit of the quiet life we dragonmen must lead after the red star passes till we go between in old age i confess im almost sorry to see the red star dwindle further from us in the evening sky i say grab the risk with both hands and shake it till its gone were dragonmen arent we bred to fight the threads lets go huntingfour hundred turns ahead lessas drawn face relaxed she had recognized the validity of drams alternate possibility and it had touched off bitter fear in her heart to risk herself was her own responsibility but to risk these hundreds of men and dragons the weyrfolk who could accompany their men mrons ringing words for once and all dispensed with that consideration and i believe the masterharpers exultant voice cut through the answering shouts of agreement i believe i have your reference points a smile of surprised wonder illuminated his face twenty turns or twentyhundred you have a guide and mron said it as the red star dwindles in the evening sky later as they plotted the orbit of the red star they found how easy that solution actually was and chuckled that their ancient foe should be their guide atop fort weyr as on all the weyrs were great stones they were so placed that at certain times of the year they marked the approach and retreat of the red star as it orbited in its erratic two hundred turnlong course around their sun by consulting the records which among other morsels of information included the red stars wanderings it was not hard to plan jumps between of twentyfive turns for each weyr it had been decided that the complement of each separate weyr would jump between above its own base for there would unquestionably be accidents if close to eighteen hundred laden beasts tried it at one point each moment now was one too long away from her own time for lessa she had been a month away from flar and missed him more than she had thought could be possible also she was worried that ramoth would mate away from mnementh there were to be sure bronze dragons and bronze riders eager to do that service but lessa had no interest in them mron and mardra occupied her with the many details in organizing the exodus so that no clues past the tapestry and the question song which would be composed at a later date remained in the weyrs it was with a relief close to tears that lessa urged ramoth upward in the night sky to take her place near mron and mardra above the fort weyr star stone at five other weyrs great wings were ranged in formation ready to depart their own times as each weyrleaders dragon reported to lessa that all were readyreference points determined by the red stars travels in mindit was this traveler from the future who gave the command to jump between the blackest night must end in dawn the sun dispel the dreamers fear when shall my souls bleak hopeless pain find solace in its darkening weyr they had made eleven jumps between the weyrleaders bronzes speaking to lessa as they rested briefly between each jump of the eighteenhundredodd travelers only four failed to come ahead and they had been older beasts all five sections agreed to pause for a quick meal and hot klah before the final jump which would be but twelve turns it is easier mron commented as mardra served around the klah to go twentyfive turns than twelve he glanced up at the red dawn star their winking and faithful guide it does not alter its position as much i count on you lessa to give us additional references i want to get us back to ruatha before flar discovers i have gone she shivered as she looked up at the red star and sipped hastily at the hot klah ive seen the star just like that onceno twicebefore at ruatha she stared at mron her throat constricting as she remembered that morning the time she had decided that the red star was a menace to her three days after which fax and flar had appeared at ruath hold fax had died on flars dagger and she had gone to benden weyr she felt suddenly dizzy weak strangely unsettled she had not felt this way as they paused between other jumps are you all right lessa mardra asked with concern youre so white youre shaking she put her arm around lessa glancing concerned at her weyrmate twelve turns ago i was at ruatha lessa murmured grasping mardras hand for support i was at ruatha twice lets go on quickly im too many in this morning i must get back i must get back to flar hell be so angry the note of hysteria in her voice alarmed both mardra and mron hastily the latter gave orders for the fires to be extinguished for the weyrfolk to mount and prepare for the final jump ahead her mind in chaos lessa transmitted the references to the other weyrleaders dragons ruatha in the evening light the great tower the inner court and the land at springtime a fleck of red in a cold night sky a drop of blood to guide them by turn away turn away turn be gone a red star beckons the travelers on between them lytol and robinton forced flar to eat deliberately plying him with wine at the back of his mind he knew he would have to keep going but the effort was immense the spirit gone from him it was no comfort that they still had pridith and kylara to continue dragonkind yet he delayed sending someone back for fnor unable to face the reality of that admission that in sending for pridith and kylara he had acknowledged the fact that lessa and ramoth would not return lessa lessa his mind cried endlessly damning her one moment for her reckless thoughtless daring loving her the next for attempting such an incredible feat i said flar you need sleep now more than wine robintons voice penetrated his preoccupation flar looked at him frowning in perplexity he realized that he was trying to lift the wine jug that robinton was holding firmly down what did you say come ill bear your company to benden indeed nothing could persuade me to leave your side you have aged years man in the course of hours and isnt it understandable flar shouted rising to his feet the impotent anger boiling out of him at the nearest target in the form of robinton robintons eyes were full of compassion as he reached for flars arm gripping it tightly man not even this masterharper has words enough to express the sympathy and honor he has for you but you must sleep you have tomorrow to endure and the tomorrow after that you have to fight the dragonmen must have a leader and his voice trailed off tomorrow you must send for fnorand pridith flar pivoted on his heel and strode towards the fateful door of ruathas great hall oh tongue give sound to joy and sing of hope and promise on dragonwing before them loomed ruathas great tower the high walls of the outer court clearly visible in the fading light the klaxon rang violent summons into the air barely heard over the earsplitting thunder as hundreds of dragons appeared ranging in full fighting array wing upon wing up and down the valley a shaft of light stained the flagstones of the court as the hold door opened lessa ordered ramoth down close to the tower and dismounted running eagerly forward to greet the men who piled out of the door she made out the stocky figure of lytol a handbasket of glows held high about his head she was so relieved to see him she forgot her previous antagonism to the warder you misjudged the last jump by two days lessa he cried as soon as he was near enough for her to hear him over the noise of settling dragons misjudged how could i she breathed mron and mardra came up beside her it is not to worry lyton reassured her gripping her hands tightly in his his eyes dancing he was actually smiling at her you overshot the day go back between return to ruatha of two days ago thats all his grin widened at her confusion it is all right he repeated patting her hands take this same hour the great court everything but visualize flar robinton and myself here on the flagstones place mnementh on the great tower and a blue dragon on the verge now go mnementh ramoth queried lessa eager to see her weyrmate she ducked her great head and her huge eyes gleamed with scintillating fire i dont understand lessa wailed mardra slipped a comforting arm around her shoulders but i do i do trust me lytol pleaded patting her shoulder awkwardly and glancing at mron for support it is as fnor has said you cannot be several places in time without experiencing great distress and when you stopped twelve turns back it threw lessa all to pieces you know that mron cried of course just go back two days you see i know you have i shall of course be surprised then but now tonight i know you reappeared two days earlier oh go dont argue flar was half out of his mind with worry for you hell shake me lessa cried like a little girl lessa mron took her by the hand and led her back to ramoth who crouched so her rider could mount mron took complete charge and had his fidranth pass the order to return to the references lytol had given adding by way of ramoth a description of the humans and mnementh the cold of between restored lessa to herself although her error had badly jarred her confidence but then there was ruatha again the dragons happily arranged themselves in tremendous display and there silhouetted against the light from the hall stood lytol robintons tall figure andflar mnemenths voice gave a brassy welcome and ramoth could not land lessa quickly enough to go and twine necks with her mate lessa stood where ramoth had left her unable to move she was aware that mardra and mron were beside her she was conscious only of flar racing across the court towards her as fast as he could yet she could not move he swung her up in his arms hugging her so tightly she could not doubt the joy of his welcome my darling my love how could you gamble so i have been lost in an endless between fearing for you he kissed her hugged her held her and then kissed her with rough urgency again then he suddenly set her on her feet and gripped her shoulders lessa if you ever he said punctuating each word with a flexing of his fingers and stopped aware of a grinning circle of strangers surrounding them i told you hed shake me lessa was saying dashing tears from her face but flar i brought them allall but benden weyr and that is why the five weyrs were abandoned i brought them flar looked around him looked beyond the leaders to the masses of dragons settling in the valley on the heights everywhere he turned there were dragons blue green bronze brown and a whole wingful of golden queen dragons alone you brought the weyrs he echoed stunned yes this is mardra and mron of fort weyr dram and he stopped her with a little shake pulling her to his side so he could see and greet the newcomers i am more grateful than you can know he said and could not go on with all the many words he wanted to add mron stepped forward holding out his hand which flar seized and held firmly we bring eighteen hundred dragons seventeen queens and all that is necessary to implement our weyrs and they brought flamethrowers too lessa put in excitedly but to cometo attempt it flar murmured in admiring wonder mron and dram and the others laughed your lessa showed the way with the red star to guide us she said we are dragonmen mron continued solemnly as you are yourself flar of benden we were told there are threads here to fight and thats work for dragonmen to doin any time drummer beat and piper blow harper strike and soldier go free the flame and sear the grasses til the dawning red star passes even as the five weyrs had been settling around ruatha valley fnor had been compelled to bring forward in time his southern weyrfolk they had all reached the end of endurance in doubletime life gratefully creeping back to quarters they had vacated two days and ten turns ago rgul totally unaware of lessas backward plunge greeted flar and his weyrwoman on their return to the weyr with the news of fnors appearance with seventytwo new dragons and the further word that he doubted any of the riders would be fit to fight never seen such exhausted men in my life rgul rattled on cant imagine what could have got into them with sun and plenty of food and all and no responsibilities flar and lessa exchanged glances well the southern weyr ought to be maintained rgul think it over im a fighting dragonman not a womanizer the old dragonrider grunted itd take more than a trip between times to reduce me like those others oh theyll be themselves again in next to no time lessa said and to rguls intense disapproval she giggled theyll have to be if were to keep the skies threadfree rgul snapped testily no problem about that now flar assured him easily no problem with only a hundred and fortyfour dragons two hundred and sixteen lessa corrected him firmly ignoring her rgul asked has that smithmaster found a flamethrower thatll work indeed he has flar said the five weyrs had indeed brought forward their equipment fandarel all but snatched examples from their backs and undoubtedly every hearth and smithy through the continent would be ready to duplicate the design by morning mron had told flar that in his time each hold had ample flamethrowers for every man on the ground in the course of the long interval however the throwers must have been either smelted down or lost as incomprehensible devices dram particularly was very interested in fandarels agenothree sprayer considering it better than thrownflame since it would also act as a fertilizer well rgul admitted gloomily a flamethrower or two will be some help day after tomorrow we have found something else that will help a lot more lessa remarked and then hastily excused herself dashing into the sleeping quarters the sounds which drifted past the curtain were either laughter or sobs and rgul frowned on both that girl was just too young to be weyrwoman at such a time no stability has she realized how critical our situation iseven with fnors additionsthat is if they can fly rgul demanded testily you oughtnt to let her leave the weyr at all flar ignored that and began pouring himself a cup of wine you once pointed out to me that the five empty weyrs of pern supported your theory that there would be no more threads rgul cleared his throat thinking that apologieseven if they might be due the weyrleaderwere scarcely effective against the threads now there was merit in that theory flar went on filling a cup for rgul not however as you interpreted it the five weyrs were empty because theythey came here rgul his cup halfway to his lips stared at flar this man also was too young to bear his responsibilities buthe seemed actually to believe what he was saying believe it or not rguland in a bare days time you willthe five weyrs are empty no longer theyre here in the weyrs in this time and they shall join us eighteen hundred strong tomorrow at telgar with flamethrowers and with plenty of battle experience to help us overcome our ancient foe rgul regarded the poor man stolidly for a long moment carefully he put his cup down and turning on his heel left the weyr he refused to be an object of ridicule hed better plan to take over the leadership tomorrow if they were to fight threads the day after the next morning when he saw the clutch of great bronze dragons bearing the weyrleaders and their wingleaders to the conference rgul got quietly drunk lessa exchanged good mornings with her friends and then smiling sweetly left the weyr saying she must feed ramoth flar stared after her thoughtfully then went to greet robinton and fandarel who had been asked to attend the meeting too neither craftmaster said much but neither missed a word said fandarels great head kept swiveling from speaker to speaker his deepset eyes blinking occasionally robinton sat with a bemused smile on his face utterly delighted by the circumstance of ancestral visitors flar was quickly talked out of resigning his titular position as weyrleader of benden on the grounds that he was too inexperienced you did well enough at nerat and keroon well indeed mron said you call twentyeight men or dragons out of action good leadership for a first battle with every dragonman green as a hatchling no man you were on time at nerat however you got there and mron grinned maliciously at flar which is what a dragonman must do no that was well flown i say well flown the four other weyrleaders muttered complete agreement with that compliment your weyr is understrength though so well lend you enough oddwing riders till youve got the weyr up to full strength again oh the queens love these times and his grin broadened to indicate that bronze riders did too flar returned that smile thinking that ramoth was about ready for another mating flight and this time lessaoh that girl was being too deceptively docile hed better watch her closely now mron was saying we left with fandarels crafthold all the flamethrowers we brought up so that the groundmen will be armed tomorrow aye and my thanks fandarel grunted well turn out new ones in record time and return yours soon dont forget to adapt that agenothree for air spraying too dram put in it is agreed and mron glanced quickly around at the other riders that all the weyrs will meet full strength three hours after dawn above telgar to follow the threads attack across to crom by the way flar those charts of yours that robinton showed me are superb we never had them how did you know when the attacks would come mron shrugged they were coming so regularly even when i was a weyrling you kind of knew when one was due but this is much much better more efficient fandarel added approvingly after tomorrow when all the weyrs show up at telgar we can request what supplies we need to stock the empty weyrs mron grinned like old times squeezing extra tithes from the holders and he rubbed his hands in anticipation theres the southern weyr fnor suggested weve been gone from there six turns in this time and the herdbeasts were left theyll have multiplied and therell be all that fruit and grain it would please me to see that southern venture continued flar remarked nodding encouragingly at fnor yes and continue kylara down there please too fnor added urgently his eyes sparkling with irritation they discussed sending for some immediate supplies to help out the newly occupied weyrs and then adjourned the meeting it is a trifle unsettling mron said as he shared wine with robinton to find the weyr you left the day before in good order has become a dusty hulk he chuckled the women of the lower caverns were a bit upset we cleaned up those kitchens fnor replied indignantly a good nights rest in a fresh time had removed much of his fatigue mron cleared his throat according to mardra no man can clean anything do you think youll be up to riding tomorrow fnor flar asked solicitously he was keenly aware of the stress of years showing in his half brothers face despite his improvement overnight yet those strenuous turns had been necessary nor had they become futile even by hindsight with the arrival of eighteen hundred dragons from past time when flar had ordered fnor ten turns backwards to breed the desperately needed replacements they had not yet brought to mind the question song or known of the tapestry i wouldnt miss that fight if i were dragonless fnor declared stoutly which reminds me flar remarked well need lessa at telgar tomorrow she can speak to any dragon you know he explained almost apologetically to mron and dram oh we know mron assured him and mardra doesnt mind seeing flars blank expression he added as senior weyrwoman mardra of course leads the queens wing flars face grew blanker queens wing certainly and mron and dram exchanged questioning glances at flars surprise you dont keep your queens from fighting do you our queens mron we at benden have had but one queen dragonat a timefor so many generations that there are those who denounce the legends of queens in battle as black sacrilege mron looked rueful i had not truly realized how small your numbers were till this instant but his enthusiasm overtook him just the same queensre very useful with flamethrowers they get clumps other riders might miss they fly in low under the main wings thats one reason drams so interested in the agenothree spray doesnt singe the hair off the holders heads so to speak and is far better over tilled fields do you mean to say that you allow your queens to flyagainst threads flar ignored the fact that fnor was grinning and mron too allow dram bellowed you cant stop them dont you know your ballads moretas ride exactly fnor laughed aloud at the expression on flars face as he irritably pulled the hanging forelock from his eyes then sheepishly he began to grin thanks that gives me an idea he saw his fellow weyrleaders to their dragons waved cheerfully to robinton and fandarel more lighthearted than he would have thought hed be the morning before the second battle then he asked mnementh where lessa might be bathing the bronze dragon replied flar glanced at the empty queens weyr oh ramoth is on the peak as usual mnementh sounded aggrieved flar heard the sound of splashing in the bathing room suddenly cease so he called down for hot klah he was going to enjoy this oh did the meeting go well lessa asked sweetly as she emerged from the bathing room dryingcloth wrapped tightly around her slender figure extremely you realize of course lessa that youll be needed at telgar she looked at him intently for a moment before she smiled again i am the only weyrwoman who can speak to any dragon she replied archly true flar admitted blithely and no longer the only queens rider in benden i hate you lessa snapped unable to evade flar as he pinned her clothswathed body to his even when i tell you that fandarel has a flamethrower for you so you can join the queens wing she stopped squirming in his arms and stared at him disconcerted that he had outguessed her and that kylara will be installed as weyrwoman in the southin this time as weyrleader i need all the peace and quiet i can get between battles from the weyr and from the bowl bronze and brown and blue and green rise the dragonmen of pern aloft on wing seen then unseen ranged above the peak of benden weyr a scant three hours after dawn two hundred and sixteen dragons held their formations as flar on bronze mnementh inspected their ranks below in the bowl were gathered all the weyrfolk and some of those injured in the first battle all the weyrfolk that is except lessa and ramoth they had gone on to fort weyr where the queens wing was assembling flar could not quite suppress a twinge of concern that she and ramoth would be fighting too a holdover he knew from the days when pern had had but the one queen if lessa could jump four hundred turns between and lead five weyrs back she could take care of herself and her dragon against threads he checked to be sure that every man was well loaded with firestone sacks that each dragon was in good color especially those in from the southern weyr of course the dragons were fit but the faces of the men still showed evidences of the temporal strains they had endured he was procrastinating and the threads would be dropping in the skies of telgar he gave the order to go between they reappeared above and to the south of telgar hold itself and were not the first arrivals to the west to the north and yes to the east now wings arrived until the horizon was patterned with the great vs of several thousand dragon wings faintly he heard the klaxon bell on telgar hold tower as the unexpected dragon strength was acclaimed from the ground where is she flar demanded of mnementh well need her presently to relay orders shes coming mnementh interrupted him right above telgar hold another wing appeared even at this distance flar could see the difference the golden dragons shone in the bright morning sunlight a hum of approval drifted down the dragon ranks and despite his fleeting worry flar grinned with proud indulgence at the glittering sight just then the eastern wings soared straight upwards in the sky as the dragons became instinctively aware of the presence of their ancient foe mnementh raised his head echoing back the brass thunder of the war cry he turned his head even as hundreds of other beasts turned to receive firestone from their riders hundreds of great jaws masticated the stone swallowed it their digestive acids transforming dry stone into flameproducing gases igniting on contact with oxygen threads flar could see them clearly now against the spring sky his pulses began to quicken not with
