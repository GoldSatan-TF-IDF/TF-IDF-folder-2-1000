captain alan lewrie rn stepped out of the doors of the george inn just as the watch bells of a myriad of warships and merchant vessels in portsmouth harbour began to chime the end of the morning watcheight bells and the start of the forenoonin a distant jangly tingtinging much like what a rider near london might hear from church bells of a sunday morning not exactly a sound to set ones pocketwatch by that chiming for each ship depended on the turning of sandglasses to measure hours and half hours quarter hours for the dog watches the initial turning of the glasses dependent on the vagaries of masters and captains time pieces all of varying quality accuracy and cost lewrie unconsciously drew his watch from a waistcoat pocket and found the time to be two and a half minutes past am then he as half a dozen other officers nearby did put it to his ear to see if it was still ticking strongly one much older postcaptain growled under his breath gave his a hard shake and damned its maker with a muttered christ bloody cogs before stalking off lewrie merely shrugged put his back in his waistcoat pocket and lifted his gaze to savour the morning and a fine morning it was by jove there was ample early summer sunshine and the sky was barely dappled with thinly scattered and quickscudding light clouds flags and vanes showed the wind had come about from the noreast and in some strength too for the flies of those flags were snapping chearly the halliards chattering against the flagpoles weather vanes on rooves squeaked and jiggled to a relatively brisk breeze lewrie resettled his cocked hat on his head and now alone on the walkway as the other officers headed away on their own occasions allowed himself a most satisfying belchnot a wellstifled gentlemanly thing but a rather long and loud eructation for in all of portsmouth there was no breakfast finer than that served at the george inn and his morning repast of two eggs fried not quite to hard with fried and grated potatoes a chopsized hank of flank beef and bread sliced two fingerjoints thick toasted to perfection then slathered with fresh butter and kentish apple preserves had been perfection and sluiced down with three cups of coffee fetched to his table halfscalding to boot well that belch in point of fact was so savoury that lewrie allowed himself a second before taking hold of the scabbard of his hundredguinea presentation smallsword to restrict its swinging and set off towards the quays and the kings stairs where he would take a hired boat back to his new frigate the morning was so clear and bright that even before he got to the kings stairs lewrie could espy dozens of sail making the most of the shift of wind to head downchannel for the atlantic nearer to at least a dozen warships were falling down to st helens patch down to the isle of wight and the open sea after being cooped up in port for a fortnight or more awaiting a favourable slant of wind and a moderation in the weather to be back at sea were savage in any respects ready to sail what a grand mornings departure it would be but alas his frigate still lay to anchor with both bowers and both stern kedges down with her upper masts and rigging stripped to a gantline for rerigging and remasting to his satisfaction her jibboom and bowsprit had been steeved to a lower angle whole new sets of inner and outer jibs cut and sewn and the sailmaker and his crew ready to make new foreandaft staysls to lewries requirements once the upper masts were set in place all to aid hms savage to point just a half or a quarter point closer to the eyes of the winds the sooner the better pray jesus lewrie fretfully thought his good mood and joy of a good breakfast curdled by the dread that he might not stay free long enough to skitter over the horizon out of reach of his pending legal troubles and the adamantine wrath of the beauman family no wonder the others were peerin at me so odd lewrie thought as he reached the stone quays wondrin whether im saint or felon the george inn was one of the better establishments in portsmouth the favourite of senior naval officers so he had been among an host of rearadmirals a commodore or three and postcaptains of more than three years seniority like himself salted enough to wear a pair of giltlace epaulets on their shoulders theyd seemed polite and civil enough some smiling as they pointed him out to their table companions and gave him a nod others well thats lewrie dont ye know pile o tin in the west indies the ramcat hes called and god pity his poor wife at cape saint vincent and camperdown both with the medals for em a fight near cape town in early spring took a bigger french frigate twohour fight in a blowin gale i heard got his frigate out from the nore during the mutiny oh in all the papers and such cause he stole jamaican slaves tcrew his ship darlin of the abolition crowd and wilberforce so please ye black alan lewrie now hawhaw soon thang i heard god rot im aye and wilberforce too demned reformers and killjoys lewrie had heard rumours from his new allies in the society for the abolition of slavery in the british empire the reverend william wilberforce and his coterie that the beauman family already about as fond of him as cold boiled mutton had departed jamaica for england now theyd finally discovered just who it was who stole their dozen prime field hands from one of their many plantations the one on the shore of portland bight well sort of kind of recruited or received not stolen exactly they were come with vengeance running hot in their spleens to see him tried convicted stripped of all of his wealth and property cashiered from the royal navy then most publicly and satisfyingly carted to tyburn and hung from a gibbet to the taunts from the mob and the huzzahs of the beaumans never shouldve shot their damned cousin in that duel lewrie silently rued grimly recalling when hed seconded his old friend kit cashman whod drilled the youngest beauman brother ledyard right in the belly too whod taken five agonising days to die after they had scandalously violated the rules of honour with a backshot and extra hidden pistols though it was satisfyin most of the bumboats and boats for hire were scurrying about from vessel to vessel and for the moment only two remained tied to the landing their shabby bundled or furled sails rustling and snapping to the breeze and frayed rope halliards chattering against their short masts the blocks clattering and squealing lewrie paused from choosing taking a long look seaward it was such a clear and sunny day that he could even see far upchannel into the main anchorage of spithead past gilkicker point into the littleused and shallow channel of needles passage round the west end of the isle of wight redcoats standing sentrygo on the ramparts of the monckton fort could be spotted individually to the east he could even make out the heights of selsey bill for a rare wonder and there was his brandnew frigate hms savage anchored not five cables offshore and as shiny as a newminted penny just fresh from the graving docks her new hull paint tar and pitch shone in the morning light every glitter of sunshine on the catspawed harbour waters reflected down her sleek flanks like a continual shower of diamond chips she floated light and high less her guns and stores which still sat ashore in warehouses and armouries at gun wharf or among the goods from the victualling boards vast depot and fresh copper cladding normally below the waterline flickered with dapples of sun like a horizontal sheet of gold or brass she was a fifth rate pounder of over tons burthen the largest longest bestarmed ship lewrie had ever been appointed to command and the thought of losing captaincy over her was as painful as the dread of dying she was long lean and powerfullooking with such a sweet aggressive curve to her sheerline and gunwale with an entry and forefoot finer and leaner than the usual bluff bowed ships built in british yards she was a leashed greyhound a french greyhound lewrie had to remind himself even so though the french had built her at brest of stout hamburg oak before the outbreak of the war in and commissioned in the vicious and bloody turmoil of the terror in named in honour of the crackpot ideas of the philosopher rousseau as le sauvage noble sent out to an ignoble sacrifice lewrie had learned for with all the former aristocratic or royalistleaning officers of the french navy dismissed from the service hunted down for trial and humiliation by the revolutionaries imprisoned for a time were they lucky their heads chopped off by the heavy wicked blade of the guillotine were they not she had been captained and her semihapless crew led by former bosuns mates and matelots with the proper revolutionary attitudes and viewpoints when she ran afoul of a lightergunned british frigate off rochefort a year later in all her grace and power had gone for nought and she had abjectly surrendered after a mere quarterhours pounding renamed hms savage taking the name of a much older sixth rate of guns that had gone to the breakers after serving since shed been bought in and commissioned into the royal navy for a full three years of active service before requiring a truck to keel refit a new crew and a new captain and lewrie had thought himself as fortunate to get her but hoy there fellow someone cried nearby a boat at once i say lewrie turned away from admiring his frigate to espy an officer a lieutenant in bestdress uniform trotting along the quay chivvying a much older gaptoothed and oneeyed civilian in charge of a brokendown handcart piled with the officers dunnage the lieutenant lending a hand on one of the shafts to speed the handcart along lewrie noted the typical seachest much battered and scraped with its original gay and martial paint nearly faded away a large canvas seabag and a pair of stuffedtobursting portmanteaus made of scrap carpet to boot atop the precarious and wobbly cart im late im late the younger officer could be heard to say christ a quarter past eight bells im fucked so bloody fucked oh he exclaimed as he took note of lewrie and his pair of epaulets he visibly blanched almost slammed to a stop in chagrin to use blasphemy and billingsate in the presence of a postcaptain joining a ship are you lewrie enquired putting a stern expression on his phyz cuttin it rather fine aint you aye sir the lieutenant replied doffing his cocked hat in salute to which lewrie replied with two fingers touching the brim of his own got the last coach skin o me teeth that and arrived at a late hour last night sir some old friends at the blue posts indeed lewrie primly drawled quite enjoying himself for a rare once lately damme this is fun he thought and they simply had to wet you down to your new posting hmm aye sir the lieutenant shamefacedly replied a damned bad beginning sir lewrie admonished to punctuate his shammed disdain for such he drew out his pocketwatch and peered at its face then turned and waved at the last remaining hired boat at the foot of the landing for during their brief conversation another lieutenant and two midshipmen had engaged the other better boat i ah the lieutenant began to say realising that he was going to be even later reporting aboard his new ship for he was outranked and would have to wait for the return of anything that floated i spose i could offer you a ride mister ah lewrie idly offered urquhart sir edard urquhart the other told him looking desperately into the middle distance to see if anything resembling a hired boat was coming back to the foot of the kings stairs empty edward mean tsay he babbled on might i enquire as to where your ship is anchored sir mine own is quite near at hand that frigate just yonder sir savage aha lewrie exultantly thought theyve finally got round to sendin me a first officer at last one had turned up weeks before but thatun had pleaded off sick after the first week and had departed looking like deaths head on a mopstick hacking wheezing coughing and hoicking up phlegm by the bucket hes mine damn his eyes what captain alan lewries ship lewrie pretended to scoff aye sir under that scoundrel that rogue lewrie mocksneered that rakehell corinthian hah god have mercy on your soul then sir lt edward or edard urquhart blushed and gulped timorously replying i was given to understand though sir that captain lewrie is a most distinguished and capable captain a renowned any fool can be brave and dashin dont ye know sir lewrie poohpoohed well then mister urquhart i will this once mind take mercy pon ye and allow you to board that shiny wee barge before attending to mine own urgent return to my ship bargee two passengers and all this jetsam the boatman and his assistant helped place the heavy seachest amidships of their scruffy little launch while lt urquhart saw to his own seabag and carpet bags an act that secretly pleased lewrie for most young men of the squirearchy who made up the bulk of the navys officers would have stood aloof on their dignity and depended on the lesser sorts to hew and haul lt urquhart stepped down into the rustling boat following the timehonoured tradition that senior officers would be last in first out when transferring from a ship or shore wich ship capm the bargee at the tiller asked once they were settled upon their respective thwarts well go to savage first lewrie stated a short sail for you the gantlined frigate yonder four pence apiece sirs the bargee said horny and grubby hand out to receive their coin no matter how short a trip it would be once paid he nodded to his assistant who cast them off and shoved on the landing stage then whirled to hoist the single lugsail a pretty thing lewrie said in seeming disparagement french ye know shes absolutely beautiful sir lt urquhart replied gazing at her with delight despite the reception he would mostlike receive for reporting aboard so late in the morning note her bows though mister urquhart lewrie went on as if to point out her flaws much too fine fast aye but perhaps with less buoyancy than yed need tride a heavy sea when it ships over the bow shell bury her nose like as not and the frogs dont space their hull timbers close or thick enough ttake heavy poundin shell flex in a full gale and flll herself with scantling timber in a fight without closespaced stout bracing kill a lot of men if captain lewrie has no qualms about her sir well lt urquhart declared before catching himself at being too argumentative with a strange postcaptain after all sir do not our own naval architects take off the lines of the newest french national ships that we are able to capture and emulate them better to serve aboard such a frigate than one of those much weaker and lightertimbered new brigsloops sir he added with an attempt at a disarming smile like lucifer said in dantes poem mister urquhart lewrie quickly riposted better to rule in hell than serve in heaven i assume by your age and the condition of your seachest that you are to be her first aye sir my first such commission lt urquhart proudly stated oos fer is savitch barkee then sirs the boatman at the tiller asked as his sole assistant handed the launchs lugsail as the boat swung up to approach the frigates starboard entryport both of us lewrie told him with a taut grin of mischief boat ahoy came a shout from the quarterdeck savitch the assistant in the bow shouted back showing four fingers as well to indicate that a postcaptain was coming aboard oh my soul lt urquhart whispered his eyes blared in alarm as he swivelled about on his thwart to look at lewrie toldyou lewrie was a scoundrel mister urquhart he grinned chapter two after that shocking chance meeting lt edward or edard urquhart had had a rather trying day his proper reporting aboard was not so bad nor was his reception in capt lewries greatcabins where he had been offered a glass of cool tea with lemon and sugar been told he would be one of the rare johnny newcomes aboard savage after most of the officers and crew of lewries old ship hms proteus had volunteered to turn over into this new frigate a great honour to lewrie to elicit such loyalty but for those of warrant or petty officer rank who pretty much stayed with one ship commission after commission such as the bosun and his mate cooper sailmaker master gunner and lived aboard even when a warship was laid up inordinary hms savage was now manned by officers and hands who had rubbed together for three years and would squint with chary eyes at an interloper til they had had a chance to take his measure capt lewrie had informed him that he detested tyrannical flogging officers and had found that his people had never been of the insubordinate sort that the necessity for corporal punishment was rare aboard and that hed found firm but fair treatment from solidly experienced officers not tartars worked better than anything else lt urquhart had heard scads about capt alan lewrie from his fellow officers not just from the newspapers and such he was not as famed as the gallant pellew or collingwood not quite the nationally cheered nelson but he had a reputation as a fighter so urquhart had come aboard feeling rather fortunate to have a chance to serve under a man who had a fairly wellknown name in the clannish family of fellow royal navy officers capt lewrie was also possessed of a repute that was well colourful to put it charitably lt urquhart beheld a man in his mid to late thirties who owned a charming and easy smile a captain who wore his own hair stead of a wig whose hair was midbrown where the sun had not lightened the shade to light brown and the merriest blue eyes surrounded by laugh lines and the crowsfeet of perpetual seasquintingthough they did when lewrie turned more serious about professional matters seem to go frostier and greyer lewrie was three inches shorter than lt urquharts own six feet even a fellow who might weigh eleven or twelve stone with a fit build without the beginnings of a senior postcaptains pot belly bred of higher pay prizemoney or private means natural to the typical squirearchy background of most captains his age born of the ability to purchase more wine brandy and rich viands consumed alone in a shipcaptains traditional aloofness from others aboard from the richness of suppers shared with fellow captains and foreign dignitaries when showing the flag with junior officers and midshipmen on a weekly rotation when at sea where one was forced to show off openhanded hospitality even a touch of splendour from ones own purse or as edward urquhart had always suspected from sheer boredom to fill the lonely aloof hours spent so often alone attable in ones greatcabins or the gluttony that followed years of plain commons capt lewrie had done most of the talking asking the usual questions about urquharts previous service and urquhart had responded as firmly as he could without veering off into too many inessential digressions after that disastrous first meeting ashore he had a false impression to correct an urgent need to please and to reassure his new captain that he would be a worthy addition and the hope that he fit in it did not help lt urquharts efforts that lewries two cats a stout blackandwhite one named toulon and where had that odd name come from he wondered and a mostly white younger one named chalky much more obvious thatun had come trotting to the desk in the daycabin from the transom settee where they had been sunning themselves and had discovered that they simply adored the new first officer the scent of his freshblacked hessian boots the leather scabbard of his sword the tails of his uniform coat then the suitability of his lap from whence they had explored his coat lapels shirt collar and neckstock and had even gone so far as to nuzzle and paw at his hair lt urquhart it was sad to say was a huntin dog man and had no use for cats except for killing stable rats were fresh from the graving clocks and expect the barges and water hoys alongside this morning mister urquhart capt lewrie had concluded rising to his feet to most charitably walk urquhart to the exit door which had required urquhart to rise as well giving him a chance to peel the two wee beasts off gently rather than following his instinct to seize them by their scruffs and hurl them from one end of the greatcabins to the other i expect youll be hardpressed to see all loaded by sunset weve a welldrilled and experienced crew so the work should go orderly and your fellow officers whom i expect youll soon meet know what theyre about so it shouldnt be all that demanding really welcome aboard and im looking forward to having you as first officer sir well it hadnt gone that smoothly urquhart suspected that he was on trial by every leery manjack midshipman and officer everybody had seemed to suffer from sudden ignorance of ropes blocks and such requiring him to see to everything the test if testing it was had felt more tongueincheek than mutely insubordinate and lt urquhart had swallowed his spleen and patiently endured it mostly by the end of the day at eight bells of the day watch and the start of the usually idle first dog the holds had been filled water butts stowed and firmly wedged in then filled with fresh water pumped from the ungainly hoys great casks of saltmeats treated much in the same manner chests and bags of freshbaked biscuit a vast array of bosuns stores and spare timbers miles of spare cordage and replacement blocks all had gone below settling hms savage a few inches lower in the harbour waters the day after and kegs of gunpowder flannel cartridge bagging guncarriages and the frigates artillery would come aboard last into the ship late in the day had come a load of fresh loaves a bellowing bullock whose hooves had barely touched the deck before he was slaughtered for supper and a cage of live chickens for the officers mess lt urquhart had mopped his brow nodded to his new fellows and had gone below to his dealandcanvas partitioned cabin rather grand in size after the ones he had bunked in whilst a junior officer and had finally had a chance to unpack and sponge himself down before dressing for a proper meal in the wardroom one where he must begin to enforce his own stamp upon the others firm but fair sober and nearly humourless relentless in the pursuit of duty no matter his private nature he had it all planned out unfortunately his curiosity got the better of him for there was too much to learn about his new captain from the ones whod been with him so long chapter three mr maurice durant the ships surgeon a rather laconic french emigre finally promoted from surgeons mate it helped to be a protestant huguenot had made a guarded comment about capt lewries pending legal troubles anent some dozen stolen slaves seven of whom still survived among savages crew which resulted in an equally cautious discussion of the how and the when of the matter and whether their captain might remain captain for very much longer or might be relieved to face trial in london and where would they be then lt urquhart was struck by how fond the others seemed to feel about capt lewrie despite the notoriety attached to him the tracts and pamphlets put out by the abolitionists and the lurid accounts in the newspapers the seeming depth of their feelings went beyond the usual dread of serving under a new captain of unknown abilities temperament or aggressiveness that might not be equal to lewries when it came to seeking action glory or prizemoney quite expectedly they would fear dull humdrum service or anything that took the gloss off the reputation they had made in hms proteus some of it urquhart suspected was the comfort of old shoes and better the devil you know along with their rightful pride together so long savages wardroom did not exactly follow the traditional narrow strictures on table conversation either captains and senior officers usually were never discussed except in the most careful praiseful way their foibles and idiosyncracies warts and all were definitely offlimits but savages officers knew their captain extremely well by then and seemed to take a perverse pride in his weaker moments a glass more than hed planned to imbibe had fuzzled urquharts wits just enough to mangle his attempt to quash such improper nattering it came out as well i dare say that captain lewrie has made himself a fair name in the fleet said with a sober face at least and with the merest hint that they treaded on taboo territory as his brow furrowed such is not usually a thing junior officers should bandy about i will allow however that i am not cognisant of every deed which has created such a sterling reputation i was right proud to receive orders into savage as first officer and when i learned that captain lewrie commands her i did indeed say to myself aha ive heard of him and thought myself quite fortunate as i gather that you gentlemen feel about serving under him though i cannot say that i knew much beyond the fact that i had heard the captains name mentioned at one time or tother whatall have you and the captain done in your old ship then what are the highwater marks you might recall it was off to the races after that alan lewrie had always been reckoned an extremely lucky fellow urquhart was rather eagerly informed by lt adair the second officer a dark and curlyhaired scot by the third officer mr darcy gamble who had been an upwards of twenty and capable midshipman aboard hms proteus til their last battle in the south atlantic off the coast of africa by the elegant marine officer lt blase devereux by mr durant the surgeon and by the purser the prim little mr coote even sailing master mr winwood a most taciturn and sobersided fellow of the new strenuous christian bent lauded cautious praise for capt lewrie though with some reservations anent his extracurricular activities lucky aye reckoned so by fellow officers and especially so by the people who shipped before the mast from the lower deck for hadnt lewrie been blessed with a geas in the bay of biscay when hed captained hms jester way back in why twas rumoured that sealshundreds of miles from any beachhad come alongside and spoken to commander alan lewrie at the end of a sea burial of a midshipman of cornwall who mightve mightve mind been born a selkie one of those ancient cursed souls who had angered the mythic halfforgotten celtic seagod lir and were doomed to live lives in the sea as seals crying for a life on land then shedding their skins and becoming human just long enough to suffer longings for a life in the sea til the end of time silly pagan and heretical but cornish and irish tars walked in awe of lewrie as one of lirs blessed to this very day and how hellishodd it was that theyd heard other officers eerily recall the barking of seals whenever hms jester needed an omen of danger ahead lucky in battle and in prizemoney too lewrie was how had he gotten jester in the first place hed been first lieutenant into hms cockerel but had ended up seconded ashoreor in charge of a captured french mortar boat some had heard tellduring the siege of toulon in and had been captured by the bastard frog napoleon bonaparte himself when the mortar vessel blew up but saved by spanish cavalry blown skyhigh but lived theres luck for you days before the evacuation of the first coalition forces hed been put in charge of a leaky halfarmed french frigate barely manned and crammed with french royalist refugees chased down by a squadron of two corvettes and a frigate lewried not only held his own but hammered one corvette to ruin then swung cross the bows of the next boarded her with a scratch assault force of british soldiers and refugee frenchmen and took her for his own his patron at the time viceadmiral sir samuel hood had made lewrie a commander once back at gibraltar and renamed her hms jester stead of sans culottes or something revolutionary no wasnt sans culottes lt gamble chortled the way that i heard it was there were some japes bout how ridiculous some of the french warships names were and captain lewrie said that it would not do to have an hms barearsed in the fleet and admiral hood thought him too much a wag and called hex jester as his own little joke despite the impropriety of such talk lt urquhart found that he was quite intriguedperhaps half a bottle of claret over but intriguedand even essayed an appreciative little chuckle which only encouraged them for this was miles beyond the usual carefully written official afteraction accounts sent to admiralty and printed in the marine chronicle and the gazette lewrie and jester had been a terror to the french during the first italian campaign when napoleon had routed and annihilated the genoese piedmontese and savoian armies and had defeated the might of austria too raids along the coasts shelling the few roads that could support supply waggons capturing coastal shipping which bore the bulk of french supplies routing and reaping french vessels sent to support their army on corsica against british invasion though i did hear that he did something that angered nelson who was in overall command lt adair said with a puzzled shrug of incomplete knowledge made him kick furniture and swear one time or more went ashore and shot some frenchman he was pursuing someone told me lt gamble offered got caught up in the battle that ran the whole austrian army twenty miles in a perfect panic fore noon but got back to the coast and was picked up by one of our boats that wasnt even looking for him speak of captain lewries good fortune why that fellow he shot was the very same guillaume choundas we dealt with in the caribbean adair added shot his arm clean off with that ferguson breechloading rifle from two hundred yards away or better choundas was in charge of all the privateers working out of the isle of guadeloupe and twas his frigate we battered to kindling right in the harbour of basterre before she could get a way on and that captain choundas the ugly bastard welltween the american revolution and the frenchun choundas and the captain crossed hawses somewhere in the far east too we put paid to that ogre even if the americans did end up capturing him but twas the captains doing mister adair mr winwood stuck in that we cooperated so closely yet so carefully with the new american navy during their brief little notquiteawar with the french back in bless me but we led the yankee doodles out of english harbour right to that french arms convoy bound for saint domingue and choundass clutch of warships and privateers too dont forget saint vincent lt devereux said after hed topped up his port and passed it leftwards down the table jester id heard was on her way home with despatches in need of a refit at the time when she stumbled into admiral jerviss fleet think of it mister urquhart nelson in hms captain with the culloden daunting a whole wing of the spanish fleet up against twodecker threedecker ships of the line and the santissima trinidad the worlds only fourdecker before they could assail the rear of our fleet and right by their side was captain lewrie and hms jester a sixth rate by heaven which had no business engaging anything bigger than her especially not a ship of the line blazing away with her ninepounders and drawing the fire of the worlds biggest warship captaind tell ye different mr winwood countered coming as close as he might to an outright laugh i mentioned it once whilst we dined and he swore that jester was just sailing along alee of nelson minding her own business and acting as a signalsrepeating ship but nelson suddenly wheeled out of line and nigh would have rammed jester amidships had she not hauled her own wind and come about as well as the captain told it it was ram you or damn you that jester and he were pushed and courage had nothing to do with it he did fire on the santissima trinidad since it seemed the thing to do but that she was far out of range of jesters guns and far out of range of her own and why the dons would waste an entire fourdeck broadside on his wee ship he still has no idea took em a month to reload and run out but admiral jervis thought it brave lt adair said thats why the captain wears the gold medal for the battle of cape saint vincent told he was daft as bats in point of fact and not to do that sort of thing again but he did put his name forward for the medal after that before it i cant quite recall lt gamble said with a frown of concentration jester was in the adriatic with a small squadron a few months before old jarvy had to fall back on gibraltar and abandon the mediterranean oh that was definitely during napoleons italian campaign and the french badly needed adriatic oak to build new warships or repair the ones they still had and the captain went through their merchantmen like a hot knife through butter fought a vicious pack of local pirates serbian or something to save a bunch of english men and women got lured ashore by them and almost lost his life before his first lieutenant got leery and sent a marine party ashore the pirates had taken a venetian ship just full of catholics and white muslims whom they hated worse than anything and were simply butchering for fun fore the captain got there that is where captain lewrie met mistress theoni connor widow of a man in the ionian islands currant trade and ahem well saved her and her little boys life the pirates put her up for auction and the captain bought time by bidding her price up heard lt urquhart raised a brow over thatun for while he was not a rakehell and had been raised in a strict but loving religiously observant home still and all he was a young man of all his parts and not averse to a run ashore so long as precautions were taken and pleasures could be taken discreetly that was one incident that hed heard about capt lewrie a greek woman a hellishfetching widow rich as king croesus off the currant trade and britons insatiable desire for them who lived so flambouyantly in london had had a child out of wedlock with a navy officer was his mistress during the time he was ashore capt alan lewries name had been linked to her and the boychild was so hed heard named michael alan connor aha theoni kavares connor the one you mean sir he asked the onlyslightlydiscomfited lt gamble she and the captain aye thats the one lt adair supplied she came down to sheerness and took shore lodgings once proteus was repaired after the battle of camperdown and got orders for the west indies the captain did ah spend a night or two ashore but long before that just as proteus was fitting out just before the nore mutiny well mr winwood intoned and heaved a deep sigh now foolish as it sounds there was something fey about her too a celtic pagan thing that was extremely odd and disturbing tell it me lt urquhart asked of him even more intrigued the mutiny at the great naval anchorage of the nore which was much more dangerous and rebellious against king and country than ever the more respectful spithead mutiny had been had begun just as demands had been fulfilled among the channel fleet lewrie had just been made post into hms proteus fresh from the private yards at chatham where she had first tasted water under another captain and the manner of her launching had as mr winwood had said been extremely odd the admiraltys chosen name was to be proteus a greek seagod but came the day when the bands the crowds the dignitaries and the church representatives had turned out for the celebration a retired rearadmiral who at the moment had been filled with more brandy than sense and at the nagging of his mythladen wife who had been simply besotted with the newly popular tales published by the blind irish poet ocarolan and an host of others cried out success to his majestys ship merlin as he hoisted his glass to her and drained it off just as the last restraining props had been sawn through and a gasp had arisen and the band nighstumbled to a cacophonous halt one simply didnt name a protestant christian kings ship one specifically built to kill catholic spaniards and atheistic frenchmen in the most efficient manner after a pagan wizard and heathen druid even if merlin had been such a boon to fabled old king arthur hms merlin had begun to slide down the greasy ways into the medway til another senior officer in better mental takings and relative sobriety perhaps one without a termagant wife in tow quickly got to his feet seized a full glass and corrected things with a loud cry of success to his majestys ship proteus at the instant the frigate had stuck quite solidly on the ways talk of greater consternation it was not until an irish sawyer whod helped build her with his little boy at his side had gone down the slipway and had stood under the ships bows right beside her cutwater had whispered something to her to this day unknowable then the wee lad had given her the tiniest shove more like a love pat in point of fact before proteusmerlin had given out a soft groan then had allowed herself to be launched sliding into the river as sweet as anything newly posted alan lewrie was in fact her second captain a bit after her launch whilst still completing rigging her first commanding officer and his cousin her chaplain both angloirishmen landowners in the big way over hundreds of poor irish cottagers rowed back from shore one deadcalm night not a breath of wind stirred with not a ripple to disturb the medways surface yet proteus had heaved a slow roll starboard steepening the boarding battens to deadvertical and the first captain and her chaplain and been heard to utter shouts as both suddenly lost their gripsboth were abstemious and sober as judges so it was reported later the chaplain well he fell backwards striking his head on the gunnel of the ships boat he sank out of sight at once and his body was never found and while her first captain had managed to cling to the boarding batten steps he had claimed that it felt as if the manropes had stung him or bit him as hurtful as wasps and not a week after said captain was found raving and crying in his nightshirt dashing about the quarterdeck or cowering in sheer terror in his cabins swearing that proteus had murdered his cousin and was out to kill him too were his family not rich he could have ended up in bedlam in london supplementing his halfpay it took rather a bit of doing for a senior officer to be struck off the navy list for any cause other than dropping stonecold dead in those days off the pokingstick and watersquirt concessions offered those who toured the place and wished to stir the inmates up from catatonia at that point enter capt alan lewrie lucky again to get himself such a fine spankingnew frigate or so he had thought for not a fortnight later proteus had fallen down the snaking medway to the nore anchorage right into the heart of the mutiny one mutineer in particular whom lewrie himself had recruited off the receiving ship hed turned out to be a former midshipman rolston back in when lewrie first donned kings coat as a mid a little fiend who had been responsible for a sailors death and broken to ordinary seaman stoked proteuss own rebellious cabal of mutineers and had tried to arrange the murder of all her officers warrants and gentlemanly midshipmen in the end capt lewrie kept from being sent ashore as the other officers and captains were by the rebellious committee had won enough loyal sailors and marines to launch a rebellion of his own with the rather embarrassing help from the roughly two dozen prostitutes fetched out to the ship by the bumboatmenpimps whod usually serve as temporary wives by sailors with money for their socket fees supporting them on shares of their rations rum issues and smuggled spirits the mutineer committee had declared that all women must stay aboard the rebelling warships long after the sailors last coins had been spent so the doxies had been feeling a touch rebellious themselves indeed hms proteus was one of the few warships that had managed to escape under fire from mutinous ships of the line to join up with adm duncans muchreduced squadron which kept watch on the batavian dutch republics coasts to daunt the dutch navy from leaving port to join with a french fleet after dropping off the whores and those mutineers theyd made prisoners it had been reckoned notorious that capt lewrie had sent letters to both admiralty and parliament asking that the women receive monetary rewards and letters of thanks for the patriotic and courageous aid theyd offered the captain had also sent a noteofhand to his london solicitor ordering that each of the prostitutes be paid a morethandecent sum for services rendered and what the crown society and capt lewries wife thought of that well and when that rolston had died now that was eerie too a transfer from proteus to a coaster theyd met hired to take prisoners to the authorities at sheerness rolston coming on deck in chains and shackles cursing lewrie for his luckthere it was againfor how else could one explain how rolston could swing his cutlass for a killing beheading blow but damme if the captain hadnt deflected it with his tinpennywhistle and if the good lord or the pagan seagod lir hadnt been looking out for him then please explain it then when rolston had started down the boarding battens with manropes in hand damme if proteus hadnt heaved a slow roll to windward and rolston had cried out hands springing open as if something had stung his palms and had fallen into a round pool of lanthorn light tween both vessels surfacing one last time and looking as if he was floating in a circle of odd yellowgreen light as if sinking into the very eye of a great seamonster then had seemed to be sucked down and howling a final shriek of utter horror after a collective shudder of recalled awe the bottle of port made another quick circuit of the table all of them feeling as dry as dust of a sudden after that we played the dutch a merry jape sir lt devereux of the marines told urquhart we spent weeks close inshore of the texel hoisting false flag signals to the fleet they feared was just over the horizon and pretending to reply to questions even if admiral duncan had barely a handful of old sixtyfour gunners present til the nore mutiny was settled and he was reenforced urquhart certainly knew what had happened once the winds had come fair the dutch fleet had sailed but had been caught upon a lee shore and nearly annihilated and proteus it seemed had played her own significant part in the battle engaging a larger dutch frigate and forcing her to strike after a boarding action capt lewrie had been seriously wounded in the arm but had lived his uncanny luck had held once more for his arm had not required amputation as most brokenbone wounds would have done and that was why the gold medal for the battle of camperdown hung on his chest alongside the one for cape st vincent lewrie mistress theoni connor hyde park the captain and his ife yes urquhart suddenly recalled a hero with his arm in a sling a wife with a furled umbrella employing it like a sword after seeing her mans mistress and bastard byblow at close quarters making lewrie hop duck and back up briskly thered been many salacious snickers in his favourite coffeehouse when that tale had been told he hid his smile as the others touched upon lewries doings in the west indies and lt urquhart once more went wideeyed an outbreak of yellow jack that was why lewrie had needed the dozen blacks so badly was it before or after the captains friend had duelled ledyard beauman and slain him when the captain had had to shoot beaumans second too no matter that was one reason there was so much bad blood against the french though proteus had swept the north coast of st domingue what the rebel exslaves were now calling haiti of any shipping larger than a canoe had captured american arms smugglers captured sank or burned french merchantmen and privateers had crippled that choundas fellows big proud frigate as they had already related and had put paid to that cruel fiend too and werent there seals barking lt adair said with a face full of wonder and rather red with claret and port the night that our boats went ashore to fetch out our black fellows seals in the west indies have been hunted nigh to extinction but i swear i heard them and their splashings to boot some of the lads mr coote the purser who had spent the last hour entire in contented and companionable nodding silence said they swore they saw seals in the water and even i thought i saw one head and disturbance in the water i certainly am sure that i heard them mister langlies boat crews our former first sir vowed that seals swam to either side of their boats on the way back aboard saint nicholas mole lt devereux reminded them one of exslave general toussaint louvertures armies tried to oust the british army garrison at the port on the northwest coast and proteus had caught a signal asking for help and had sailed into the roadstead close ashore with the fighting lines hidden in dense forests lewrie had sent a signalling party ashore to aid the army and wigwag with their frigates guns at extreme elevation proteus had fired both solid roundshot and bags of grapeshot adjusting according to the shore partys signal flags and allowing their own troops to fall back behind a screen of plunging shot and reform their lines and in the process decimating the slave army with springs on her cables proteus had swung in a wide arc firing off nearly all of her grapeshot cartridge flannels and a whole tier of powder casks from morning til sunset saving the port and the british garrison in the process and those french creole pirates lt adair suggested with a wry shake of his head had we been quicker about it thered have been nigh a million pounds sterling in silver captured not a mere two hundred thousand barataria bay dye mean lt urquhart cried aye i read of thatun courageous seafights prizemoney and slews of captured enemy specie brought in had ever caught his eye in the marine chronicle especially since lt urquhart had never even come within hailing distance of anything so adventurous or profitable yet though under capt alan lewrie it sounded better odds that he could be part of such glorious doings and reaping the monetary benefits mad as hatters the lot of them lt gamble said with a sniff rich bored young grandees none older than me or adair there but determined to seize louisiana back from the spanish and turn it over to france again and the way they tried to finance their rebellion was to turn pirate playactors lt adair sneered murderous coldblooded and capricious little bastards and one bitch stole a prize of ours as far abroad as dominica lt gamble continued marooned the hands of her harbour watch on the dry tortugascause theyd yet to do a marooning so please you laughed and hooted our sailors said once theyd been rescued like it was a grand game one shot our midshipman mister burns poor tyke just to try his hand at long range and it took him three days to die well we made them pay when we finally ran them to earth slew the lot of them twas only the girl that got away and she nearly slew the captain for revenge for scotching their plans why are foiled plots always scotched scot lt adair carped cause you scots plot so bloody much lt devereux hooted peraps it was more ze wrath of a woman scorned and betrayed than mere revenge sirs surgeon mr durant slyly suggested wreathed in a cloud of smoke from his clay pipe nestcepas after all ze captain ad made her acquaintance in new orleans before rejoining ze ship in new orleans a puzzled urquhart gawped but thats more than an hundred miles up the mississippi in spanish louisiana foreign office doings that mr winwood heavily said with a sage tap aside his nose the captain i gather has been involved with their agents several times during his career something in the far east tween the wars something that involved that choundas chap again in the mediterranean i heard when in jester it mightve involved choundas again in the west indies a pair of foreign office agents spent rather a long time aboard proteus that james peel especially the captain was temporarily supplanted in command by a more senior captain nicely and sent to new orleans in civilian disguise as a cashiered british officer looking for employment on the mississippi with just a small party of our sailors three of whom proved false in the end and ran guarded by a merchant agent from the panton leslie company who was half a spy himself charite de guilleri she was devereux stuck in and a most hellishfetching wench of nineteen years or so the captain managed to meet her her brothers and cousins who were all in on it and i gather that he and she even might have conducted an ah liaison for a time before they set off on their last foray and he rejoined the ship im certain that the captain would not have ahwinwood grumbled with a blush the others smirked at the sailing master and his squeamishness which led lt urquhart to reckon that his captain was a man of many parts saw her only the once myself marine lieutenant devereux said with a rather wistful expression when we assaulted their camp on grand isle standing atop an ancient indian burial mound or something chestnut hair flowing in the breeze dressed mannish in breeches and boots and shooting at us with a girandoni airrifle and all honours to lieutenant devereux and his marines and late lieutenant catterall and his party of sailors for conquering them the purser cried which made them pound fists on the wardroom table a toast gentlemen to mister catterall devereux called for to bully god rest him he added when all the glasses were charged and they drank in remembrance of their old companion the captain boarded one of their schooners and slew one of the older pirate leaders sword to sword lt adair narrated after the port bottle had made another round then took off in a native boat after the wench and he almost closed with her too before she shot him right in the centre of his chest shot him lt urquhartmarvelled a tad walleyed by then in the centre of his chest and he lived surely sir youre not saying that his whatd ye call it his geas for good fortune made him bulletproof all she did was knock him flat and make a bruise as big as a mushmelon the surgeon mr durant said with a wry chuckle fortunately for the captain the buttflask of compressed air which provides the motive force was nearly spent lt devereux related with a chuckle of his own i put it down to extreme good fortune no more mister urquhart for had mademoiselle de guilleri had a spare flask wed have lost him certain you should have been there to see the pirates captured spanish treasure ship explode sir lt adair told urquhart she took light somehow as she drifted off and when her powder magazine went up she was blown to kindling and god knows how many newminted silver coins went flying skyhigh bright as a royal fireworks and plopping in the bay in a circle a mile across and lost forever after that twas a rather dull year though gamble frowned off to halifax last summer with despatches he was interrupted by the lone chime of one bell in the evening watch half past eight leaving them another half hour before a call for lights out at nine observed in harbour or at sea a partial refit and a full recoppering there gamble went on to portsmouth then orders to join the escort of an east india company trade we might have gone as far as bombay calcutta or canton but for getting our rudder shot clean off by a french frigate one night off cape town adair supplied with a pouty look though we did touch at recife and saint helena on the way and that was enjoyable and there was the circus lt gamble said with a twinkle circus urquhart by then rather bleary enquired at a loss once more why mister daniel wigmores travelling extravaganza sir lt adair replied surely youve heard of it the most famous circus in all the british isles circus menagerie of exotic beasts and theatrical troupe in one lt gamble happily mused comedies dramas aerial acts knife throwers dancing bears and lion taming clowns mimes and bareback riders some barer than others hmm he leered oh princess eudoxia adair gaily joined in bow and arrows and never missed standing bareback from under the belly of her huge white stallion facing aft like a parthian what a wonder she was billed as scythian circassian royalty but really a roosian cossack gamble stated with equal enthusiasm an absolutely stunning darkhaired beauty slim and tall with the most cunning long legs in skintight breeches kneehigh moccasin boots a corsety thing and seethrough gauze whatyemaycallit long shirt and wasnt she hot after the captain threw herself at himtil she learned he was married o course he did pick up a smattering of roosian though adair leered suggestively cursewords mostly from that vicious old lion tamer father of hers their slow old tub the festival was bound for cape town to capture new beasts and attached itself to our convoy on our way for recife lt devereux explained she sailed with our homebound trade too once wed replaced our rudder and set the ship to rights and was there the night we fought and made prize of the l uranie frigate the second frenchman went after the slowest ship in the convoy the festival but when they tried to board her they ran into a hornets nest of trained bears baboons and a loosed lion knife throwers sharpshooters and mistress eudoxias bow and arrows too the frogs were so terrified they tumbled back aboard their ship and sheered off just as the other escort the old jamaica sixtyfour got about and closed with them and i doubt they fired more than a single broadside for honours sake before they struck as well why wigmores circus received thanks of the crown thanks of parliament and john company and even did a command performance for king george devereux said with a laugh and now wigmores future is made forever i must own surprise mister urquhart that you havent heard of them i was at sea aboard albion and out of reach of the papers urquhart had to admit though i did read the official account about proteuss defence of the convoy well gentlemen he said with a glance upwards to the stubs of the candles in the overhead lamps instead of drawing out his pocketwatch this had been a most enlightening evening one which assures me that as savages first lieutenant i run no risk of lacking excitement hey and i look forward eagerly to whatever new adventures our gallant captain lewrie may lead us in future we will follow him anywhere lt gamble said with a taut grin and his tongue firmly in cheek if only to see what hell get into next ha ha which jest raised a general round of laughter from all the men attable but for the dour mr winwood i ah urquhart flummoxed his nowfuzzy thoughts put off pace by lt gambles smirky comment a toast may i be so bold a last one for the captain assured me that tomorrow will be a strenuous day to the gallant captain alan lewrie and to further glory and fame for hms savage he raised his glass on high as did the others but and to mother greens best sirs lt devereux amended andom captains favourites urquhart gawped once more mouth agape for a moment for mother green god rest her patriotic soul had made and sold the finest and safest sheepgut cundums from the green lantern in half moon street in london for years had come out of retirement at the urging of her old clients when the american revolution had erupted in to make protections for their officer sons so they could rantipole yankee doodle wenches in perfect assurance of safety too urquhart also blushed for did he not have a round dozen from that selfsame source now manufactured by mother greens heirs down in the bottom of his seachest cause one never knew when the chance might arise not with women of the better sort certainly but the captain savage and mother green he proposed boat ahoy came a muffled cry from the unfortunate midshipman who stood harbour watch in the officers stead the reply could not be made out as they tossed back their last glassfuls to heeltaps but moments later came the faint thud of a boat coming alongside the entryport and at such a late hour too chapter four alan lewrie was ready for bed after a rather succulent supper taken alone in his greatcabins a whole jointed chicken dredged in flour and crumbled biscuit then panfried the way his wife from north carolina had cooked it a method happily rediscovered when hed been dined aboard ships of the fledgling united states navy in the indies among officers from south carolina or georgia fresh garden peas and young spring carrots intermixed had accompanied it supported by a baked potato smeared with mustard and a basket of dainty shore rolls his coxn liam desmond had talked their free black volunteer cook so aptly renamed cooke into baking a few apple tarts as well all sluiced down with one of the bottles of cape town white wines that lewrie had purchased just before sailing back to england and a couple of brandies after when catching up on the last of the days unending flow of official paperwork from the warehouses ashore a chapter or two of a new novel and a game of chase with a champagne cork on a string with toulon and chalky til theyd tired of it had rolled their eyes at him and had flopped down on the canvas deck chequer exhausted he was in his nightshirt the coverlet and top sheet of his hanging bedcot turned down and was just about to roll into that bed that was wide enough for two and a sure eyeopener for any senior officer who espied it when there came the sharp rap of a musketbutt on the deck without his cabins and the loud cry from the marine sentry of vistor fer th capm sah enter lewrie cautiously replied not without an eye towards his weapons rack for if the beaumans had landed in england and had laid charges against him it could be someone from a lord justice or one of those newfangled police magistrates come to arrest him thankfully perhaps it was only a lone rather weedylooking civilian who entered the greatcabins hat in hand and blinking his eyes as he took in his surroundings surely a civilian fellow whod never been aboard a ship of war by the way he bore himself so mouseshy and curious lewrie noted though that he bore under his arm a leather portfolio of a very pale dye what attorneys jokingly called law calf lewrie looked even sharper towards his weapons rack and you are sir lewrie had to demand at last putting on a stern phyz with one quizzical brow raised beg pardons the paleskinned civilian all but stammered as he came forward but am i speaking with captain alan lewrie of the savage frigate of course you are sir lewrie snapped appalled at such an inane question your boatman brought you to savage not the victory beg pardons the weedy fellow reiterated though he didnt look daunted in the least allow to name myself to you aye thatd help lewrie drawled summoning up as much dignity as one could when clad in a looseflapping nightshirt and his bare feet george sadler sir clerk to mister andrew macdougall esquire in london your barrister sir aye mister sadler and what is so urgent that he sent you down lewrie enquired with one hand hidden behind his back with his fingers crossed and a sudden cold and empty fearvoid in his innards news has come from jamaica captain lewrie sadler announced as he opened his law calf brief and withdrew a sheaf of documents the beaumans havent landed in england then not yet no sir not yet word of proceedings instituted on jamaica have however come along with mosthelpful information anent them provided by ah a certain friend of yours from the foreign office on jamaica a mister james peel what sort of proceedings sir lewrie asked why your trial captain lewrie mr sadler said wideeyed i havent even been charged with anything yet lewrie barked oh my but you have captain lewrie sadler sadly told him as he referred to his sheaf of documents and allowed himself a pleased little aha as he found the pertinent one which he held out in offering for lewrie to take charged i fear with the theft of a dozen slaves and tried in the high court at kingston jamaica nearly six months past found guilty and are sentenced to be hung what lewrie spluttered how can i be tried if i wasnt in absentia captain lewrie sadler replied much too calmly and with a wee shake of his head over lewries lack of knowledge of the intricacies of the law it happens all the time when a felon flees the jurisdiction of the flee mine arse lewrie roared i sailed away under naval orders got em in my desk tprove it by mine arse on a bandbox of all the shit shit shit he sank onto his leatherpadded chair behind his desk feeling badly in need of another brandy some civilian clothing and a ticket for overseas wonder if the yankee navys in need of experienced men he shudderingly thought see one otheir consuls get a certificate ocitizenship and huzzah george washington under the circumstances captain lewrie mister macdougall is in need of your presence in london as soon as possible he told me to relate to you sadler went on legal cases and trials were his workaday experience mostly piles of paperwork to him and the personality of the accused was of no matter nor were the accuseds feelings he also told me to assure you that the informations supplied by mister peel including a complete copy of the trial transcript reveal a most colourable proceeding he is certain that perjury was committed though to determine the full nature of that it is vital that he speak with you in person sir i was what is it called lewrie managed to say from a dry throat one that he massaged to see if a hempen noose was already about his neck whats the legal term for falsely convicted captain lewrie sadler said with a simper of esoteric amusement for a second though the informal term would be framed i fear you must come up to london at once sir oh bugger lewrie bemoaned i just cant leave my ship at the drop of a hat the navyd have my nutmegs off relieve me of my command whether i request leave or not just couldnt macdougall simply sue for more time believe me when i tell you that time is precious sir sadler said with a negative shake of his head your poor relationship with the beaumans and their brutal and vengeful nature which you described to my employer in letters must be fleshed out by direct questions put to you before the beaumans and their representatives arrive and lay the charges the verdict and the sentence before a court this cant be done by post any longer christ shit on a biscuit lewrie muttered under his breath as he rose and headed for his winecabinet for a restorative glass of something any spirit that fell first to hand the bastardsl they seem to be sir sadler primly agreed with a longing eye on the squat bottle of brandy that lewrie dug out he brightened as lewrie waved the bottle in his direction and fetched out a second glass it would appear that we meaning your legal representatives have received the transcript and the verdict beforehand of its being laid before a lord justice in kings bench where all criminal trials are held which happy fact will allow us perhaps enough time to find flaws in your trial which may result in the sentence being ruled null and void and a second trial held here or your being acquitted really lewrie piped with a faint glimmer of hope and until your foes actually arrive and are allowed to lay the sentence of death before a lord justice you will remain a free man captain lewrie sadler assured him sort of as he accepted the glass of brandy and did for a weedy sort a manly job of drinking off half of it at once and there is the matter of which law term will have space on its docket before an evidentiary hearing before you are brought to dock that is to say damme i could be at sea long afore that lewrie gleefully cried out of reach of though sir perhaps under a deathsentence sadler had to point out until we may challenge the result of your trial and stay its execution baad choice o words mister sadler lewrie said blanching bloodybad choice o words christ am i fucked lewrie thought to himself think o going to sophies and langlie s wedding with this hangin over me shit did i say hanging now th bastards got me doin it book i dick butcher the first thing we do lets kill all the lawyers william shakespeare the second part of king henry vi act iv scene ii chapter five it had been extremely crowded in the diligence coach up from portsmouth to london arseholes to elbows as lewrie grumbled at the coaching inn at petersfield where the horse teams had been changed a few passengers got off there but a horde of newuns had gotten on and lewrie had been crammed into a tiny corner by a window with the bench seat normally fit for three abreast jampacked with four and nary a one of them seemed to have bathed the last week entire he had taken lodgings at an inn suggested by mr sadler who had made a bad travelling companion the man simply could not silence his cheery babbling towards lewrie who grunted back lost in his own brown study and ready to throttle the wee bastard with each and every passengermale female child or toddler wizened droopeyed and wheezing dodderers simpering matronhags adult men new mothers with drool fountains on their lapsanyone was fare for him from rich to poor and generally goggling out the windows at every passing sight like a simpleton whod found himself on an aristocrats grand tour of the continent by mistake well perhaps mr sadler had never been outside london before lewrie could speculate and he was on a grand tour and slaving away over special pleadings all ink and rustling paper from dawn to dusk as a law clerk just might be a stiflingly drab life in a sobersided profession sadler was like a boy just up from school he ate like one too for lewrie had been given to understand that the honorarium already paid to his employer andrew macdougall esq did not cover travel expenses meals and lodging etc and etc so it was lewries notbottomless purse that had gotten sadler back to shore and into decent lodgings after they had completed their business aboard savage had repaid his downward fare to portsmouth and their coach fares to london sadlers hearty breakfast their midday meal at petersfield and a basket of treats to take the edge off any wants the rest of the way up to london as well as a pint of ale here then a bottle of porter aboard the coach to keep sadlers touchy throat condition wet lewries rooms in london and another hearty evening meal taken together at a rather fashionable new chophouse near somerset house in the strand a chophouse that seemed dedicated to settling the national debt off the price of its victuals and one lewrie was mortalcertain had never been one of sadlers haunts without one of his employers clients to pay for all the damned fool hed even shown up at lewries lodgings for a preconsultation breakfast by god mister macdougall will be out shortly captain lewrie sadler said with a simper as he hung up his hat and greatcoat on a halltree in the outer office and saw to lewries as well they had coached the short distance from lewries inn well sadler had coached in rare style from whatever miserable garret he occupied to the inn then had the cabman wait for an extra fee til they had eat and for a small fellow sadler could put it away like a modernday sir john falstaff then taken the coach up the strand to fleet street then into narrower whitefriars street where macdougall had his digs it was not quite the offices where lewrie had expected to find himself the first room he entered was more a parlour or sitting room than anything else all prim and clean with an axminster carpet on the floor a marble fireplace and freshlooking and brightly upholstered settees and wingback chairs set about with two large windows facing the street and god only knew how much macdougall paid in window tax for such a lot of light and a good view sadler parted a set of double doors in the back wall stepped through then closed them leaving lewrie to pace about the parlour peer into the bookcases and fret with his shirt collar and neckstock a moment later sadler was back leaving the doors open this time and saying most formally if you will step this way sir hmmph got his workaday face back on i s pose lewrie had to think thank god there ii be no more blathering he followed sadler into a room of equal size to the parlour one featuring a dining area a wee butlers pantry and a large sideboard past thatun into a third a bedroom with an oldstyle curtained fourposter then through a final set of double doors to yet another large room furnished as a proper office a booklined study with a fireplace and yet another pair of windows looking west onto bouverie street damme how much is his fee lewrie wondered and felt thankful that reverend william wilberforce and his charitable and fervent antislavery followers had so far footed the bill aha captain lewrie do you come in sir his barrister gayly exclaimed broadly gesturing him to a wingback chair before his desk which was piled high with stacks of legal octavos and folders of that puddingcrust law calf leather your servant sir and i am andrew macdougall will you take coffee or tea captain lewrie take a pew sir and be comfortable whilst we begin about it ha ha andhes the one tsave mine arselewrie gawped to himself as he took in mr andrew macdougall esquire for macdougall looked more like a puckish public school boy than what lewrie expected an attorney to be macdougall looked no older than his middletwenties his face round with dimpled cheeks and chin under a head of curly dark blond hair that spilled over his forehead in an unkempt mopone that he swiped back at least twice before lewrie could seat himselfand was so curly that lewrie could conjure that he really wore a perukestyled court wig of unconventional colour were it not for the fact that his lawyers formal black court robe and peruke already rested on a stand in one corner a stand formed much like a mast with one crossed yardarm lewrie found it oddly disconcerting that mute display more of a legal scarecrow with arms spread wide to net the unfortunate and the peruke with its three tight sidecurls short queue bound with a black ribbon resting on a pad atop the stand a faceless intimation of future horror it was so ghoulish that lewrie felt a tiny shiver scarecrow or the grim reaper lewrie thought with a gulp well now isnt this delightful macdougall most happily said as sadler hovered over lewries right shoulder coffee or tea sir umm coffeed suit lewrie decided delightful sir why to meet one of britain s heroic seadogs captain lewrie macdougall exclaimed again making lewrie even uneasier with the dread that his new attorney did rather a lot of exclaiming and had less of the requisite gravitas than god had promised a march hare a seadog now under a sentence of death sir lewrie replied with a squirm of impatience to get past the politenesses to the meat of the matter oh that macdougall said with a wave of his hand as he took hold of a matching wingback chair and dragged it round the desk quite near lewries plumped himself down in it and crossed his legs clubman fashion with one ankle resting on a knee stuff and nonsense stuff and non lewrie gawped aloud this time slavery was outlawed in the british isles nigh fifty years ago captain lewrie and the condition of slavery is no longer recognised under common law macdougall was quick to assure him leaning over to tap lewrie on the knee and bestowing on him a very wide grin also there is the fact that the committee of privy council for the colonies disbanded long ago by the by allowed jamaica and certain other colonies and plantations use of their own local grant law but such law has no standing in english jurisprudence dye see captain lewrie oh for cases concerning commerce those presented in courts of common pleas or chancery court should such grant law cases concern inheritances and disputed wills jury decisions or local justices rulings might stand if appealed in england but certainly not anent your case which would go to kings bench for confirmation most usually ah the coffee capital thankee sadler so no ones to snatch me up and march me off to tyburn lewrie asked suddenly feeling a lot better newgate sir macdougall corrected him with another swipe at his unruly locks and yet another of his disarming smiles tyburns out and newgate prison near the old bailey is london s new site of executions closer and more convenient to everyone needful of instruction in the sureness and majesty of the law ha ha theres nothing finer than a series of hangings to keep our criminal class daunted ha ha well sometimes in horsemonger lane beats the theatre all hollow too does it lewrie shied away wondering just what sort of a tomfool his supporters had engaged entertainment for some surely captain lewrie grim warning to others macdougall chummily agreed as he shovelled four spoonfuls of sugar into his coffee and stirred it up ah just right brazilian and thank god the portuguese are still neutral in this war lewrie took a sip of his and found it not quite as scaldinghot as he preferred but it was close so he dashed two spoonfuls of sugar into his own stirred it up and sipped again so lewrie reiterated could someone take me up oh there is a remote possibility macdougall allowed with a shrug very remote mind any fool may lay an information with one of our newfangled police magistrates but that sort of arrest usually involves petty crimes or revenge twixt thieves whove fallen out even were you to be denounced and the bow street runners come snatch you youd be back on the streets in a trice or as my good old granther always said in twa shakes o th wee sheeps tail an th feerst ain aready been shook ha ha uhm why lewrie had to ask not reassured a whit fear sir fear macdougall told him with a great chortling laugh now tis a crime the runners are already pursuing yes they would hold you til trial one of those kings bench justice mills that prosecutes twenty or thirty cases a day but you sir ha we do not treat our wellborn or our heroes in such a fashion most of the criminal class the lower classes well their crimes are evident as usually is their guilt god help them but for a gentleman a member of the landed gentry and the welltodo most of the magistrates start to tremble in their boots deference to the better sorts and members of the nobility would result in a quick remand to higher authorities and with the presence of legal counsel at your side upon such remand would have you free in an eyeblink unless you had committed a heinous crime here in england sir macdougall cautioned in a rare sober moment then not a second later guffawed and slapped his knee and of course we both know that you didnt and any police magistrate would drop you like redhot shot and not care a fig what transpired on jamaica unless told to do so i may safely walk the streets of london then lewrie asked no one walks london streets in perfect safety given how many criminals we have abouts captain lewrie macdougall said finding a new cause for amusement but in your case such a takingup as ive already said would be a very remote possibility well thats something then lewrie said with a relieved sigh there is also the commonly held fear of the old star chamber tyranny and official oppression captain lewrie macdougall told him as he rose to liven the fire in the grate with a poker then sat back down you are aware that there are no government prosecutors under common law every person put on trial whether in kings bench for criminal cases in common pleas or chancery court is prosecuted by an objective attorney engaged by the aggrieved party and every person brought to court is supposed to be represented by yet another objective attorney engaged by the accused his family and supporters or in some cases by a barrister sarjeant or advocate appointed by the lord justices should the accused be indigent as i supposedly was back in kingston lewrie charily asked the conduct of your trial in absentia on jamaica i tell you sir was the very epitome of the worst abuses of star chamber proceedings macdougall intoned in a sudden pique from what i was able to gather from friends and allies of yours in the west indies your legal counsel a locally schooled johnny newcome to the jamaican bar was whistled up from a tavern cross the street from the courthouses given but half an hour to familiarise himself with little more than your name and background and presented no witnesses on your behalf not even any witnesses who might attest to your character or qualities before your trial began oh theres a whole host of irregularities which i have gleaned from the transcript of your trial sir rather a short one given the fact that the entire proceedings did not last much more than three hours from oyez to verdict to sentencing and the justices god have mercy on his soul wheresoever he may be at this moment three hours lewrie blanched that wonderful coffee curdling in his stomach three bloody hours not as odd as youd think sir macdougall replied laughing again why the first complex criminal case in kings bench with a slew of witnesses on both sides that actually lasted more than a lone day did not occur til sat in on it whilst i was eating my terms at greys inn and what a show it was ha ha fascinating oh christ lewrie weakly croaked nought to fear captain lewrie macdougall soothingly said eating my terms was not all i did before being called to the bar macdougall then proceeded to lay out the usual cursus lex that most aspiring attorneys were required to pursue which did nothing much to reassure lewrie that any lawyer was worth a pinch of pig shit a first or second son usually from a welltodo family might attend university for a decent grounding in a gentlemanly education in rhetoric latin and greek whether graduate or not anyone wishing to become a proper lawyer would approach one of the great inns of courtlincolns inn greys inn middle temple or inner templewhichever suited his tastes and where the members seemed more of a like mind to his than any of the others then ingratiate himself by merely hanging about reading precedent from past proceedings on his own time with no real schedule of instruction and dinein often enough for the elder membersthose called benchers who had already earned their honourifics of kings counselto vet them and decide usually after a period of three years of social dining in hall with other members whether they should be called to the bar or not oh some more aspiring might spend their time as special pleaders the ones who wrote up presentations to be submitted to court for their elders but it wasnt really all that necessary after all there were many wellborn aspirants who avoided the drudgery of such menial work but became lawyers on the strength of their supper conversation and their ability to look sober after those communal dinners andrew macdougall though was the son of a scottish magistrate who had actually bothered to read the law and for a time apprenticed himself to a real successful attorney before inheriting the estate and becoming a respected local magistrate the fathers respect for the law and his incessant talk of what had occurred in his local court his explaining the intricacies of the differences between english common law and scottishand long evenings in his study spent wrangling what current law was and what a fairminded man felt it should behad enflamed young andrew macdougall to be a barrister he had spent time at a good public school or what passed for one in scotland then had done two terms at university in edinburgh before coaching down to oxford to complete his studies then had approached greys inn and while eating his terms he had deeply immersed himself in studying in attending court sessions in long and earnest discussions with the benchers and writers of his lodge eagerly offering to take on the drab fingerpinching work of a special pleader for more than a year before being called to the bar and macdougall was quick to inform lewrie had been successful in most of his cases since my gowns yonder sir macdougall concluded with a hint of pride as he pointed to that spooky black robe with outstretched arms on the stand in the corner though i am still required to wear one of stuff not silk and have yet to earn the title of kings counsel yet i do assure you that i will do my absolute best to represent your cause captain lewrie and my absolute best is dare i say it rather a cut above what you may encounter from some other of my colleagues whether i held strong personal views on the justice of your actions in recruiting those slaves and making free men of them or not which act i not only approve but applaud by the by ha ha though whether you approve or not mister macdougall you sound to me more than capable lewrie told him thank god for it thankee kindly for your words captain lewrie and i trust you will be of the same mind once your time before the bench is over mr macdougall said now we may need send sadler for a second pot or a third as we get to the meat of the matter for i must glean all i may from you concerning the theft well shall we say rather the obtaining of those dozen former slaves ha ha how and when was the idea concocted and with whom every last particular that happened on the night you ah closed the coast what evidence still in your possession i might present as testimony that sort of thing i know you are fitting out a new ship of war and your time is short so today perhaps tomorrow as well but no longer it is vital that we make the most of your presence here in london lets be at it then lewrie was quick to agree chapter six surviving witnesses there were plenty of them for lewries old crew and wardroom had mostly turnedover entire from proteus to savage macdougall was delighted to hear that all lieutenants and midshipmen were required to keep daily journals noting wind weather sea states and what happened during their times on watch or outoftheordinary events that their ship met while lt catterall was dead and gone and his journals were unavailable adair and grace could testify and lt langlie no longer on the ship but still fitting out his own new warship could send his old journals to macdougall if he was quick to ask for them hells bells lewrie spat ill be seeing langlie before that hes to wed my ward sophie de maubeuge this weekend in portsmouth and did you keep journals of your own sir did you write down what your purposes were that evening macdougall pointedly enquired not reallyl lewrie explained squirming once a commission is done logs and journals are sent to admiralty for perusal and storage so no it wouldnt do would it to write down may first at eight pm turned slavemonger hey macdougall said with a moue followed by a schoolboys i noted the course steered from kingston closing the coast at night dousing all lanthorns how far offshore it was when we cameto sending boats ashore under mister langlie and ah being received of a round dozen volunteers he concluded blushing a bit what doused all lanthorns macdougall suddenly enthused as he scribbled that down on a sheet of foolscap so madly that he slung ink droplets now thats extremely interesting it is lewrie asked at a loss and macdougall eagerly pressed did you or any of your surviving witnesses see any lights ashore sir well there were some porch lamps and such a halfmile or so back from the beach lewrie recalled where i assumed the overseer had his lodgings perhaps one or two round the main houses porch gallery where the beaumans would reside if theyd been there it wasnt their only plantation dye see but the one nearest to my friend christopher cashmans plantation id not have tried it on else for hed sent word to them that if they wished to run and join the navy theyd get the joining bounty as volunteers and get the same treatment as any white volunteer couldve taken twenty or more the whole lot of em if admiralty wouldnt notice sooner or later that i was paying twice the number of hands that proteus was rated but other than those few lamps did you see any other light ashore macdougall squirmed like a puppy as he insisted on an answer nary a one sir lewrie could firmly aver for he had spent the hours from sunset to dawn in a funksweat to be discovered and it had been a huge relief at the time for proteus to have stolen in then stolen out without waking a cricket saw no handcarried lanthorns or torches no hue and cry mr macdougall repeated as if a life hung on the answer hounds barking gunshots anything like that god no twas quiet as the grave lewrie told him ah ha macdougall sharply cried slapping his palm on his desk and guffawing as he swiped his hair out of his eyes once more well there were seals on the beach they barked a bit but no dogs lewrie further informed him never saw a living soul coming to that beach other than your volunteers captain lewrie macdougall demanded suddenly not sounding so young and schoolboyish what other lights were there a moon starlight lewrie related pouring himself another coffee as he did so even if the pot had gone tepid twas a new moon at that time it was ah taken into account for the success of the enterprise lewrie admitted a trifle shamefaced and talking chindown to his shirt collar and your own ships lights were all extinguished ah ha yes yes of course lewrie assured him one brow up would it surprise you very much captain lewrie to learn that the beauman familys overseer on that plantation and his son claimed in their testimony at your sham trial that they were awakened by sounds of the slave population ah celebrating that they testified that they quickly roused themselves took up arms a handlanthorn and lit a rag torch that they rushed down to the beach but arrived too late to recapture their runaways what thats utter shite lewrie spat we didnt fired off a pair of shots at the boats they swore macdougall rushed on to relate and though they hit nothing your ship was so close ashore they knew her for a frigate a british frigate at once more damaging to you they swore they could mark your appearance by the light of your ships taffrail lanthorns because you were standing right by one of them fully illumined mine arse on a bandbox if they could lewrie erupted now sir another matter macdougall demanded picking up a notsothick octavo and flipping through the pages to the section he wanted quickly he rose and paced tossing hair out of his eyes and looking like a cherubic rotund puck for he was a young man of substantial girth and heft in what position relative to the coast did your frigate lie sideways to the beach how close well as to how close lewrie growled still fuming over those baldfaced lies im a better skulker than that by god he assured himself as he got to his own feet too exercised to sit any longer lewrie and macdougall began a slow stomping minuet about the parlour office mostly circling the unused chairs before the desk as if participating in a game of odd man out when the music suddenly stops there was a broken shoal of reef and rocks a cable distant from the beach and we fetchedto into the wind three cables shy of that as i recall and a cable would be why one hundred and twenty fathoms lewrie supplied shocked that such was not common knowledge six feet to the fathom thatd be seven hundred and twenty feet well the nautical mile is divided into ten cables of six hundred feet each so say the reefs and shoals lay six hundred feet offshore and proteus was fetchedto eighteen hundred feet further out there was a break in the reef right between proteus and the beach and we could see the phosphoresence of the waves breaking on the reef and rocks high tide round midnight and we planned for that too dye see a much dimmer rim of phosphoresence where the waves rolled in on the sand twentyfour hundred feet from shore on a dark night ah ha macdougall crowed stopping to wet his quill in an inkpot before he began tramping a circle of his offices again sideways were you uh no lewrie told him feeling as if he was forced to chase his barrister round the office usually the noreast trades blow to the souwest but for the blue mountains and the shape of the coast so we had winds out of the east that night and to fetchto we had to place our bows into the nornoreast with the foreandaft sails forcin her forrud but the foretopsl laid aback tkeep her idlin in place and makin a slow sternway away from those shoals a person on the beach wouldve seen us close to bowson not abeam and you could not have gone any closer i take it macdougall asked juggling loose transcript pages the danger of the reef id suppose less than ten feet of water inshore of the reef as i recall from the chart lewrie answered and only twelve to fifteen feet of water to seaward of it even at high tide we fetchedto as soon as the leadline showed six fathoms proteus drew eighteen feet right aft so we had a safe margin with deeper water clear of hazards astern so an hour or so of drifting wouldnt set us on anything that could rip our hull open right along the reef twas three feet or less even at high tide so will you sit down sir or must i trot after you macdougall came to a full stop suddenly looking round his offices as if wondering why he was there and where was the nearest chair so your ship did not lie in profile to the shore macdougall pondered after hed settled himself once more in profile with her bows pointing west towards the cape or the point or whatever you god no lewrie hooted the shoreline swings in a great arc in portland bight he continued taking a welcome chair himself to the west of kingston is roughly easttowest then begins to jut south down to portland point the beauman plantation and cashmans are on the coast quite near the point uhm have you a pen and paper i may borrow ill draw you a rough sketch though a proper chart of the a chart macdougall cried of a sudden but of course you still have the chart you used that night aye lewrie told him puzzled by his attorneys enthusiasm wouldnt that chart still with his pencilled markings prove that he had premeditated the crime after all and he had to wonder why mr andrew macdougall esq burbled with laughter rocked on his chair and kicked his thick legs in seeming joy to lewrie macdougall looked about to pop like a haggis all swollen with steam and a poke with a sharptined fork would do him in one never throws away an accurate chart lewrie said hoping that macdougalls glee was a good sign theyre rather rare dye see certainly my sailing master mister winwood has his as well never throws anything away even pencil stubs he doesnt he was my sailing master in proteus and turnedover into savage while he may not need charts of the west indies for now im sure his charts are still aboard you must send it me yours and his at once sir macdougall urged swiping hair from his eyes again and about ready to leap from his chair and start that infernal pacing once more we must have him this winwood fellow too he was there that night oh capital well in fact twas mister winwood who took the most interest in the former slaves welfare and their spiritual improvement none had more than a smattering of knowledge of christianity before comin aboard lewrie related made more at ease by macdougalls elation denied the good news of christ macdougall scowled why by omission or calculated commission one wonders if told theyre equal in the lords sight might slaves begin to think and wonder why they are slaves and whether their own humanity is the equal of a masters perhaps is that common dye think captain lewrie as a means for their continued oppression it may vary from master to master sir lewrie said digging round the top of macdougalls desk to find a spare lead pencil paper and enough space in which to begin to draw some im told dont go much beyond one of saint paul s letters the one about slaves obey your masters hey mister winwood twas the one who helped them take new freemens names for ships books even used the usual hosingoff under the washdeck pump that newcome hands get as a sort of baptism hes low church lewrie had to caution halfway to leaping methodist mind such a character witness though mr macdougall mused with his arms about his chest rocking once again as if in transports of a heavenly rapture at a welsh revival meeting oh capital capital i shall swoon with joy swear i will to have him in the box what a scandal gainst the beaumans i could make macdougall stopped rocking turned grave and peered anxiously at lewrie charts maps where does one get them from admiralty they dont print their own lewrie told him happily drawing but there are plenty of printers who do sayer and bennett in fleet street are very good very uptodate if theyre still in business how large are they captain lewrie macdougall pressed oh bout three foot square most of em though it depends lewrie said intent on his depiction of the reef and beach harbour charts and their approaches might not be more than eighteen inches by eighteen some even smaller we must have one much larger macdougall petulantly declared a gigantic reproduction for all in the courtroom to be able to take in judge jury and most especially the audience ha ha they ah ever make charts that large doubt it lewrie replied looking up from his sketch itd be dear and he wondered will you be billing me for that hang the cost macdougall exclaimed leaping to his feet at last unable to contain his urgency which outburst made lewrie wince the reverend wilberforce will surely see the necessity cost is no object compared to true justice for you the former slaves and the cause of ultimate empirewide abolition yes captain lewrie i too support the cause of abolition macdougall quite proudly stated looking as if he was posing for an heroic portrait in this one instance i may not be quite the dry and objective lawyer who presents the most compelling argument in his clients best interests i am enthusiastic in court others tell me though not to my detriment nor to the interests of those who engage me and i have found that visual evidence is more compelling than dull yawninducing blather dye see the pictures worth a thousand words dye mean sir lewrie supposed aloud exactly my dear captain lewrie macdougall replied guffawing with great pleasure abandoning his stiff noble pose as quickly as a poster could be ripped from a tavern wall if the printers cannot reproduce your charts large enough perhaps a canvas as big as a bedsheet may serve and a journeyman artist or sign painter could draw it all in broad strokes something on which the jury may gaze as any false evidence is reiterated do the beaumans not bring their witnesses with them and depend upon a dry reading of their testimony from the jamaican transcript well theres confrontation standing mutely in the centre of the courtroom do they fetch em along and testify anew ill present your officers and that mister winwood in stark rebuttal or tear them to pieces when you put your question to em beg pardon captain lewrie when you question them yourself lewrie restated oh heavens no sir macdougall poohpoohed the prosecuting attorney puts questions to his witnesses to form a case then i as a defence attorney put our witnesses in the box to refute prosecutors under english common law cannot examine my witnesses or attestors nor may i examine his what i fear youve had little exposure to the law and courts captain lewrie macdougall said with one of those simpering little how ignorant of you laughs not til now no lewrie sarcastically replied and why that is god only knows the things ive got up to he thought a tick later well at least ill have no fear of scathing questions from whoever it is the beaumans hire as prosecutor he concluded with a resigned sigh uhm beg pardon again captain lewrie but macdougall said looking a bit sorry for his new client the accused only speaks upon his own behalf after the verdict is announced most usually in kings bench cases to plead for mercy transportation to australia stead of the new market gallows what lewrie gawped in alarm i just sit in the dock while everybody else gets tlie their arses off stay mum as a tailors dummy while that ah is the custom captain lewrie macdougall sadly informed him ah look at the time he cried as a mantel clock atop the fireplace chimed the hours i thought i was beginning to feel a tad peckish oh theres an hundred a thousand more matters which i must ask of you in the short time allotted us but i do believe we may repair to the most excellent chophouse quite nearby and take our midday meal i took the liberty of reserving private rooms where we and mister sadler who shall prove to be instrumental to the preparation of our presentation good fellow may dine i swear all you have related to me and what stir such has caused in my wits has made me famished shall we adjourn for the nonce captain lewrie sadler and his tapeworm lewrie morosely thought as he gathered up hat and sword in the outer parlour and you macdougall a dabhand trencherman yourself still a growin lad in need o stuffin hey good thing i brought a full purse tlondon cause i doubt any attorney treats or even go shares cant speak for myself my god but im bloody doomed chapter seven i really cant lewrie whinged once they were seated in the small but wellappointed private dining room not a word sorry macdougall tossed off intent on the handwritten days menu and wine list aha theyve fresh oysters up from sheerness and a dozen apiece sounds lovely dont you think sadler capital as you always say sir his clerk happily seconded their veals always toothsome hmm macdougall mused aloud perhaps only the brace of roast squab before the main course rhenish with that it goes without saying and i see theyve still a few dozen of the chateau lafites to go with the veal any favourites sir he asked lewrie anything else catch your fancy the lobster perhaps it is done to perfection here not all that hungry really lewrie replied ready to finger his purse to weigh what he had remaining for the way macdougall and his perpetually starved clerk were thinking this midday meal might cost as much as the wedding breakfast for langlie and sophie down in portsmouth soup salad perhaps the veal with some shore vegetables cant get fresh at sea nonsense macdougall said with a snort cant think cant plot on an empty stomach and weve a long afternoon ahead a waiter arrived took their orders and set out glasses and chargers silverware and napkins then reclosed the doors to scurry off not a tick later another waiter arrived with a bottle of that grand st emilion bordeaux for them to sample then disappeared just as softly as the first now sir macdougall said along with the transcript of your fraudulent trial and the utter uselessness of your putative counsel dredged up from a kingston tavern your friend mister james peel of the foreign office provided me with some even more intriguing information most particularly the makeup of the jury that convicted you macdougall seemed to preen and like most people with a secret that you did not yet know withheld his news with a most smug smile and pray what is that mister macdougall lewrie enquired fighting down his urge to grab the lout by the lapels and give him a brisk shaking why do i always run into the beg me to tell you type lewrie cynically asked himself it was hard enough to tolerate it when it came from peel or peels former superior the archly inscrutable zachariah twigg but by god he didnt have to take it from a civilian peel provided me with the entire list sir macdougall preened a bit more tapping his noggin sagaciously and their backgrounds and connexions to the beaumans while i did not bring it with me and cannot cite you chapter and verse from memory i can relate a few of the most suspicious your jury consisted of a dozen local gentlemen though what constitutes a gentleman on jamaica is rather a broader definition than that which obtains in the british isles macdougall halfwhispered as he leaned a bit closer one for instance was a captain of a slaving ship a ship husbanded by several rich planters the beaumans and their close kin principally one gentleman was editor and part owner of a kingston newspaper the other owner being hugh beauman aye lewrie grimly interrupted for he and his friend christopher cashman had both suffered that papers attentions both before and after the duel a damned lyin rag the jury even included tradesmen an importer and chandler who sells shoddy and castoffs with which to feed and clothe slaves macdougall grimly intoned and an overseer a slave driver from one of the sellers familys plantations hey the sellers lewrie spat more beauman kin and a captain sellers was the one i and the judges at that duel had to shoot down more reason for the overseer and another from that family to be disqualified macdougall said in an outraged huff the rest of the panel consisted of slaveowning planters all of whom mister peel pointed out to me in his affidavit most suspiciously selected from the immediate neighbourhood of the beaumans main plantings and supplied us with their bonds of long affinity direct or indirect kinship and ties to business interests or indebtedness most carefully delineated a sham from start to finish sir sadler stuck in i would not have thought such a travesty of justice possible in our more enlightened times mr macdougall gravelled with a derisive snort without the active collusion of the court itself but quite happily for your cause captain lewrie your friend peels attestations were all done on paper bearing the letterhead of lord balcarres the islands governorgeneral lending the imprimatur the guinea stamp of official interest and disapproval by the local representative of hm government and his own affidavit was witnessed by the secretary to lord balcarres to boot ha ha nothing from lord balcarres though mr sadler was quick to add taking the edge off lewries joy but the reverend wilberforce and his patrons in the house of lords have written him requesting he delve into the matter and hopefully return a denouncement of the doors to their private dining room opened and in came the rolls three bowls of cockaleekie soup the chophouse must have had macdougalls scottish tastes graven in stone by then and a round ball of butter the size of a mans fist and it was a closerun thing as to who scored the first roll sadler or macdougall with another contest to see who could usurp the freshsweating butter the soup deserved a glass of rhenish each no need for a full bottle really a second glass to accompany the salad of fresh greens drizzled with oil and vinegar and hang it fetch a whole bottle of rhenish to accompany the pair of squabs that each of them ended up ordering and when the plates of oysters arriveda dozen for eachwhy they were so succulent that to forego a bottle of portuguese sparkling wine to sluice them down and cut the edge of the horseradish sauce would be a mortal sin and of course the roast veal the seasoned fried potato quarters and asparagus demanded that rare chateau lafite laid down long before the war supposedly and not smuggled from the south of revolutionary france last month so delightful on the palate that two more bottles were necessary dessert was apple dowdy and ginger snaps and macdougall swore that the very best thing with hot sweet apple dowdy would be a light sweet canarya single glass no more thankee jesus coffee for three macdougall asked once all that repast had finally disappeared clear heads for the afternoons doings what he jovially suggested swiping hair from his shiny forehead dabbing a fine sheen from his cheeks and a last flick of apple dowdy from his lips it is my custom to save the nuts fruit and port for supper worse things happen at sea lewrie commented feeling a bit glassyeyed by that point and his belly constricted like a vise by the waistband of his breeches the doors closed as a waiter went for cups new spoons and a coffee service once gone macdougall leaned over all chummylike and more than a bit pieeyed himself to simper at lewrie for a moment and snicker whilst he stared holes in lewries direction aye sir lewrie at last had to ask believing that if the man kept eying him so intently hed fall out of his chair saved the very best for last captain lewrie macdougall said touching a finger to his lips as if to shush everyone your former leftenantcolonel christopher cashman the fellow who as you say instigated the plan for your dozen slaves to flee their masters and volunteer board your frigate your mister peel has found himl kit lewrie whooped rather loud for conspiratoral whispers but given the circumstances and the load hed taken aboard could be forgiven this once in utter astonishment found him dye say ive been tryin the most of two years whered he light sir the reason none of your letters ever caught up with him was due to his peripatetic rambles captain lewrie macdougall chuckled from what mister peel wrote colonel cashman first tried charleston south carolina wandered down to savannah georgia looked over commercial prospects as far north as the chesapeake bay before settling in wilmington north carolina requests to various british consuls finally found a mention of a business firm in wilmington by the name of seabright amp cashman a further request determined that the fellow partnered in that firm was indeed one christopher cashman english as roast beef and formerly of jamaica ha ha the old rascal lewrie chortled with glee wondering if his old friend had gotten at least one of his letters begging kit to hunt down guillaume choundas then in american custody after capture by a monstrous yankee frigate in the west indies and murder him by fair means or foul to save britain future troubles should the man get free of his parole and return to french service that and to save his bastard halflewrie halfcherokee son desmond mcgilliveray from murder should choundas ever discover that the promising lad was his must write the boy lewrie blearily reminded himself see what hes up to first thing tomorrow a promise hed made and remade monthly since departing the caribbean sawmills pitch tar and turpentine macdougall related pausing to belch then quickly excuse himself import and export and ricemills iron forging land speculation that sort of thing i must write him at once lewrie vowed cringing to admit that young desmond would be taking long straws for a bit longer but at the moment saving his own neck by getting corroboration from kit was more important do you have the address but of course just send it care of seabright amp cashman wilmington cant have grown so big as when i was there during the revolution peels written him macdougall countered leaning back into his chair with an ominous creaking noise of tortured joinings just two months ago as he said in his last letter to me and twill take two months more or better to get a first reply then another period of time for either peel or cashman to contact me do i have a certified declaration from your old friend to present in court i may prove beyond all question that you are most definitely not guilty of theft though he added after a deep breath and taking a second to run his tongue round the inside of his mouth mostlike looking for a last crumb or morsel you could still face the risk of new charges of unlawful conversion but not theft or robbery conversion lewrie frowned never having heard the term of being the person who received the stolen goods then used them for his own purposes mr sadler softly supplied from the other side of the table might as well say that king george converted em then lewrie sneered for hes the one whos gotten service from em hmm scribble that down will you mister sadler lest we forget it macdougall said with a giggle and an inspired expression a ludicrous argument but not completely implausible they are his majestys sailors are they not ha ha no matter the attorney suddenly sobered though with a bit of visible difficulty that your friend cashman is now a citizen of the united states of america and the state of north carolina not a subject of the crown and beyond the reach of british law unless and until he voluntarily returns to great britain or any british colony or possession so he would run absolutely no risk were he to supply us with an affidavit stating his role in the matter we must keep our fingers crossed well of course he would lewrie countered once you write him and suggest it hed be ah but i may not captain lewrie macdougall interrupted as he put on his stern and formal pose for a noble picture phyz for me to elicit testimony which i know to be fraudulent would go against the grain with me i will do all i can for you but to suggest to a witness that he cut his cloth to suit my purposes would be to suborn perjury and that would be dishonourable to the profession of the law and would redound to my complete discredit besides macdougall said with a lopsided cherubs grin we have so much perjury obfuscation and collusion done by the beaumans already that any jury in the land may smell the rot whilst we on the other hand must be above all that and appear as pure as caesars wife along with our usual antics sir sadler mystifyingly added stifling a chuckle of his own with his napkin goes without saying mister sadler indeed ha ha macdougall chearly replied guffawing right out loud so does cashman send us an affidavit whatyecallem lewrie asked too fuddled to pay much attention to that cryptic statement sayin that twas he who roused the slaves to run and arranged for me tbe there to collect em i dont get scragged my dear captain lewrie macdougall smugly assured him by the time im done youll be chaired and cheered through the streets and twill be the beaumans wholl be lucky to get aboard a ship back to jamaica with clothes on their backs a step ahead of captain tom of the mob well if youre sure lewrie pondered certain as tomorrows sunrise sir macdougall vowed then both he and sadler turned their gazes on him just as a waiter fetched them their coffee milk sugar cups and spoons the waiter carried the reckoning scribbled on a quarterpage of foolscap as well which he withdrew from a chest pocket of his traditional blue apron sadler and macdougall both put their heads down as the waiter poured coffee for them and got grossly intent upon the sugaring and the milking of their beverages paying the waiter no mind christ lewrie sarcastically thought my bloody treat sure the waiter obviously a fellow very familiar with the ways of the barrister and his clerk made but a small sly nod and turned his attention to lewrie coughed into his fist as if to prompt lewrie and plastered a benign but expectant smile on his face oh give it me lewrie resignedly said pulling his leather purse from his snug breeches pocket mine arse on a handbox could buy a blooded hunter at these prices he groaned inwardly regretting that he and caroline had made up their minds to settle a dot of an hundred pounds a year on young sophie to match the hundred that langlies parents had settled on him a trip to coutts bank would be in order soonest to replenish before returning to his expensive lodgings that evening else hed not be able to pay that reckoning either well after coffee well retire to my lodgings macdougall suggested once the waiter was gone a hard afternoons work then supper i know a wonderful new establishment near the change sir i don t feed him proper lend up swinginin the breeze alan lewrie cynically wondered but of course he had to say and grin as he did it that sounds simply delightful i am completely in your hands chapter eight it was a passingfair day for a wedding rain had poured down in buckets the early evening prior just about the time that lewrie had returned to portsmouth in the diligence coach slithering down the road from portdown hill thankfully though the rain had eased off to misty light showers round midnight and had quit in the early hours of the dawn just afore first sparrow fart by proper sunrise the skies had mostly cleared displaying patches of lightercoloured clouds through which the sun broke now and again the town and the seaport smelled freshlaundered without the usual accumulated reeks horse dung and ordure had been flushed away for a little while anyway and the street cobbles and narrow brick sidewalks bore a damp sheen with here and there puddles some rather large but shallow that acted like mirrors to the nowbenign sky lt urquhart who had never met langlie volunteered to remain aboard along with the newcome midshipmen to keep an eye on the ship whilst savages commission sea officers marine lieutenant devereux and mr winwood the sailing master along with mr midshipman grace accompanied lewrie ashore in the ships boats buffed up polished brushed down and clad in their best uniforms for a rather rare once except for sunday divisions they had even bathed closely shaved and gotten their hair trimmed and combed into presentable order caroline had insisted upon the services being held at the church of st thomas abecket s that grand and prominent portsmouth landmark if hoary old st georges in their home village of anglesgreen was not convenient to langlies family who lived in kent and if langlie could not get free of his new ship long enough during her own fittingout and if a london parish church was equally inconvenient then st thomas abeckets it would be and hang the cost she had determinedly insisted rather strongly in point of fact turned as chilly as a greenland blizzard highnosed and imperious and playing upon her husbands guilt like a master violinist hadnt lewrie made a pile of tin off creole pirate silver his prizemoney from the mediterranean as well been freed by the prizecourts at long last so what is money for if not to spend on such an occasion dear she had pouted lewrie and his wellgroomed party shambled into the appointed inn the blue posts to meet up with the groom and his party and there langlie was dressed in a spankingnew uniform with the single bright gold epaulet upon his left shoulder his shirt waistcoat and breeches as white as snow his hessian boots newblacked and his long and curly dark hair brushed back with a dab or two of pomade to keep it in good order and a mere sprig of a queue at the back of his neck and uniform coat collar in the new style and looking as fretful and nervous as a treed cat even if his two lieutenants and four midshipmen off the brigsloop hms orpheus were gently joshing him at the moment captain lewrie sir langlie exclaimed fleaquick to cross the room and offer his hand stead of waiting to receive that honour commander langlie lewrie replied in like manner taking that offered hand and giving it a warm shake ye look well in your new rank and both welldeserved and about time too sir lewrie said in normal tones then leaned closer to whisper but about as nervous as a feagued horse marriagell do that or so im told though more gladsome anticipation than fret sir langlie admitted in equally guarded voice beaming fit to bust may i make you known to my parents sir my sister and my officers and mids be delighted lewrie happily agreed it had come as rather a surprise when lt langlie had spoken to his captain just days after his commission and orders had come down from admiralty hemming and hawing coughing into his fist and turning as red as rare beef to formally ask lewrie for his wards sophie de maubeuges hand in marriage oh lewrie had long ago given both of them permission to write each other but then sophie and caroline had gone all wroth with each other and sophie had fled to london to live with his father sir hugo st george willoughby and had been for sir hugo and his unsavoury repute introduced into london society lewrie had figured that the girl surely had struck upon another by then one with richer estate and prospects perhaps who would not turn his nose up at a penniless foreign girl with but a mediocre paraphernalia to bring to the marriage and but a miserly dot of annual support no matter how radiantly fetching and lovely how wellschooled in social graces but it seemed that absence makes the heart grow fonder lewrie could almost understand it when hed first met her at toulon in sophie and her firebrand brother and woeful mother had been living with an equally impoverished cousin baron charles auguste de crillart one of those royalist french naval officers hounded from the service during the terror and ejected from his seat in the peoples assembly for being too damned reasonable and moderate stances both highly suspect and rare in those bloody days sophie had evinced all the signs of being in teenaged creampot love with her older cousin in defending the hundreds of refugees of the fall of toulon de crillart had sacrificed his life and poor wee sophie had lost her brother in the final boarding of the lone french corvette that had caught up with their weary old halfarmed frigate as well to make things even more grievous a last broadside from the corvette had smashed in the stern down low slaughtering her mother to boot and sophie would have had no one to look after her if not for lewrie honouring his pledge to the dying charles de crillart to see to his kinfolk lewrie and caroline had been her saviours caroline in the beginning with her wholehearted charity and lewrie streaked with their common foes blood smudged with spent gunpowder hatless and a sword in his hand at the end of that battle the battle that resulted in the corvette becoming hms jester lewries first wartime command did i seem a replacement for poor charles lewrie took time to maunder was an officer from someones navy sophies destiny he gave himself a mental shake plastering a smile upon his phyz for the introductions mr anthony langlie senior was a squirearchy gentlemanfarmer of good appearance an equal to his sons handsomeness well dressed and obviously a man of some means whose lands acres in freeholdlay close by to horsham mrs langlie made just as impressive an appearance not the typical country dumpling he expected still a quite fetching and tastefully dressed lady in her fourties the langlies were the sort of educated and polished couple one might meet in a fashionable drawing room in london yet not so grand and highnosed if they were to be inlaw kin lewrie could contemplate future time ith them might present him with conversation that did not consist solely of sheep husbandry and how the apple crop was doing admittedly the langlies did eye him in a fashion that lewrie could only deem chary no matter the good reports they had of him through their son during his service as first lieutenant aboard proteus there were those many articles in the newspapers some hints of infamy the taints of the tar brush and all well then mister langlie sir mistress langlie maam quite delighted to meet you at last lewrie said after the requisite bows and hand clasps and pledges of yer servant and such after a threeyear commission with your son i feel deeply honoured for him to become my soninlaw for theres no finer officer in the navy to my lights nor a finer gentleman didnt exactly realise the depths of their feelings for each other the drudgery of duty and all that that theyd sent each other miniature portraits and such til he asked for sophies hand theyll make a grand couple let me assure you and youll be getting a sweet and honest daughterinlaw good in the pantry stillroom at housewifery my wife caroline has seen to that like shakinfins with a shark theyre thinkin lewrie could conjure as they simpered polite agreement with him or marryin into a tribe o headhuntin cannibals from the great south seas lewrie was introduced to langlies officers and midshipmen and got a much better almost heroworshipping reception from them young mids especially who all but goggled and gulped as if being presented to nelson for all theyd heard of his derringdo lewrie made the introductions of his own officers and the mids off orpheus looked upon those worthies heroes in their own right during the fight that had taken the french frigate l uranie after nigh i a twohour battle in the middle of a raging gale much the same langlies midshipmen in awe of the saltiness of mr grace even though he had come up from the nore fisheries and was several grades of gentility below their own typical squirearchy or loworder nobility backgrounds ah hmm langlie quibbled looking at his pocketwatch ah indeed sir lewrie agreed looking at his own i fear that im due away to the george to collect the bridal party you will excuse me mister langlie maam and i will see you all at the church quite soon mister adair aye sir his second officer piped up coffee or tea only do you please or my wife will kill me lewrie cautioned keep em somewhat sober mister whitney langlie also said in like vein to his first officer aye aye sir and for a brief shared moment of inner amusement lewrie and langlie looked each other in the eye taut grins breaking out on both their faces and nodding winking on lewries part in recognition of the fact that both of them postcaptain or newminted commander were in command of kings ships and were mature leaders of men moulded ye langlie damned if i didnt lewrie could think as he took his leave though i had better than good material to work with youre on yer own bottom now in more ways than one and god help the french sophie excepted ocourse chapter nine at the grander george inn where the wedding breakfast would be held lewrie spoke with the owner took a peek into the private dining rooms already laid for the celebration then trotted abovestairs to his familys lodgings ah there ye are at long last his father majorgeneral sir hugo st george willoughby grumbled as he entered their rooms father lewrie answered heading for the bedrooms id not dare go in there at the moment me lad his father cautioned a massive bout of the vapours alls not quite tiddly and i heard voices raised in high dudgeon not a minute past brandy sir hugo laconically offered lifting a squat bottle to him ah no thankee lewrie demurred not before the ceremonys doned be best theyre in a pet at loggerheads or at one time caroline had been all christian sympathy and welcoming doting stepmother to sophie when shed first arrived from gibraltar but once those anonymous you must know of your husbands doings letters had come and kept coming and had suggested that he and sophie had been lovers caroline had turned spiteful on the girl which was why sophie had fled anglesgreen in tears of betrayed trust and ended up with lewries father the most unimaginable port in the storm for sir hugo was known far and wide as an infamous lecher and beardsplitting rakehell it was carolines duty to stand in lieu of her real mother at such a time as sophies wedding and to every outward sign she was fulfilling that role but what she actually thought was anyones guess lewrie took a dithering step closer to the bedrooms suit yourself sir hugo said with a sigh as he leaned back in his chair and crossed one kneebooted leg over the other tis not a shrieking pet thankee jesus lastminute wheres me pearl dropsi gathera general bout of the fantods womens nerves he scoffed so now youve met the langlies what was your impression not the chawbacon countryputs i expected lewrie said as he made the wise decision to seat himself at the table with his father so gracious and straightforward the frenchd call em suave i do imagine do we dine em in back home theyll even eat with knives and forks as mannerly as kiss my hand and did they goggle when they clapped eyes on you sir hugo asked with a snicker like greetin a crocodile aye lewrie told him chuckling in spite of his own twangy nerves hed not had that much experience at getting people married off could barely recall his own and getting anthony langlie and sophie de maubeuge longspliced was as demanding a proposition as arming rigging and commissioning a warship and as pleasing an occasion as it was it took time away from seeing to that proper commissioning of hms savage kept him pent ashore whilst awaiting the beaumans arrival was a day stolen from possible escape on the kings business once savage was able to sail well wont be a patch on what the langlies think when they clap eyes on me haw haw sir hugo said with an evil little smile youll do nothing to spoil the lewrie fretted hed seen his father in action before his eyes glittered something satanic i will simply be my usual self sir hugo archly replied god help us then lewrie muttered under his breath for his corinthian sire despite his sterling success in the field in indian army service the nabobs pile of plunder hed fetched home and his longago knighthood for bravery during the seven years war to scrub the smuts off his repute among the better sorts had been a member of lord sandwichs hellfire club in his early days and had whored and rantipoled with the strumpets and bareback riders in the undercroft cells of medmenham abbey before the club had been exposed and broken up indeed so eager a member was he that after a night or two of swilling gorging and putting the leg over sir hugo had been one of the few orgyasts who rose sunday morning to attend the divine services that lord sandwich in dominee ditto attire preached against fornication and other deadly sins mostly to the hundreds of farm cats that his labourers would herd into the church to improve their own amoral natures and despite the good service sir hugo had rendered the crown in the field during the nore mutiny at sheerness people would gossip and goggle him women gasp behind their fans whether in disgust or carnal curiosity it was sometimes hard to tell men cut him direct or displayed taut grins of envy to this very day for once a rogue always a rogue an unsavable sinner bound to hell on the fast coach or the man one might like to spend an evening with just to pick up some pointers least hes turned out proper lewrie told himself as he turned a leery eye on his father damme if he aint sober too mostly to match the uniformed naval members of the wedding sir hugo had donned his very best army uniform a smartly tailored red coat all adrip with gilt lace and gilded chain gimp lace and gilt buttons up the sleeves above the blue cuffs blue facings and collar with giltoutlined button holes atop a scarlet waistsash and breeches shirt and waistcoat as white as snow there was also the star of the order of the garter and the crosschest sash that went with it sitting on the table between them was a cocked hat the size of a watermelon just as laced with gold trim and gilt cords as his coat and a goldbound black silk cockade on its lefthand forward face at his hip the sly old rogue sported not the usual hundredguinea straight smallsword like everyone else but a moghul tulwar reputedly one he had taken off the corpse of a rajput rajah whom hed chopped to chautney sauce it was a short sabre with a shiny damascene blade but so studded with pearls emeralds and rubies that it was worth a rajahs ransom in its own right and lewrie hadnt seen a gaudier one in zachariah twiggs vast collection at spyglass bungalow when hed been forced to ride up to consult the old cutthroat a year before gilt hilt and handguard an engraved and goldinlaid blade sheathed in a brightsteel scabbard with gold not gilt throat and drag with even more inlays engravings and inset gems pretty as it was it was no toy and was as keenedged and dangerous as a barbers razor and of course sir hugo also sported a tightcurled white peruke with short queue for his own hair was mostly a thing of the past and his nighbare pate was now agespotted all in all did one meet him on a daytime street and be unaware of his scurrilous nature one might be mightily impressed almost to the point of gambling with him or loaning him money there came the thuds of travelling chests being shut a light patter of softsoled shoes then the bedroom door was flung open and caroline emerged followed not a tick later by the bride and a brace of maidservants one a stout and redfaced country girl from anglesgreen who did for his wife and a slimmer darker but just as shinyfaced and beaming maidservant whom sophie had engaged in london all cooing and twittering at the joy of the occasion and how splendidly the bride had been arrayed how radiant she was at that instant sophie sophie sophie lewrie commented as he and sir hugo got to their feet give ye joy of the day my dear and allow me to say how absolutely lovely ye are merci thank you captain lewrie sophie replied shinyeyed as if about to burst out in tears of sheer delight or tears of lastminute qualms breathtakin ye are dear girl sir hugo added pretty as a picture this langlie fellows a fortunate dog damned if he aint merci grandpere merci beaucoup she said to him for she had always been closest to the old roue depending on him to learn how to adjust to being british she gave him a twinkling smile and bowed a graceful curtsy to punctuate her gratitude for the compliment along with his years of amusing aid and caroline lewrie dared venture for despite the giddy air coming from the bridetobe and the maids his wife sported that worrisome furrow twixt her brows how utterly splendid and lovely you look this day as well smashin why thankee husband caroline replied dipping him a curtsy as fine as sophies and sounding pleased with a sketch of a smile on her face does she still suspect sophie and glad tbe shot ofher indeed both of them were a picture sophie with her reddish auburn hair and bright green eyes had chosen a bridal gown of aquamarine satin with the puffy upper sleeves and skintight lower sleeves that were now in fashion highwaisted and squarecut at the bodice all ruched and awash in white lace her hair was done up under a fetching matching bonnet with fake flowers fruit and ribbons bound under her chin by more ribbon in sophies travelling chest lay more gowns for the coach trip to where theyd honeymoon for their first supper together as a couple dainties for morningafter lounging more gowns for enlightening tours of whatever was famous where they were going and surely some even daintier bed gowns to entice her new husband into starting a naval dynasty no wonder carolines fashed lewrie understood shes spent a month slavedrivin seamstresses an milliners and payin out a years farm rent on the girl caroline had chosen a soberer gown of dark blue satin with matching bonnet trimmed in gilt lace hers was in much the same highwaisted and lowcut style but with wide shawllike pleats over both of her shoulders mores the pity damn trepidation lewrie told himself going to take hands with both of them bestowing a chaste kiss on sophies cheek then another upon his wifes both of you are as lovely as the occasion merits he reiterated and sophie squeezed his hand in shy thanks there was though a slight shying away from his kiss on carolines part a faint stiffening of her spine and limpness to her hand she all but uttered a resigned sigh sure sign of a whole gale to come when she and lewrie were alone but over what he tried to puzzle some reconciliation and theres my children lewrie exclaimed taking the arrival of his sons and his daughter as a convenient excuse to break free and shove what dread he had of his wifes iciness down to his orlop for later much later could he manage it sewallis his firstborn was now thirteen a lean and primmish lad just entering that awkward time twixt childhood and maturity though he had always been too sobersided for lewrie to fathom exactly why his suitings were dark grey ditto as stark as a parson hugh his middle child and everrambunctious imp was now ten and more flambouyant dressed in a blue coat and buff waistcoat and newfangled trousers booted not shod and though caroline had spent a fair amount of time getting them spruced up and warning them both to behave hugh already looked mussed with his blonder hair in his eyes and his neckstock come halfway undone little charlotte well at seven she was definitely made in her mothers spitting image her long light brown hair controlled by a pale blue bonnet and ribbons dressed adultlike in a pale blue gown very much like carolines her amber eyes glowed as her gaze devoured every detail of sophies ensemble mesmerised by a reallife bride lewrie shook hands with the boys knelt to give charlotte a hug and gave them all a congratulating jape or compliment naval service had spaced their births so far apart that and the use of cundums after sewalliss birth in the bahamas in hed been off on patrol duties for the most part as far south as the turks amp caicos for months on end so hugh had not been quickened til the early months of in alacritys greatcabins and hangingcot to be truthful and born just after hed paid off taken halfpay and rented their house and lands from carolines uncle phineas chiswick in anglesgreen where he had spent the most miserable years of his life as a knownothing gentlemanfarmer of whom it was said that he knew how to raise his hat but little else a useless drone and hangeron to his much cleverer wife who had grown up with a bountiful knowledge of agriculture from her childhood in the cape fear region of north carolina it was a wonder to lewrie so bored had he been in those days that for want of anything better to do there werent more children but after charlottes birth and caroline had survived the perils of childbed fever she had suggested that three was enough and wished him to obtain cundums so much to do on the farm in the stillroom and truck gardens the flower beds and decorative plantings care for the children already born their mutual joy of horseback riding the annual bills of mortality listed most deaths for young women as childbed fever which usually took the infant too they had already birthed sewallis as heir hugh to go army navy or take holy orders and a lovely daughter and they seemed to thrive thank god and might live to adulthood and have children of their own someday so why take the risk and lewrie had been so much in love with caroline in those days and so loath to risk her life so selfish to keep him with her for all the years the lord gave them and selfish to keep her the slim tempting lass whod come to their marriage bed too that he had been more than willing to go along with her wishes his only worry had been how he could portray ignorance of what cundums did and where they might be obtained charlotte lewrie supposed was a happy accident the result of an unguarded night as the stormclouds of the french revolution and the terror loomed the nootka sound incident twixt spain and england in faroff northwestern north america in his temporary recall to the colours then the sureness of war coming with france too after the revolutionaries had beheaded king louis and queen marie antoinette after the war did erupt in february of lewrie doubted if he had been home with caroline more than five months altogether in the past seven years he could step back and admire his wellgroomed well there was hugh and wellbehaved properly educated children well there also was hughs boisterousness and charlottes penchant for blurting out whatever thought crossed her wee mind usually at the worst possible moment and call himself fortunate he could take pride and visual pleasure in caroline too for she had not battened or thickened into the typical country housewife and matron were the lines on her face more noticeable they were not as prominent as those of women her age and they were mostly laugh lines and crowsfeet round her usually merry eyes her hair was yet glossy her amber brown eyes bright her form straight and slim im judgin her like a fox hound lewrie chid himself ready to see how even she trots thirtysevens not that old after all me or her why cant we i pray one of you gentlemen has confirmed that the coaches we contracted are arrived she rather vexedly enquired more than ready to believe that her husband or fatherinlaw had forgotten that detail waiting at the kerb as i came up dear lewrie was glad to be able to tell her saw to it sir hugo drawled as he tossed back the last dregs of his fortifying brandy and tucked his ornate cocked hat under his arm that worthy looked as if he needed fortifying for with lewrie slaving away like a trojan to fit out his new frigate it had fallen to him to be the gobetween the hewer of wood and the drawer of water to supply what the women needed from london the fetcher and carrier and guide to the better shops when caroline and sophie came up to the city and thered been little love lost twixt caroline and sir hugo since hed come back from india and just popped up as a land owner and immediate neighbour to their rented lands to caroline sir hugo was if not satan himself then one of his unsavoury minions and ever the slightly shameful burden to be borne grandpere sophie prompted with a twinkle of course ma cherie sir hugo replied with a wide smile and offered his free arm to her to escort her downstairs to the coaches children next lewrie ordered sewallis see to your sister caroline and me last well debark at the church in the reverse order first in last out like an admiral hey youre to give her away father he got a firm nod from both sophie and sir hugo he could understand that his father had ever been charming and delightfully droll erudite and surprisingly patient with sophie as she made her adjustments to english country living besides his fathers french was infinitely better than carolines hed played the dutch uncle to the girl ever since his arrival and had kept her chastely amused of all lewries household sophie surprisingly had adored the old rogue the very fondest lewrie offered his own arm to caroline and she laid hers atop it lightly so very lightly as if averse buggery buggery and buggery lewrie thought irked whats the bloody trouble now you did not ask of mother nor uncle phineas caroline said in a whisper as they trooped in rough order towards the door nor did you ask why governour and millicent are not here well in the excitement of the occasion i spose i didnt he whispered back governour i may assume thinks me a traitor for spiriting away my black sailors undermining slavery worldwide mother charlotte will not see midsummers day caroline told him her whisper turning harsher and cannot travel yes governour will not attend any event where you are also present and forbade millicent to come as well i know you have no love for uncle phineas nor he for you burgess in london last i heard lewrie responded carefully beguiled by you to purchase colours in a british regiment and risk his life all over again no matter the perils he faced in india she accused hes done enough god save us hes done his duty entirely his desire caroline i did not beguile him he also wishes to wed id think youd be happy for him lewrie said wed some trull of your acquaintance pah caroline spat as vehemently as she could get away with as they descended the stairs to the entry hall to the smiles and bows of the servitors and innkeeper for them at least his wife plastered on a serene and happy smile family lewrie scoffed to himself aint they so much fun chapter ten very few people stopped to ogle as the parade of coaches drew up to the entry of saint thomas abeckets for in these wartime days one more naval wedding was twoapenny perhaps a few wives whose husbands were away overseas paused and smiled in reverie or bitterness maybe a bachelor officer or sailor perhaps an idle civilian lecher or two stopped just long enough to leer at the bride as she emerged and was handed down grinning to themselves and wishing to be in the grooms boots that night langlies second officer his name escaped lewrie entirely put out his spanish cigaro beneath his shoe then came to hold the doors to the church for them and doff his hat in salute inside one of langlies midshipmen ushered them down the aisle to the lefthand pew boxes in the front whilst sir hugo spoke with a curate then led sophie to a private room outside the nave where shed wait til the music began once seated lewrie checked breast pockets of his uniform coat for the sheaf of foldedover letters he carried notice from their own church st georges in anglesgreen attesting that the banns had been read three times the rectors fee for the ceremony the fees for the organist and bellowsman the bellringers and small gratuities for the crucifer and acolytes he looked across the aisle to the grooms side and found mr anthony langlie senior fidgetting with a thinner stack of letters as well and they shared a smile together for all his time passing through portsmouth it was the first time lewrie had actually been in st thomas abeckets so he simply had to crane his neck and take in all its splendours the decor of the ceilings nave apse ambo and high pulpit the carvings of its columns and the intricacies of the stainedglass windows most so nautical in nature to match the famous golden galleon atop the spire outside such a wee wedding party in such a large edifice nigh echoing empty with so few relatives or neighbours able to attend counting acolytes musicians even dustmen there werent above two dozen folk present behind the immediate family on the langlie side there was no one except officers midshipmen and a few sailors off hms orpheus pardons pardons by your leave someone whispered behind them and lewrie turned his head to discover that burgess chiswick had managed to make it down from london after all he slid into the pew box just behind their full one making caroline all but squeal with open delight coach was late sorry can you feature a dilly that runs behind hallo alan oh sister youre looking splendid just did find lodgings at the black spread eagle and freshen up first burgess no longer wore east india company uniform but was most nattily attired in a snug doublebreasted tailcoat of bottle green a sedate but shimmery fabric that lewrie didnt recognise equally snug grey trousers and topboots with a newfangled cravat that completely hid whatever sort of shirt he wore maybe thatll mollify her lewrie hopefully thought how do things go in london lewrie asked whispering softer than before wont be a grand regiment but it looks as if i may purchase a majority for a reasonable sum burgess whispered back sounding as if he was chortling all the same armys not doing much at present so horse guards is a buyers market and i met the trencher family aha lewrie congratulated much too loud for the occasion joined the abolitionist society sent my carte de visite up and finally wangled an invitation and youre right alan theodoras damnedscuse me nearly perfect thankee for the suggestion well lewrie said come over all modest swivelling so he could face burgess and see his eager smile but christ almightyhe gawped what the bloody hell are they doin here for there a couple of pew boxes astern of those where men off savage impatiently sat were mr sadler from his barristers office a bird of ill omen to be certain and in the same box with him mr zachariah twigg the devious coldblooded murderous arrogant and duplicitous haughty old master spy who had bedeviled lewries very existence since their first encounter in in the far east lewries jaw dropped open and he could feel the blood drain from his face to which struckdumb expression the cadaverouslooking twigg responded with a grim nod a flex of his spidery fingers on top of his silver walkingstick handle which rested between his knees and then did the very worst thing for lewries equanimity that cruel visage so usually set in thinlipped asperity and highnosed disdain for the world in general and sometimes for lewrie in the particular twisted up into a rictus of a sly smile the sort of smile lewrie might conjure that would appear upon a starving tiger or a nettled cobra just before the leap strike or spit in lewries harshly won experience with the man over the years nothing good had ever come of a smiling zachariah twigg there came a wheezing sound from the organ bellows the ringing of the bells in the steeple and loft giving lewrie a welcome excuse to snap back front and pass a hand over his ashen face whatever is the matter lewrie caroline raspwhispered inclining her head towards him as if meaning to share both prayer book and hymnal with him but with a fierce look normally reserved for any misbehaving children actupnowandipromisethatyouwillpay too much was invested in time and money in prestige and decorum in frets and labour on her part to let anyone spoil this wedding it was hers as much as it was sophies by god and the person who ruins it will get drawn and quartered by the horses of the bridal coach er uhm nothing my dear lewrie muttered as the organ music drew them to their feet awaiting the brides entrance on the arm of the splendidly turnedout sir hugo surprise i must own to see an old companion attending i will introduce you later love hmmf was her comment on that sure that whoever it was was he a companion of his he must be a fellow sinner and adulterer hence not worth an introduction lewrie he silently groaned to himself she called me lewrie have we come to that like all tother fedupwiththebastard wives do whatever happened to alan or dearor oh right all that happened why was sadler here less the news from the courts was dire why would twigg attend and how bad could his news turn out to be as well sadly lewrie was certain hed discover the whys not a second after the happy couple coached off into wedded bliss chapter eleven the ceremony went well as did the new couples departure with both ships officers and midshipmen forming an arch of bared swords or dirks though forcing commander and mrs langlie to duck when they got to the shorter midshipmen whose arms and shorter dirks threatened hats shoulders and noses once at the george inn the wine began to flow almost from the instant that hats swords dirks and walkingsticks were deposited with the doorkeeper people still sober enough to read the place cards got themselves sorted out and took their seats with some of the men principally zachariah twigg sir hugo and mr sadler heading straight for the sideboard and its restorative brandy bottle lewrie wished he could do the same but he still had host duties the requisite speech to make in praise of langlie and sophie toasts to propose and his wife to puzzle out for though she appeared gay and chirpy he could recognise the secret signs that caroline was missish over something too there were the children to keep an eye on and there were sadler and twigg to avoid til the last minute like rosied plague carriers or peeling lepers a lovely setting for the ceremony what captain lewrie mr langlie the elder remarked with a glass of wine in his hand my missus quite relished it a most pleasing compromise location in all oh absolutely sir lewrie agreed why in all my years of passing through portsmouth i cannot actually recall my being inside of saint thomas abeckets before a most impressive place indeed langlie slightly cocked an eyebrow over that statement keeping a mostly serene expression though implying i dare say your sort would have not anyway or so lewrie deduced he refusedto cringe your father sir hugo langlie continued lewrie managed not to wince as that name was mentioned as was his usual wont a most ah colourful character or so i have heard colourful aint the half of it mister langlie there came a faint guffaw from over mr langlies left shoulder as sir hugo came to join them colourful indeed for sir hugos longtime sikh orderlyvalet trilochan singh he of the swarthy complexion bristling mustachios and evil eye patch stood just off sir hugos larboard quarter in full regimental fig of his old th native infantry and never lend him or let him hold any monies either mr zachariah twigg chuckled as he joined them too and damned if his own personal man sri ajit roy wasnt there as well right down to those elephant hide sandals of his red cotton celebration stockings suit of dark buff broadcloth with baggy pyjammy breeches his mustachios though greyer than singhs were as stiff as anchor catheads too and it looked as if roy and singh had been having an old boy reunion much like almuni of harrow or eton langlies jaw dropped so much for serenity namaste ellooey sahib best wishes singh said in a gravelly voice palms together and bowing namaste captain ellooey ajit roy added oh springing joy to the happy pair namaste sri ajit roy sri trilochan singh lewrie replied as he put his palms together before his face and bowed in return dhanyavaad thank you for coming so far and your wishes colourful runs in the family mister langlie sir hugo said i dare say langlie replied unsure whether to smile or flee youve met my father at the church sir lewrie said attending to the social niceties but allow me to name to you mister zachariah twigg late of the foreign office mister twigg the father of the groom and i am proud to say my new inlaw mister anthony langlie of horsham in kent your servant sir from langlie then from twigg delighted to make your acquaintance mister langlie as twigg prosed on smooth and benign as a sated tiger allow me to express my congratulations to you and your wife upon this happy occasion and remark that you and mistress langlie have raised a praiseworthy son one with great promise to the crown and the navy whose name has figured prominently in official reports from captain lewrie the last three years to my superiors and admiralty as well ah well langlie puffed up with pride thankee kindly sir for your best wishes and for that information too ahem came a faint throat clearing a timid cough into a fist from mr sadler who hovered nearby my old orderly from my time in east india company service and a longtime friend mister langlie sir hugo stuck in former sergeant havildar trilochan singh twigg was quick to introduce ajit roy as well outre though an introduction of a servant to a gentleman was requiring mr langlie to try on the pressedtogether palms head bow and stab at pronouncing a hindu greeting with langlie looking dazedly bemused as if wondering whether his sons wedding day could get any stranger ahem sadler coughed a tad louder he wasnt exotic merely impertinent but evidently thought his case urgent enough to violate the niceties this once oh yes twigg said may i also name to you another friend of captain lewries mister langlie who coached down from london with us he did lewrie fearfully gawped to himself twigg father and sadler in the same coach with ajit roy and singh to boot christ i must really be in the legal quag the two former orderliesvalets surely would have ridden in the coach not been stuck in the cheap seats atop in the rain vile as they were both sir hugo and twigg held high regard and respect for their manservants sadlers such a chatterbox away from work tis a bloody wonder he ain t fluent in hindi or urdu by now bless me mister twigg but tis a rare thing indeed to see a solicitor be so ah solicitous as to coach all the way down to portsmouth for a clients wards wedding mr langlie marvelled and making sadler turn several livid colours after twigg had made but the sketchiest explanation of sadlers relationship to lewrie financial aspects was the way hed phrased it c captain lewrie is a client of long standing sir mr sadler managed to say with a straight face and so successful with prizes taken over the years that ah he trailed off with a sheepish grin i see langlie said chin lifting and eyes glazing over after meeting one too many below his station sadler handled money so he was a tradesman perhaps only a cut above an apothecary or tailor and not quite a gentleman your servant mister sadler he said as he turned to lewrie once more a small matter sir speaking of financial doings you are agreed captain lewrie that we each settle one hundred pounds per annum on our newlyweds an hundred from me upon my son an hundred from you upon sophie absolutely mister langlie lewrie agreed in much better humour langlie cocked a brow again and posed a better offer care to go guineas instead captain lewrie twentyone shillings to the guinea as opposed to twenty to the pound would be per annum total in addition to the pay of a commander in active commission shillings a day or a little over per annum less all the damned deductions of course so sophie and her new husband would start out life on a firm financial footing even if sophie chose to reside apart from either set of inlaws i get acquitted its not that much more lewrie told himself i get convicted and hung and it dont matter a toss guineas it is then lewrie agreed with a smile offering his hand to seal the bargain he could not resist turning to the hovering sadler and adding youll see to that arrangement will you sadler theres a good fellow but of course captain lewrie sadler had to respond to keep with the spirit of things bowing himself away his neck turned red well shall we seat ourselves join the ladies and allow the festivities to begin sir langlie suggested mainwell pleased must speak twigg rasped in a harsh businesslike whisper in lewries ear as langlie preceded him to the table later hmm if we must lewrie said with a resigned sigh you father and sadler all came down togeth later twigg shushed him all will be discovered chapter twelve praiseful speeches from lewrie from langlies father one shy shamble of thanks from the bridegroom and even sophie broke tradition to tap her wineglass with a spoon and rise to express eternal gratitude to the lewries for her adoption as their ward which touched upon how courageous captain lewrie had fought to conquer the french who would have butchered the royalist refugees but for him the pledge to her dying cousin to see her safe and protected in life and finally to have been so welcomed that i have quite forgotten those times when i was french and may now make the proud boast that i have been raised as english asas plum puddingand am now as equally proud to be the wife of an heroic british seadog merci to you captain lewrie to you mistress caroline she said tearing up just a bit as she lifted a champagne glass to sir hugo my jolly mentor and to you and your company sewallis hugh charlotte darling and playful companions all and to my many happy years in your family in anglesgreen that dear and lovely place which will remain with me forever no matter where anthony and i go merci merci beaucoup to you all and bonne chance to all of us they toasted the king with the youngest of langlies midshipmen at the foot of the long table proposing it followed by carefully chosen wardroom toastsmondays to our ships at sea tuesdays to our men and sundays absent friends studiously avoiding of course a bloody war or a sickly season which was too much of a reminder of the bridegrooms trade hunting and old port which wasnt apropos and most certainly not sweethearts and wives may they never meet after that things degenerated to the usual a glass with you sir or maam and offers of may i interest you in another slice serving of this delectable ham goose roast beef force meat pie sausages bacon or removes of hashed potatoes dainty made dishes or platters of eggs either fried scrambled poached or frenchified into omelettes at long last not long before most people in portsmouth would be thinking of their midday meals when every attendee and guest had been sufficiently stuffed and was nighsquiffy with spirits langlie and his bride retired abovestairs to refresh themselves and change into travelling clothes and the wedding party began to break up in search of ease of their own or another glass of something wet snickering mids and young officers with burgess chiswick leading lewries children went out to decorate the coach about a quarterhour later sophie and her new husband had come back down into a shower of rice and good wishes some wishes verging on the ribald said their goodbyes shook the last hands shared their last hugs and kisses and departed thank bloody christ thats over lewrie thought nearly halffoxed himself and in need of a restorative nap with his boots off and the waistband of his breeches undone done and done his father said beaming with pride over how well things had turned out you did warn langlie bout sophie lewrie asked him thinking that sir hugo looked a tad offcentre too wheneer she lapses into french or gets a thicker accent he should be on guard yes sir hugo rumbled swaying a little guard his purse too haw haw where will they lodge a postinghouse in brighton lewrie told him tis summer so it should be pleasant saltwater bathes flash crowds even if the king or the prince aint there then back to his ship on monday and sophies to move in with the langlies near horsham pity sir hugo said sighing still i dont spose langlie will begrudge an hour or two of his time sadlerll have to go speak with him sadler why lewrie scoffed didnt get his lieutenants journals or get a shot at deposing him for your trial sir hugo explained as if hed surely already told his son all about it recall that wee matter do ye here anthony have my lovely ward lewrie thought sarcastically oh by the by could you testify tsave my neck good trade hey what ahem sadler announced his continual pestiferous presence by coughing into his fist again ha hmm zachariah twigg cleared his throat from slightly aft of mr sadler with an impatient and imperious look on his phyz and to top things off there also stood caroline arms crossed above her waist tapping a neatly shod foot with one demanding brow up and that furrow of rightbloodynow between her eyes oh christ lewrie groaned to himself which of em can i afford tshrug off eenymeenymineymo captain lewrie twigg said rightsnappishly when it appeared that hed have to wait til epiphany for lewrie to make up his mind i believe there are matters of the greatest import which i mister sadler and sir hugo need to discuss with you mistress lewrie might i implore your kind indulgence half an hour perhaps but a single hour at the utmost i assure you dear lady for caroline twigg came over all cooing and gracious delivering an overformal bow with a hand on his chest oh do what you wish with him caroline snapped bestowing on lewrie a very frosty glare heaving a dramatic sigh of resignation and narrowing her eyes she spun on her heels to leave stiffly bound up the stairs ouch lewrie thought for officers and midshipmen off both warships had trooped back into the dining room for a last pocketful from the leftovers for later or to take a last celebratory glass of spirits down to heeltaps and had witnessed that little contretemps mister adair i will see you and the rest back aboard ship sir gentlemen he said to dismiss his people then made awkward goodbyes to those off hms orpheus who followed his own out the doors some much worse for wear shorttacking for the piers three sheets to the wind thankfully langlies parents had already departed for their lodgings for a liedown and an easing of corsets or shoes go with your mother children lewrie bade his offspring navy work ive my own rooms at the black spread eagle twigg said once they were relatively alone my coach is waiting let us all repair there with any luck at all our own business shall be done well before dark so mister sadler may coach to brighton and speak with commander langlie tomorrow after their first night of connubial bliss and a very late breakfast hmm he suggested with a leer just how bad is it lewrie had to ask sounding as if musing more on his wifes chilly departure statement instead the beaumans and their entourage are landed in london and are hot after your immediate arrest sir twigg bluntly told him but with a rarely heard tinge of sympathy in his voice we must put our heads together to determine the best course of action let us go once they were in twiggs lodgings a bottle of brandy made an immediate appearance and a vital contribution towards calmness for every set of frazzled nerves lewries most especially they seated themselves on the hard settees and halfsprung chairs near the tiny fireplace with the bottle and extra glasses on a sidetable dragged up between them now mister sadler twigg began what does your employer say of this development it was expected mister twigg sadler said with a grim nod of his head mister macdougall was certain that they would not be satisfied with a ruling from jamaican courts and must pursue the sentence of death in absentia in kings bench here to obtain what passes for justice mister macdougall of course has already made strenuous effort to deter the beaumans case from appearing on this law terms docket hence delaying any need for captain lewrie to be taken up and put in prison you know of the law terms sirs no from lewrie an abrupt nod from twigg a certain shifty look from sir hugo and from burgess chiswick who had joined them at the last second a cocked head and a negative shake there are four official law terms each calendar year sirs mr sadler solemnly explained when court sessions are held there is hilary term which begins in january easter term which is sat just after easter and is selfexplanatory we are now in the trinity term which began on whitsunday and which will continue to try cases til late autumn and thankfully for the good captain here is full well right then burgess exclaimed as if it was all over lastly there is michaelmas term which begins in october and does not conclude til christmas sirs sadler continued in the same tones ignoring the enthusiastic interruption trinity term is also the time when the lord justices remove themselves to the major cities of each shire to conduct trials of those imprisoned for major crimes beyond the scope of local magistrates so the lord justices are now away lewrie puzzled in that case who sits in london while theyre gone and who could doom me to hanging on the strength of the beaumans lying packet magistrates mostly sir sadler told him shifting about to face him though at least one or two lord justices who do not care for protracted stays in the countryside remain and do the beaumans lay their case before one of them alan here gets taken up and slung into gaol til burgess asked one of the remaining lord justices would be perfectly capable of accepting the transcript and verdict of the jamaica court sadler informed him turning in his chair again and pronouncing sentence mister chiswick upholding a travesty of justice sir hugo all but yelped that is why my employer mister macdougall was so eager to lay hands on a copy of the transcript sir hugo sadler said with a prim pride though having to swivel to face yet another interlocutor as well as receiving an affidavit from the jamaican barrister who represented captain lewrie during that sham of a trial an affidavit which was obtained by mister james peel of the foreign office at kingston and the deposition performed by lord balcarress the islands governorgenerals personal attorney one mister johnathon porter esquire a most respected member of the bar and formerly kings counsel from temple bar before accepting lord balcarress offer of employment overseas trust me gentlemen sadler said spreading his hands and letting a wee smile cross his solemn atwork features every lord justice in the land has dealt with mister porter and hold him in the highest esteem it does not harm our cause either sadler continued turning just a big smug that both mister peel and mister porter had the deposition transcribed to papers bearing the governorgenerals seal and letterhead copies of which mister macdougall already has in hand and stands ready to lay them before any lord justice who may adjudge the matter such imprint sirs while not bearing lord balcarress signature will go a long way towards lending a taint of official though tacit displeasure with the conduct of the jamaica trial and what did this local barrister have tsay for himself bout the matter burgess pressed why that he was hired on by the court dredged up from taking a pint or two of mild in a tavern close by mister chiswick sadler said with what almost approached a sly snicker given less than ten minutes to familiarise himself with the charges and the identity of his absent client and was unable to present much beyond apro forma defence poor mister pruett a newcome to the jamaica bar about as unschooled as they come sirs poor in abilities i should suspect as well as pelf and only paid his honorarium months later after persistent dunning of the local court system for his meagre thirty pounds and that miserly honorarium gentlemen sadler said with an air of gleeful triumph was finally paid by mister hugh beauman s local attorney in part at least since the local justices didnt deem pruetts services worth even such a low amount why thats thats lewrie spluttered jerking erect from his dismal slump in a hard chair so quick that he spilled a bit of brandy on his waistcoat evidence of a criminal collusion twixt prosecuting barrister and defence barrister so vile that poor mister pruett could be brought up on charges and slung into prison himself sadler crowed loss of membership in the bar at the very least both of them really pruett and beaumans barrister mister george cotton and he said that in his deposition mister sadler sir hugo chortled rocking back and forth with excitement on his chair indeed he did sir hugo sir sadler exulted my employer believes that pruetts presence at any trial or delaying evidentiary hearing is so important to captain lewries defence that he wrote to mister peel along with a sum of money to see to it that pruett must take passage to england and be lodged in london until such time that he testify in person exposing how onesidedly was the trial conducted how scanty were his chances to present a credible defence and what a travesty was the whole affair sirs right then burgess erupted huzzah a glass with you mister sadler and a glass with you next alan old son toast toast sir hugo insisted top up your glasses so we may make a double toast to the poor mister pruett of jamacia and the sagacious mister andrew macdougall esquire hes thave room board and spirits on my purse lewrie thought utterly appalled at how eager other people were to spend his money even on his own behalf recalling how lavishly macdougall and sadler had already regaled themselves at his expense he didnt know whether to laugh with relief or weep in fear of future poverty after that gala toast though mr sadler shyly called for their attention for a bit longer for he had more to relate mister macdougall sirs has already ascertained who it will be who prosecutes the beaumans case as well sadler said in sober takings evidently their mister cotton on jamaica had written their london solicitor and agent before taking ship whom they authorised to engage a barrister upon his own judgement and recommendation to speed things along whilst they made their sailing arrangements who is the bastard sir hugo snarled sir george norman kc sirs sadler informed them he is also a member of greys inn as is mister macdougall very well known at the bar and to mister macdougall too so aint that illegal or something sir hugo asked snorting in disbelief mean tsay not at all sir hugo gentlemen sadler quickly responded with a prim dislike for the honourable conduct of members of the bar to be questioned one might as well question the validity of two former students of cambridge opposing each other of two congregants of the same church parish or it happens all the time sir hugo twigg sitting and listening silently for the most part assured the nettled old fellow giving him a calming pat on the arm one must remember that both macdougall and this norman fellow gain their livelihood from their successes for their clients and their best interests aint that so sadler indeed mister twigg their livelihoods and their reputes rather twigg went on leaning back in the padded armchair he had appropriated as if musing lose a prominent case and ones repute is diminished as is their ability to attract clients or stick in the mind of solicitors who engage them oh burgess chiswick commented seeing the light i should think their pride suffers too how important and brilliant others in their line o work think em how shameful a loss would be to their souls exactly so mister chiswick sadler said taking charge of the conversation once more a man recognised as kings counsel or barrister might be engaged to prosecute one time defend another so for all those reasons which you and mister twigg have laid out it would be impossible and a grave offence gainst the dignity of law and their personal sacred honour to collude sir george norman ate his terms the requisite three years at greys inn and was called to the bar three years before my employer applied and mister macdougall was still a special pleader and writer when sir george was made kings counsel they are not colleagues in the familiar sense gentlemen dont sup tgether a dubious sir hugo asked shoot fish go on country retreats with each other sir george and mister macdougall do not socialise at all sir hugo sadler could say with confidence and a certain sly humour i do not think that such would be possible in point of fact for ah well sir george holds rather low opinion of scots or anyone who has risen from beneath his own class in general sir georges father is viscount selby his elder brother a baron and sir george i should have said is sir george norman baronet long before he attained the honourific of kings counsel and became a bencher in greys inn aha twigg said with a derisive bark what our man here captain lewrie might nautically term a toplofty is he the toploftiest mister twigg sadler said snickering a trifle reckoned a capable man lewrie had to ask so he could know his odds and his opponent at some things captain lewrie sadler replied tapping his nose sir george did a few terms at oxford to no special honours earned no blues won dye see mister macdougall heard a lot of him during his early years at greys inn for sir george dined in diligently and was reputed to toady diligently with the benchers of the time but without much in the way of proper legal study sir georges family is close friends and catercousins to a great many at the law though and one might charitably say that he was called to the bar more on the strength of his connexions than his abilities do not mistake my meaning gentlemen captain lewrie mr sadler gravely cautioned sir george norman is not a fool nor easy to outwit in court he is not an opponent to dismiss or underestimate though he said looking as if he wished he could chew on a thumbnail in such company though what burgess prompted impatient and intrigued well sir george has done rather a lot of cases in the court of common pleas for rather wellconnected clients from his own social set and the peerage one case in chancery court a most convoluted and intricate affair of inheritances multiple wills the upkeep for distraught and penniless heirs during its slow procession through the courts has been so lucrative and protracted that no one doubts it will outlast sir georges lifetime and keep him independently wealthy apart from what his own family might settle upon him he hasnt tried cases in kings bench then twigg posed with a frown on his face his spidery long fingers flexing on his glass oh many sir sadler countered for those accused who may meet his honorarium or who have family and friends who may have the wherewithal to support their kinsmans or friends cause not that often on the defence mind you gentlemen mister macdougall says he suspects that placing ones reputation at risk should he lose might not suit sir georges cautious nature no he has been engaged most often to prosecute and has an estimable record of success at it as mister macdougall says though most of those were openandshut cases with but little doubt of the accuseds guilt nor the outcome of the proceedings i see twigg said slowly drawing out the phrase and with a sly grin spreading on his skeletal face thin lips drawn upward and after seeing captain lewries name featured so prominently in the newspapers perhaps even in some of those abolitionist society tracts and such he scented a chance to shine in a most prestigious case certain that the fame resulting from the successful prosecution of a wellknown figure would polish his repute to a high gloss aha and if he read the transcript and took the beaumans lies as gospel truth lewrie exclaimed snatching at sudden hope after a dismal few hours not realising how despicably and shamefully the beaumans cheated and colluded burgess ever a staunch ally cried in like glee why it mustve looked as easy as a stroll in hyde park and thousands of pounds in his bank account for two hours work to boot yayss mr twigg drawled for i am sure that the solicitor who engaged him for the beaumans made known to him how king croesuswealthy the beaumans are and how large an honorarium he could demand mister macdougall sirs is confident that sir george is not yet cognisant of how weak his case really is sadler stated nor how colourable is the testimony and the veracity of the witnesses quoted in that transcript mister macdougall said for me to tell you captain lewrie and i quote that forearmed as we now are i fully expect to eat sir george norman and the beaumans alive in court thank bloody christ lewrie breathed ready to leap to his feet raise his arms in victory and perform a spastic dance around the room that is why your presence in london is urgently necessary sir sadler went on pouring cold water on that wee hornpipe of joy dye mean now the beaumans are in england were goin tcourt right now lewrie spluttered visibly paling a trifle and with a sinking feeling under his heart tomorrow or oh no sir sadler countered his attempt at a sympathetic and reassuring smile more of a leer at clients ignorance of the law than anything else as i said earlier the michaelmas term in october is the earliest we may expect no this would be more in the way of an evidentiary hearing a preliminary to stave off the prosecution my employer wishes you to be in london no later than day after tomorrow in your best fig he told me to tell you captain lewrie best of your uniforms id suppose todays for the wedding will suffice though ah sadler cautioned with an ahem and a cough into his fist perhaps it might be best did you coach up in civilian clothes in mufti lewries father said with a knowing nod and a bit of hindee slang so any bazaari badmashes the beaumans might have hired dont recognise him aha surely you do not imagine that any english gentleman even if reared in the colonies would stoop to violence or murder sir mr sadler gasped the law grinds slow but fine and to go outside of the rule of law would be revenge is the reason for half the murders mister sadler and yes dignified homegrown english gentlemen do it all the time mr twigg harshly told the naive sadler and he should know what he was talking about after all his deeds and experiences or they hire on bullybucks so their own hands stay clean ye dont know the beaumans if ye think theyre civilised i was ordered out of port after kit cashman shot hugh beaumans brother and i shot his cousin lewrie sourly commented else id have ended up dead in a dark kingston alley with my throat slit a second duel for revenge bedamned theyre vicious brutes for all the money land and slaves they own englishborn or not the highhandedness of lewries trial mister sadler mister twigg archly said as if they own the courts on jamaica if they may present such calumnies in a court of law so prideful as to think they may get away with anything so fraudulent should be proof enough for you as to what innate english respect they hold for the rule of law and how unscrupulous and dangerous the beaumans may be when rowed beyond all temperance what temperance lewrie scoffed never had any i see sadler murmured both enlightened and appalled alan and i shall coach together sir hugo offered with my man trilochan singh btween the three of us the beaumansd need a squad o cutthroats tdo him in why not hire a band tlead the way while were at it lewrie gravelled heading for the brandy too fretful to sit any longer we could stand out like a royal fireworksl ooh da lookit th foreign feller oos at wif im at lewrie git mine arse on a to the contrary mr twigg interjected with a sly expression a grand shows the very thing sir hugo and i came down together in a hired coach not the diligence with singh and my man ajit roy who i may dare say is as dangerous an opponent as singh though not a sikh sworn by his faith to wear the seven steels mild appearance on ajits part has led many a foe to underestimate him dead foes i am happy to relate hmm no we shall coach to london as grand as any lord and his retinue sir hugo in his uniform singh in his and ajit roy in his best native holiday suiting you lewrie in the clothing you now stand in twould take an extremely wellpaid gang of bullybucks whod dare attack such a party lewrie twigg snapped turning his gaze as quickly as a famished falcon in his direction have you among your crew any tars whod relish a fight does it come to it sailors whod kill if it is required any who might enjoy a melee to the knife bloody dozens i suspect lewrie said with a sly smile of his own recalling past battles and those possessed of the hottest bloodlust during a boarding action my coxn liam desmond hes a battler his mate patrick furfy not the sharpest thinker but he is big strong and like most irish dearly loves a good scrap and theres jones nelson one o my black uh volunteers monstrousbig and very strong not so good with cutlass or pistol but nelson is daunting just tlook at and does wonders with mauls loggerheads and wooden rammer staffs the more exotic the better mr twigg agreed nigh purring good we are agreed then dawn day after tomorrow we shall with those additions coach to london make room for me burgess chiswick offered i did not pack my own uniform but i did fetch along a brace of doublebarreled pistols and may one of you gentlemen lend me a sword ive some spare french officers swords aboard my ship pick whichever you like burge lewrie offered well be arseholes to elbows but sir hugo said flexing his fingers on the hilt of his costly tulwar as if looking forward to a violent encounter somewhere twixt portsmouth and the elephant and castle postinghouse in london perhaps anyone sent to intercept us might think that lewrie and his armed sailors are the impress looking for fresh muscles for the navy and shy off haw haw should i also fetch cutlasses for singh and ajit roy lewrie asked no need sir hugo told him with a grin a hanger swords a part of his seven blades in his luggage already ajit roy and i ah are always prepared twigg added just bet ye are lewrie thought daggers swords pistols and a pair o swivelguns t boot mounted t either beam o yer coach well then gentlemen sadler said draining the last of his brandy and setting his glass aside with a determined thump as if the meeting was gavelled to adjournment i must be off in pursuit of the happy groom to obtain his deposition and lieutenants journals then join you in london as soon as possible it is obvious that i depart leaving captain lewrie in the safest of hands and i could use a liedown fore supper sir hugo said with a yawn as he finished his own brandy and rose to see the others out of his rooms well then lewrie said as well ready to head back to the george inn oddly he didnt feel that much in danger not in portsmouth not in a navy seaport surely he had his frigate and her crew and a most secure place to sleep soundly where any lurking assassin couldnt reach him thered be so many senior officers and their own attendants at the george that even a lone knifeman would feel daunted to enter no it would only be on the road that danger lay right oh shit lewrie suddenly recalled carolines still waitin to tear a strip o hideoff mine arse for some reason he had no decent excuse for haring back to savage for shelter from her simmering displeasure either not for long at any rate this aint goin tbe pretty he told himself chapter thirteen tea please abigail lewrie requested once he had shed his hat coat presentation sword and snakeclasp belt at least he thought carolines new maidservants name was abigail it was hard to recall since hed only clapped toplights on her two days before though for convenience sake most housemaids got called abigail no matter what their bloody names really were jane sir the stout girl with a bulldogs face meekly said jane then and yer pardons lewrie corrected himself theyre gettin uglier he thought as he steeled himself to see his wife evidently caroline would not trust him to keep his fingers off any livein household help but trolls or the women whod win the side of bacon at the annual village uglyface contest without trying jane returned with the tea but lewrie only had a sip or two to restore himself and appear soberer after all that palaver with mr twigg amp co before caroline emerged from her bedroom in an athome dress and more comfortable slippers you may go jane caroline said in a level tone the children are now changed and ready for a stroll take them please yesm lewrie studiously applied himself to sugaring and creaming his tea slurping down one cup as the children thundered from their rooms and tromped noisily belowstairs for the outside world and god help jane and portsmouth and got a second cup ready for consumption before caroline swept to a settee and sat arms crossed her brow furrowed and her gaze piercing and what was of such import that required the better part of two hours husband caroline coolly enquired savin my bloody neck from the noose lewrie told her that the beaumans are in london and what my attorney plans tdo about em how were tgo and when youre just dashing off again his wife scoffed when tmorrow very early lewrie told her she wasnt yet so hot she was throwing things so he dared to amble over to a wingback chair by the fireplace with his cup and saucer and sit himself down not in easy reach it went without saying i see caroline muttered with a nod of her head then heaved one of her exasperated sighs i suppose i should expect no better of you after all these years absence and indifference i could stay with you here dearest but the next time ye saw med be swingin in the wind at newgate lewrie posed rather see me hang he tried to jape with a lopsided grin hmm was her answer to that oh for gods sake caroline lewrie griped crossing his legs and shifting uneasily on his chair we were makin some progress on a reconciliation now you youve been in a pet ever since you came down from home whats the matter the weddins over and it came off damn near perfect idve thought yed feel relieved stead o it did caroline said with no joy of arranging a successful ceremony breakfast and beginning on good terms with the new inlaws now im shot of her and god help the langlies the coy jade is now their worry she spat and lewrie could read bitch or whore in place of the term she chose caroline there never was a single thing twixt sophie and me lewrie assured her as he had dozens of times before i made a solemn oath to a dyin man a friend no matter he was french and i honoured that pledge we honoured rather for twas you most of the time who saw to her raisin did she ever dally with anyone you ever suspect sophies morals ever hear or see anything with your own senses that led you to believe she played either of us false or do ye place complete trust in those damned letters he pointedly asked he didnt relish a fight with her and knew that he had set one off after months of tippytoeing but he was simply tired of being treated like a leper her fierce frown and the way one slippered foot and shin jiggled was all the answer she made and was all he needed to know what youve gotten another un he tried to tease darlin theyre all lyin packets oh was your corsican whore phoebe aretino a madeup fantasy alan was carolines vexed reply or was she real in genoa there was a claudia somethingorother was she spun from thin air that slutty mort who bore your bastard child theoni kavares connor i read of you and her long before seeing them both in hyde park just fever dreams were they you bastard now now lewrie tried to shush her setting aside his tea and pushing hands towards her theyd never lodge at the george inn again if she went on like that and as loudly whoremonger corinthian rakehell caroline skreeched just like your bloody father like ail your line mostlike the other letters proved true so why not the ones about your precious and sordid sophie hah like the one about that vulgar circus bitch what lewrie gawped rowed beyond genteel temperance and volume himself eudoxia durschenko you must be joking or somebody must i told you caroline she set her cap for me but i never laid a fing vain and prideful bastard you got a fresh letter is that it lewrie demanded let me see it so you can destroy it then call me tetched she accused ive never seen one of em lewrie explained getting to his feet ive told you and told you tis someone who despises me thinks i done him wrong somehow and is gettin his own back through you my father described one tme just after the nore mutiny fine bond paper spencerian copperplate hand all that id hoped mister twigg couldve found out more i told him of em last year and another of your circle of whoremongers caroline scoffed why does he wish to read them late at night alan or is he ready to swear on a bible and lie for you convince me that theyre all false then laugh with you at me behind my back she sprang from the settee and began to pace the room and the proper languid graces bedamned she was all but stomping caroline zachariah twigg is most certainly no friend of mine lewrie tried to explain almost finding some faint amusement in the very idea his place at the foreign office is that of a spy a meddler and intriguer overseas toppled rajahs and foreign princes who stood in england s way a cutthroat an assassin and probably still is despite his official retirement one of the most dangerous men ever i met but not a real friend to anyone or me he knows forgeries handwriting or knows people who do i thought that hed be able to smoak out the identity of your anonymous scribbler that stopped her in her tracks wideeyed in surprise ive been his gundog since in the far east he went on sensing an opening dancin ttwiggs music in the med and the west indies too and every time twigg or one of his agents shows up with a scheme i feel rabbits runnin over my grave he finds me a useful asset caroline lewrie spat still does else id never have gained support from the abolitionists tdefend me nor gained such a good attorney god help whoever it is writin those letters to you my girl if twigg discovers em he can make an enemy just disappear on the quiet all the pain theyve caused you wouldnt you desire tknow whos plagued you and have something done about it i never knew caroline softly replied looking puzzled not any less bitter but it was a slight improvement i was never at leave ttell you or anyone lewrie said now show me this latest letter as twigg and i coach to london together i can show it to him and let him have a go at it please caroline she took a long pause to think that over her arms snugly tucked under her breasts hands gripping both elbows and looking at the floor before making up her mind and going to the bedroom to fetch it damme i think know this hand lewrie told himself as he read the first for caroline had fetched not one but two of those letters both much crumpled in her past rages from where though or when i wonder still could be a mans hand or a womans the oldest was about sophie full of scurrilous observations of her behaviour in london society perhaps just after the time that she fled anglesgreen and went for shelter with his father sophie was portrayed as frivolous flighty and flibbertygibbet openly flirting with the many beaus who sniffed about her sporting and playing balumrancum on the sly with impressive bachelors and rich married men who kept her under their protection like a mistress or a courtesan then creeping home to sir hugo st george willoughby into his bed where they whored together and regaled each other with minute recollections of their latest conquests the anonymous writer included an allegedly overhead conversation twixt sophie and some other infamous young belle about how she filled her days and nights but could not wait til her hero long out at sea could return so they could pick up where theyd left off and continue their long affair right under her paladins roof caroline this is utter bloody tripe lewrie gravelled all the years sophie lived with us sweet and virginal how can you believe shed act so or sound so carnal what girl not a penniless waif but damnedwell supported and reared would say such things to anyone if she had any hopes of makin a good match this supposed overheard conversation sophie mightve been heard talkin bout anthony langlie comparin dance partners and tellin some other girl why she was so indiffrent to em thats all someones twisted it all round and salted it with smut he told her caroline had moved to the tea table and had poured herself a cup she sipped standing up and looked over the cups rim at him in faint mute agreement that his supposition might be correct the second about eudoxia durschenko was even more scandalous more lurid she was portrayed as an amoral roosian foreigner a jade who didnt own the morals that god promised a stoat a circus person who performed nigh unclothed and thought nothing of it an actresswhich was a bare cut above a street prostitute if the sum was right according to the scribbler lewrie and eudoxia had rogered in his greatcabins on long country rides naked as earthworms right out in the open in her private dressing room before and after performing well hed fantasised such but nothing like that ever happened mores the pity cant be anyone from the convoys aboard proteus who wrote this trash he grimly thought this is all made up a feverdream for certain worse n a novel bout a sultans seraglio and how had the nameless writer discovered all this introduced to her following a performance of wigmores new peripatetic extravaganza lewrie read aloud his scorn and sarcasm positively dripping on the threadbare carpets cross the thames in southwark and after complimenting her upon the heroism she and the circus performers had shown when assailed by a french frigate in the same south atlantic battle in which her paramour won his latest fame she thanked me prettily but then began to regale me with tales of how she had emulated her navy lover then to my astonishment told me of their lovemaking as if it was the most natural thing in the world or so it might be to such a trull who may not even be strictly allowed to be considered a christian damme caroline lewrie spluttered she and her father were roosian orthodox arslan artimovich slept with one eye open to keep her a virgin with a dagger in one hand and his bullwhip in tother and there wasnt a man in their troupe whod dare even let his glance linger for someone tknow details all of em false mind he had tbe close tme this last year past and he paused to compare the handwriting of both letters and these letters are both done in the same hand the one time once i tell ye that dan wigmore invited me backstage after the show in recife none of the performers had a dressin room troger in rickety foldin mirror tables with a thin curtain tdress behind that was all eudoxia was never guested aboard proteus and you go aboard savage tomorrow morning you ask of anybody from wardroom to gundeck theyll tell you that cant you see that someone is spinnin tales bout sophie and eudoxia out of thin air that this is all spite though she behaved so fond of you when i met her during the circus parade right here in portsmouth alan caroline coolly said seemingly intent on her tea as she slowly paced the rooms slowly and more gracefully rode right up onto the sidewalk bent down to kiss you in a most intimate fashion from horseback did she not i was in all the papers after we anchored and paid off she was famous and saw a way to increase the audience by a public show he countered managing to sound relatively reasonable about it and i introduced you and the children to her did i not would a guilty man do that the slyest ones would yes caroline said and could she flung herself upon you you said alan how much did she fling hah we met aboard the circus ship the time the dancin bear tried teat my hat and shins lewrie replied i told you o that and she found me amusin what happened tme amusin didnt see her at all til we anchored at recife and i went to the circus and wigmore invited me backstage i talked to a lot of circus people he wanted me tuse what influence he thought i had with captain treghues to letnavy sailors have shore liberty so they could attend his shows makin him even more tin faint chance o that you remember treghues we sailed for saint helena they put on the circus and the comedies and dramas there and i sat in the front row one night and after the curtain call she hopped off the stage and plopped herself in my lap just as i told you for a jape on her father for the audience cause it was funny ha ha caroline mocked at cape town i barely saw her lewrie pressed on going over old news of his innocence she stayed in cape town when others from the circus went inland thunt new beasts for their menagerie and we were down at simons town salvagin a new rudder she rode out the mornin we set off for target practice with her bow and her guns and met us on the road in front of a dozen sailors and a dozen more drovers and we talked for a bit as we rode along pennsylvania rifles and fergusons the red indian moccasin boots she got in savannah georgia a shootin contest perhaps then she galloped off to exercise that white trick stallion o hers and that was all dear uhmhm one brow was up high and her eyes were squinted your own brother met her lewrie stanchly soldiered on with his protestation of innocence the mornin we were loadin the new rudder into a barge she came down to the docks tsightsee burgess came ashore off one o the homebound indiamen and i had tintroduce her or give her the cutdirect and when i named him as my brotherinlaw she called me a slew o names like id led her on false tarakan sikkim siyn peesa cockroach son of a bitch and well ah prick if ye must know pardons how discerning of her caroline said quite brightly faintly amused though not that much my estimation of her foreign or no rises peesa hmm and sikkim siyn is it how apt one o my black hands had run away with the circus hunters lewrie contined wondering if caroline would go buy herself a stack of foreign lexicons to find new ways to say what she couldnt in public mauled by a lion some of her fellow circus people had been killed too shed come task of her father and she helped tget my sailor to their own surgeon who knew more of animal wounds than ours and that was the absolute last time i saw or spoke to her til that parade here in portsmouth back in the spring caroline and havent since aplausible tale alan she coolly replied after finishing her tea and pacing back to the settee where she arranged herself most primly her back erect her gaze level and unrevealing and her hands in her lap even if nothing did pass twixt you and that barely clad creature even if she was then and still is a naive and feckless young virgin in deluded creampot love with you i suspect it wasnt for want of trying on your part twas lack of opportunity knows me too damned well she does he sorrowfully thought caroline wed begun writing each other again lewrie said in a soft and pleading tone gods my witness ill admit i was tempted sore but i didnt and not for lack of opportunity for id hopes we might you and me all this about sophie or eudoxia are vicious sordid lies and thats the truth she looked down at her hands and considered that for a long bit she then looked up the simmering of anger back in her amber eyes and with a most odd expression as if she wished to believe him but found past betrayals just too massive perhaps that is so alan she said and my nameless torturer has overreached at last but there are still so many others to explain do you deny your taking that phoebe aretino as a mistress ah lewrie dithered feeling like wincing if he could get away with it and not doom himself and all his recent pleadings six eight months and thousands of miles away from home caroline and a man has well i aint a saint nor a tonsured monk oh how well i know that of you caroline said with a bitter little chuckle your italian mort in genoa she asked nighgayly twigg he ordered me to and it was just the once lewrie told her chin tucked into his collars and realising how lame that sounded even as he said it struth claudia was a french spy and gobetween twixt the frogs and the cabal that wanted france to seize power she got set on me thinkin i was gullible enough tblab just what they needed tknow and twigg used that used me tfeed her what he wanted em to know so we could lay a trap for their best ye recall what i told ye of guillaume choundas why for king and country alan caroline sweetly said with a very false smile how patriotic of you i may still be but a north carolina country girl but do not imagine that i am a total fool but its true i swear it lewrie protested ask twigg hah was her opinion of that calming she continued as if she were the cat and he the cornered mouse and what of the mother of your bastard alan theoni kavares connor she intoned as if savouring each scornful syllable after you rescued her and her natural child from those serbian pirates was she so enthralled was she so grateful that she simply had to fling herself upon your manliness and your sterling and heroic character it was it lewrie stammered totally disarmed this had simmered like an acrid pot between them and finally finally there it was served up like manure soup it happened aye no denyin it in the adriatic after i was wounded and groggy with laudanum there wasnt enough room aboard for all our british refugees fore the frogs took venice so and in sheerness too alan caroline remorselessly reminded him as if he had need of reminding before you sailed for the west indies the last time a whole week with her you spent sharing a lodging for all the world to see aye he had to confess sitting down in his wingback chair again too limp with guilt to protest after youd stormed off home to hell with more tea for by now he was starkly sober more in need of brandy or yankee corn whisky could he find any after you threw me away and wrote ttell me i would never be welcome under the same roof with you again well there it was said at long last out in the open port in a storm he lamely tried to expound damn you his wife blurted damn you to hell alan caroline what dye expect a man to be how much time have we had together since the war began two months three out o seven bloody years even before then swaddles and spitups pantries and stillrooms flower gardens not this time o month you said three children were enough you said perhaps you said if id employ protections and charlotte an accident and nigh six months for nursin and celibacy after and you blamin me for riskin your life tchildbed fever one more time and she flounced off the settee halfway through that stamping the bounds of their lodgings arms stiff at her sides and her small fists balled me more like a burden than a loved husband lewrie went on spilling all his pentup recriminations on how such a loving marriage with so much spectacularly exciting intimacy had become so drab and lacklustre right ill never be a farmer or a herdsman we know it but youre so complete to yourself and the children and i go she snapped at last pausing by the one window her arms across her chest once more looking out not at him go up to london to your damned ship to your loversl go to the devil why dont you look caroline twiggll discover whos been bedevilling you with these letters and what bedevils me is you you faithless amoral bastard she shouted turning about to face him i shall make your excuses to your poor children god knows ive gained practice at doing so these many years with you never at home and daydreaming about all your doxies when you were thats not true caroline lewrie insisted when i was home and you were there for me with me i never do not try to beguile me alan she spat fighting the tears that blinded her striving not to lose her voice as her breath caught in hitches in her chest just go go be your navys hero a hero to the antislavery people preen all you wish but you will do all of that without me go be tried without me or hung without me dearest hah she picked up the first thing that came to hand a cheap toby jug in honour of some ancient seavictory of some kind and hurled it blindly it came within a bare inch of breaking his nose and making his bung sport claret had he not shied at the last moment caroline darted for her bedroom door flung it open then shut it with a titanic bang bedropes creaked as she flung herself cross the coverlet and mattress lewrie shut his eyes in pain and utter defeat he felt pain because hed caused her pain but oddly perversely morelike he chid himself he felt nothing much beyond that at that moment just a faint twinge of conscience a touch of shame that he had brought it upon himself of a certainty a tad of that there was nothing more he could do the woes in pandoras box had already fluttered away and there was no point in shutting it putrid old wine had been spilled and there was no rebottling it perhaps there never had been a hope of reconciliation the whole thing had felt forced and shamful anyway a stiff and unnatural show for friends family and children for navy and society but there had been no warmth in it not even a hint of the old intimacy or the trust or the forgiveness or lewrie heaved a deep resigned and shrugging sigh it was over sure as fate he redressed in uniform cocked hat and sword trying to compose his face as neatly as he could his clothes looking round the set of rooms as if to discover a single thing that held even a jot of warmth of comfortable familiarity of lewriehood either his or hers and found nothing for it was as empty and impartial as the yawning gunless gundeck of a hulked warship nothin for it he grimly decided snatching up those damning letters and cramming them into a side pocket perhaps twigg could do him proud the identity of the mysterious writer would never bring his wife round but there was always his own vengeance to wreak that might prove satisfying hed coach to london to try to save his life and honour she would coach to anglesgreen and erase him from her life and there was likely an end to it give ye joy o the day lewrie sadly whispered as he stepped out into the hall and softly shut the door for evry weddin day is a time for good cheer book ii it is hard to say whether the doctors of law or divinity have made the greater advances in the lucrative business of mystery edmund burke a vindication of natural society chapter fourteen when zachariah twigg had said my coach lewrie had pictured a typical sixpassenger equipage drawn by four horses the sensible sort of carriage that most people of means owned come dawn however there before the black spread eagle stood the twin to the commercial dilly the diligence or balloon coach big enough for nigh a dozen if they were fairly intimate dwarves and with even more seating atop twigg was there already in topboots old tricorne hat and the voluminous doublecaped greatcoat that lewrie remembered from the harumscarum ride that twigg had given him the year before in his sporting twohorse chariot from his hampstead retreat spyglass bungalow to london at a terrifying rate of knots with twigg cracking his whip and howling maniacally with the wind blowing back into their faces with a breathstopping force youll ah not be takin the reins will you lewrie asked in trepidation as an assistant coachee took his valise and carpet bag to stow in the boot oh i thought at least one stage twigg said eyes twinkling in evil glee and anticipation once on the flat oh christ lewrie muttered and your father sir hugo may take a leg as well oh no lewrie gawped id known this idve hunted out a priest for last rites he grimly told himself feeling like he should cross himself ah theres me slugabed sir hugo chuckled as he came round the lead pair of the sixhorse team after checking harness admiring the quality of the beasts as well breakfasted been tthe jakes aye but hearing that you and mister twiggll be driving i feel a sudden new need lewrie chaffered and wellarmed too i see good lad his father hawhawed sir hugo looked positively piratical sporting a pair of doublebarreled pistols in his waistsash and the pockets of his ornate generals coat sagging with another pair of lighter singleshot barkers hed traded his rajahs tulwar for the plainer smallsword that lewrie recalled from earlier days come to think on it twiggs greatcoat showed similar bulges and lumpiness and the drag of a sword scabbard could be seen under its hem knowing twigg lewrie strongly suspected that there were even more blades in hidden placesslim poignards krees daggers from the far east jammed into his boots and god knew what else might have grenadoes up his rectum lewrie decided ajit roy and trilochan singh came out of the inn carrying final articles of luggage and both of them positively clanked with weaponry chattering away in hindi or urdu as gay as magpies compared to them lewrie thought his hands coxn desmond landsman furfy and landsman jones nelson looked fairly naked outfitted with but a cutlass each clumsy sea pattern singleshot pistols and their personal knives which served for everything from work to dining like it twigg asked gesturing towards his coach hired it on from a fellow who refurbishes dillys usually damned comfortable when travelling with only four or so he went on whether lewrie made a good or bad opinion or none as was his wont time is precious the sun will soon rise and we must be off board sirs board if you please there were two additional bodies up in the box the driver and an assistant wearing subdued burgundy livery under their greatcoats two more held open the doors and lowered the folding metal steps wearing the same livery and as lewrie got aboard he took note that the fellow who held the door with a blankfaced servants expression for him but with darting sly eyes for everything beyond wore the most cunning set of holsters sewn inside his greatcoat the briefest look at the fellows overall appearance and his taut and wary face before he was seated inside convinced lewrie that the man had been a soldier at one time and not a timid rearranker either the coach swayed on its leather suspension straps as desmond and his party clambered up onto the roof seats poor patrick furfy awkward and heavy as usual itd be a rare day that anyone sent furfy aloft there came a clatter of hooves as four mounted men all dressed in the same greatcoats hats and livery paced up from a stable down the street the leader leaned close to twiggs lowered window muttering a reply to twiggs whispered instructions and touched the brim of his hat before touching spurs and cantering away lewrie got a glimpse of a brasshiked heavy cavalry pattern sabre in a scabbard mounted on the saddle a saddleholstered pistol forward of his right knee and a scabbarded musketoons wooden butt peeking above the horses rump outriders just in case mr twigg confided with a hiss and the look of a scrapper just spoiling for a battle the way hungry men might look forward to toast and jam four altogether once it gets warm enough theyll doff the greatcoats just so anyone contemplating ambush will be daunted or eliminated he added with savage relish the coachees and the footmen just as well armed lewrie asked oh yes twigg said smiling broadly as the coach lurched and began to roll forward a most useful party of men altogether not always so overt in their purpose but in this instance not only our showy appearance but a show of force i thought them necessary rode down before us sir hugo casually imparted yawning like an hippopotamus zachariah whistled em up soon as he discovered the beaumans arrival lurked bout the piers the church and the wedding breakfast and ill wager ye never even noticed didnt think tlook for such at a wedding lewrie said with a snort disguised as ushers and acolytes were they most useful men indeed twigg told them all disguises do now and again play a part in their line of work hard as it is to believe in time of war there are some nefarious sorts who will play spy for our foes britons in the pay of the french or spanish who are in need of convincing he said with a leer foreign agents who covert themselves in our nation and operate traitorous bands of nativeborn informers who must be smoaked out exposed and hung or simply drop off the face of the earth to the utter confoundment of their spymasters in paris or madrid or certain other foreign capitals he said with a sage tap aside his nose skulkers for the foreign office ye mean lewrie said who work for you i thought you were retired mister twigg years of service overseas has made my face and name much too well known to our opposition twigg told him i now merely keep my hand in with consultations and some few tasks closer to home my fellows here well he leaned over the top of his walkingstick towards lewrie on the rearfacing bench my intown residence on baker street among other locations is the most convenient place for discreet comings and goings so i call my fellows the baker street irregulars though private armies are no longer allowed in britain he had himself a little simper of amusement you forget zachariah sir hugo reminded his odd choice for a friend that some scottish lairds still maintain private regiments lord thinggummys own highland foot or lord sheepthiefs border reivers haw haw fortunately all on temporary loan to his majesty though old son twigg quickly rejoined in like good humour and part of great britains army til they feel an urge for rebellion and independence once more god save us in point of fact a fair number of my fellows come from such private regiments easier to second from any regular british unit whose soldiers took the kings shilling for long enlistments though there are ways should a fellow be promising ha mercenaries in essence lewrie asked with a worried frown trust twigg my boy sir hugo assured him i do blieve our side pays better than our foes so with such lads about youre as safe as a babe in his mothers arms even as light as the balloon coach was with such a light load aboard all of them had to get out and push to help the horse team get to the crest of portdown hill fortunately the road was newgravelled and dry so they didnt end looking like thames river mudlarks and six horses made it bowl along quite nicely and swiftly under the reins of the regular coachee a tad faster when twigg took his turn upon the box or when sir hugo tried his hand at emulating jehu the biblical charioteer as the sun rose and the summer warmth gathered the greatcoats were shrugged off baring livery and uniforms and the oddness of their indians garb twigg was right they did make a raree show and every twentyodd miles or so when the horse team had to be changed for fresh beasts they received a variety of greetings run lads run an raise th yeomanry one myopic twit cried as they clattered into petersfield the fookin french are ere as loosely organised as the local volunteer soldiery were the travellers were long gone by the time a sergeant turned up with half a dozen men all still struggling into uniform at least their coachs stop had given those poor fellows a good excuse for leaving work and angrily chivvying free beer for their troubles from the weakeyed old fool huzzah th circus is acomin a young stableyard hand yelled in glee when they stopped at guildford and that brought out a mob of gawkers who though disappointed that their party wasnt the circus at least took joy from such an outre batch of travellers crikey ye aint th king isself is ye the publican at the last stage stop wondered aloud as their coach rolled to a halt at his tavern and postinghouse on the outskirts of kingston near the south bank of the thames his customers and help tumbled out to witness the arrival ready to curtsy doff their hats or tug their forelocks til twigg and sir hugo alit not looking all that royal and slunk back to their labours or their drinks lewrie stretched his legs rolled his shoulders and eased his aching fundament in the shade of a large oak just outside the doors to the tavern sitting on a wooden bench with his legs at last stretched out instead of awkwardly pinched up crabwise desmond and lewries two other hands got down from the coachtop seats and stood licking their lips in expectation the team need changing dye think lewrie asked his father who was with twigg seeing to the horses watering and stroking them over it wasnt that much further to london proper from where he sat lewrie could espy the citys taller steeples already they seem sound enough to make it to the elephant and castle sir hugo told him and twigg shrugged then nodded his agreement halfpints then desmond lewrie said digging for his coin purse and handing his coxn a crown piece one for me too aye sor a halfpint sounded good to desmond though furfy rolled his eyes and heaved a sad sigh of disappointment that they had no time for a fullun so many stops had taken a toll upon lewries purse beer with hardboiled eggs to tide them over at petersfield beer roast beef and currant duff at the postinghouse in guildford at the paying passengers rate not the price of a twopenny ordinary and one stop midway twixt guildford and here for cheese apples and more beer his sailors came out of the tavern with their halfpints and a rather pretty serving girl fetched lewrie his returning his change as she gave him a fair curtsy and smile and lewrie returned it allowing her the last few pence for a tip which earned him a second smile and bob he took a sip appreciating the brew probably unknown to other towns beyond a long walk and laid up in the taverns cellar what a dead bust lewrie thought all this way and i couldve ridden it alonefor all the danger we ve seen he wasnt exactly sure just how long the beaumans had been here in england but began to doubt that they could have enlisted thugs for outofcourt revenge this quickly wouldnt know their way about nor know whom to approach hoy there one of the outriders called all four of them had come to the watering troughs to freshen their mounts at the same time all were now dismounted but one of themthe taciturn leaderhad kept his wits about him twigg and sir hugo snapped their heads about in the direction he was chinpointing up the london road near a thick stand of trees and shrubbery a lone man stood by the head of his horse stroking its nostrils to keep it silent and halfhidden waistdeep in the bushes lewrie got an impresion a quickun of dark clothing a widebrimmed and flat black farmers hat about an hundred yards or so away lewrie estimated as the fellow now aware that he was being stared at sprang up onto his saddle urgently sawed his horses reins and spurred away before any of their outriders could even think to saddle up within moments the strange rider was out of sight round a bend leaving small dustpuffs of dry dirt road that hung like a tan mist where shafts of sun dapples filtered through the trees uhoh was his fathers sour comment trouble at last ha skirmishers out you concur zachariah your men your call scout for an ambush perkins theres a good fellow twigg said with a harsh snap damme just damme mightve been a highwayman lewrie supposed aloud finishing his beer setting the mug on the bench and walking to the head of the horse team for a better look as their unofficial cavalry vedette hastily mounted and cantered away in pursuit make a try for a rich coach but thought we looked too daunting so he not a bit of it sir twigg countered slashing the air with his walkingstick like a cutlass he peered at lewrie with a pitying expression as if he were the most naive fool in the world or as blind as a bat no one innocent spurs off in such fashion a highwayman perhaps but in whosepay lewrie and the leader or sentinel of how large a band i thought our luck had been a tad too good but it does make eminent sense to wait and watch nearer london than try their hand closer to portsmouth where you must go after all hmm twigg said with an arch leer too many roads to watch else but trouble sor coxn desmond asked his captain might very well turn out tbe desmond aye lewrie answered do you have the lads see ttheir arms rush on sir hugo suggested is an ambush laid better that we gallop through it your lads press the bastards hot they cannot take the time tchoose a second layby if flushed from their first doubt theyre sharpshooters good enough tstrike swiftmovin targets take the initiative yes twigg said after thinking it over a bit put them wrongfooted worked often enough in india burgess chiswick seconded not a tactic theyd expect even were they exsoldiers themselves and i know for a fact that most shooters never get enough practice to hit a blessed thing that isnt standing stockstill and no more than thirty yards off right sir hugo mount up and be at em instanter sir hugo urged get everyone aboard the coach and lets get crackin and weapons ready on either beam lewrie added as they trotted back to the coach doors back up top lads were off simple robbers or hired badmashes no matter sir hugo short of breath but full of vinegar said as their coach quickly clattered to a swaying rocking pace they try us on well give em hell scatter the bastards if nothin else and leave em in our dust once past em i doubt theyve the nutmegs for pursuit the shortest route into london though just in case twigg suggested now with a brace of pistols in his hands one laid atop his left arm ready to fire from his window on the widest streets so any others cannot assault us right sir hugo heartily agreed westminster bridge and into whitehall up charing cross to oxford street thence to either my own gentlemens hotel or your house in baker street zachariah my house twigg quickly decided his full attention out his window more secure even than your madeira club once there we may send a runner to mister macdougall and let him put his plans afoot for lewries defence and court appearance we gallop past whoever they are mister twigg burgess piped up and well be ahead of them passing word to their other associates best they can do is send two or three to skulk behind us to discover where were bound true enough major chiswick thankee twigg replied the beaumans lewrie said trying to be helpful even if this fellows one of theirs they dont know a bloody thing about who the rest of you are an army general but who they dont know about my father what little time i ever spent with em i never said a thing bout him and we dont have the same last name so there is you as well mister twigg they wont know your connexions or how dangerous you can be either dont know my connexions my inlaws so theyll not recognise or bother twatch out for burgess here and lewrie went on sneering the beaumans for all their money back in jamaica are a cheap set o bastards thousands for show but pennypinchin at all else hugh beauman the senior now is used to slaves dy see tstay covert and innocentlookin behind a pack o bullybucks he cant hire a lot of em lest they blab too wide in their cups and mostliked weep over the expense of more than a whole dozen so new to england to london hes never been here beforehe wouldnt know his way round cheapside seven dials or any of the stews where the real cutthroats can be had like wapping and need a city map a lanthorn and four hands tfigure his way about ha sir hugo chimed in zachariah twigg turned away from gazing out his window over his pistol barrels so intently and might have said something in reply to that his expression seemed almost inspired with some new thought and a tinge of surprise to hear something sensible coming from lewrie but the faint sound of faraway gunshots ended that the coachee blew a long straight horn in the taratara octet of notes usually heard when the dogs have flushed a fox signal for the hunt to be on and desmond furfy and nelson shouted almost as one and in naval parlance enemy in sight two points off th starboard bow twiggs private cavalry outriders had flushed an ambush forcing four or five armed men out of hiding on the righthand side of the road stampeding some of their horses and leaving a few of their armed foes to dart about on foot out of the bushes onto the verge of the road twiggs horsemen were whooping and hollering sabres in hand after discharging their pieces and slashing their way through thick foliage on the right take close aim sir hugo bellowed loud enough for the coachee and his assistant in the box and lewries sailors on the coachtop to hear lewrie tried to find a window on the far side but burgess filled one and his father the other and twigg nighbackhanded lewrie out of the way as he took post in the door window shots rang out powder smoke filled the coachs interior in an instant and muffled return shots thunked into the body of the coach and one of their wheel horses making it scream with shock surprise and pain got im sir hugo crowed in old battlelust take that ye bastard one tlarboard ware larboard desmond shouted down and lewrie swivelled awkwardly about to level a pistol in that direction before their coach galloped past the threat he got off one shot but missed by a wide margin with the mad swaying and rocking of the coach the foeman ducked turned and darted away into the woods on the far side of the road abandoning his musket and pistols in his wake so he could run faster or pop up innocent as anything later on and feign mere curiosity shootin wot shootin an where lewrie dared stick his head and shoulders out the leftside window just in time to see one of their outriders dash cross the road and into the woods in pursuit of that escaping highwayman sabre held ready for a pursuit slash that could remove a fleeing foes head from his shoulders or slice his back open from the nape of his neck to his waist a faint view halloo and he disappeared into the forest twigg was thumping his walkingstick on the roof and the coach slowed and came to a stop so they could all spring down with loaded weapons or swords out back behind them there were bodies staining the gravel and dirt with blood sprawled like heaps of castoff clothes perkins the leader of their outriders knelt over one man who gasped and twitched his deaththroes to twiggs tacit query perkins heaved a shrug and shook his head the fellow was gone the outrider lewrie had seen gallop into the woods returned to the road as well all smiles and with his sabre blade bloodied right to the hilt got em all sir perkins yelled half a dozen all told and all dead he confirmed as all his men returned whole fetch em all out sergeant perkins twigg sourly ordered as he sheathed his unused smallsword and search their bodies for any letters or large sums of money that might point to the one who paid them usual drill hmm damn id have wished for one witness for a magistrate to attest to a few minutes later and six dead men were laid out in a line together pockets turned out and belongings being sorted through for clues pipes plugs of tobacco pocket knives hanks of twine tokens from taverns for free drinks or doxies which in coinstarved england in time of war could almost be passed as easily as crown coinage and what seemed a rather suspicious amount of the new muchhated paper currency too much for the hobbledehoy griminess and castoff finery that their late assailants sported too much chink for needy highwaymen burgess chiswick said as he counted the loose crumpled stack of bills if theyd stolen this much earlier id think theyd be off celebrating spending it like water not staging another robbery somebody paid them to do a job certain he firmly decided it would appear so sir mr twigg agreed pacing among those rumpled bodies and poking them with his walkingstick as if attempting to make at least one of them blab his secret in a deathcroak but no sign of who or writtendown instructions to explain why ours and lewries coach was their specific target the attack on us might as well have been instigated by some disgruntled liverpool slave traders businessmen involved in sugar rum and molasses trading bah twigg snarled kicking one of the dead highwaymen in the rib cage so how did they know who to shoot at lewrie fretted whom twigg primly corrected at whom tshoot said sir hugo tsk tsk bugger was lewries frustrated comment we must take these curs to the nearest magistrate no matter twigg directed the attack upon us points the finger at someone at any rate for it most certainly was not random nor may i recall all that many highwaymen working in broad daylight nor in such numbers i am certain that a magistrate will find this crime unusual as well unusual enough to raise dire suspicions in the right quarters he said with an enigmatic grin too bad their leader there didnt carry one o those damned abolitionist tracts with alans saintly features illustrated sir hugo snickered so hed know his quarry does anyone happen to have any of them twigg asked pity i would suppose any that you kept are aboard your ship in portsmouth lewrie i dont keep em lewrie groused they went right into the quartergallery for bumfodder long since sounds a bit sacreligious that burgess japed wiping your fundament with pictures of saint alan the liberator only banned in catholic countries lewrie shot back ahem mr twigg loudly harrumphed to stifle their low levity as i was saying gentlemen we must convince the local magistrate that this assault was not a random event then tracts yayss he drawled reverend wilberforce and his associates in the antislavery crowd can turn this into a positive flood of new tracts whether the beaumans were the instigators or not the attempted murder of their champion their paladin by person or persons unknown combine that sensational news with hints of slaver or sugar interests and the merest mention of how the beaumans arrival barely a week before coincides so mysteriously ah nothing libellous to be certain but newspapers sir hugo suggested though he despised them just so sir hugo twigg said almost twinkling with delight the latest editions have featured rumours of lewries impending trial so news of this will make quite the uproar newspaper owners editors and newswriters are in the main a sad and scurrilous lot of neerdowells drunks whores and gossipmongers five pounds in the proper inkstained hand will buy you favourable words in any publication and one can skirt libel in a printed letter signed with a pseudonym such as elia of the strong opinions who is really charles lamb for all the london papers to be inundated with a slew of anonymous letters speaking in lewries favour and subtly linking this attack to the beaumans well even the most cursory reader might make the hinted connexion ha ha good lord more press lewrie thought with a groan my field twigg smugly allowed i shall see to it in the meantime well disarm ourselves and our people i doubt there will be a second ambush awaiting us today ill send perkins and his men on ahead separately there will be covert work for them in london before our arrival now when we wake the nearest dozing magistrate let us agree that we had no outriders and that i sir hugo lewrie and major chiswick were the only ones of our party who bore weapons i see no need to involve ajit roy or exhavildar singh or your sailors lewrie we were suspicious dye see of the lurking rider who stood watch for us then armed ourselves a bare minute before these felons burst from the woods and began firing at us no stand and deliver demand for us to stop and hand over any valuables twigg intently schemed but an attempt on all our lives got it sir hugo said with a quick nod you fellows twigg instructed the coachee and his assistant up on the box hide your weapons and dont let on that you were armed when it happened right same for you navy lads your captain lewrie his father major chiswick and i did all the shooting right aye sor coxn desmond firmly replied peering at big jones nelson who grunted his understanding then at his mate furfy who was looking a bit puzzled ill spell it out for ye pat makes a better tale for th newspapers an helps th capm ah arrah i git it furfy replied with a wide smile we have all the miscreants horses perkins capital twigg crowed bind them over their saddles fetch their weapons into the boot of the coach for evidence and well be on our way at least alan burgess opined as they stuffed the dead mens small possessions into a drawstring bag theres no survivors left so no way for the beaumans to know their ambush failed and no alert for anyone else hiredon in london theyll be completely in the dark bout where you or any of us go and lads sir hugo added in right good humour as he swung an armful of muskets into the boot when word of this gets out among the london badmashes that half a dozen o their stoutest met their maker how manyll be willin thire on with the beaumans after ha and with mister twiggs watchers and followers to guard us burgess said taking time to reload and reprime one of his pistols in spite of twiggs assurance that the worst was over and seeking out where the beaumans have lit theres a good chance we might know how many more we must watch out for perhaps spot them by face the beaumans ah sir hugo said inspired to set the scene even further by drawing his smallsword and bloodying it with the gore of a dead highwayman now slung headdown cross a saddle then wiping the blade clean on a pocket handkerchief evidence he snickered as he did so a couple of em got hacked tbits so some of us must own blooded swords dye see you burgess you son you were sayin bout the beaumans lewrie asked as he obeyed his fathers suggestion with twiggs men tsmoak out their lodgings and with a little money tinspire the local captain tom o the mob in their parish the beaumans might not get a single night o rest anywhere in london hue and cry rocks an cobblestones through the right windows dung an mud slung at em when they dare go out by a properly outraged mob o londoners hmm a capital idea old friend twigg applauded as he rejoined them at the coach door the blooded swords and the harassment both let an anonymous letter or two get into the papers suggesting that a pack of cruel and arrogant slaveholders have no place in a civilised england in london and theyll rue the day they took ship i believe i may be able to arrange that as well come then twigg ordered turning grimmer let us be away the quicker were done with the magistrate the sooner we shall be in london where we will dine on roast lamb and tandoori chicken then our plans may be set afoot chapter fifteen and it was a true far eastern hindi feast the sort of thing that lewrie ravenously remembered from his time in calcutta all four of them attable in twiggs baker street house that evening were veterans of india and each new course was cheered much like the arrival of the christmas pudding genteel and witty conversation expected of diners at refined english tables had given way to lipsmacking slurping and only occasional sallies in finding new adjectives and adverbs to congratulate twigg on his chef and his creations but instead of lingering over nuts sweet biscuits and port and entertaining each other with the aforesaid witty conversations to the wee hours their small party broke up just before ten of the clock sir hugo and trilochan singh taking the short walk to his private townhouse and burgess chiswick yawning heavily off to the madeira club where sir hugo had arranged a room and temporary membership you are surely exhausted by our arduous adventure today sir twigg imperiously announced as if the matter was settled and by the early hour at which you and we were forced to arise for our journey ajit roy will light you up to a spare bedroom for the night you are sure you brought along your best uniform your medals and such good such a brave show your barrister assures me will go a long way with the lord justice who will conduct your evidentiary hearing tomorrow good night bonne nuit achchhaa raat sonaa tkeek all that achchhaa raat sonaa theekgood night sleep well thankee again sir lewrie replied loath as he was to give twigg thanks for much of anything for he still had his lingering suspicions of the mans motives we breakfast at seven in this house was twiggs parting comment as he betook himself to his firstfloor study with a lit candle with no acknowledgement of lewries gratitude sincere or not if twiggs country estate spyglass bungalow was hindiexotic a museum and treasure trove of priceless far east relicts his london house was the epitome of subtly understated palladian grandeur a home furnished and decorated by a rich but modest english gentleman from the crown of his head to the tip of his toes albeit with rather more firepower available than most no bejeweled tulwars or valuable asian matchlock or flintlock jenails but here a guncabinet there a guncabinet a brace of rifled duelling pistols in a glass case in the salon a brace of rare ferguson rifled breechloading muskets standing in the library and doublebarreled fowling pieces secreted behind almost every open door twigg obviously was a fellow whod spent too long in the field to sleep well without something bangworthy near to hand in lewries own spacious but darkly panelled bedchamber his own doublebarreled mantons were set out on the winetable much like a house servant might spread out his housewife shaving kit ready for the morning there was a shotgun presumably loaded and primed for any emergencies twixt the wall corner and the armoire and a brace of infantry hangers crossed on the wall near the door sleep well mine arse lewrie thought as he undressed court in the mornin gaol right after dinner and the noose after breakfast o th next day shit he did give sleep a try sans the silk anklelength night shirt so thoughtfully laid out for him for even the mild warmth of a london summer was a tad too hot the wee decanter of brandy left on the nightstand didnt help much either nor did the rumble of wheels the clops of hooves or the squeal of axles from the street outside even if the road had been strewn with straw to dampen the din window open and the noise was maddening window closed and it was too stuffy to breathe he sponged off and dressed in slippers breeches and shirt and padded back down to the first floor with a candle in his hand to find a book to read or another decanter of brandy at the library rooms door though he heard a suspicious noise there was a skritching and rustling sounding as if someone had snuck into the house despite all of twiggs security and was rifling through his files there was also a gurgling bubbling sound someones throat had been cut and was now in his final gasps for air the office door was open and there was a light inside so he went on tiptoes to investigate but no it was only mr twigg sitting crosslegged on a pile of large and garish tasseled pillows with a portable writing desk in his lap and quill pen in hand now more comfortably dressed in equally garish pyjammy trousers and robe with a long night cap on his head now and again sucking on the mouthpiece of a hubblebubble pipe and blowing smoke rings tween scribbled thoughts oh tis you twigg snippishly said cant sleep hey oh come in then if you must i thought tfind a book or lewrie said excusing his oddhour ramble was it doctor samuel johnson who said that the idea of being hanged concentrates the mind most wondrously some scribbler yayss twigg drawled or it very well might have been boswell to make the old grump sound more lively youre up late lewrie commented as he found a more conventional seat in a wingback chair looking about for a bottle of something i find that as i age the need for sleep is less twigg said finishing off whatever he was writing with grand nourish and a smug sniff of pleasure before sanding it and setting the paper aside of course when younger and more active in the crowns service overseas i perhaps developed a habit of sleeping with one eye open in short bouts and have never really lost it you i should expect usually have no difficulty sleeping deep long and well insult me more why dont you lewrie silently groused something about all this has disturbed my sleep for the last year or better lewrie said and what is that lewrie twigg asked looking nettled to be interrupted in his thought processes as he prepared a fresh sheet of paper and dipped his quill into the inkpot why you of all people all of a sudden are so solicitous for me lewrie said half the time i imagine youre saving me for future work upon your behalf the other half the time i think im being used in some scheme youve dreamt up but for the life o me i cant find what advantage there is in it i can halfway believe that you are as opposed to slavery as wilberforce and his crowd but knowing you and your ways by now im always haunted by knowing that nothing with you is ever that clear that you always have an ulterior motive or a whole set o motives am i to hang as your martyr to further some grand scheme o yours or twigg took a pull on his hookah pipe smiling mysteriously all those damned tracts an such was it you or the abolitionists who ran em up hired cruikshank tdo the artwork lewrie pressed they cant afford all that surely perhaps i merely wish to watch you wiggle twigg snickered twixt honesty and morality and whatever feels necessary at the time and pleasureable to you following your career can be very entertaining ye know well it seems a night for home truths so i will this once mind explain my motives to you slavery twigg harrumphed almost rolling his eyes as long as there are hindu ryots and irish daylabourers england has no need of slavery lewrie it is a despicable abhorrent practice one which all civilised gentlemen must deplore i personally despise slavery but that is of no matter any more than your own detestation of it preceded your liberation of those dozen beauman slaves or is a sudden conversion by indictment he just has tgoad me even when hes serious lewrie thought but where does slavery principally thrive lewrie here in england in france or the germanies in sweden no europe and the civilised parts of the world have done away with it the french abolished slavery even in their west indies colonies all that liberte egalite fraternite nonsense taken to the ultimate extreme for that giddiness i might almost admire them the rest of the world ha what heathen pagan backward cultures may do in their benighted lands of no consequence to britain or anyone else bothers me not a fig lewrie cocked his head over that seeming hypocrisy which only made zachariah twigg snigger in smug amusement slavery thrives in spanish and portuguese dominions lewrie twigg continued after a satisfying puff at his hubblebubble one a continual foe one a doubtful neutral their colonial economies and the wealth that flows to spain and portugal from them could not survive without slave labour in mines and fields consider also the united states of america whose constitution may claim that all men are created equal but restricts full rights to european descendants a quarter of the inhabitants cross the atlantic were slaves before their revolution and their numbers yearly increase through the further importation of slaves the fecundity of the negro race and the lascivious doings of their masters who indulge in a sordid practice which so i am told is termed going through the cabins to wit the rape and impregnation of comely negresses as a matteroffact rightl now just when dye think lewrie twigg archly posed might the enchained and oppressed in the americas take the uprising of saint domingue or haiti or whatever they call it these days to heart and fight to free themselves and what happens to those nations which thrive and grow rich and more powerful on the backs of their slaves chaos civil war slaughter and massacre lewrie gasped generations of it bad as saint domingue for certain and how important in the scheme of things will toussaint louvertures free and independent haiti ever be lewrie twigg asked in triumph too embroiled inside of themselves to ever become a foe to britain or a substantial ally to other powers opposed to us their economies so bankrupt that maintaining a navy to face ours would be impossible effectively isolating them all in their own regions unable to affect the expansion of the british empire beyond the range of some yew heavy fortress guns much less affect europe and twigg concluded with great satisfaction ripe for the plucking should we ever wish such hapless ungovernable snake pits my god thats christ lewrie goggled in awe thinking of the hundreds of thousands no the millions doomed to die in revolts should they require arms and powder well twigg waved off i dont know whether tcongratulate you or curse you lewrie finally said all the americas up in flames blood flowin like rivers take your eudoxia durschenko she of the long fine limbs and firm breasts lewrie twigg continued huh what what does she have tdo with ever been to the russias lewrie twigg almost benignly asked i have serfdom is the achilles heel of the tsars as bad an institution as slavery once outside the grand palaces and salons of their refined frenchspeaking aristocracy russia is as backward and appalling as a trip back to the dark ages all mud mire and shite a serf is a landless tenant so dependent upon the good will of his land owner that he can be flogged to death with great bullwhips knouts they call them for looking at them cross turf a serf and his family off the land for some offence and they become lepers pariahs unwelcome anywhere and usually starve to death the tsar wishes to fight a war he has to raise troops and sends word down to the country aristocracy hey ho each estate must conscript twentyorso young men for the army and off they go for twenty years service marched very far away from home ground and barracked among strangers so should they be called out to read the equivalent of the riot act and fire on the locals they have no compunctions whatsoever russian peasants are a brutal lot to begin with so demanding brutal measures from them is an easy matter twigg informed him with a shrug their pretty unmarried girls are prey for young aristocratic blades as well and can be treated as brusquely as one may wish youd turn all russia topsyturvy too lewrie gawped really in need of strong drink by then this was appalling stuff and more proof of twiggs coldbloodedness ye think on a grand scale damme if ye dont but a russia whose serfs rise up at long last the veterans still young enough the youths not yet conscripted along with them and supplied with arms from somewhere twigg said with an evil wee smile cannot field an army to save itself much less interfere in the rest of europe as they dearly wish to do you were in the west indies and missed our invasion of the dutch batavian republic in horrid muddle that with the russian navy and army as temporary but prickly allies sent forces from the black sea into the aegean the adriatic and eastern mediterranean and dearly wished to remain in possession of anything they could lay their hands on til the tsar learned that he would not be given malta as the new commander of the knights of saint john and recalled all their forces impossible for us to invade possessed of millions of militaryage men hence impossible for us to contain should they put their minds to expanding their empire westward a rebellion of the serfs could estop that for a long time ask your mistress eudoxia how her family barely a cut above serfdom suffered should you ever run into her again but what emerges from the ruins mister twigg lewrie asked most likely a weak and fractious land wracked by eternal wars tween various regions and warlords twigg said with relish could i snap my fingers and turn all france to dust and bones i would do so lewrie a nation which wishes to survive has no friends only interests and the united states lewrie wondered hmmpf as i recall from the reports sent me by you and jemmy peel that loose federation of sovereign states is already at loggerheads the southern states distrust the cold natures of the people of new england the northern states mock the culture manners accents and cuisine of the southern as early as northern writers show scorn for southerners and their institution of slavery which is dying out in new england even if it is the new englanders who own and make their money from slave ships and negro importation if there is more antislavery sentiment in the north we shall capitalise on that if the southern states feel oppressed we shall find some way to provide diplomatic and military aid therefore widening the break in the unity of the united states that nation is far too young to have a nationwide ethos as of yet mens loyalites lie within their particular states borders much more than the federal entity which is fardistant and as distrusted by most as englishmen distrust a large army and this is crown policy your ultimate ploy lewrie asked but what of our own economy the sugar and all from the west indies we ban slavery throughout the british empire lewrie giving us the moral and ethical guinea stamp twigg schemed which will be as valuable as any amount of lost trade besides the southern united states are almost completely agricultural may we by diplomatic and moral force make slavery so shameful an institution in america that the federal government bans it at least bans the further importation of africans they are crippled in need of imported goods finance and friends dye see our shipping interests sugar interests will go where the products are will make just as much money as they did before and will be just as happy the navigation acts will not be violated for british exports in british bottoms will sail to ports in the south and return with all the timber tobacco naval stores rum and molasses as before in addition to the burgeoning sources of flax and hemp for linen and rope and the newer southern crops such as sugar cane and cotton if the liverpool slavers in the triangle trade are harmed if the few sugar grandees in the west indies go out of business then it is a small price to pay twigg happily concluded first though we have to abolish slavery in all british possessions lewrie rejoined and that involves me did i just stumble into this or you were lewrie once i became aware of your plight the perfect example with which to deepen the average englishmans detestation of slavery to make more people aware of the issue and in supporting a successful naval hero guilty of stealing blacks an act of liberation if you will so britain will be seen by the entire civilised world doing something about it leading the way setting a highminded example for the rest of the world to emulate wilberforce priestly hannah more and clarkson et al perhaps even the wesley brothers and their tooexuberant leaping methodism which has so taken hold of the common folk even bentham and his rot are reforming britain from the ground up fostering a stronger religiosity and the concurrent moral climate which accompanies such so that our christian duty will be in future to right the perceived wrongs of a sinful world ha ha even if that means i must hang in the process shit lewrie spat getting to his feet in search of twiggs study for something wet and spiritous he found a largeish cruet sort of bottle but its contents stank bad as hyena piss so he restoppered it wait a bit did you merely take advantage of me or did you see to it that my case had to go forward get splashed all over the papers could i have been swept under a rug your powers used tget me off to your previous question lewrie you stumbled into it as you usually do twigg said with what most people might deem a sympathic smile you alone leaped into a dunghill of your own volition and the beaumans followed their typically rapacious wont in pursuing you though lord balcarres viceadmiral sir hyde parker and your captain nicely did try to sweep you under the rug as you say once the matter became public about the same time that i became aware of it i decided to get involved to get you acquitted firstly and force the issue onto the public conscience and that is the bald truth oh for gods sake lewrie twigg snapped mercurially changing tone you wish a drink theres a bottle of brandy sitting right beside my daylilies the bloody flowers yonder and i seriously doubt you will hang how can you be so sure lewrie asked after a goodly slug and a smaller second right from the bottle as he sat back down your barrister mister andrew macdougall sent me a note this evening in reply to mine twigg related sucking meditatively on the mouthpiece of his hookah though many lord justices are away on the summer assizes tour some few remain in london to dispense justice so much crime these days so many trials to be held tis the war i expect which so unsettles our society that and the remnants of the spithead and nore mutinies the lawless examples of the american and the french revolutions and ahem lewrie grumpily reminded him impatiently shifting upon his chair some lord justices who preside at kings bench are impatient rash sorts who give the accused short shrift twigg said lips thin in asperity to be pressed to the point before he had ended his philosophical ramblings perhaps theyre paid by their number of convictions and executions they do not wish to involve themselves with any complex cases mister macdougall though has managed to have you appear before lord justice oglethorpe a most cautious and deliberative man a member of one of my clubs in point of fact lewrie damme is it already rigged i wonder he thought bit of a pedant really and a dead ruminative bore do you meet him in person twigg continued so much so that he requires nigh an hour choosing from a chophouse menu but oglethorpes your man when it comes to reading glooming and meditating over every jot and tittle should have been appointed to chancery court where just crossing all the ts and dotting all the is could take five years or better and cases stretch out a young lawyers entire lifetime once macdougall presents the transcript of your trial in absentia on jamaica no lover of rude colonial concepts of justice is oglethorpe and sees the flaws in it you stand a very good chance of being carried forward to hilary term next january oh joy i lewrie thought with a groan six more months of agony an fret six more months for you twigg t shout abolition in papers and tracts hmmm though six months o hugh beauman stuck in london bleedin pounds sterling out his arse lovely our ambush too lewrie further mused aloud word o thatd put him out o sorts too id expect word of that right alongside the announcement of your appearance at kings bench this morning will hit the streets in the early editions twigg smugly told him mister macdougall was appalled at the news of it but also delighted pleased as punch he said in his note that the beaumans or some other interest closely involved with slavery could have been so infernally stupid and arrogant as to attempt such a clumsy and brutal murder in broad daylight trust to the tract printers as well lewrie who have been toiling away this night running off express numbers which condemn the attempt in exclamations of the most florid sort the kingston magistrates written conclusions and eyewitness accounts from among our party your father and major chiswick principally forgive me if i prefer that my part in the affair remains unmentioned will be quite the sensation so much so that even an impartial lord justice may not be immune well lewrie dithered bottle resting on one knee and his limbs sprawled in contemplation you wont be there then oh yes i shall be twigg informed him frowning as the fire in the upper bowl of his hubblebubble pipe went out though not in close proximity to you in the dock nor with the first rows of attendees will that be all lewrie are you more settled of mind drunk enough for sleep at last pray god for i still have several more letters that must be distributed about the city just after dawn aye i spose lewrie decided corking the bottle and rising to stretch and force a yawn which always helped put his body in touch with his mind and fool it into rest with any luck at all perhaps my trial may get postponed til after easter hah more time for hugh beauman tstew and twiddle his thumbs away from his precious plantations spendin money like a drunken sailor he has brought quite the entourage as the french call such a large retinue his witnesses and jamaican attorney and his new wife twigg sniggered a classic young and beautiful batter pudding so i am informed and their personal black servants that wont make em popular in london lewrie scoffed anne died im sorry thear that she was the one redeemin member of the whole damned clan damned shame he said more soberly they have not been in london a fortnight twigg continued in a somewhat merry taking and i doubt theres a single fashionable shop she has not set foot in as my irregulars report hugh beauman dotes on her like the most foolish colts tooth cully i doubt that they shall much enjoy their enforced stay not if your father and i have anything to say about the matter the mob indeed hmm hmm ill wish you goodnight then mister twigg see you at seven ajit roy will wake you at six achchhaa raat lewrie twigg coolly bade him now go shoo bugger off and let me work chapter sixteen another little matter lewrie dared say to the taciturn twigg at breakfast for he had learned through wretched previous experience that zachariah twigg was not a man to speak to before his fourth cup of coffee you recall our talk last year at your country estate in hampstead i know where i reside sir twigg snapped as if vexed beyond all temperance must you about those anonymous letters to my wife lewrie dared essay hmmph what of them twigg said with a stern warning glare i have two of em with me mister twigg lewrie said pulling the two most recent letters from the breast pocket of his best uniform coat left there and forgotten til he had dressed that morning and a tad trepidatious slid them over towards twiggs breakfast plate if ye havent actually seen one before well dont think my father had an example tshow ye either you said ye might be able tsmoak out who it was sendin em so ah twigg said with a putupon sniff those which you once suspected that sent just to plague you those damning and anonymous letters lewrie aye was lewries daunted reply well damme twigg said issuing forth the sort of sigh that usually preceded a deathsentence from a judge he laid aside his fork and knife though swivelled sideways and crossed his legs his coffee cup in one hand and the first letter in the other an expensive bond paper mostlike sold in two dozen of the better stationers shops in the larger cities besides london a rather fair copperplate hand as well the letters smaller and finer than those done with a quill pen so i might deduce that your anonymous tormentor owns a finepoint steelnib pen flourishes and unnecessary serifs here and there so i doubt the writer is a military man almost prissy hmm at one time i recall that you also suspected one commander fillebrowne yet have you run into him since your service in the adriatic neither hide nor hair sir lewrie answered emboldened by the mans curiosity which was now piqued and during your brief association with fillebrowne did you gather any impression of fussiness idle languid vain and arrogant aye but not fussy lewrie told him before returning his attention to his toast butter and jam after a bite chew and swallow he added came of a rich family they all did their grand tours of the continent art collectors all that thinks damned well of himself i cant recall we ever corresponded by letter so i wouldnt know his writing style i shall ask of him at admiralty and compare his hand to this twigg promised though i very much doubt twigg shuffled pages scowling at what he read did any of this bawdiness occur lewrie absolutely not lewrie could say and with some heat too i swear on my sacred word of honour not with sophie nor eudoxia either odd twigg said with a smirk evidently he was now fully awake and back to his usual toplofty asperity no mention is here made of your bastard son desmond mcgilliveray peel wrote me on that head twigg said with a sunnily sarcastic smile indeed a british frigate captain meeting his byblow a midshipman in the united states navy in the west indies offspring of a temporary marriage to a cherokee indian wench well your reputation and sobriquet of the ramcat is now widespread in the fleet so i do not understand why fillebrowne is he your tormentor would not have heard of it has your wife at any time thrown this particular bastard in your face the only own she seemed aware of was theoni connors lewrie told him and damme thatun was bad enough he grimly thought then it is patently obvious that your unknown scribbler has no knowledge of desmond mcgilliverays existence either twigg assumed hence not a navy man nor anyone of long acquaintance with you doesnt narrow the field much though lewrie said yayss theres a myriad of people with a grudge against you twigg sniggered damme lewrie but i could spend the rest of my entire career defending you from yourself lewrie winced and hid behind the rim of his own coffee cup intriguing this though twigg muttered quickly rereading both letters and frowning in deep study ive a suspicion but i will say no more for the nonce he folded the letters and stuffed them into a side pocket of his sober black coat a pull on his watch and a peer at its face and he turned brisk at finishing his last cup of coffee and dabbing his lips before rising and throwing his napkin onto his plate time we should be going youre to meet macdougall by eight my coach is already brought round half a chop half his eggs and a freshbuttered slice of toast remaining lewrie had barely made a dent in his own meal but grumble you may but go you must was the days motto besides by noon he could be remanded to gaol in the old bailey which dread thought made what little he had consumed turn to a pounder roundshot chapter seventeen but for the circumstances it might have been a hearty reunion in the grim and dour courtroom so darkly panelled and gloommaking lord peter rushton was there all huzzahs and taking a morning from parliament not that he did all that much when he did sit in session along with a fancily dressed clotworthy chute another old companion from harrow a moonfaced fubsy captain sharp who looked as if his career at fleecing newcome countryput heirs was progressing nicely sir malcolm shockley had taken the morning from the house of commons along with his wife lucy ironically once hugh beaumans sister still stunningly pretty blond and fair with the most amazing aquamarine eyes beestung red lips short and sweetly rounded figure and the wits of an addled sheep one discovered after an hour in her company and why lewrie ever thought her a fine match back in he could no longer fathom beauman money and those tits he decided thinking back on his early years as a penniless futureless midshipman his father and burgess chiswick were both there in full uniforms of their respective services burgess attending miss theodora trencher and her parents from the abolitionist society so it appeared that hed made good progress in his suit as was the rev clarkson whom lewrie had met at the trenchers home to gain the abolitionists support and by god so were the rev william wilberforce mistress hannah more and a platoon of the leading lights in the clapham sect and reformminded his barrister mr macdougall made the introductions to a very welldressed youngish man as sir samuel whitbread he of the vast brewery fortune who led a pack of likeminded younger progressives in both commons and lords all of whom had to pump lewries paw and tell him that he was the very devil of a fellow the greetings and introductions took so long that lewrie could imagine that he was at old boys week at one of the many public schools he had briefly attended and the captain of the champion cricket team to boot your wife and family captain lewrie macdougall fretted in a whisper as they finally neared the defence table they do not attend twould have been better were they to be seen in support dont even ask mister macdougall lewrie muttered back with a forced smile plastered on his phyz and a cynical roll of his eyes now were here what exactly am i to do look innocent of course macdougall softly instructed wryly grinning rise with the others when the lord justice is announced hat off and when called upon enter the prisoners dock there he said directing lewries attention to a railed square dais before the judges higher and ornate bench identify yourself when asked and when put to the question of guilt or innocence state firmly that you are not guilty it is pro forma not too loudly or emphatically mind nil desperando hmm calm forthright perhaps with a touch of indignation that you are forced to be here but not so much of that as to appear arrogant else you might put off the jury once we begin to lay our arguments you may sit but you must remain erect and attentive continuing your calm demeanour no twitches shivers tics or pulling faces the lord justice will note such as signs of guilt as would a jury once empanelled though i firmly doubt we shall get that far today you may even evince surprise or disagreement with what sir george norman the prosecutor may use in his statement but you must not cry out in protest like playin whist is it stonefaced lewrie asked ascowl very like captain lewrie macdougall said ah here comes our opposition can i glower at em glowering to a point is allowed macdougall told him indicating that he should take a seat behind the accuseds table for a bit glower lewrie did developing an instant and instinctive abhorrence for the prosecuting attorney sir george norman for that worthy was a very sleek and elegant fellow in his early thirties with perfect wavy blond hair underneath his sidecurled court peruke and strutting languid as a peacock in his black silk robe attended by a pair of law clerks who carried his files and such for him glower even hotter for right behind him came hugh beauman the stout bastard glaring angrily at one and all hugh beauman had come as grandly dressed as anyone could wish his hat was a sleek and fat beaver planters hat pinned up on one side adrip with egret plumes and trimmed at the brims with silver lace over light blue ribbon his coat an older frock style richly embroidered in almost a paisley swirl of turquoise light blue and light grey satin under that his waistcoat was a longer oldstyle figured and embroidered pale gold silk or some other shimmery stuff his breeches were the same pale gold colour but thankfully plain silk or satin with white silk stockings and his clunkyheeled black shoes bore real gold buckles inlaid with diamond chips he slowly paced employing a long ebony walkingstick with its gold ferrule and a large gold knob atop a clompin breedin bull tarted up for auction lewrie thought tryin for languid angraceful too and a wig like that powdered havent seen such a macaroni in twenty years height o fashion my arse who found his tailor clotworthy chute hugh beaumans face was set in a porcine fullchinned highnosed look of royal boredom surely an affected sham taught him far in the past by outdated tutors though he did let it slip a bit when he finally deigned to let his slow gaze turn far enough to espy lewrie at the accuseds table sprised im still alive are ye lewrie sarcastically thought or perhaps beaumans arrogant demeanour had been shaken more by the rustle of titters and snide whispers that those who attended the court made when they saw his garish suitings the snickers among the ladies present certainly nettled the arch woman on beaumans arm whoever she was or had been before beaumans new wife had not been exposed to london fashion or the harsh judgement of the fashionable for she was tricked out like a bookend to her husband tooelegantly gowned in the same embroidered and figured pale gold material as hugh beaumans waistcoat her wide straw bonnet ribboned with cloth that matched his coat and bound under her chin with a pale blue ribbon over her shoulders she wore a gauzy and diaphanous blue shawl figured in silver lace and lewrie just knew that her shoes held real gold buckles with diamond chips too she was tall for a woman about five inches shy of six feet in her heeled shoes slim and willowy coolly ash blond and with eyes of the most disconcerting and icy pale green she was strikingly lovely lewrie thought her but with the air of an unimpressed empress forced to appear among the lowly imperious cold but very aware of the power of her looks deserve each other i swear they do lewrie thought and speculated who had selected their attire hugh beauman or her and at the end of the day who would get scathed for it in the privacy of their lodgings that d put a chill on beaumans new domestic bliss then to the further embarrassment of the beaumans there came in their wake a brace of blacks in livery grander and more giltlaced than any admiral or general both very darkskinned and young teenagers in pure white wigs just far enough behind the beaumans to appear as if they could bear the hems of long royal trains if required another brace of female slave servants quite comely young girls in a matching livery also entered ready to see to mrs beaumans every whim and the titters and snickers from the onlookers turned to hisses and catcalls fie for shame boo rippled through the audience abashing the wife whose cheeks turned crimson but only serving to anger hugh beauman further make ye pay lewrie he growled across the room shaking one fist in lewries direction hang damn yer eyes which utterance set off a wave of outright revulsion and winces from sir george norman and the jamaican attorney who had been gawping about in bumpkinish fashion to enter a real english court of law for a fleeting moment lewrie could almost feel sorry for the prosecuting barrister sir george norman kc as he tried to silence his troublesome client for that worthy looked about fed up to here with beauman and his crudities just for a wee bit though after all does one lie down with dogs one rises with fleas the grim thud of a mace and a cry of oyez oyez oyez drew everyone to their feet to honour the majestic entry of lord justice oglethorpe the chief bailiff intoning the ancient opening ritual to awe them with the power and solemnity of justice all who have business before this honourable court draw forward and be heard should i keep my sword on or lewrie muttered unsure of a sudden at naval courtsmartial it would lay on the judges table god aim wear it now hist macdougall whispered back the accused will enter the dock the bailiff announced and lewrie stepped into it standing right by the rail with his arms at his side at attention bare headed state your name and occupation sir he bade as if there was any doubt of lewries line captain alan lewrie royal navy he stated captain lewrie i charge you now began lord justice oglethorpe up behind the bane and seated upon a highbacked chair resembling the throne of a minor kingdom you stand accused of a heinous crime the theft of twelve black slaves from a plantation on the crown colony of jamaica three years past and the offer of armed violence in the perpetration of that act how do you respond to these charges sir not guilty my lord lewrie firmly answered in a voice close to a quarterdeck call counsellor macdougall you are ready to proceed sir i am in all respects my lord macdougall responded sir george for the prosecution are you ready to proceed sir i am milud came the nasal oxonian drawl you may sit captain lewrie oglethorpe instructed begin if you will sir george milud gentlemen and ladies we are come today to present to this honourable court the results of a capital trial already concluded one held in a court of law in kingston jamaica which resulted in a guilty verdict against captain lewrie and a sentence oi death by hanging a proceeding conducted in absentia due to the fact that captain lewrie had upon learning of his impending trial fled the jurisdiction surely the act oi a man who acknowledges his guilt and fears the consequences of his crimes lewrie sat stiffbacked head up but fuming as the worst sort of calumny was poured out against him when the vilest sort of lies were trotted out in normans opening statements lies guineastamped by the presence of the trial transcript which the prosecutor took for granted as gospel truth lewrie just had to frown and scowl to gawp in astonishment and look to macdougall for help wondering why he was sitting slouched and silent merely rolling his head at the worst of the accusations even pretending to study his fingernails and speculate did they need a cleaning with his penknife ask you milud to uphold the verdict found against captain lewrie as well as the sentence and remand him to prison so that the sentence may be carried out i thank you for your attendance upon my presentation milud and feel certain that you will find for the prosecution so that mister hugh beauman esquire may find justice at last and the return of his property before this honourable court his presentation completed sir george norman turned about with his robe flaring and solemnly paced back to the prosecutors table to sweep his robe forward so he could sit in his chair with an exhausted but smugly satisfied sigh fold his hands together atop the table and sit stiffbacked and chin high slightly smiling as if he had passed orals at oxford and was just waiting to be awarded a wellearned blue counsellor macdougall justice oglethorpe solemnly prompted andrew macdougall leaped to his feet quick as a striking cobra took several impatient steps to a post before the bench and stamped to a stop doubtless waking every nodder in the courtroom after hearing sir georges sonorous declamations and cried all that has gone before milord is a perversity a total sham which declaration aroused several in the audience to shout hear hear like backbenchers in the commons aye milord there is the transcript of captain lewries trial on jamaica macdougall went on in the same heated tone to which we do not object for its introduction before this honourable court cuts both ways like a dualbladed knife on its face it seems legitimate but upon a closer reading and with more information anent the background which led to its conduct one may surely discover that such a trial conducted in absentia was held at such short notice that no one in crown government no officer senior to captain lewrie in the royal navy and certainly no friends or allies of his were even aware that it was on the docket before these sham proceedings were done note as well milord as you closely peruse the transcript the complete utter absence of any defence witnesses called not even one to attest as to captain lewries character for the very good reason milord that the barrister for captain lewries defence was found cooling his heels and scraping for cases at a tavern close by to the courthouse in kingston was given but half an hour to familiarise himself with the particulars by the local justice then was ordered to proceed before said defence attorney could at any odds say who exactly it was he was defending much less discover a witness for the defendant macdougall quickly accused that created a mighty stir of displeasure among lewries allies and the idle curious who had wandered in to witness a raree show as well which lord justice oglethorpe had to gavel down i would now wish to humbly submit as evidence to such a change milord a deposition properly witnessed by several gentlemen from the offices of lord balcarres the crown governor of jamaica upon that worthys stationery milord may note obtained from the defending attorney one mister herbert pruett esquire who and here i quote him from memory thought the matter extremely odd but was night the easiest twenty pounds and eight pence ever i have earned mister pruetts deposition will shew that he himself was not aware that a trial would be held that day milord and was in search of future proceedings when he was found in his cups he freely admits and given the brief do you then plead incompetent counsel sir oglethorpe asked looking a tad queasy with that revelation indeed not milord macdougall said as he handed over the affidavit to a clerk given the circumstances i doubt the ablest barrister in great britain could have done any better you will also note milord that mister pruett attempted to plead a delay so that he might discover witnesses but was denied and told to proceed at once by the presiding justice why milord macdougall said with an impish grin as he turned to face the back of the courtroom under such pressure even might have failed which made everyone the beaumans and their entourage excepted of course enjoy a good laugh secondly milord i would also to submit for your information a roster of the seated jurymen along with their occupations and their kinship to the beauman family their financial or business dependence upon or their direct employment by the plaintiff or their employment in the despicable slavetrading industry as evidence that the jurymen were most carefully selected beforehand to render a conviction and the sentence most desired by the plaintiffs namely the hanging of the man who participated in a duel as second to leftenentcolonel christopher cashman formerly commanding officer of the local regiment raised by the beaumans which duel resulted in the death of formercolonel of the regiment ledyard beauman and his cousin charles sellers both of whom cheated in the most egregious manner requiring captain lewrie and the judges to shoot him down as well milord will note that there is a man named sellers listed as a gentleman of the jury macdougall further accused and if this whole affair is not an act of personal revenge with the very majesty and dignity of the law perverted as revenges implement then i do not know what else to call it silence lord justice oglethorpe had to thunder above the baying and catcalls of the audience i will have silence in the court if milord pleases macdougall went on once the crowd had done with their booing i have also obtained and would lay before you as further evidence of previous grudges affidavits from the gentlemen at the duel and their official findings one of whom is a very wellrespected retired magistrate detailing how it all fell out resulting in the wound in the back suffered by leftenantcolonel cashman and the most necessary deaths of both ledyard beauman and charles sellers and their dishonourable conduct upon the field murderer hugh beauman bellowed leaping to his feet and just about beside himself with rage his face mottled nighpurple they were murdered that bastard lewrie silence i said oglethorpe roared right back banging away with his gavel and turning a choleric shade himself sir george i conjure you to control your partys outbursts bloody lies beauman went on despite sir george normans urgings and tuggings beauman shrugged him off like a street beggars hand slave stealer he is convicted want him hanged hear me like all the beaumans even when in calm takings hugh beauman pared his words to the bare minimum necessary and like all the clan anything that went against his instant wishes had to be crushed they had made themselves after all but despite the wealth and finery at bottom were tenanttramplin shootin huntin dogkissin slavewhippin john bull squires of the most brutish sort chawbacons for all their money there had been times even when headoverheels in lust for lucy beauman that lewrie hadnt been too sure of her can you not manage yourself sir i will have you removed from my courtroom oglethorpe threatened if beauman thought the boos he got before were insufferable they were nothing to the new chorus that rose up and continued despite the justices hammering when at last the din subsided and beauman had at last listened to reason from his hired barrister and his icy young wife macdougall presented his last affidavits to the clerks and held up a newspaper murder is it milord macdougall said with an indignant tone do we look for murder or its attempt we need look no further for it than the south bank of the thames just outside kingston no further in the past than yesterday for in the early afternoon six wellarmed men ostensibly highwaymen lay in ambuscade within sight of the spires of our great city and opened fire upon captain lewries coach fortunately for captain lewrie he was travelling with his father majorgeneral sir hugo saint george willoughby and his brotherinlaw and former major burgess chiswick late of the east india company army and a comrade with captain lewrie at the siege of yorktown from which they escaped due principally to thenmidshipman alan lewries abilities both with firearms and boats i might add who gave better than they got whilst none of these alleged highwaymen survived to testify as to their motives or who hired theml a rather large amount of money was found upon their persons leading one to believe that were they in the highwayman trade had at that moment no need to perpetrate a bold daylight robbery or he slyly paused someone deeply engaged with the slave trade slave shipping interests or someone unsure that a conviction and sentence of death could be obtained in an english court of law thought to eliminate the cause of their grief frustration and vengeance by hiring on a pack of toughs to do it for them or him it was a good thing that orangeselling wenches fruiterers or greengrocers were not allowed to do business in a law court as some of them did at the theatres else hugh beauman his elegant wife his witnesses and his barrister might have been buried under an avalanche of rotting goods even the most bored and cursory attendees found such a deed most heinous and foul and let loose a cacophony of abuse once more it just wasnt english hugh beauman leaped to his feet once more beetred and shaking fists at one and all baying something that was lost in the din and no amount of urging by sir george norman could sit him back down this time it took a full three minutes before the court was quieted milord macdougall said in the most reasonable of voices as loud as before upon the ear but that was due to the utter silence of the audience as if no one wished to miss his closing arguments in light of this event i would also wish to submit to you the depositions of captain lewrie and his travelling companions as well as the affidavit from the magistrate at kingston anent this sordid affair captain lewrie has been subjected to a star chamber proceeding as arbitrary as capricious as corrupt and premeditated as any suffered by gentlemen falsely accused and executed in less than an hour by that past body in late and unlamented times that blight upon our history our traditional sense of fairness justice and honour mr macdougall solemnly intoned grant law which obtains on jamaica is not english common law there injustice may be sanctified by wigs and robes and false solemnity this socalled trial in absentia which condemned captain lewrie a man of exemplary courage bravery sagacity and honour to death by hanging would never be countenanced in england milord i appeal to your common sense and your own sagacity your long experience upon the bench after reading all the pertinent evidence placed before you to set aside the verdict and sentence as a sham a fraud and the travesty of the very word justice that it is hear hear huzzah hear him boo from lewries supporters who by then included just about everyone in the courtroom should you find that the initial charges have merit milord macdougall further pled a trial conducted in an english court of law must ensue a trial to which captain lewrie looks forward with all eagerness so that he may clear his escutcheon of such sordid charges and certain of his innocence also eagerly expects his aquittal but this hookorbycrook jamaican proceeding i humbly ask you to set aside further milord macdougall said with a hand upon his breast in the interim captain lewrie is just completing the rigging arming and commissioning of a new ship soon to be despatched by admiralty gainst england s foes must britain be deprived of captain lewries extraordinary skills and talent for battle by ordering him to remain ashore awaiting milords decision or may he post a money bond with the court and agree upon his sacred honour to give up his command and return to england should you deem an honest trial necessary no by god no hugh beauman shouted mine i tell ye hes mine his barrister sir george norman didnt even try to contain the man this time but lowered his head and bit at his lip sagging in defeat even before a decision was forthcoming cant slip away silence sir oglethorpe roared the objectivity and dignity of the law bedamned at last bailiffs remove that man shame on you sir george fie upon your clienti which might have been a worse slur for barristersgentlemen who didnt engage in trade or handle moneydidnt have clients only briefs given the circumstances and the wealth of contrary evidence presented lord justice oglethorpe solemnly said once beauman and his party had been herded out in dire huffs i find myself forced to take some considerable time to weigh the various aspects of the aforesaid proceedings conducted on jamaica proceedings which upon their face begin to sound colourable macdougall swivelled about on his chair to grin at lewrie and then at those supporters from the abolitionist society seated behind him he even tipped lewrie the wink until such time as i come to a firm conclusion i will not as you counsellor macdougall request declare the result of the jamaican trial null and void but since such deep perusal and contemplation in search of the truth shall surely expand beyond this law term and in fact far into the michaelmas term i do find that there is no plausible reason why the accused may not be allowed his freedom after money bond is posted captain lewrie sir milord lewrie piped up rising to attention in the dock do you solemnly swear upon your honour as an english gentleman and a sea officer of the king to return to appear before this court at such time as i order oglethorpe posed to him i so swear milord lewrie firmly answered then you are sir for the moment free to go about your business on the kings service lord justice oglethorpe announced with a final rap of his gavel and these proceedings are for the nonce at a conclusion huzzah burgess chiswick howled setting off the crowd once more coming to embrace lewrie and pound him on the back the second he left the confines of the prisoners dock a great many people came to do the same clapping him on the back shaking his hand vigourously or even embracing him and from the ladies came enthusiastic curtsys and hand clasps even some fervent but chaste kisses upon his cheeks by the time his party reached the outer halls lewrie had amassed a rather cumbrous pile of posies and nosegays as well free to go really lewrie breathlessly asked his attorney for now yes captain lewrie macdougall happily assured him best we could expect and thank god for beauman behaving so dewitted doubt old oglethorpell uphold the jamaica trial so pardon me my dear lady a complete new trial will be necessary and we both know that the beaumans will press the matter hotly believe me when i tell you though captain lewrie that i am more than ready for that ha ha christ does it ever end lewrie glumly thought all joy of the moment dashed all this is but a temporary reprieve niggles aside i did steal em and theyll be the first tconfess that i did so then the rev william wilberforce was there along with hannah more the trenchers and their daughter theodora nighgiddy with ladylike thrills over the courts decision or to have a handsome suitor such as burgess chiswick at her side who had shot it out with hired assassins and won in support of the noble cause sir malcolm and lady lucy shockley were next up sir malcolm sternly but warmly in approval and even lucy acting delighted let us celebrate macdougall cried once they were outside ready to descend the steps to the street and their waiting coaches hang ye will hugh beauman swore from the window of his own departing coach shaking a fist and walkingstick at them get ye yet i will ye vile sonofabitch bastard which cries only thickened the shower of horse turds rotten vegetables curses and paving stones that followed him my treat and gladly lewrie began to say quite enjoying the sight and reaching for his washleather money bag but my god my moneys gone my pockets been picked frantically lewrie felt over his possessions and found his watch and fob gone too what in a court of law his father sir hugo gawped unsure whether it was funny or not hallo old son and joy o the day to ye lord peter

cheer along know the very place macdougall quickly agreed making lewrie sure that wherever they lit it would be grander and more expensive an establishment than any he had had to pay for with macdougall before alan might ye oblige me sir hugo asked oh remiss o me lewrie said ready to slap his forehead father allow me to name to you lord peter rushton and mister clotworthy chute old friends

nigh high summer so the fierce gales that could drive ships ashore to their ruin on the rocky and hostile western coast of france lay in the future god willingwhen the seasons turned to a brisk autumn then to a bitter and boisterous winter and one storm following the last for months on end all determined to batter and dismast and wreck the weary ships of the british blockading squadrons which kept remorseless watch over enemy seaports for a sally by their foe or to interdict all trade that might comfort arm or feed the french for now though it was paintbrushed high wisps of clouds upon beautiful cerulean skies the sort one might wish for when summering in some exotic locale and the seas tossed less than three to four feet in long marching wavesets flicked with only the faintest

twelve sail three points off th larboard bows tgallants an topsls in lineahead our lineofbattle ships oned think sir lt urquhart said as he turned to face his captain on the quarterdeck either that or the french are out and better managed than we expect sir lewrie replied with a snicker picking up a brass speaking trumpet he called aloft what course do they steer after a moment the lookout howled back down in lineahead due north thankee lewrie bellowed back then returned the trumpet to a slot in the compass binnacle cabinet ours mostlike were they the french theyd be scuttlin seaward as far from our liners as ever they could mister urquhart that or bound souwest t clear cape ferrol to join the dons again or pick up the noreast trades off portugal and stir up some mischief in the west indies are they really capable of that sir lt urquhart said with a derisive sneer so far this war theyve not shown that much skill at sea comes from sitting idle in the ports we blockade with very little time on the open seas true theres only so much trainin conscript sailors may do in port sir but someday some frog admiral will get lucky and put to sea in halfway decent shape slip by us get a fortnight a month or more of real workingup and they just might give us a bloody nose lewrie mused aloud to lt urquharts cocked eyebrow and dubious expression he added not that much a bloody nose but more a nasty surprise ive met some frogs who knew how to put up a good fight and they made my bung sport claret a time or two before we settled em never underestimate youre saying sir urquhart asked exactly so mister urquhart lewrie agreed now were nigh tcomin up on our squadron sir have a turn about the ship to search out anything thatd make savage look like a dowdy unkempt whore under the flags eyes and put it right before we come up alongside aye aye sir urquhart responded tapping the brim of his hat with two extended fingers a salute more casual than doffing it and ill go change lewrie said on which made lt urquhart fight a small grin for capt lewrie rn had come up from below in his dowdy and faded old coat no neckstock or waistcoat or sword belt and that coat three years before when first returned to the west indies lewrie had had the bright idea to have a tailor run up some coats in cotton not wool so to better survive the heat never expecting that dark bluedyed cotton would not hold its colour a sweaty supper aboard another officers ship and hed come back aboard his own with royal navy blue sweat rings and giant stains upon his shirt waistcoat and snowy breeches a few wearings more a daylong shower or two and those two coats had ended up the same pale blue as this days sky with the giltlace trim of buttonholes pocket seams and collars turned the oddest sickmaking gangrenous green shade the colour of deathly pus fortified by the verdigris green that all gilt lace turned after long exposure to salt water and sea airs and so repulsive that one expected them to reek like a corpses armpit lewrie stubbornly kept them for they were cooler than the usual wool uniform coats and at this stage could look no worse when washed which one could not do with wool they could be stuffed into a mesh bag and drug astern with the bed linens and by then had bled all the dye they were ever going to hence no threat to his other apparel oh yes lt edward urquhart was finding his new captain to be a most unusual bird deck there the lookout called again courses now in sight private signal from a threedeckerl mister grisdale lewrie said to one of the midshipmen on the quarterdeck hoist the flag and send up our number quickly now get his damned name right lewrie wondered too bloody many newcomes aboard he had already had a fair bit of fame or notoriety before the last battle against the french luranie frigate and after the papers got through with it one might have thought hed become admiral nelson or his new replacement arm letters had come aboard savage as she was just being manned from hopeful midshipmen without a post at present or from hopeful parents looking for advancement or a first place for their second or third sons not knowing any of them from adam though and with very little aid from other captains in portsmouth lewrie had pretty much been reduced to writing their names on stiff card stock and tossing them blindfolded into his upturned hat for all the chance to pick through the aspirants hed had savage a gunned frigate of the fifth rate of nearly tons burthen and with a larger crew of men required one midshipman for each fifty hands or so admiralty said that had meant five newcomes with the wellseasoned mr grace to make up the necessary six three including grace might might mind have the wits and abilities that god had merely promised geese there was this grisdale if that indeed was his name for lewrie was still sorting them out whod come passably recommended whose father was a rearadmiral of the blue when watched closely he could keep his mind to his duties so far it seemed but if not mr grisdale could be a lazy sprog so much akin to lewrie at that age that one could almost take a liking to him there was a midshipman locke whose father was in the commons and one of those steam engine men whod made a fortune off the war he at least was sixteen and had had some experience at sea stern and a bit of a martinet with the ships people but not a complete tyrant and lewrie and lt urquhart could chide that flaw from him there was a mr mayhall son of another rich and influential man landed in the huge way and aristocratic in both speech and airs oddly the crew seemed to take to him for though he was only fifteen he knew the ropes already and projected the aura of a lad who would be a proper sea officer someday should he survive the process then there was midshipman the honourable carrington and so far he was proving the truth of the old naval adage that titled families sent the family fool to sea he was sixteen and supposedly salted by a threeyear stint aboard a twodeckerbut good lordwas as dense as roundshot and nearly as inert and when prodded into motion was as dangerous as an pounder ball rolling cross the deck daddy was in lords though one of wilberforces fondest followers detested the slave trade and was very influential and lastly there was midshipman dry a kings letter boy from that miserable excuse for a naval academy at dartmouth he had entered at twelve son of a widower second mate off a merchant vessel who needed a berth for the lad dry had grown up aboard merchant ships and boats so hed been utterly bored to tears by more than a year of training at the academy knots ropes rigging and such with only the reading french and navigation interesting a year more of harbour scutwork for a port admiral another admirer of lewries thank god who also sat in commons and here he was at fourteen so much like poor little midshipman larkin hms proteuss bastard irish byblow in shabby castoff uniforms all elbows and knees but impish and cheerful despite a humble beginning hmm perhaps too impish our numbers received sir grisdale announced new hoist from chatham the flag come under my lee sir very well mister grisdale lewrie replied pass word for the coxn to muster my boat crew and get her spanking ready aye aye sir and which midshipmen would be on watch when savage came alongside hms chatham in an hour or so lewrie had to fret hed prefer to have mr grace in charge of his launch but such favouritism would not do and would dispirit the others he checked his pocketwatch which clotworthy chute had recovered from that threehanded jenny back in london hour and a hall say and the watch would still be grisdale and midshipman oh god the only other choice was carrington when desmond arrives mister grisdale he is to see the boat and its crew turned out in their best lewrie added before leaving the quarterdeck for his greatcabins with his fingers crossed ease helm mister carrington lewries coxn liam desmond harshly whispered as the neatly painted launch neared the mainchains of the towering hms chatham which was still under way and generating a substantial flurry of parted waters down its massive sides dont wanta git et by er wake now so jesus an mary ease the launch rose up on the outthrust curl of the threedeckers wake in oars larbd desmond barked as the launch at too acute an angle crossed the curl tilted to larboard rather precipitously in point of fact and met the suck of the hulls turning being drawn alongside bow man hook on desmond snapped and the sailor kneeling right in the eyes of the launchs bow swung his long gaff at deadeyes and blocks atop the chain platform barely snagging its hook round a stout standingrigging cable a second later the launch went bonk against chathams side sucked in like iron filings to a magnet and the bow man cried something much akin to holy shite followed by eeh as he tumbled off the bows to larboard waistdeep in the ocean and getting dragged at a rate of knots a panicky deathgrip upon the gaffs pole and the snagged hook his only salvation the launch bonked again against chatham and both jones nelson and patrick furfy leaped to seize the fellow one by the collar of his waistlength coat the other by the waistband of his sloptrousers before the launch with only one bank of oars free to pull began to fall astern for another try cruel laughter could be heard from the quarterdeck high above ang on grisham ang on now furfy urged yer pullin me trousers arf ye daft shin up de pole grisham jones nelson said with a grunt draggin th ole bloody launch ye grisham howled boat grapnel desmond snapped digging under the aftermost thwart by the counter might ye please shift yer legs mister carrington now sir desmond tumbled forward with the grapnel and a line bounding from shoulder to shoulder took grishams place in the bows let out a dozen feet of line swirled the grapnel over his head and heaved snagging another deadeye furfy and nelson shifted grips off grisham to the rope and pulled the boat back up near the main chains making fast to a small woodarmed bollard atop the bow free of holding the weight of the launch and with a second assist from furfy upon the seat of his pants a mighty heave and toss that grisharn scrambled onto the chain platform freed his gaff from the shrouds and pulled the launch to him instead of the other way round oh well done mister carrington lewrie snarled as he rose to totter amidships of the launchs larboard side you and the bosun must have a little discussion of your seamanship once weve returned aboard hmm in fact i shall insist upon it aye sir the dejected and redfaced midshipman replied for a discussion with the bosun would mean a dozen mighty whacks across his upturned bottom with a stiffened rope starter his body bent over a cannon midshipman the honourable royce carrington would kiss the gunners daughter for his ineptness and his embarrassment to his ship and his captains dignity waiting for the proper moment of the launchs lurches and the ponderous slow roll of the flagship lewrie made a leap of his own for the boarding battens and manropes abaft the chains scored his perch on the first try and slowly scaled the long ascent to hms chathams upper decks past the closed lower gundeck entryport to the proper one high above after a deep restoring breath and a jerk upon the manropes lewrie sprang inboard trying to look spry and unabashed welcome aboard sir chathams first lieutenant said hiding his smirk damned well as did the other officers gathered on the gangway but it was only the stonefaced sailors of the sideparty and the marines presenting arms in full kit who didnt look highly amused lewrie hms savage come to join the squadron sir lewrie gruffly replied doffing his hat to the national flag and the admirals broad pendant then the deck officers ive despatches and mail with me some of which i assume will be welcome if youll drop a line indeed captain lewrie the first officer brightened snapping fingers to summon one of the flagships eighteen midshipmen to see to it my pardons captain lewrie but though we have not met your name is familiar to me l uranie another officer prompted from the side of his mouth but of course sir a gallant action the first officer said with a grin though it did appear as if he might have made another connexion had his junior not steered him away quite an arrival sir most unconventional came a loud and plummy upperclass voice and a stout older man in the full dress uniform of a rearadmiral came plodding up all smiles with him was an older postcaptain mostlike chathams and a young flaglieutenant lewrie are you saw your appointment into savage listed in the marine chronicle good god sir that one of those cuffies of yours he said pointing overside at jones nelson i can see why you ah obtained him strong as an ox is he decorative addition to your boat crew as well i should think werent you to stand trial or be sued or something last news from the london papers were simply full of it haw haw oh that lewrie was the expression on many nearby faces kings bench found the jamaica trial colourable milord and put off the proceedings til all evidence is reviewed lewrie had to say with a straight face though fuming at such abrupt treatment from a senior officer he should have been used to such after his years serving under an host of insulting fools and a fair number of people who might have had good cause to abuse him now and again but by god it still irked eat his shite an think it plum duff aye he grimly thought the particulars are mostlike featured in the latest papers i brought from england milord lewrie said with a seemingly uncaring and unaffected shrug and smile perhaps by hilary or easter term walk with me captain lewrie the rearadmiral said turning more businesslike a glass of something nothing for me milord lewries orders from admiral lord bridport commander of channel fleet had told him to report himself and his frigate to rearadmiral arthur iredell baron boxham so he knew with whom he was strolling even if that august worthy had yet to name himself which was insulting enough but to be walked up and down the quarterdeck instead of being welcomed into the greatcabins under the poop deck was even worse we shall soon be coming about so i will not keep you long lord boxham explained yonder to our lee lies france at present not six leagues off sir my brief for this particular squadron is from fourtysix degrees latitude or the north tip of the lie doleron all the way down to the latitude of arcachon to blockade a coastline that runs roughly one hundred and twenty seamiles and tis rare that all the liners of this squadron are together in one place as you find us today not quite as bad an area to cover as the squadron buried deep in the sack near bayonne where spain and france meet should a storm roll in from the west as they usually do hereabouts lord boxham said with a visible wince navigation is also tricky i warn you now from rochefort suthrd to biarritz and the spanish border this coast is very shoal the land quite flat with few notable headlands by which to estimate position should fog arise one may cast ashore before one knows what has happened aye sir lewrie said as they reached the aft end of the deck by the poop cabins and turned to pace back towards the hammock netting overlooking chatham waist that reply was usually safest though i have the latest london chartmakers works perhaps your flagcaptain is in possession of more current soundings and such which i might obtain or copy milord he went on trying to sound energetic and thoughtful your senior in the inshore squadron will have better no doubt captain lewrie lord boxham said rather dismissively as if he resented having his lecture interrupted savage so i note is of the fifth rate which means that she has a draught of seventeen or eighteen feet lewrie good that will serve nicely now as i was saying the rearadmiral went on and yes he had felt interrupted and was irked by such from a mere frigate captain there is another squadron keeping an eye on rochefort the small ports of the vendee region saint nazaire and the mouth of the loire up north whilst my duties principally encompass the river gironde and what the french possess in the way of warships built or building fitting out or readying for sea from the port of bordeaux upriver i see milord lewrie replied with his best stern phyz on once onstation a perusal of the charts will shew you lewrie that the gironde below the last of the aits is actually a very wide ria thirty miles or so long and over six miles wide as it approaches its mouth rather a lot of places for french warships to find a safe mooring and for french merchantmen as well i should expect milord you demmd frigate captains rearadmiral iredell lord boxham barked in disgust all prizemoney and loot with not a thought for anything else your pardons milord lewrie countered but starvin our foes o food and naval stores both keeps em tied up alongside the piers and eases our duties i should think thout the proper battle that stops their demmd business for good an all lord boxham said with an outraged snort god forbid well youll be in good company captain lewrie all i may spare for the close blockade are light frigates some overaged sloops of war some newer brigsloops and eightgun cutters under mere lieutenants all of whom dream of money he gravelled in a huff very well sir lewrie flatly replied youre to seek out and report to commodore ayscough in hms chesterfield lord boxham said the one with the bagpipers milord lewrie could not help but blurt out for thencaptain ayscough had been his superior in the far east tween the wars in telesto yess him lord boxham barked as if rowed beyond all temperance to be interrupted a third time or that the sound of bagpipes set him howling mad delightful milord lewrie happily said sure of a better welcome deserve each other morelike the admiral spat well off with you captain lewrie now your mail and despatches are aboard i shall not keep you ayscough should lie to the soueast of the river mouth today thank you for receiving me milord adieu lewrie said with a doff of his hat and a sketchy bow in conge try not to drown yourself sir cant afford to milord lewrie rejoined ive not yet been to france rias lewrie fumed on his way back down the battens to his boat rias and aits a ria s a narrow estuary and the girondes as broad as the straits of dover and whats wrong with river islands not aits good old ayscough a commodore though even if he still has his damned bagpipers lewrie sat himself down on a thwart near the launchs tiller to contemplate whether commodore ayscough would go so far with his fondness for all things scottish as to dine him aboard on a haggis cockaleekie soup and turnips and on a happier note lewrie also considered whether he should send midshipman carrington aloft to spend the night perched on the crosstrees or hang him from the mainmast truck with a line round his balls chapter nineteen hms chesterfield was an older twodecker bluff and beamy but with a more pronounced tumblehome from waterline to her gangways and bulwarks was much easier for lewrie to boardthis time with midshipman grace in charge of his launch savage had run across her in late afternoon in company with one of the few large gun fifth rate frigates hms lyme as soon as numbers and private signals had been exchanged chesterfield had made two more short hoists first dog followed by captains repair onboard as sure an invitation to supper as a handdelivered note or a butlers china bell still in full dress lewrie gladly paced til near seven bells of the day watch then called his boat and crew away once more just at the last strokes of chesterfields bell chiming eight bells he was at the foot of her boarding battens and scrambling up as the dogs vane atop his cocked hat crested the lip of the entryport a drum rolled bosuns calls began to shrill marine boots on oak decks marine palms on polished muskets stamped or slapped and god there was the dreadful preliminary drone of single bagpipe before the piper launched himself into a lively rendition of campbells farewell to red castle one of ayscoughs very favourites as lewrie could attest after three long years serving under him hearing it and being told its title every bloody day lewrie you young scamp sir commodore ayscough bellowed with glee as he came up to doff hats with him then seize his paw and shake vigourously look at the laddie will ye all a postcaptain on his own bottom just clanking with medals for bravery ha ha tis good to see you again too sir lewrie rejoined and you a commodore had admiralty a parcel o wit you shouldve hoisted a broad pendant years ago aye and if more cripples and wheezers meet their maker ill make rearadmiral as they fall off navy list ayscough whooped you are delivering orders or are you to join my motley crowd lewrie to join sir and see if we may have a merry time with the foe over yonder lewrie told him vaguely pointing off to the east where the french biscay coast could almost be made out in the quickly dying sunset as we did in the far east toppin news ayscough exclaimed the frog shore is crawlin with smugglers spy boats and all sorts of shippin and too many of them still manage to get past us thin as we are in these waters how many guns is your savage and whats your weight of metal when told that she mounted twentysix pounders with a pair of pounders for chase guns and mounted eight pounders and eight pounder carronades ayscough was delighted chesterfield is a stout old barge lewrie but a slowcoach ayscough grumbled as the music died the sideparty and marines were dismissed and they paced the length of the gangway good for commanding a squadron but not for helping at close inshore work either rather have me a frigate like yours keep me hand in partake of a hot action now and then but he said with a resigned sigh now lyme there is fine for the open sea too but a fourtyfourgun frigate cant pursue runners close enough ashore any more than can i her captain is already come aboard solid fellow is captain charlton captain thomas charlton sir lewrie gawped in surprise and further pleasure i served under him in the adriatic sir when he had lionheart back in this really is an old boys reunion deed it is ayscough chearly agreed recall young hogue do you made commander last year and i made sure to request him when i got sailing orders hes here into a brigsloop the mischief and a damned good choice o name too for hes energetic and full of it mischief that is ha ha id be delighted to see him again too sir lewrie declared i read of his posting but havent seen him since telesto paid off in see him soon enough ayscough promised soon as i despatch you and your fine frigate closer to the coast know how the royal navy works lewrie commodore ayscough said with a wry scowl decades of swallowin ninnys shite and only findin a few truly gooduns here and there so when one finally has the seniority and the active commission one seeks out as many gooduns as one can get away with what place and influence is worth that employ the best one discovered and make fond daddies happy to boot ah heres captain charlton i think you know our third guest charlton good god above captain charlton said almost gasping in surprise as he strode up from aft and below to the gangway the last that i heard lewrie werent you to be hung decided tsteal away with a frigate and turn pirate out here sir lewrie japed as they performed the same ritual first a doff of their hats in formal salute then a hearty handshake hed have made a good one as i recall from the adriatic sir charlton told ayscough you must reveal all to me to us lewrie as we dine upon commodore ayscoughs generosity speaking of let us repair below shall we gentlemen i promise you an excellent supper ayscough as host bade them and a most excellent supper it was for commodore ayscough had always set a fine table and was partial to his tucker though how ayscough could provide crisply fresh leafy greens for the salad course and crispcrusted pipinghot breadnot maggoty and hard biscuitafter so long onblockade lewrie could not fathom nothing fresh could survive the long voyage from england even stowed aboard the swiftest packet there was a mincemeat pie the inevitable reconstituted soup of course but the main course instead of salt beef salt pork or a chicken from the forecastle manger was lobster served up surrounded by boiled shrimp and even the clarified butter was fresh not rancid from the tub on the orlop and each diner got a small dish of a horseradish sauce vaguely reminiscent of the frenchstyle d la mayonnaise or a remouladel and the wines the bottles set out on the sideboard all bore distinguished french vineyards names and varieties not seen in england since the war had begun in but for a few cases brought in by channel coast smugglers every now and then and priced so dear that even the wealthy might take pause before purchasing some how do you do it sir lewrie marvelled between bites and a deep appreciative sniff of his freshpoured wine oned think that by the time you arrived onstation such victualsd have long ago run out get the bulk of it from the frogs captain lewrie ayscough gleefully told him struth god the look on your face french fishermen put out every morning to earn their livings capt charlton was glad to expound does one of our cutters or brigs close them these days theyve learned that their boats are too tiny for us to take as prize so they no longer run in fear of us british silver a little british silver goes a long way for wine fresh food some of their catch or information commodore ayscough cryptically said give the frogs this much they still manage to mint solid coin after seven years of war whilst weve had to resort to paper bank notes not great value to their coinage by this time of course what with all the what do they call it captain charlton inflation sir charlton supplied with a grin and what a potmess their coinage is ayscough derisively grumbled god knows what a denier is made of soft iron but three of them make a hard or twelve deniers make one sol but youre still in the range o hapence four hards make one sou twenty sous make one livre six livres make one ecu and you begin to talk of something in silver four ecus makes what once was called a louis dor before they chopped poor king louiss head off that is and you finally get to gold bout the same as our guinea all a jumble left over from the royal days along with localminted tripe and how the devil even the french keep track of values is a mystery to me more bread sirs ayscoughs cabin servant made a quick tour round the table with the bread barge and lewrie took another thick slab now that he knew what he was dealing with he could put a name to it a boule loaf would the french fishermen run from a frigate sir he asked not any longer charlton informed him no dread of us taking them for spare hands nor of seizing their boats fetchto within two miles of the shore and they will mostlike swarm you like bumboats in a british harbour mind the spirit smuggling though our sailors are not that fond of wine when they can get rum for free and most french beers are simply ghastly but the fishermen will have small flasks of brandy or arrack aboard not good brandy mind capt charlton said with a wry expression pearls before swine ayscough snickered though the arrack a rather fiery equivalent to rum is desirable charlton continued probably stolen from french naval stores no american whisky i spose lewrie said with a downcast expression of his own grew rather fond of it in the west indies the kentucky sort which is aged several years in oak barrels bourbon i think theyre beginning tcall it dear lord charlton softly exclaimed rather in awe of anyone who would prefer such a strong drink i do have two fivegallon barricoes aboard but god only knows how long well be onstation here lewrie said youve never tried it sirs might i decant a gallon each for you to sample he teased a quart perhaps for me lewrie ayscough replied grinning impishly for i doubt a yankee doodle bourbon can measure up to my highland scottish whisky usquebaugh by god the water of life i am set down amid furcoated barbarians charlton pretended to shiver vikings with the palates of philistines oh it was grand to be in company with such fine men officers he had long before learned to trust and rely upon lewrie deemed during their supper ayscough that burly fellow with saltandpepper hair clubbed back into an oldfashioned sailors long queue his cheerful weathered face and piercing grey eyes charlton still the tall lean and wiry epitome of the genial and articulate softspoken english gentlemanoff his quarterdeck of courseand possessed of a droll and dry wit charltons mild brown eyes and regular unremarkable features had many times crinkled in amusement in their private moments and both of them were sailors sailors as experienced and canny as any rough tarpaulin man right down to their toenails away went the last plates and the white wine and out came their dessert and its accompanying drink ripe anjou pears amid crumbled sweet biscuit drenched in a sweetened brandy with large blobs of stiffened and whipped cream atop and with it a rich dark madeira port magnificent lewrie pronounced it rather succulent aye was capt charltons restrained praise bit off ayscough commented though he was spooning it up like a starved hound havent laid hands on any as of yet but ive heard there is an orangeflavoured brandy of french distillery and i cannot help but think that the rob of oranges combined with a fine and aged brandy would be even better i could ask once inshore sir lewrie offered intrigued by the novelty of such a liquour inshore aye ayscough said as the dishes were removed the tablecloth was whipped away leaving only a bowl of nuts and the port to business if i may gentlemen droop kindly fetch me the charts now the tables cleared then leave us be for an hour or so aye sir ayscoughs cabin servant replied weve three actual groupings of small ships standing blockade the numbers varying due to refits recalls and new arrivals such as your savage lewrie ayscough sketched out on the chart tapping one finger near rochefort and the ile doleron charlton here commands an assortment of brigs and cutters in this area whilst down south captain percy lockyear keeps watch off arcachon and its large basin he has but a twentygunned older sloop of war arundel to support his smaller clutch of ships suitable to the shoal conditions obtaining there a nice fellow is lockyear youre sure to like him do you ever meet and i til your timely arrival do the best i can keeping an eye on the mouth of the gironde that leads to bordeaux ayscough said with a selfdisparaging tone very wide entrance to the estuary and sufficient depth of water rather far up so chesterfield can sail most of it but for several forts sited on the tops of the headlands which outgun all of us both in number of artillery pieces and their weight of metal dammit though thats not what i am to do with my ship ayscough groused i am promised a second sixtyfour to join me here so i may employ two middlin ships to reenforce our lighter ships if they run into trouble even if both of us would still be too slow to really catch anything incoming or outgoing should the french come out in force lewrie capt charlton said with dry wit our brief is to harass if we may or fall back upon lord boxhams lineofbattle ships and alert him if we cannot aye ayscough added with a guffaw run screaming out to sea like a pack of hysterical women well perhaps not run sir charlton rejoined with a twinkle nor scream either it would be more of a purposeful lope along with loud shouts of hue and cry or tallyho hmm oh o course sir ayscough chuckled stout hearts strong legs and lusty voices what i mean tsay lewrie is that i cant exercise overall command of this coast and have any fun at all anymore that is why i will place you in command of the river mouth me lewrie gawped in surprise me are you daft he thought a tad dizzy at the prospect wee little me in command o me own squadron yed have tbe barkin mad t turn me loose to that very instant the most he expected to control was his frigate his crew and his penchant for strange and nubile quim to acquire more responsibility than that he had always supposed that hed have to attain ayscoughs age and that would be years in the future but well he was a postcaptain of more than three years seniority and times were hard even if he was less than a year in that rate could he have physically turned his head and gone crosseyed to look at his pair of giltfringed epaulets denoting his rank he would have if only to confirm that he was indeed the lewrie that ayscough was talking about he almost snickered out loud at how ludicrous such a posting sounded hear hear charlton congratulated taking the port bottle to top lewrie up for the coming toast after all you did with independent action in the adriatic i can think of no one more suited to driving the french demented and stopping the gironde like a beer keg bung well i knew the navys shorthanded these days but lord lewrie responded what do the french have up in bordeaux then ill get to that ayscough told him pouring himself a fresh glass as well what you have to work with first there are five smaller vessels you will command lewrie first are a pair of newish brigsloops our old compatriot hogues mischief of sixteen sixpounders and erato with much the same armament then there are the cutters argosy and penguin mount eight guns and banshee which is a hired merchant brig and a little larger mounts ten of course all mount eighteenpounder carronades in addition to their long pieces if you think it best further divide your forces into pairs or two groups of three should you deem such necessary daily stations and patrolling areas will be up to you but ayscough all but wheexed with amusement knowing you i am certain that your penchant for cunning will harass the french to no end and i may rest easy at night with you out there with your eyes wide open whilst pray god the french do not get a wink of sleep wondering what new devilment will befall them charlton seconded hogue is senior then lewrie asked knowing that even large onemasted foreandaft rigged cutters were usually lieutenants commands ah no ayscough sobered even looking a shade evasive for a second commander james kenyon in erato is senior by a year lewries lips halfparted and his face took on a stunned look know him do you ayscough offhandedly enquired second lieutenant of my first ship in old ariadne sixtyfour lewrie found wit to reply that backgammoning bastards here he thought stupefied took him long enough charlton said with a shrug at the fickle nature of navy politics must not have had a single decent patron for interest or influence pon his career god pity you ayscough commented with false sympathy first ship a doddering old sixtyfour and as feeble a sailer as this barge became the stores ship at antigua did she not capt charlton asked faintly frowning to recollect seem to recall no matter did i not have to hunt about and use up half my interest and patronage id gladly let lyme become a stores ship or troopship like the few of her sort still in commission and trade up to a third rate and toss chesterfield into that pot too god willing commodore ayscough quickly seconded well then heres a double toast sirs success to captain lewrie and confusion to the french hear hear charlton cried as they tipped their glasses back to heeltaps we need a bowl of punch by god ayscough decided droop fetch us the bowl and makins for a good stout punch come all ye bold heroes give an ear to my song and well sing in the praise of good brandy and rum tis a clear crystal fountain good england controls give me the punch ladle illfathom the bowl lewrie and charlton sang along to ayscoughs rough raspy lead twice through all verses before the ladle was first dipped and cups were filled kenyon my god lewrie grimly thought no matter the good cheer how am i tdeal with him after all these years chapter twenty dawn came hazy with a light fog up the estuary of the gironde the sea was slack and glassy and the winds from out of the west were light though steady right after breakfast and a shave lewrie bent savages course inshore the frigate enjoying the topsl breeze with her main course twicereefed and tgallants and royals brailed up to the upper yards but all staysls and jibs hoisted for quicker manoeuvring it was secondbest uniform for lewrie this morning his plainer cocked hat on his head without all the formal folderol of the previous evenings supper though it was a cool morning a touch shy of nippy the breeze on savages starboard quarters felt too humid to savour showers by the middle of the day watch i would wager sir the sailing master mr winwood gloomily pronounced as he peered birdquick from each headland or sea mark to the next with his pocket compass one of his new charts spread atop the binnacle cabinet though he did not pencil bearings on his chart winwood did mumble to himself as if memorising reciprocal courses were i a wagering man of course lewrie glanced astern to scan the skies for weather signs but could not discover any cause for winwoods prediction for the mans nervousness lewrie could determine good cause slap winwood up against a strange new coast hostile or no and he would turn as skittery as a whore in church for he had not yet known it had the proper seamans distrust in twentyyearold redrawn and reprinted charts and was just as responsible as his captain for the safe navigation of the ship miss just one shoal or rock that was marked on the charts hit one that wasn t either way his career was on the line and until winwood was as conversant with their new area of operations as he was of his own palm lines there would be no living with him no cheer in his body not that ponderous and cautious mr winwood had ever been much for good cheer mister mayhall reports six and a quarter knots captain lt urquhart stiffly reported doffing his hat by lewries side a light breeze sir even if it is on the quarter good enough for now mister urquhart lewrie said no sense chargin in like a spanish fightin bull sooner or later they get stabbed by the matadors sword todays a getacquainted day get the feel o things meet up with the lighter ships and their captains anyway and he quipped in a softer voice inclining his head towards mr winwood we must allow the sailing master tget his feel for evry wee pitfall hell not sleep a wink til he does aye sir lt urquhart replied with a brief but shy grin as if he had to think about it before reacting two of a kind really lewrie thought as he took a sip of his coffee then strolled over to the starboard mizen shrouds urquhart might as well have been winwoods bastard son for all his humourlessness comes o tryin too hard lewrie speculated or is he just a soberside from birth in their few weeks at sea lt urquhart so far had appeared as taciturn and serious as a scottish calvinist preacher the man never slouched never allowed himself more than four glasses of wine in the wardroom so his cabin servant and personal cook aspinall had heard from the officers mess servants never took part in any of the highcockalorum antics his fellow lieutenants might stage appeared to need no more than four hours sleep a night and could always be found fully dressed and on the quarterdeck sometimes for as little cause as when the nanny goat farted was he competent yes immensely so and lewrie could find no fault with how during his london absences urquhart had seen to the ships fittingout storing and rearming was urquhart the complete sailorman a tarryhanded tarpaulin man with the addition of a gentlemanly education manners and dignity aye he was he just was not anthony langlie lewrie could resignedly bemoan langlie during their three years in proteus lt knolles his first officer aboard hms jester even arthur ballard when he had had the converted bombketch alacrity in the bahamas all of those officers had been young though able possessed of quick wit and good humour ballard well he had his ponderous moments but sly and dry and a good friend as well been spoiled i spose lewrie thought with a sigh all of his first lieutenants since his first commands had felt more like helpful and supportive friendsl urquhart though lewrie supposed he could put his moodiness down to all of that punch port claret and rhenish that hed sloshed down with ayscough and charlton it had been past eleven when hed reeled his way aboard savage and barely managed to undress before sprawling into his swinging bedcot and falling asleep as if poleaxed and had been roused drooling onto his pillows both by the bosuns calls for all hands and the chimes of eight bells as the middle watch ended at am well all that and the cats stocky toulon the blackun with white markings and chalky the youngest with white fur and grey splotches had pawed leaped upon him with all four paws as close together as a quartet of coins abutted on a publicans bar counter with loud and raspy were starving squawls and urgent digging at the bed linens right by his nose toulon had been refugeed from the port of toulon chalky had been found by his bastard son desmond the american midshipman aboard a french prize brig in the west indies and presented to him as a gift they were both therefore french perhaps they knew the smell of their homeland off to loord and wanted lewrie to rise and take em on deck to share their furry rencontrel and damned if they werent poised atop the quarterdeck hammock nettings that very moment peering forward towards the shore sniffing the air tails curling and jittering like they did when they saw a sea bird glide cross the decks and sharing looks with each other now and again not thinkin o jumpin ship are ye catlings lewrie teased as he came to the forward end of the quarterdeck to give them a stroke or two he was rewarded with head butts on his hand some wee trillish mews by way of greeting ill brook no desertion hear me plain deck there a lookout atop the mainmast crosstrees called fishin boat tlarboard three points off th larboard bows lewrie wandered over to the top of the larboard gangway ladder as lt urquhart and mr winwood raised their telescopes to peer at the fishing boat which was just beginning to emerge from the haze and the lowlying skim of fog atop the estuary waters she appears to be unarmed sir urquhart reported only a few men on deck with nets ready for streaming rather goodsized i do allow though sir bout the length of a portadmirals barge your glass sir lewrie bade and took a squint for himself he saw a twomasted lugger both her broad gaffrigged sails and her single jib streaming slackly astern as she came into the wind probably to lower her fishing nets before coming about to wallow inshore for the first of her mornings trawls four no only five sailors in sight and none of them showing any evident signs of alarm at the appearance of a bloodys frigate cruising up to range of random shot hands to quarters mister urquhart lewrie ordered lowering the borrowed glass and handing it back over carronades quarterdeck ninepounders chase guns and swivels only no point in manning the eighteenpounders for such a feeble target spare hands and mister devereuxs marines for a boarding party aye sir bosun pipe all hands and quarters spose i must pass the word for the surgeon lewrie chuckled im told my french is a horror and mister durant was born speakin frog uhm i am considered quite fluent in french sir urquhart almost timidly put forward with a throatclearing harrumph excellent mister urquhart lewrie cheered when closer to call for them to fetchto and prepare tbe boarded have her captain come aboard so you can interrogate him aye aye sir a quarterhour later and both savage and the french lugger were fetchedto into the light winds no more than one hundred yards apart though lewries french was horrid he could make out a few phrases of invective damn you bloodies were working here death of my life you put us in povertyl go and fuck yourself you arrogant beefsteak turds they quieted though and lapsed into surly silence when cowed by the size of the boarding party and the marines with their bayonets and muskets a brief inspection above and below decks into the reek of the luggers hold halffilled with sea water to preserve any catch til they could be landed ashore then lt urquharts launch was coming alongside savage with a lone frenchman amidships a wiry older man in loose pantaloons bare feet a filthy canvas fishermans smock and a tasseled liberty stocking cap upon his grizzled head captain may i name to you captain jules papin lt urquhart gravely and punctiliously announced capitaine papin permetteimoi de vous presenter notre capitaine de vaisseau alan lewrie de le fregate sauvage capitaine papin lewrie said doffing his hat bon matin msieur hawh the frenchman growled back scratching at his unshaven grey weeks worth of stubble bon mon cul ou est le rum have rum ah hum was urquharts stricken comment his face reddening aspinall lewrie called over his shoulder a bottle o rum and glasses for our guest you

contents of his glass back like the experienced toper he looked to be and gulped it all down his gullet in one swallow making papin wheeze wince then grin and shake his head in appreciation of raw unwatered rum and he thrust his glass out for a refill i am delighted to hear that my our other ships are alert and doing their proper duty capitaine lewrie told the frenchman as he took a cautious sip of his own rum stifling a wince and a belch as the fiery spirit slid down his throat and hit his alreadyunsettled innards hair o the dog mine arse lewrie thought what you wish papin impatiently snapped after his glass was replenished fish quel dommage msieur capitaine i have none for youpirates do not give me peace to fish langoustes et crevettes a lobster or shrimp small boats close inshore

sailors work aboard and no goods beyond their dinners and such either sir very well then lewrie said turning back to papin sir i will trouble you no longer you are free to go about your fishing no good zat do now zis late in morning pawh papin growled looking at aspinall and the rum bottle and his newly emptied glass in expectation of a stirrup cup and licking his lips sorry bout that lewrie allowed convey capitaine papin to his boat um vappilation des votre bateau capitaine he asked making papin wince again this time over lewries lack of grammar and his outlandish accent the marie doux is it sweet marie thankee i shall know you and your boat in future perhaps lewrie gave the man a sly look nodded to aspinall to pour him a third glass of rum and posed the question i would appreciate an occasional bottle or two of good wine perhaps a case at a time as would my wardroom officers im certain capitaine papin he posed and as you say lobsters and shrimp a parcel of mussels or clams are not your normal catch but you could are you reasonable obtain such from the smaller boats to sell me a decent brandy hmm american corn whisky if you could get it haw lewrie concluded with a scoffing laugh at such an outoftheordinary wish as if asking for a slice of cheese off the moon ze merican whisky ze bourbon msieur papin said with almost a wink slyly scratching at his weeks worth of grey

conspiratorial voice peutetre you wish to know of ze forts ze navire de guerre warships hmm lewrie replied in like voice daring another sip of his rum finding it easier on his stomach this time and taking another that might prove useful for such of course one must expect to be rewarded oh mais oui capitaine lurr msieur hawn hawn papin chuckled in the fashion of a pimp or tout whod just landed a customer to enter his brothel i ave nozzing to tell you now but oh but surely our ships will meet again capitaine papin soon lewrie said to that a smug and satisfied grin on his face as they all but clasped hands and shook on the bargain care for another glass of rum sir give me ze bottle papin insisted i curse you eh what lewrie asked suddenly befuddled mes hommes see us papin said with a shrug as he accepted the recorked bottle and tucked it into the large crosswise pocket of his rough smock zut alors i curse you i look like patriot zey will non mind i sell food an drink but ze information non ah lewrie said with a nod that was all he had time for for papin suddenly went into a ranting screech like to pull his hair out stamping about the quarterdeck hocking up a glob of spit as he cried jamais or never along with a rich store of invective about the english poverty lewries doubtful ancestry the piratical royal navy syphilitic kings and queens the battles of agincourt and crecy the burning of joan of arc at the stake that thieving foutre henry the fifth the english language anglican protestant heretics invaders and chicken thieves and the filthy english habit of bathing too often he concluded with a dramatic armsakimbo aggressive stance so he could hock up another large glob of spit and shout pawh does this mean we wont get any fresh cheese mayhall asked in a wee voice which quite destroyed the spirit of the thing cheese ouiplus tard later papin rasped from a corner of his mouth looking like an actor whose grand soliloquy had been interrupted and ruined by an unruly drunk in the cheap seats au revoir capitaine papin lewrie said not sure whether to applaud or laugh til we meet again a tout a lheure with a final broad obscene gesture papin went to the entryport and scampered down the battens and manropes as agile as an ape see him back to his boat mister urquhart and recall our men lewrie ordered and have someone swab that up secure from quarters sir lt adair the second officer asked half the quarterdeck ninepounders and the carronades aye lewrie decided i dont see any boats as large as papins out this morning so the swivels and muskets would suit just as well there do seem to be a fair number in the offing captain lt adair pointed out christ we stop and search em all well be at this til sundown lewrie said with a scowl no well not waste our time on em well hunt up argosy and erato first and get the lay of the land from their captains before we try on anything else after all he said with a chuckle theyre the ones tdo the stopping and searching we are here tback them up odd fellow this papin sir lt adair commented as close as he could come to initiate a discussion of what had just transpired i pardons sir but i would not trust him with much hes french well as commodore ayscough and captain charlton told me last night mister adair lewrie responded quite pleased with his initial dealings with the french fishermen a great deal of useful information is had from the locals once cordial relations are established by dint of paying good prices for their catches then for their smuggled goods the old directory of five in paris now bonaparte are bankrupting the country with their endless wars upon the rest of europe their trade with the rest of the world is cut to the bone our doin that and i doubt evry frog is in love with the revolution this papin some of his fellow captains may prove extremely informative some shillings here a guinea or so there and these impoverished frogs ii mostlike sell their dead mothers hair lewrie cynically thought fed up with war and shortages sons conscripted or already dead or crippled on battlefields from here to the alps why wouldnt they play spy if theres some money in it and get a bit o their own back on the damned fools in paris he was quite pleased with himself all but rocking on the balls of his feet and whistling a merry tune oh perhaps papin couldnt deliver the best information but surely he could come through on the wine cheese eggs freshbaked baguettes and boules the bourbon whisky if not papin some other of these fishermen in almost daily contact with british warships could a cornucopia of fresh seafood surely newspapers lewrie thought of a sudden feeling remiss that he had not mentioned them french newspapers half lies though they might be could still provide a treasure trove of information mostly unintentinally for not every paper could be pored over by government censors uhm sir lt adair spoke up again all but muttering confidentially i noted that whilst that papin fellow was doing his rant and dance he well from the first moment he came aboard he kept darting rather shrewd eyes about our ship counting our guns and such and we havent seen a single other fishing boat as large as his quite this far out near the mouth of the gironde perhaps there are others but why would this fellow dare the blockade sir might papin be spying for his own navy sir or passing information to us as quick as he passes observations to shore playing both ends against the middle oh fu lewrie began to blurt with a yelp of dismay but quickly substituted mine arse on a bandbox instead the son of a bitch was spyin on me he had to recognise didnt notice his demeanour lewrie huffed and thankee for keepin your own eyes on him mister adair and for your suspicions papin may be only the first middlinsized boat weve come across it may be that others sail out this far on a regular basis were so new tthese waters weve no idea at present we find erato or mischief one of the cutters or sloops and speak their captains well have a better idea of what tlook out for and who whom rather well there is that sir adair replied unsure whether to be eased of his suspicion or not rather like mister winwood and his fear of where the driftwood logs lurk on the tides hereabouts mister adair lewrie tried to make a jest of it til hes secure in his mind hell spend all night on deck lookin outboard for shipkillin trees adair doffed his hat and returned to his duties leaving lewrie to pace the length of the quarterdeck nettings and railings hands in the small of his back head down and his neck burning in embarrassment spied on he chid himself just let the bastard aboard tsee any thing he wished gawd which o these frogs can ye trust this whole endeavour could turn out tbe a rare shitten business chapter twentyone t he safe and navigable outermost reaches of the gironde river estuary measured about twelve miles across on a line drawn from pointe de la coubre the tip of a narrow hookshaped peninsula on the north shore an appendage to a clenchedfist larger peninsula whose atlantic face was labelled the cote sauvagewhich lewrie took as auspiciousto a seaside village south of pointe de grave on the southern atlantic coast named soulac sur mer the south shore peninsula narrowed and bent back to the nor east at pointe de grave near another coastal village called le verdon sur mer which actually lay on the inner river bank from pointe de grave to the north shore and the small town of st georges de didonne just a mile or so south of the larger town of royan lay the narrows of the gironde which was only about three miles across a short row for a determined boat crew or an even shorter sail temptingly beyond those narrows the gironde widened considerably remaining deep and six miles across only narrowing slightly until it reached the long and skinny river aits that rearadmiral lord boxham had mentioned near pauillac and blaye any number of french warships or merchant vessels could be moored below those pointe de grave narrows but as to the getting to them or even sneaking a ships boat up the river to spy them out it just didnt look like it was doable now in king louis the fourteenths day sir mr winwood said in his usual bleak manner the key fort guarding the river was on the eastern bank bout twelve or thirteen miles upriver ah here at saint fort sur gironde one might suppose they deemed fortifications by le verdon sur mer the tip of pointe de grave and saint georges de didonne too vulnerable to armed landings now though my word keeping a chaste three miles offshore as they cruised down the north bank past la grande cote st palais sur mer and to within sight of royan in case some monstrous pounder coastal guns might lurk in the forests and bleak fields they had not seen all that much sign of military preparations they had not been fired upon yet though as they neared st georges de didonne they could finally espy a stout pile of stonework sited about halfway between the village and the town of royan it appeared to be no more than one hundred yards long overall a place formed in a shallow threesided u with the crenellations that served as gunports no more than sixteen or twenty feet above the shoreline but with an even lower water battery mounting lighter guns to deter an assault by boats at the foot of its centre face i count only four openings atop the walls for heavy guns along the walls well four per face sir lt urquhart pointed out it might be open on its land face but a landingparty would have to go ashore west of royan lewrie replied peering intently through his day glass then stumble their way to the fort and is royan garrisoned they might run into a stiff fight before they ever got to musket range of their objective it didnt help lewries lingering hangover or his wariness of what might lay hidden that the sailing masters glum prediction had come true just past one bell of the day watch the wind had slackened and a sullen steady rain had begun to fall blurring the coastline so that at a cautious three miles offshore vital details they wished to see now lay partially veiled as they watched a bright and fresh french tricolour flag was run up the flagpole of the fort and tiny blueandwhite uniformed figures could be seen scurrying like a disturbed ant hill well come about mister gamble lewrie told the officer of the watch make course souwest by west half west if she will allow fullandby on starboard tack aye aye sir mister thomlin pipe hands to stations to come about lt gamble ordered does that fort possess fourtytwopounders it could hurl shot as far as pointe de grave all by itself lewrie surmised aloud as the scurry of hands drummed upon his frigates timbers heated shot as well do they have enough warning even twentyfourpounders or eighteenpounders would serve captain mr winwood commented is there a matching battery near the pointe de grave the cross fire would effecively close the narrows id wager on the lighter guns lewrie reluctantly had to agree hell even twelvepounders could do the job fire and be reloaded quicker and engage even rowboats i dont see the french investing all that many expensive guns in a place like that old king louie was right a determined fleet of third rates with the equivalent of a regiment or two of foot could open the narrows in one day take royan and saint georges and all of pointe de grave right down to this soulac by the sea and why in heaven does a french town honour saint george he concluded eleanor of aquitaine sir lt urquhart piped up all this once was english territory when henry plantagenet our good old king henry the second married her stead of king louis the seventh we owned it til the s where we get our best clarets i believe ah urquhart said beginning almost whimsically amused but ending stiffbacked and ready to cough into his fist for slipping from his usual grim demeanour the city of bordeaux was our capital of the province i see lewrie said with a wry twinkle source of claret indeed the medocs hautmedocs and saint emilions the white graves and the sweet white sauternes as well mister urquhart he teased all do come from here sir urquhart gravely intoned lifting his telescope as if it was his prime duty to peer at the southern shore by pointe de grave poor sobersided bastard was lewries thought still and all i couldve gotten a merry andrew for a first officer who d run us ashore some dark night and try tmake a jape of it he looked forward as savages bows were swung up into the wind what there was of it besides the odd lt urquhart and his wary ways there were several more new faces aboard despite the majority of proteuss people turning over into savage men holding admiralty warrant once appointed into a warship usually remained with her all their careers unless they asked for transfer even when their ships were laid up inordinary there was bosun george thomlin for instance a burly balding older fellow who had come with savage as had his mate john ellison and the ships carpenter thomas fisher along with them had come some replacement hands strangers to one and all in the beginning to fill the shoes of dead or crippled proteus men there was a new marine corporal dudley a sour taciturn and so far thoroughly unpleasant ass there were two new surgeons mates now that mr durant had finally gotten his longdelayed promotion arthur ford who had been seasick nearly half the time since theyd left portsmouth and a dark and heavyset grump by name of harold gaines there was a new gunners mate named foster a new quartermaster by name of raymund a very gloomy newcome yeoman of the sheets named orwell an entirely new pursers assistant the jack in the breadroom who was wonder of wonders both scrupulously honest so far and energetically aspiring well he was very young the midshipmen of course and at least a dozen fresh hands most of them dredged up by the shire quotas act all rated landsmen and as clumsy as drunken steers and lewrie was still sorting them all out for strengths and weaknesses and he and lt urquhart had spent many hours going over the muster book and watch lists to sort out the chaff and reenforce the weak with better help ware the point sir lt urquhart called out there is a fort of some kind on pointe de grave just there sir this side of the village le verd what the devil its named lewrie raised his own glass and put it to his eye trying not to look urgent or concerned as a captain must nothing good ever came of instilling panic ahha yes he said instead as the place became steady in his ocular cant sail closer tthe wind inside two miles oshore were in their range and theyll shoot the shit out of us if we dawdle along on this nexttnothin wind lewrie thought though watched us sailin in the last hour heated shot fourtytwopounders christ it looks to be just where a small stream splits and runs down to the sea in three rivulets sir lt urquhart said with the proper amount of stoicism perhaps the dull note to his voice came from a lack of lewries fervid dreadfilled imagination no flag though quite a lot of activity but well damn my eyes mister urquhart lewrie said with what a casual and objective observer might have called a giggle of relief i do blieve the place is still being built i know im not livin right t earn such luck but just thankee jesus he thought the fortification near le verdon sur mer indeed was unfinished there were no crenellations atop its low wall for guns yet in fact it appeared that the sloped stone walls were still being erected and were barely above the height of a tall man so far there were frenchmen in uniform but very few of them all now engaged in using their telescopes to peer at savage waving their arms and mostlike blathering agitated frog with much use of sacre bleu mort de ma vie zutalors and nom dun pipe almost everyone else over there now scuttling to the rear and into the shelter of the village seemed to be civilian frogs and workmen make a note mister winwood lewrie said lowering his glass til we know their weight of metal once they get their fort completed we go no closer than three miles to the pointe de grave peninsula either i will see to it sir winwood replied with a grunting moo deck there a lookout called brig tlarboard three mile off an fetchedto shes runnin up er flag an makin a hoist midshipman of the watch lewrie demanded though still unsure of which of his newcomes would respond aye sir midshipman dry their youngest piped up make our number to the brig and conjure me who she is lewrie ordered and decypher her signal hoist from this months book midshipman dry quickly referred to his loose bundle of private signals and the navys list of ship names and numbers then crisply announced she is the brigsloop erato sir commander james kenyon aha lewrie said tensing up a little for he had hoped that she would be mischief that he and hogue could share a glass or two as they conferred and relived old times and her hoist her number and this months recognition code sir dry said very well lewrie said with resignation any idea of how long t will be before we crawl up abeam of her mister gamble half an hour sir gamble replied with a cock of his head and a shrug once we do stagger up abeam of her mister gamble well come about and fetchto mister dry assumin it doesnt take so long that the watch changes be ready to hoist captain repair onboard to her just now though young sir id admire did you pass word for my cabin servant and inform aspinall well have a guest aft perhaps even two for supper aye aye sir dry chirped assumin i dont kill the bastard fore the soup lewrie thought chapter twentytwo one could usually tell a lot about a seacaptain by how well his ship was kept despite the ravages of sun storm or the inevitable depletion of bosuns stores after a long voyage or in this case a long time onstation hms erato seemed at first to prove that truism once savage had fetchedto to seaward of her about a cable to windward she was a trim little ship perhaps feet on the range of the deck maybe to overall from taffrails to the tip of her bowsprit about feet abeam and might draw no more than feet lewrie could count eight gunports along the beam facing him and pick out the light pounder carronades she mounted in place of chase guns on her focsle and flush quarterdeck her masts were well painted her spars oiled but her sails were the colour of ancient parchments the running and standing rigging was geometrically taut the standing well tarred and the running looked fat and amply slushed with fats skimmed off the cauldrons as saltmeat rations were boiled up so far so good for no matter his dislike of kenyon the man had always been a proper sailor yet it was the little things that made lewrie wonder eratos figurehead was not an approximation of a grecian legend but a simple rather crudely chopped crowned lion torso the sort that got churned out by indifferent woodworkers by the dozen and bore not a single flake of gilt paint trim the same went for eratos beakhead rails entryport quarterdeck bulwarks and counter lewrie had not kept track of kenyons career but could only conclude that he either didnt care about the niggling details of decoration or had no money beyond his naval pay and could not afford such niceties a brigsloop could not store much more than three months of victuals rum beer or water so she could not have been standing guard over the gironde much longer than that yet her gunwale hull stripe paint was fading flaking and peeling the original blue colour now so pale that she looked as if she hadnt seen a lick of admiraltyissued paint in over a year and had gone through several whole gales to boot in reply to his hoist of captain repair onboard a twentyfivefoot cutter was being rowed over from erato to savage with kenyon in the sternsheets sitting upright in a boat cloak against the sullen rain the cutter in comparison was a pristine thing of beauty with a shiny white hull and royal blue gunnls and the oars being plied by her crew were painted white with bright blue blades and the shafts where sailors horny hands gripped had been turneddown at least a foot with ropework the boats crew and coxn were equally rigged out dressed in a uniform manner as clean and natty as sunday divisions sloptrousers that had never seen slush or tar so white they might have been pipeclayed like marines kit bright red solidcolour shirts under the typical short blue jackets with white tape or piping on every seam and glittering brass buttons as the boat came alongside oars aloft and dripping lewrie could see that every man aboard her wore white cotton stockings and freshblacked shoes with newly polished brass buckles theyd do an admiral proud sir lt gamble commented indeed lewrie drawled back though i dare say savage makes a much better impression compared to her shabbiness erm theyre awfully handsome lads midshipman dry said in an aside to midshipman grisdale indeed grisdale agreed in his toplofty nasal voice lewrie raised a handy telescope and quickly scanned eratos bulwarks and gangways those sailors yonder were nowhere near as natty as the boat crew their slopclothing the usual stained patched and ragged motley their shirts mismatched from several baled lots of calico or gingham and from appearances stripped from dead beggars and turned down by ragpickers the most slovenly of savages people looked like footmen at a formal supper by comparison captains pets lewrie silently sneered as he stowed the telescope back in the binnacle cabinet kenyons hareem well a captain is second next to god at sea and sets the rules he returned to the head of the starboard gangway ladder just as the bosuns calls began to shrill the officer of the watch lt gamble presented his sword and the marines stamped and slapped their boots and palms commander james kenyons hat had just loomed over the lip of the entryport and the ritual was on damn hes got old was lewries first impression in he had been a trim and lean figure of a man a fellow who certainly could have been considered handsome and fetching but now as kenyon doffed his hat in return salute he revealed heavily saltandpepper hair more salt than anything else greatly receded at his temples thin atop and worn long and combed straight across like seaweed pomaded to stay in place to cover his advancing baldness in strands kenyons features once so regular and dashinghandsome had a sad old hounds thick and flaccid droopiness heavily lined and just a touch pale too his body looked to be as lean as lewrie dimly recalled perhaps a touch too lean for his uniform seemed to hang upon his frame as if he was ill with something welcome aboard savage sir lt gamble said thank you sir kenyon replied though looking aft at lewrie with what could be taken for a wry secret smile commander kenyon welcome aboard lewrie was forced to say as he walked up to him lifting a hand to his hat captain lewrie kenyon responded doffing his hat again he sounded a bit bemused and still wore that taut wry expression as if he found the situation funny which immediately raised lewries hackles i am glad to see that the french did not put a ball or two through yer hull when you swanned into their range didnt anyone warn you of the fort on the north shore no yer not lewrie thought irked at once you dve adored it well perhaps we should go aft to my cabins then commander lewrie all but snarled though keeping a smile on his own phyz whilst he said it so you may impart tme your vast store o knowledge about the gironde defences and save me from myself lt gamble and midshipmen dry and grisdale all winced or made moues over that retort sure that their captain would put this fellow in his place right smart though it didnt seem to have any effect on kenyon whose face still bore that bemused look but of course captain lewrie kenyon said allowing himself a broad toothbaring grin damn my eyes is he drunk lewrie thought as he caught a whiff of wine on the mans breath and teeth so grey it looks as if hes been on the fifteen shillin mercury cure for the pox this way commander lewrie offered a glass of something sir lewrie asked once they were seated at their ease in the greatcabins at the collapsible settee and matching chairs claret brandy american bourbon whisky cold tea cold tea kenyon asked with a brow up seemingly appalled quite refreshing in summer lewrie told him as i discovered in the west indies with an admixture of sugar and lemon brandy i spose kenyon allowed then as aspinall fetched a brandy for him and a glass of white wine for lewrie swivelled about to look at the cabins furnishings that brow still up in nighmocking appreciation just one more thing that raised lewries dander maybe kenyon liked the winecabinet and the desk in the daycabin the table and chairs and the sideboard in the diningcoach or carolines portrait hung on the bulkhead the wideenoughfortwo hanging cot heard you married kenyon said after a deep sip your wife there handsome woman aye lewrie said and you no not yet kenyon said with the same sort of easy smile that lewrie could recall whats the old saying marry in haste repent at leisure besides he simpered crossing his legs and shifting rather uneasily in his chair between the navy and merchant service and long spells of halfpay ashore i never seemed to be able to amass the wherewithal to set up a proper household and it always felt wrong to me to force a trusting lass to share my poverty hah hah same old kenyon lewrie thought whilst keeping a straight face still playin the upright rugged sort o man knowin just the right dissemblin blather t say you though lewrie kenyon continued in a jovial manner i must imagine youre rolling in prizemoney by now and have got right famous to boot so maintaining a household for wife and kiddies is no bother pocket change what though your recent legal matter is tell me all you know of the fort by saint georges de didonne commander kenyon lewrie coldly rejoined damme does he imagine im still his raw johnny newcome midshipman and tell me all you know of a french fisherman name of jules papin or any others of his ilk who you think are spyin on us who you think are disaffected and a reliable source of information give me all the cautions it was as if hed reached over and slapped the man in the face kenyon recoiled and for a revealing second allowed his face to slip from that taut selfcontrolled bemused expression to one of hot sliteyed hate which was as quickly erased with a step between anger and the requisite subordinates blandness that came across as stunned and blank as that worn by someone headbutted and concussed i see kenyon at last said nodding slowly in recognition of his place in the universe as if hed expected better but lewrie the toplofty lucky bastard would always be a disappointment papin well he and four or five others dare to fish almost out of sight of land sir most are to be distrusted really for anything beyond wines or fresh victuals from shore ive attempted to vary my routes about the estuary the times i appear and the boats i stop so are any of them passing information to our opposition in the french navy to a merchantman wishing to slip past the blockade erato and the cutters are unpredictable it may make no difference though kenyon continued shaking his head in the negative for any fool with a telescope may lurk atop the dunes back in the shadows of the pine forests up in any churchs bell tower and take our daily measure for all the famous vineyards and the great chateaux upriver this portion of medoc or aquitaine is a bleak and grim place near the sea rather boring i expect in peacetime for blockading it is boring enough now my first impression of this coast does put me in mind of the american carolinas aye lewrie cautiously allowed squelching anger at the recent lack of respect and proper deference but ready to slap kenyon down sharply if he presumed again pine forests settlements miles apart and barrens between salt pans and salt works what of the smallboat fishermen then he asked any o them tbe trusted there were a few kenyon informed him but they knew little and did not come far out to sea one had to go to them sometimes in ones jolly boat launch or oared cutter and even then they didnt venture far from their seaside villages and rarely went upriver so they had little of value to impart the fort by st georges de didonne it had only been completed the year before and was reputed to be thinly garrisoned with only the french equivalent of british pounders and pounders perhaps no more than nine guns altogether atop the main ramparts with about half a dozen pounders and swivels in the sealevel water battery kenyon had heard rumours that the french had reenforced the place with a few pounders so they could close the narrows but no one really knew if that was true or what the french wished the british to think the smaller fort on pointe de grave less a fort than a battery really had been under construction only a few months before erato had come to the gironde and the work seemed to be going slowly certainly the french were even more months away before any artillery was put in place or its magazines filled with powder saint fort sur gironde lewrie speculated over a second glass of rhenish up where the river isles split the channel and force any ship into close range might they be stripping it of guns and shot commander kenyon after all its not all that likely that our fleetd barge that deep towards bordeaux and surely the frogs can see that it doesnt serve em any use move its guns and garrison up here to the bay instead shift some warships up from bordeaux to what the devils its name talmont thats it cutters gunboats or galleys into the shelter of the cove in the lee of le verdon sur mer thatd provide a quicker response you ever see any frog warships this far downriver sir very rarely captain lewrie kenyon replied almost wincing as if using the younger but senior officers rank galled him and if a merchantman is trying to thread through the blockade they or so i have been told by local fishermen so i you may put as much stock as you may in the truth of it anchor under the battlements of saint fort sur gironde itself and let slip round ten oclock of an evening and only on nights when its as black as a boot sir do we get all that many runners commander kenyon not really sir kenyon told him musing nosedeep over what had to be his third glass of brandy since coming aboard the french need so much of their own produce or manufacture to support their wars that they cannot spare much to export beyond their wines and brandies the bulk of the ships weve seen and made prize or frightened off have been socalled neutrals trying to get in and so kenyon informed him while the french still built ships of war at the bordeaux yards and refitted and maintained a substantial number of older and lighter frigates corvettes the french term for sloops of war and gunboats for local defence there didnt seem to be good odds for that glorious yardarmtoyardarm battle of which admiral lord boxham had spoken so longingly not a promising place to reap a pot of prizemoney here sir kenyon said with a sullen sigh one hopes he trailed off deep in his cups of a sudden as if the brandy had snuck up upon him like a pickpocket the outer squadrons catch most were nigh pointless well if the french wont amuse us well just have to amuse ourselves lewrie determined with a chuckle and thanking his stars that kenyon was sinking so fast that it would be impossible to offer him supper else hed be charged with drowning the bastard in the aforementioned soup course as he went facedown in it and utterly comatose raise some mischief keep our hands in hey what operations have we conducted against them since youve been onstation commander huh oh we keep our eyes peeled kenyon replied with a sleepy slur stop fishing boats and do inspections dont ye know ask questions of em and confiscate any contraband things like that thats about tchange lewrie declared now ive been put in command of the close blockade hereabouts well come up with some devilment for the frogs you in charge kenyon blurted out sounding stunned again or sarcastic it was hard to discern which thought lord boxham or commodore ayscoughd sent you in to snoop about make a report yes commander i am in charge lewrie took great delight in telling the man always were a lucky bastard kenyon could barely be heard to mutter under his breath i will call for your boat kenyon lewrie snapped getting to his feet and if that wasnt a bald hint for kenyon to stir himself as well he didnt know what it was kenyon slurped down the last of his current brandy to heeltaps throwing his head far back to get it all then shambled to his own feet reeling on the gentle scend and roll of the frigate as she drifted look at me sir in the eyes sir kenyon tried though his own gaze wandered rather wideabout do not make the mistake of familiarity with me again hear me do not appear before me reeking of spirits again either commander lewrie barked and truth be told greatly enjoying himself you are supposed tbe an experienced commission sea officer entrusted with the command of a kings ship but believe me kenyon that can be subject to change do ye cross me again understood sir lewrie shouted so loud that anyone on the quarterdeck could hear him aspinall he said in a much calmer taking pass the word for my coxn that he is to help the commander to the deck and see that the commanders boat is called alongside to bear him back to erato aye aye sir aspinall meekly replied and sped out of the cabins for he had never heard his usually genial captain in such a rage directed at anyone other than englands enemies yer supperll be ready in half an hour sir aspinall told him after eratos boat had come and gone and kenyon had been seen over the side in a bosuns sling and into the cutter where his pretty sailors had received him with what might be called fond and loyal care whatever hell lewrie had boasted he might deal the french there was a lingering dread in him that when the time came he could not rely on kenyon or erato kenyons jealousy that longago detestation that hed shown when down with yellow jack and it had fallen to lewrie as a midshipman the only officer aboard the parrot schooner about to be taken by a french privateer to kenyons lights he had done a most dishonourable thing pretend to strike colours til the french were closeaboard then fire every weapon weak hms parrot possessed employing dards de feufire arrowsto set the privateers sails afire and make their escape as the privateer burned to the waterline there had been no french survivors well with half his own crew down with fever and quickly succumbing himself lewrie hadnt bothered much with plucking enemies from the sea there had been their important passengers lord and lady cantner to consider and keep from any more risk kenyon had gone all huffy about it once hed recovered to the point that he could listen to the tale and had gone all prim and outraged at such a breach of gentlemanly conduct even to their foes he had bought lewrie his first hanger icily writing that he would surely need it the next time lewrie was faced with an ethical dilemma which dilemma he would fail and be called to account on the field of honour spite aside jealousy aside kenyon had had a miserable career might have spent years on miserly halfpay and too proud to stoop to just any employment while still a socalled prestigious sea officer of the king only a new war had put him back in the uniform he loved he said he did time in merchant service lewrie recalled and that might notve paid that well either proud priggish punctilious over his precious honour so where did it all go i wonder how d he reconcile all that with his secret life o buggery lewrie considered a note to ayscough questioning kenyons fitness a request that erato be transferred but at the moment lewrie had no real evidence against him other than he was as drunk as a fiddlers bitch in midafternoon and the sight of kenyon and one of his longago friends kissing passionately a long long time before no leery as he was concerning kenyon he would have to accept the notion that for now hed put him in his place and on warning to straighten up and serve soberly competently and chearly lewrie crossed his fingers over that hope as lt urquhart got savage under way and out to sea for the night damme though lewrie also thought if blessing him out wasn t hellishgreat fun chapter twentythree over the next few weeks lewrie could almost agree with kenyon that blockade duty was boresome indeed if there were merchant ships attempting to enter the gironde they were caught further out to sea by the larger frigates that served with the lineofbattle ships and if any vessel was prepared to depart bordeaux then the sight of royal navy ships hullup and prowling the rivers mouth put the wind up its master given the tides savage could only spend a few hours deep in the estuary and then only on fairweather days for the continual westerly winds off the bay of biscay could gust up to half a gale without warning pinning savage on a lee shore and able to beat only sixtysix degrees off the eye of the wind she could end up wrecked on either the north or south shores such a sack limited the usefulness of the two brigsloops of his small squadron too for squarerigged as they were they suffered the same limitations on how close they could go full and by should a blow arise if the weather got really bad they had two bad choices attempt to work their way further out to sea abandoning the blockade or try to anchor in the estuary and ride it out with both bowers down and dragging through the unfirm sandy seabed it was the foreandaft rigged cutterslt umphriess eightgunned argosy lt bartoes penguin and lt shalcrosss slightly larger tengunned bansheethat could dare operate inside the invisible dividing line twixt pointe de la coubre and soulac sur mer on a regular basis after meeting and diningin those three worthies lewrie could at least feel secure in his mind that his cutters were in good hands lt umphries was only twentytwo and some admirals favourite a lad with lots of interest and secure enough in his prospects to show a lot of sauce and high spirits lt bartoe on the other hand was in his midthirties had little official favour and penguin was his very first independent command he was therefore more hardbitten and taciturn but just as eager to get at the foe and prove himself at last lt shalcross might as well have been a swashbuckling pirate from the first decades of the eighteenth century from the days of blackbeard stede bonnet and captain kidd a very clever and aspiring fellow with the most engaging and exuberant personality all three were growing tired of stopping the same fishing boats each day of snooping within gunrange of the middlingsized fort near st georges de didonne to draw fire and nimbly tack about to frustrate the frogs or of taking a few potshots at the battery being built near pointe de grave to panic the local workers and slow progress lt bartoe was eldest the more senior by date of commission so lewrie gave him charge of all three cutters daily operations hinting that he would be highly pleased did the cutters make even more nuisances of themselves as for hms mischief and hms erato lewrie assigned them to work only slightly across the dividing line with erato to stand sentrygo from pointe de la coubre to st palais sur mer and sometimes taunt the st georges fort and for hogue in mischief to pace back and forth from the barren beach point below soulac sur mer to pointe de grave and if the wind allowed get close enough to take the battery under fire along with the cutters every now and then for himself and savage though he could not risk her across the line he had drawn except for the rarest circumstance lewrie began to feel commodore ayscoughs frustration with blockade duty of commanding from a distance no matter how short of being there to protect all his smaller and weaker vessels should the french get so tired of them that they sortied to try to drive them off he poached a little instead venturing north into charltons bailiwick as far as the northern end of the cote sauvage peninsula to the southern tip of lie doleron and the pertuis de maumusson the channel that led into the sheltered bay that lay behind the isle and the maze of waterways near the towns of marennes and la tremblade to the south savage might cruise into capt lockyears territory as far as the north end of the etang dhourtincarcans a shallow lake back of the barren beaches twixt hourtin and maubuisson just to keep the french honest and to relieve the boredom of tacking at the stroke of every second watch bell from one bank of the estuary to the other as predictably as a pendulum clock and to make things even more boresome medoc and aquitaine were unremarkable with very flat land no significant hills or headlands by which to navigate or take bearings the pine forests were immense and dark and from soulac sur mer south to cap ferret by arcachon and its large basin the dunes and beach were unbroken when scouting outside his proper area and going alongside capt lockyears gun arundeliox a relatively merry get to know each other dinner lewrie learned that the coast lockyear watched was much the same sameness all the way to biarritz and bayonne in the golfe de gascogne in yawning point of fact capt lockyear and his tiny squadron of cutters and schooners saw as little activity as lewries and frankly were beginning to make a few forays onto the beaches just to break the monotony at least in lockyears area of operations there were several thin rivers or wide creeks that fed directly to the sea below arcachon where they watered without opposition just lewries luck though the only freshwater streams hed spotted so far were near the tip of pointe de grave that split into three rills by le verdon sur mer right by that bloody abuilding gunbattery and the closest freshwater lake twixt hourtin and maubuisson lay more than two miles behind the beach the dunes and the sea but the idea of armed landingparties was tempting have you ever heard an estimate of how many french troops there are in medoc or cross the river in saintonge sir lewrie asked one day over dinner when commodore ayscough as weary of offshore plodding as he had brought hms chesterfield to within five leagues of the shore and had stumbled upon savage first cant say that i have sir ayscough had to admit frowning your cutters do you proud by the by and i am grateful for your kind offer of all this fresh butter goes well with the equally fresh rolls though id adore did you fetch off a sheep why do you ask lewrie sheer jawcracking boredom sir lewrie said chuckling i spoke captain lockyear and told you youd like him ayscough jovially interrupted got on like a house afire id wager aye sir we did indeed but lewrie began again explaining the watering and shooting parties that lockyear was performing upon his own beaches and streams supplying his crews with fresh game meat as well as potable water he reported very little opposition almost next to nothing sir surely theres more we might be doing than just swanning about and stopping the odd fishing smack there is that battery being built on pointe de grave for one id dearly love to have a go at it before its completed several kegs of powder all of my marines and a boat or two of armed seamen from each brig or cutter to run off the few french troops weve seen and we could blow it skyhigh but theres no peeking round the point into the two shallow bays east of le verdon sur mer lewrie complained not with tother fort cross the river able to fire completely across the gironde pointe de grave tapered to the noreast immediately to the east was a wide sweeping but small bay where all sorts of shipping or gunboats might lurk in fact after peering over the charts for hours on end lewrie had come to think of pointe de grave as a dragons head the point itself was an erect crest the shallow bay below it on the river was the slope of its snout and below that he could imagine the mouth and fangs for a very narrow small peninsula dashed due south as a natural breakwater very much like a long fang to protect the harbour of le verdon sur mer which looked like an opened mouth with another equally narrow peninsula or breakwater jutting east like a thin lower jaw below that where a stout neck would meet an upper torso lay one more cove which the charts indicated had sufficient depth for lighter coastal shipping and all of it as unknown as the blank swathes of an unexplored continent terra incognita indeed weve not learned all that much about the fort by saint georges de didonne either sir the weight of its artillery or the strength of its garrison lewrie explained whether theres a rampart on the land face or whether its an open threefaced lunette before hostilities commenced the french guarded the gironde with saint fort sur gironde far upriver and mostlike maintained a substantial garrison at bordeaux but now who knows that theyre building these two forts or batteries may indicate theyve stripped saint fort of troops powder shot and heavy artillery and have elected to defend closer to the sea doubtful wed ever muster sufficient forces to raid that deep up the gironde really ayscough mused aloud knife poised ready for a thick smear of mustard on his mutton chop not after the debacle of the vendee landings trusted royalist frogs to raise their commoners what and spring to arms with great britain thank god we didnt lose all that much when it failed prestige notwithstanding he took a bite of his mustardy mutton chewed blissfully for a moment then took a sip of wine aye it is possible that the french have shifted troops and guns nearer the estuary the risk to our own side in sending third rates and frigates upriver with the westerly winds square in their teeth in a narrowing stream should they be deterred would be too great take whole regiments perhaps an entire brigade of army troops as well and you and i know for certain that such an undertaking would have to be schemed and planned in london at horse guards which might take two years before a decision was reached then shuffled over to admiralty where another two years of muddling would be necessary hmmpf wish we could do something active though your french fishermen theyve related nothing of value some of the larger boats and some middlingsized do venture out past pointe de grave or pointe de la coubre sir and theyve come to accept savages presence as a minor nuisance not a threat to their livelihoods or boats and a source of coin for whatever they might smuggle out all our vessels hereabouts are reckoned good customers as i told you ha ha ayscough rejoined as he buttered a new roll a few silver shillings go a long way theyre locals though sir lewrie bemoaned and never get upriver so they know nothing of note about bordeaux or the condition of the old fortress theyve no reason to enter the local forts or the french army wont let em for fear of what theyd see a few of the captains soundlike theyd sell information if the reward was big enough but im still not sure which of em i can trust well there is that ayscough said with a wry rolling of his eyes over the perverse slyness of the french damme though lewrie wouldnt it be fine to put together an expedition to both of these pesky fortifications recall our assault on the pirate lair and fort in the spratly islands or our twopronged attack on balabac in the spanish philippines where we ran that fiend guillaume choundas to earth at last ha ha what grand times those were what sort of force might you muster for the landing ayscough suddenly demanded intrigued and savoury mutton chops bedamned my own marine complement would amount to fourtythree and off the brigsloops another fiftysix sir lewrie told him having done some preliminary scribblings over the last few days of ennui about ninety to an hundred armed sailors off all six vessels before our artillery and sailtending suffer not nearly enough sorry tsay no marines aboard your cutters and such aye the commodore grumped but should you smoak out the particulars anent what force the french own and does it sound feasible i have seventyodd marines aboard chesterfield perhaps in a month or two the second sixtyfour i requested may turn up with a matching number of marines available and with two sixtyfours i might be able to assemble about an hundred and fifty sailors to go ashore with themand bring both liners inside the estuary to take the lunette fort by saint georges under my fire to boot my god charlton sir id wager a rouleau of gold guineas charlton would leap at the chance and be heartbroken to be left out ayscough hooted thatd add another fourty marines and perhaps fifty sailors to the endeavour and does your plan seem intriguing to lord boxham i might be able to convince him to close the coast with two or three of his third rates and add his own marines and tars to the landings lewrie you dog a man after mine own heart a glass with you sir and success to you in discovering all needful facts cabin stewards refilled their glasses from a bottle of chateau dissan bordeaux a splendid little wine from a local seventeenthcentury vineyard little known beyond the medoc region so far but one that both ayscough and lewrie thought a treasure that went well with the mutton while it was more than pleasant to have commodore ayscough toast him and declare him an aggressive and active fellow possessed of such uncanny wit and wile lewrie thought there was one niggling hitch to such praise he would now have to deliver it was one thing to speculate idly and quite another to enter into a thorough investigation which would require long hours questioning french fishermen cajoling getting drunk bribing and playing a spys game to determine whether he was being told the truth the halftruth or having his leg pulled and two out of three could prove fatal then perhaps gulled like one of clotworthy chutes newly come heirs or haying the entire french defensive plan laid before him like moses first peek at the commandments he would actually have to plan a complicated operation with his head on the chopping block did it go awry oh wont this be just bags o fun he sarcastically thought as he clinked glasses with ayscough shouldve kept me bloody gob stopped what was ithinkin this is more twiggs game than mine sortin fact from fiction christ dont know if im bright enough for it another realisation struck him right after that doubt well two realisations really the first was that whenever in his life be it in his personal life or his naval career he had felt slyboots and clever dame fortune usually woke from her nap and came down from mount olympus to kick him firmly in the fundament the second was that he would have to make nice of a sudden with capitaine jules papin and that might be just too horrid to contemplate chapter twentyfour dye trust any of the fishermen ye run across lewrie asked of commander nathaniel hogue some days later and finding it remiss of him to have served with the younger man in the far east yet never learned his christian name til then this papin fellow for instance oh him hogue said with a wry chuckle frankly sir i am surprised he hasnt crammed a dozen local whores aboard his boat and pimped them out to us on a dayrate papin is a thorough rogue in my humble opinion rogue enough to sell information at any rate and so far what little hes grudgingly related to me or the cutters has proven true mind now captain lewrie hogue cautioned i only speak of shilling revelations not gold lieutenants bartoe shalcross and umphries and i hold much the same opinion of msieur papin and where his loyalties lie which is in personal profit such a confident young man lewrie thought recalling the last time hed served with hogue when the lad had been a somewhat shy and diffident cully a tad naive of the ways of the world and straight as a die now though after years of service and on his own bottom hogue was as chirpy as a magpie and just about as sure of himself in those days when hogue had contracted the pox from some chinese whore hed blushed and stammered and skulked in shame like a pregnant nun damme was la bad influence on him back then lewrie asked himself mostlike aye ive something in mind sir lewrie told him over glasses of cold tea in savages greatcabins late summer in the bay of biscay was warm days and muggy seaside nights just enough so to make the cold tea refreshing do we gather enough information to improve our odds we might have a chance to reduce the battery on pointe de grave and may even convince lord boxham to bring some of his liners inshore to help take the fort cross the river too the biggest snag o course will be what forces the french maintain hereabouts and where what weight of artillery we really face and how quickly the local garrison could march to counter us may not come off but oh finally sir hogue crowed rocking boyishly on his chair with a hand clasping a raised knee weve spent weeks and weeks just staring at that new battery as it is being erected at last being allowed to fire upon it well to land take it and slight it would just be delightful just watching it being built lewrie asked puzzled how so well sir hogue reddened slightly and lost his buoyant airs far be it from me to say anything uncomplimentary or insubordinately of a senior officer but dont know why not lewrie cynically scoffed tis usually a hellishgood relief uhm in that case sir since you put it that way hogue said in a soft voice all but peering squintapipes in the dark corners of lewries quarters to see if there might be a witness to his disloyalty commander kenyon said our chiefest role was stopping commerce entering or departing the gironde sir that we were not to risk our vessels by entering the possible gunrange of the saint george fort or dare to go east of point grave we could stop and search as many fishing boats as we wished and ask of doings ashore but that was to convince the french of the impossibility of any imports or exports and by not confronting their guns or giving them any chance to do us harm foment in french minds a notion of our invincibility and inevitability ahum i see lewrie slowly drawled a dark frown forming on his face well such might be decent goals but once the battery on the point is finished such orders and cautions would force us to give it a wide berth too convincing the frogs that do they build a set of batteries up the north shore we could be frightened out beyond pointe de la coubre or three miles to seaward of soulac sur mer assuming as we have sir that the french possess fourtytwopounder guns in sufficient number hogue pointed out the commander may have decided that the few men we have aboard our ships could make no impression on the saint george fort for certain and could only delay the completion of the one on point grave and were we repulsed with casualties fill the french with confidence defeats tend tdo that lewrie mused aloud if i thought the frogs had four or five thousand troops they could whistle up on short notice id be much of the same mind but so far we dont know just how dangerous a landing could be and we must find out just like the old days isnt it captain lewrie hogue asked with a cheerful grin chasing the french and lanun rovers from the malacca straits to canton and back and but slowly knitting all of the clues together very much like aye lewrie agreed i will speak erato sometime this afternoon for the nonce id like you to pass word to our cutter captains and tell them to begin pressing cajoling and bribing the fishermen even sharper and i would very much like for them to discover for me just what lies behind le verdon sur mer the port the bay by the point and that cove below the village uhm if i may make a suggestion sir hogue said but weve come to name places more anglicised to avoid confusion we say point grave stead of pointe de grave and say it like a churchyard grave verdn saint george stead of all that de didonne flummery soolack mashers stead of meschers sur gironde point coober stead of de la coubre and royan well thatun needs no change but i see lewrie said well thank god fort for my french is next to nonexistent and i mangle enough already so itisnt the cote sauvage its the savage coast is it my coast perhaps or might well be by the time im done with it ha ha capital idea just cause the frogs own em is no reason we have to go all nasal and hawn hawn tsay em uhm there will be another matter captain lewrie hogue said in a more serious tone so far we purchase wine foodstuffs and news with shillings halfcrowns and crown pieces in silver and with the shortage of specie aboard our ships at present and the shortage of it at home we might need an infusion of coin and how that may be found or from whom ive not the slightest hope i seriously doubt that admiralty would ship us out a keg or two o guineas im suddenly so responsible for it i have to pay for it too lewrie gawped to himself this could get as expensive as lawyers ill sail out and speak to commodore ayscough again lewrie somewhat reluctantly vowed who knows maybe his scottish clan is richer than midas maybe he could arrange a whipround of his wardroom for donations god knows if ayscough has to submit it to lord boxham they both have to refer it to admiralty well still be spectators off this coast til next epiphany if lord boxham thinks it valuable sir he might give us some of his contingency funds hogue rather wistfully suggested he wants what fleet the frogs might have up by bordeaux to come out so he can crush em commander hogue lewrie gravelled ruining their forts spikin guns and all might scare them out of the idea there is that sir sad tsay said hogue deflated perhaps we could bribe these fishermen in other ways hogue lewrie mused bosun stores lumber spare canvas and such with rum ragged as most of em dress slopclothing might move em tell our cutter captains we must do it on the cheap but done it must be if the french prove tbe too strong ttake on then we wont become debtors and beggars if the endeavour does prove practicable then weve bought ourselves a victory for hapence i shall be on my way then sir hogue declared after he had finished his cold tea and thank you for a most refreshing beverage i must obtain some lemons from shore do they grow them here and emulate you god speed young sir and it was damned good tsee you after all these years my congratulations pon your promotion and command and aye now we work together again as we did in the far east we may raise a parcel o mischief on the french hey lewrie said as he walked him to the quarterdeck i await such with all avidity captain lewrie hogue assured him chapter twentyfive another day another disappointment lewrie glumly decided as hms savage sidled up alongside yet another french fishing boat nearly five miles off soulac sur mer now better known as soolack he had met up with capitaine jules papin and his marie doux several days past but rencontre with that fishsmelly rogue had not exactly been all that productive in the way of information in other ways papin had proved true to his word for his boat had produced nearly a slingload of goodies from shore papin had promised cheeses and eggs and he had come through to the delight of the midshipmens mess and the officers wardroom who had vowed to chip in and go shares navyissue cheese came in two varieties a cheddar and something else unidentifiable hard and crumbly both of which sprouted mould and simply oozed wormlets after a month or so at sea these though were fresh and as creamy sweet and soft on the tongue as pats of butter the eggs several dozen of them had probably not been candled to determine whether the shells hid tasty yolks or unhatched chicks but a quick inspection in front of a strong lanthorn could decide that and with luck the broody hens already roosting in savages forecastle manger would accept a few extras and keep them warm til they hatched resulting in a few more roast chicken suppers for the fortunates papin had come through with several straw baskets of fruit as well apples pears and such there had been middling sacks of sugar and flour baskets of table grapes and bags of raisins three young suckling pigs two smallish turkeys and a kid goat and a partriidge in a pear tree midshipman mayhall had caroled to the amusement of all as he seized a bag of fresh cherries small baskets of peas and beans for fresh soups not the reconstituted portable soup the navy issued in gangrenouslooking slabs salad greens carrots cabbages and onions oh my it was a godsend and for lewrie along with some foodstuffs had come a case of wine a mix of medocs sauternes and white graves along with the reds of the region from chateau margaux chateau latour bravemouton and lafite there were batailleys dissans loudennes paulliac and stestephe and wonder of wonders a onegallon stone crock of american bourbon whisky which bore the stencilpainted mark of the evan williams distillery in faroff bardstown kentucky capitaine papin you are a miracle worker lewrie had told him non msieur i am ze smuggler miraculeux papin had sourly rejoined i am ze smuggler oo is to he paid nestce pas ze dry smuggler in need of ze rum hawn hawn they had repaired below to crack a bottle for papin which hed keep and a second bottle for his crew to keep them sweet and silent lewrie dug into his coin purse and laid out the reckoning allowing the frenchman to see the gold guinea coins that he had placed in it just for that purpose you are successful in prizemoney capitaine kein papin commented as lewrie laid the purse out of reach but still in sight papin licked his lips and gave the washleather drawstring purse sly sideofhiseye glances and rubbed his still unshaven chin rather well in fact lewrie told him he thanked papin for the delivery striving to not sound too profusely grateful hinting that a working arrangement once a week or so would be welcome and there is another matter one you raised when we first crossed hawses capitaine papin lewrie said striving too for offhandedness idle curiosity not avidity concerning information ah oui ze information hawn hawn papin said a hand inside his coarse and filthy smock to scratch his chest i do not know zat much but he tossed back a deep slug of rum keeping his eye locked on lewries all the time what msieur wish to know well for one do the gunners at saint georges de didonne keep the guns manned round the clock damme i must sail into the bay and keep watch but i dislike being shot at all the time lewrie said in a forced chuckle savage is a stout ship but not proof against their fourtytwopounders papin smiled back saying nothing a particularly greasy smile mean tsay lewrie had gone on feeling lame do they have enough troops tmaintain three watches give me guinea msieur papin soberly said holding out his hand palm up garrison is small non ave eavy guns dixhuit ze eighteens et ze douze ze twelves only ze six sixpounders in water battery below an ze swivels non as much as you fear ze guinea vite vite he insisted snapping his fingers lewrie handed over a guinea coin still unsure if he was being twitted and taken for a fool it sounded too good to be true not as many as i fear is it how many of the heavier guns capitaine i see zem drill i ave count capitaine lirr m sieur papin growled as he slipped the coin into a sloptrouser pocket mon dieu keep marie doux at royan dock ave home in royan an when zey practice zey keep all awake each face ave ze four openings oui papin explained leaning forward fort ave two of ze twelves only one of ze eighteens each face comprendre only ave men each gun require plus ze dozen more for keep watch hein old navire de guerre at bordeaux rotted at piers zey strip an bring id by ze barges ozzer old ships zat cannot sail iarmee strip aussi tak mos guns to forts on channel to iest on german frontier msieur as they bring the stone for the pointe de grave battery walls lewrie asked pouring papin another dollop of rum out papin agreed leaning back in his chair legs extended stone mus come from ze dordogne zere is beaucoup trop sand in zis part of medoc an saintonge cross river many barges lewrie prompted are they ever escorted une more guinea papin tantalised hand out once more when you can tell me how many and when they come lewrie said instead slyly chuckling and if theyre escorted i assume they put into that wee harbour behind le verdon sur mer sometime papin slowly allowed with his own sly laugh what does lie behind the point in the port bay and cove msieur you do not pay i do not remember papin replied with an avaricious oily grin wish to know i mus go see zen you mus pay me nozzer guinea i do not go to le verdon zat often try this then lewrie wheedled handing over two shillings where could i land boats and gather firewood and water without a risk of being attacked he spread a chart for papin to look over papin took the silver coins and shoved them into his pocket i wish wood an water msieur i go ashore on la cote sauvage spend night sometime off beach here get to fish before ozzers oo ave sleep in port fresh stream beaucoup trees almos no one live zere an no soldier presque jamais he coni eluded with a shrug hardly ever hey lewrie translated aloud finding it droll very well then capitaine papin fair enough merci for what you have told me so far and for all the wine bread and butter and the whisky we must meet again soon perhaps then you will have learned more and another guinead be a fair trade perhaps more if you could learn how many troops there are here say within twenty miles of royan or pointe de grave bon papin cynically cried i ave ze devoirs ze asignement i am good boy i win ze prize hein oui i do zis pour vous even if you are cursed anglais sanglant hawn hawn papin had thrown back the last of his rum tucked the bottle in the large chest pocket of his smock grabbed a second to take for his small crewfelt in his trouser pocket to recount his money for a brief halfhours workand had gone on deck for his boat now whos thisun lewrie asked as they sidled up near another decentsized boat out fishing beyond the hook of point cooberhave we seen her before mister urquhart they both peered at a singlemasted boat of about thirty feet or so rigged with a small jib and a gaffhung mainsl she was worn and shabby and held but three crew none of whom seemed alarmed by a british frigate she and hms savage were four miles to seaward of the coast so there could be no escape for her oddly though she steered towards the frigate putting lewrie in mind of a similar boat full of maniacs and powder kegs who had tried to blow hms proteus out of the water off st domingues north coast during the british invasion of that gory french possession and the slavearmys rabid resistance lewrie almost felt an urge to steer away let this one go just in case the frogs had gotten so frustrated by the loss of commerce that a screeching hairpulling official in bordeaux had asked for volunteers full of patriotism and hatred whod take a british warship with them by the prickin o me thumbs somethin wicked this way comes lewrie thought i believe ive seen her before sir lt urquhart carefully ventured something bout her sail patches but much closer down to soulac than here i think it was lewrie peered at her with his telescope a piece more then took a look about savages decks the swivel guns were manned and ready in the iron stanchion mounts atop the bulwarks and at least ten marines and a corporal were in full kit and red uniforms following his standing orders for dealing with so many inspections and searches she comes alongside an pounder ball dropped overside would sink her in a blink he decided she looks as if she wants tbe stopped mister urquhart so well oblige lewrie said fetch the ship to if you please sir coxn he called out aye sor liam desmond piped up from below the quarterdeck in the waist where he had been idly chaffering with his mates in lewries boat crew bring the launch round from towing astern and be ready to inspect yon fishing boat desmond the usual drill marines and a midshipman this morning its mister mayhall lewrie ordered aye sir the midshipman cried eager for something to do it took only minutes to swing savage up to the wind haul round the launch to the larboard entryport and get desmonds oarsmen and a quartet of marines and midshipman mayhall aboard for a minute or so it looked as if the fishing boat might try to come alongside but just as soon as they saw the launch being manned her captain took in sail and let her rock and toss on the oceans scend to await a boarding bottle o rum in my cabins aspinall lewrie casually ordered same as usual and lay out my coin purse you know the drill aye sir ill have a glass o tea poured fer you too th same colour praps this frenchie wont know th diffrence an wont be insulted his shrewd cabin servant replied long as ye just sip at it slow capm he cheekily added an dont give the game away point taken aspinall lewrie laughed off with you back came the launch to the starboard entryport this time as a sign of honour rendered even to a civilian frenchman four hands and four marines made the salutingparty and bosuns mate ellison did a pipe on his silver call worthy of a postcaptain though it looked wasted on the fellow who scrambled up the battens and manropes capitaine bienvenu a bord lewrie said going so far as to doff his hat and receiving a sketchy knuckle to the right brow below the burly frenchmans knit cap parlezvous langlais oui i do the husky fellow admitted captain alan lewrie his brittanic majestys navy jean brasseur capitaine the fellow answered long ago we are named brass you commandeur ho hogue oui he speak to me uhm las week does he mention zis not yet no sir lewrie said mystified brass did ye say your name was long ago oui it was

him lies i adore ze fine brandy capitaine brasseur suggested with a broader grin aussi uhm also i have ze fine fish to sell then pray join me below lewrie offered where you may have an excellent aged brandy and we may discuss what you have to sell like all men who grow from boyhood to middle age in the fishing trade jean brasseur was a weathered man with exposed flesh seared to a dry tanned leather his hands were large and callused by nets and sailtending lines by oars and hard labour his fingers blunt and his nails squarecut with one or two missing like papin and so many of the other fishermen that savage had come across brasseur wore a loose serge de nimes smock over a plain ecru shirt and faded dark blue sloptrousers unlike the othersperhaps for this meetinghe was newshaven and his long dark and curly hair looked freshwashed too and he didnt even half smell of fish ver good brandy merci capitaine brasseur said with a grin of pleasure zese days good brandy ard to find more than welcome lewrie said playing host and sipping at his tea slowly as aspinall had directed you say your kin were once english all aquitaine owned by les anglais three century capitaine brasseur explained with a large gallic shrug hitching himself upright on his chair is s when france take it back at last mafamille come as anglais soldier john brass peutetre around ze s e marry local jeune

much stink an merde oh la youre quite a way from le verdon this morning though sir lewrie pointed out rather cagily he thought to himself do you always fish this far from home waters oh we ave more

not hein hawn hawn hawnf id minets ici venei brasseur coaxed puckering his lips and making kisskiss enticements even essaying a meow and toulon and chalky got up enough courage to sniff at his trousers after that it was instant adoration for the mans clothes did bear a faint reek of fish the big blackandwhiteun is toulon where i got him lewrie told his guest to answer brasseurs raised brow in at the siege the littlun thats chalky crayeux came off a french brig in the west indies in when young man i am in west indies brasseur declared with a broad grin of pleased surprise as he stroked both cats who found the aromas on his fingers as tantalising as his trouser legs was in ze navy wiz admiral comte de grasse battle of ze chesapeake zen at yorktown malheureux unfortunate was axissi at ze battle of ze saintes where you admiral rodney defeat us was at yorktown lewrie exclaimed in like enthusiasm to meet a veteran from the opposite side of his early adventures we got out the night before the surrender so you were french navy lewrie said with an idle thought in the back of his mind that the man might still be to end of americain war oui capitaine come ome sail wiz merchant trade

brasseur topping off the mans brandy was time i think to go hack to navy brasseur said when ze revolution just begin but he heaved a sigh and stuck his nose in his glass for a deep sip many good people ere in medoc are for ze assembly end of king louiss rule an become free republicains like america but zen brasseur laid out a litany of woe as the initial high hopes of a reasoned logical and bloodless call for change had become a revolution turning more violent and capriciously murderous with each passing month locals in the medoc in saintonge cross the gironde were torn twixt monarchy or its complete eradication the provinces of vendee and charente not so far north of medoc had risen in counterrebellion in favour of the king in defence of the catholic religion which the revolutionaries had banned and stripped of its riches which brought blood murder plunder and noquarter combat and the people of medoc had shivered in dread of their own neighbours as the armies of the directory marched closer with their drumhead courts and guillotines in tow like siegeartillery after king louis and queen marie antoinette were executed in and the madmen of the terror had begun to lop the heads off anyone even slightly ennobled or who had worked for the monarchy even serving girls who had styled the hair of the rich and titled the medoc had turned on its own and longterm spites grudges envies or debts had turned to accusations of being monarchist reactionaries true enthusiasm for the revolution had gone away replaced by fear for ones own safety and dread of neighbours then had come conscription to raise the worlds first enormous army of citizensoldiers from every class the levee en masse so the frontiers could be defended against what had felt like all the rest of europe the levee had swept up brasseurs eldest son his younger brother and both his inlaws sons one died in alsace under kellerman one died of the black plague near gaza under napoleon bonaparte one had come home halfblind and crippled from bonapartes first italian campaign and brasseur had not heard from his son posted on the savoian border in months and feared the worst may be good zat zose fools in paris ave been swept aside brasseur morosely stated all pomp an silliness ze men of ze directory revolution countercoup fighting among zemselves ze new calendar which make no sense centimetres metres an kilometres ze gram centigram an kilogram bah still ave church in village still ave priest but when fort is finish an garrison come will zey allow notre church stay open or turn it to temple of reason brasseur sneered he thought it was good that general napoleon bonaparte was now first consul after his successful coup detat that had removed the tyrannical and illogical directory maybe bonaparte would abandon his military career and sue for peace then concentrate on righting many wrongs to set france to rights but brasseur also thought that the crowned heads of prussia austria and great britain could not tolerate revolutionary republican and successfully militant france not for very long if they wished to keep their own citizens in line and docile too many castiron liberty trees had been set up across europe with america now france to emulate peutetre capitaine what as appen in france will be good so long as france doesnt feel dutybound to spread revolution round the globe lewrie countered cork is out of bottle peutetre brasseur rejoined smiling in a worldweary manner an peutetre france must be beaten for example ow not to become ze republic here now that sounds intriguin lewrie thought whats this man offerin how so capitaine brasseur he asked do ze dutch need guillotines to be ze batavian republic or ze piedmontese venetians ze ozzer states in italy zey depose ze royalty but not behead or purge zeir peoples msieur if france is no more aggressive if france as more care for things at home if france as to look west to protect ze coast au lieu de uhm ow you call instead of lewrie supplied wishing he could cross fingers for his french was awful ah oui instead of ah looking to expand east comprendre perhaps a fleabite along the biscay coast every now and then a repeat of the francobritish expedition on the vendee coast lewrie carefully posed might keep bonaparte looking over his shoulder not looking for new conquests into the germanies keep the bastard from plannin an invasion of england certainlewrie grimly thought ze fleabite oui msieur capitaine brasseur gravely replied with a slow sage nod of his head ze many fleabite hein hellishhard that lewrie told him less sufficient forces could be scraped tgether and a good place discovered to strike with no intelligence of local sentiments opposing forces available all that one would require a great deal of factual information m sieur brasseur left off petting the cats and leaned forward elbows atop his knees and rolling his glass between his hands such facts could be found out capitaine he said in a soft guarded voice and with a sly glare in his eyes all i suffer all neighbours suffer i owe la revolution nozzing m sieur last son a moi is sixteen revolution take my eldest do zey take him aussi e become gunner at pointe de grave fort or march away to die in faraway prussia bah peu peutetre a fleabite ere msieurl brasseur declared in heat before calming and still hunkered over sipped at his drink i speak of zis to votre commandeur hogue he added e say e must speak to you or i speak to you myself if lewrie cautiously supposed aloud if you were to supply the information which made a fleabite here possible might you and your family require a means of escape msieur brasseur jean it is possible if ze authorities discover oo talk to you brasseur cagily allowed rubbing his chin and shrugging but zere are so many fishermen you stop each day oo is to say which man tell you what is it you need to know before the flea bites hein your village lewrie said daring to trust him at last i cant see round the point so your little harbour the bay north of le verdon the cove south of the mole how far along the construction of the battery how many troops already there and how many troops on the south side of the gironde there are within two hours march when you have discovered all i ask of you stray out to sea again and hoist a long pendant from your masttip i note you have none now i shall pay guineas for what you learn capitaine brasseur say a guinea now as well non msieur brasseur replied non ze guinea better ze silver shillings spend gold coin an ze gendarmerie take notice of zis and suspect besides i ave not yet sold you my fish hein brasseur said with a wide smile and a laugh done and done lewrie declared reaching for his coin purse lewrie ended up with another basket full of a medley of oysters clams mussels and shrimp along with brasseurs wifes recipe for the famous biscay mussel dish mouclade which he would serve his officers that very evening brasseur had also sold the wardroom and the midshipmens cockpit some large fish he had trawled on his way out to sea since brasseur didnt usually put in on the north shore of the river gironde he knew little of the doings at the st georges fort or the weight of its guns he had seen the artillery barged in over the last year and thought they might have been long eighteens or twentyfours but could not say with certainty yes barges laden with dordogne stone put into his home port of le verdon sur mer and he had never seen an escort and it was a rare thing to see a saildriven or galleystyle oared gunboat near pointe de grave nor many light warships either and yes brasseur had sometimes sailed along the savage coast to go up to marennes or la tremblade on the far side of the peninsula mostly to trade for salt so he could preserve some of his catch but he had never overnighted on the windward beaches so could not confirm the presence of a freshwater stream or pool pine trees for firewood but of course there were he had assured lewrie lewrie could barely contain his rising excitement til papin or brasseur or both fetched back news from shore newspapers lewrie chid himself again though hed all but tied a string round his finger to recall the need for recent french papers and what they might inadvertantly reveal no more just these two lewrie silently decided as hms savage slowly loafed her way seaward for the night into the beginnings of a spectacularly fiery sunset too many pointed questions of too many of the local fishermen and suspicions would be roused with the local authorities too much coin doled out and just one drunken fisherman who had cooperated and savage would be swampedby others eager to earn a golden guinea with just any sort of fantasy or moonshine if papin and brasseur brought back good tidings he could come up with a workable plan to lay before ayscough who was always ready for a good scrap perhaps a goodenough plan to entice rearadmiral lord boxham to participate too before he died of boredom out beyond the horizon yearning with drawn daggers for the french to sortie jules papin could he trust him so far hed proved greedily honest and what little he had related was true an amoral man without a jot of patriotism with his eyes ever on the main chance jean brasseur lewrie wondered a fellow in need of money but a disappointed patriot as well at least brasseur had not attempted to spin a fools tale had freely admitted what he did not know and could not say with assurance take what both say with a grain osalt aye lewrie speculated thatdbe safest they agree all well and good their accounts vary too much then christ whatll i do thenif they do though lewrie resisted the urge to chew on a thumbnail as he pondered what he wished to accomplish clapping both hands in the small of his back and rocking on the balls of his booted feet instead wondering if he might be aspiring to too much not just a landing by the pointe de grave battery to drive off the workers and officers so he could blow it apart no there was the completed small lunette fort by st georges de didonne too with any luck at all there might be barges in le verdons harbour to take or burn with enough force devoted to the endeavourand hed have to talk a blue streak to see that there wasa landing could be made by royan a quick march behind the st georges fort an assault from the unguarded land side pray god that papin could tell him for sure so he could spike all those guns as well lay charges to topple those ramparts rout both garrisons and sail out with prisoners perhapspeutetre even stay ashore long enough to barge the artillery out to sea and scuttle them or have enough marines to meet any relief column on the shore road from talmont and give them a bloody nose to boot hopeless bloody daftlewrie irritably thought reining in his galloping imaginingsyet it beats waitinthear bout my legal troubles or a recall tface trial dont it bloodyjust there was also a nagging qualm that would not stay tamped down am i doin all this cause it needs doin or am i so desp rate for glory t keep me from the hangman chapter twentysix the task of wooding and watering at papins indicated spring required a good part of the day with savage anchored half a mile offshore of the lonely and heavily forested cote sauvage parallel to the beaches with the best bower and heaviest stern kedge anchor down with springs on the cables the starboard side guns were manned and by tightening or loosing the springlines hms savage could be swung to bring fire against any threat that emerged from the woods all the ships boats were led from towing astern or hoisted off the boattier beams that spanned the breadth of the hull swung out by employing the main course yard as a crane then loaded with the oldest water casks the ones whose contents had gone whiskytan and so reeky as to make the stored water a punishment to drink and giving a sickly taste to any rations boiled up in it from the first peek of dawn to long after the midday meal the workingparties hewed and chopped wood gathering dryer deadfall limbs and twigs for kindling taking down manageablesized younger trees for cordwood hacking and splitting them to thighlong lengths the inside of each huge water butt was scoured clean of slime with salt water and beach sand rinsed then trundled inland to the freshwater creek and a spring that jules papin had vaguely pointed to on a chart filled and trundled back to the beach to be rowed out to the frigate then labouriously hoisted aboard for storage in the bilges on the orlop with the cordwood and kindling crammed between to keep them from shifting least the seas kind lewrie thought as he took off his hat and mopped his brow on a shirtsleeve then felt like spitting for luck though the skies had clouded over by midmorning and the height of the incoming waves breaking on the barren beaches had risen a foot or so his frigate was not yet pitching heaving and rolling and threatening to pluck her anchors from the sandy bottom and drive aground sideways the ships boats working in savages calmer lee made good time fetching their heavy cargoes back alongside and the scend that rolled under the keel still allowed the landsmen doing the heavy pulleyhauley work to hoist the refilled butts up and over the side and into the holds still no sign of trouble mister devereux lewrie asked of his marine officer the sentries have yet to report any movement along the road sir lt devereux replied he had landed with two files of marines twenty men in all leaving sgt skipwith aboard with the other half of the marine complement cpl plymouth with ten marines was posted in a wide arc about two musket shots to the east of the spring for a close guard over the workingparties cpl dudley with another ten marines devereux had posted even deeper into the woods to keep watch over the rough sand and dirt track that lay a mile further east to alert them to any threat coming along that road i must allow sir that this is the most amazing thing to actually be standing on the foes home ground pray god sir do we land in france again we meet just as dull a reception lewrie joshed but aye it does feel daring to be here a proper postcaptain would have remained aboard pacing slowly and fretfully about allowing his junior officers and midshipmen opportunity for action and mention in despatches a lazy postcaptain most certainly would by this point in his naval career though alan lewrie knew himself too well he despaired of ever being proper and given his druthers would be lazy yet the lure of walking on firm soil for an hour or so the temptation to tread on french sand gravel pine needle beds and grass to in essence stick his tongue out at the snaileatin bastards was simply too great to be denied and admittedly the fretting about the rising of wind and sea the arrival of a french column a young peasant couple disturbed from their fornication in the shady groves by the spring whod leap up and away and raise the hue and cry had driven him beyond distraction so once most of the water butts most of the firewood had been stowed below he had ordered lt urquhart to take charge of the frigate and had gone ashore himself armed to the teeth with his pair of twinbarreled manton pistols his hanger his ferguson breechloading riflemusket slung over his shoulder and an east asian pirates krees knife and scabbard jammed into one of his hessian boots the knuckles of the imagined clenched fist which the cote sauvage resembled in lewries mind at least ran north to south for seven miles or so and the charts did not show any settlements at all the whole way at the bottom of the fist inside the hook of pointe de la coubre lay the tiny village of la palmyre east of the thumb up north lay ronce les bains cross the channel from the lie doleron and but one lonely track that squiggled through the forests from one to the other might be a garrison at ronce les bains dye imagine lewrie asked to close the pertuis de maumusson channel sir id think there would be a battery near there but the closest garrison town would more likely be la tremblade or marennes lt devereux speculated in a soft voice his eyes focussed more on the dense woods than lewrie on wary guard til back aboard the ship about five miles from here as the crow flies but eight miles by this road captain and are our charts accurate lewrie also mused aloud about fourteen miles from royan unless there are more roads than the one i see that runs from la tremblade to saujon with a secondary road from that good road at the crossroads that turns south to the village of saint sulpice de royan to the coast commander hogues mischief just days after lewries encounter with papin and brasseur had stopped one of his regular fishermen and had finally produced a slew of newspapers and a rough chart of roads and settlements north of the gironde which lewrie had ordered copied and distributed to all his commanders how much trust he could put in it was still up in the air but at least it was a start the papers barely days old were full of boastful malarkey and gasconade but of much more evident value when it came to information about the state of things in france and in the local area last water butt is ready to roll sir lt gamble announced he looked quite pleased with himself and a tad excited that they had snuck onto their enemys shore and seemed to be getting away unseen very well mister gamble lewrie said with a grin feeling a sense of relief himself it was one thing to dare but quite another to linger too long be sure we gather up all the axes and saws as we go mister fisher the carpenter would have our nutmegs off did we lose a single honing stone i shall call in my sentries from the road sir lt devereux said with a casual finger to the brim of his hat in salute i spose i should return to the beach lewrie told him with a sigh of resignation it had felt so good to get his boots dusty for a few hours youll find me there mister devereux aye aye sir but before devereux could send a runner to cpl dudley a marine private came panting out of the woods from the road his musket unslung and held across his chest ready for action french sodjers on th road sir he panted as he slammed to attention lowering his musket to his side bout alf a compny corprl dudley says sir e thinks no moren thirtyr fourty of em sir shamblinalong e says ttell ye sir from th south sir from royan mostlike lewrie muttered but why why now and why here damme have we been betrayedhe furiously thought do they seem to be looking for our presence private langdon lt devereux asked in a harsh rasp as he fiddled with the hilt of his smallsword and the tightness of his blade in the scabbard uh shamblin morelike sir like corprl dudley said private langdon repeated bracing to stiffer attention offcer on a orse coupla mules carryin tentsr somethin goin along at route step an gobblin away in frog sir lt devereux turned a wolfish look at lewrie lewrie looked at him with a gleam in his eyes and unslung his ferguson lt devereux was all but wagging his tail and whining to be let loose to be sicced mister gamble unarmed men to get the water butt back to the beach armed men to come with me lewrie growled mister locke will come with me sorry mister gamble but someone must command the others this once aye sir a letdown lt gamble sighed whilst mr locke the midshipman about hopped in joy lets go and see if we can sting the bastards lewrie snapped first of the fleabites mister devereux the coast road was a mile inland of the spring from which they had taken their water and lewries party of marines and armed sailors were shambling and panting by the time they reached it cpl dudley rose from a crouch behind a thick clump of bush and waddled bent over deeper into the forest to report to lt devereux twenty privates one corporal one lieutenant mister locke if he does know how t shoot lewrie toted up as he lingered further back in the woods waiting for devereuxs report eight tars with muskets and no marksmen either and me hmmm damme but all this runnin corporal dudley here spotted them down the road sir coming from la palmyre it would seem lt devereux whispered after he had retreated to lewries side the road is clear north of us and hes seen no traffick other than these french soldiers theyre about half a mile down that way from us at present shuffling along slowly sir lewrie looked about wondering how the devil they could hide an ambush with the marines kitted out in their red coats and white pipeclayed crossbelts his sailors mostly in calico shirts and white sloptrousers in your considered military opinion mister devereux any cover thick enough in which to hide our men til they get up to close musketshot shit was that grammatical he chid himself sod it hmm devereux speculated going on tiptoe to the verge of the road and peeking up and down its length then coming back there is a copse of secondary growth about two musketshot to the south captain quite thick it looks to be do we order the men to lie prone til the last moment it should serve quite well they would march past us as near as ten yards sir hats off of course but of course mister devereux lewrie agreed with a twinkle lets sneak our people down there whilst we can prime firelocks now carefully ye ignrt maggots dudley hissed at his marines once primed slowly ease yer pieces off cock an god elp th man discharges fore the leftenant saysta for yell git no elp from me hear me mister locke our men are primed lewrie asked um i uh dont know sir the eager midshipman answered christ lewrie spat sailors were trained in the use of muskets and pistols but were nowhere near as well drilled as the marines they even loaded ye wonder mister locke the lad turned red as lewrie went to see for himself no not a single piece was loaded so he saw to supervising loading himself after they got into cover halfcock good prime good now close yer frissons now very carefully or youll give the game away and we wont get a chance tkill any frogs firm thumb on the lock sneak the triggers and ease em down slow slowly everyone off cock thankee jesus now dont get the damn things hung up in the bushes as you lay down with yer hats off and lie quiet as the grave lewrie drew both his pistols and placed them on the ground for easy grabbing took off his cocked hat and lay down with his longarm by his side you must be skilled in weaponry mister locke lewrie whispered to the midshipman who had come to lie prone by his captains side looking miserable more than the hands so you may be the tutor the master at everything that our sailors must know dye see it was my fault their muskets werent loaded since we were countin on our marines to guard us though i imagined that mister gamble had ordered them loaded and safely set aside before they began work my fault to assume use me as an object lesson if you will young sir how not to fart about lewrie concluded with a wry grin aye aye sir midshipman locke whispered back gulping in awe that a postcaptain the fearsome ramcat lewrie would admit to his mistake and when the time comes rise up when ordered pick a target keep yer eyes open stead o shuttin em aim for the belly a little below your fellows breast plate or the vee of his crossbelts then gently squeeze the trigger and take the frogeatin sonofabitch down lewrie instructed grimly this time no false sentiment no shootin wide or high cause it dont seem christian tkill a man unawares and unready theres nothin fair bout what were about tdo so dont bother looking for fair better him than you what aye aye sir locke mumbled his face now pinched and paler than before as the enormity of what they were about to do struck home hist now lads quiet as mice was lewries last whisper they heard the french coming the clop of the officers horse the dull plopping of the pack animals hooves and the shuffle and drum of unsynchronised outofstep infantry boots on the soft dirt and sand of the road it might once have been planked by laying trimmed tree trunks either end to end or crosswise with soil sand and stabilising gravel but from what little lewrie had seen of the road it had been a long time ago and the handiest trees beside the planned road had grown back into a tangle of secondary growth and thick bushes not six feet beyond the verges the pines and mixed hardwoods beyond easy cutting stood nigh an hundred feet tall with adult boughs interlaced together overhead so that the road resembled a narrow but deep tunnel through a very dark green and gloomy thicket laughter someone was telling a joke another frenchman related his need for a loan til the end of the month one bitched about that whore whod cheated him at the bordello in royan a sergeant was down on the typical neerdowell lackwit soldier whose pack straps were chafing him whose musket showed sign of rust round the firelock and bernard you skinflint hand me your tobacco pouch and go foutre yourself alphonse you never pay me back you sorry beggar from the fellow named bernard wait wait wait lt devereux was mouthing under his breath rising to one knee then up cock yer locks aim and firel the range was about ten yards as the brown bess muskets levelled in rough aim the french soldiers froze for a second their shambling march halted lewrie saw one fellow with his shako on the back of his head his musket borne behind his shoulders and probably unloaded to boot before he could free a hand to swing it down from behind his neck a musket ball thrummed dirt and dust from the white facing of his tunic and replaced it with a bright splash of blood just above the mans brass breast plate and crossbelts lewrie cocked his ferguson took aim at an older soldier with a single diagonal chevron on his lower sleeve fired and knocked the man off his feet with a ball in his stomach kneel pick up one of the doublebarreled mantons cock aim and fire the right barrel down went a hatless soldier who had turned to run into the woods on the far side of the road and lewrie took him just below his knapsack scream of a horse as it toppled over the officer with his sword halfdrawn twisting in agony from bullet wounds as it fell on him pinning him beneath its kicking thrashing weight left barrel and a frenchman trying to load his musket howled in instant pain and terror as lewries ball shredded his lower throat less than five seconds of the initial volley a few followup shots from lewries devereuxs and midshipman lockes pistols and it was over in an eyeblink there were four or five french soldiers still on their feet haring back down the road to la palmyre or all the way to royan were they terrified enough their heavy knapsacks stripped off for more speed and their muskets thrown away the rest of the french unitperhaps as many as twenty menlay where they had fallen only a few of them able to writhe as the pain of their wounds forced them to stir one knelt on splayed knees puking blood another tried to crawl away leaving a gory stream in his wake the officer was screaming as loud as his horse and one of the marines went to him he took his time reloading then stuck the muzzle of his musket to the horses temple and fired again he took his time to bite cartridge pour powder in the pan the rest down the barrel spit the ball down draw the ramrod to tamp it down return the ramrod to its brass pipes then ease the firelock from halfcock to uncocked each motion as smart as parade drill then the marine muttered poor bastid performed right about and marched away from the dying officer it was lt devereux who approached him with pistol drawn and gently spoke to him in french before leaning down to give the unfortunate fellow the requested coup de grace lewrie strolled out into the road amazed and appalled but in secret glee that none of his own had even gotten a scratch mr locke staggered out to look down on one of the frenchmen who lay on his side but was struggling to roll over onto his back as dying men will do locke turned away and fell to his knees throwing up you well mister locke lewrie asked as he reloaded and reprimed his pistol brutish as it was both marines and sailors pawed over the dead and the dying for tobacco coins pipes or clasp knives breast plates and shakoes for souvenirs crowing with triumph my god sir locke stuttered its horrible its war mister locke lewrie grimly told him you think this is bad worse things happen at sea when ships come to pistolshot range and flail away at each other chearly now young sir the men are watchin youre blooded you marked your man and lived ttell of it here take his shako the rest of the midshipmen in the cockpitll be green with envy and after a rum or two you might feel like braggin of it aye aye sir locke said with a gulp and a final retching noise as he got to shaky feet but he accepted the shako and even found the courage to pick up an infantry hanger as well quite useful in close combat a hanger mister locke lewrie told him as they began to stroll away from their massacre i prefer its shorter length stoutness of blade and the slight curve whichll let you get in a slash or drawin stroke when a smallswordll be hung up and all you have is the point twork with lighter than our brute cutlasses too youll find quicker in the hand and in riposte i i wondered why you wore one sir but could not dare to enquire midshipman locke said trying to play up game in his captains esteem he went back to strip the baldric and scabbard from the nearest dead frenchman for later why the devild i do this lewrie asked himself as they tramped back to the spring loosehipped and cocksure even loaded down with a pile of booty and french weapons he had had no motive for ambushing those pitifully unprepared french soldiers beyond the fact that they were there his people were there and the opportunity had presented itself what tmake of it then he mused as they followed the creek to the beach and what ii the french make of it have i ruined any chance ttake those forts because of it will they reenforce now we gave em my fleabite and where might they reenforce might the french think that it had been captain charltons work forcing them to send more troops to la tremblade marennes the lie doleron for it had been in his watching squadrons bailiwick after all well close to it anyway quibble quibble quibble he scoffed was there a sizable garrison at royan already and that unit had been a part of it the french might despatch companysized road patrols to the cote sauvage peninsula find the newly felled trees the signs of a british presence round the spring and to counter any new landings might even shift some light guns a flying battery to lay an ambush of their own which would weaken the infantry force that could defend the fort at st georges de didonne might it spur the french to rush the completion of the battery on pointe de grave that would mean more barges loaded with stone or timbers coming to le verdon sur mer vulnerable barges open to a nighttime cuttingout expedition by bartoe shalcross and umphries what would that do though lewrie wondered as they reached the beach and the waiting boats result in a whole regiment sent into the area from st fort sur gironde downriver from saintes or up from bordeaux too ave a bit o fun capm sor his coxn liam desmond asked as he brought the jolly boat to ground its bows on the beach sure an we heard th shootin furfy here sor was all outta sorts ya went an danced wi th frogs an left us aboard niver as any fun does furfy willy toffett teased tousling furfys hair well make it up to him desmond soon lewrie promised as he swung a leg over the gunnl the last water butt aboard aye sor it is bung up an bilge free desmond chuckled then lets be off lewrie ordered mister locke sir the midshipman replied from the launch alongside everyone present and accounted for sir lewrie asked aye sir locke firmly replied beaming with pleasure as the sailors who had been denied a scrap oohed and ahhed and made much of his prize shako and hanger i called my muster list and all of the hands answered sir and not a scratch on any of our people sir very good mister locke lewrie said in exuberant praise as much for lockes quick recovery as for his attention to duty well make a scrapper of you yet and half a clerk might not be able tuse that place twater anymore lewrie had to imagine as he discharged his pistols overside once back aboard hms savage pity bout that he thought for his one taste from the creek and spring had been marvellously fresh and pure use it or not ill send one of the brigsloops one of the cutters cruisin close ashore and maybe draw french troops there away from royan let em hope to hurt us back yet as he returned to his cabins for a welldeserved glass of something wet there was a thought that troubled him he had queried only two men about a good place to wood and water one was papin and the other was brasseur perhaps kenyon hogue or one of the cutters captains had asked the same but he could not quite silence the nagging qualm that one of those two frenchmen had mentioned it to the military commanders charged with the defence of the gironde mouth why else would french soldiers he taking the coast road not one of the more direct routes one of those two had set him up now which one of them could he trust chapter twentyseven aye ive known of that spring since erato took station here commander james kenyon said with a frown as he and lewrie dined aboard kenyons brigsloop cruising slowly about five miles off the cote sauvage kenyon paused over his plate with knife and fork poised midway twixt mouth and meat the captain of a departing ship related its existence to me in his parting briefing did you ever avail yourself of it lewrie asked i always judged that too risky sir kenyon replied showing lewrie that enigmatic i know how to do this better than you smile a mile inland of the beach within a mile of the coast road and deep in rather thick woods or so i was told sir when the stores ships and water hoys arrive from neutral lisbon or from england we humbler ships of the inshore squadron usually are summoned seaward for replenishment he said with a dismissive shrug top up your wine sir at lewries nod an extremely handsome chiselfeatured steward of about eighteen or so too frail to lewries lights for pulleyhauley or sailtending aloftalmost a beautiful young blond fellowpoured lewries glass of chateau margaux full again as lewrie took an appreciative sip he let his eyes dart about kenyons greatcabins not so great really aboard a flusheddeck brigsloop that small compared to his and in keeping with stoic royal navy suspicion of too much idle luxury which translated to distrust of any comforts kenyons quarters were spartan in the extreme dove grey paint over shiplap panelling with dove grey canvas and deal partitions as plain as an artists unused frames with nary a stab at attempting to make them look like false moulding or plaster walls below the panelling the inner faces of the hull scantling and timbers were the usual bloodred there was a scuffed old blackandwhite chequerboard canvas nailed to the deck but no colourful figured carpets in sight the table at which they sat the chairs the winecabinet and desk in the miniscule daycabin looked as dull and utilitarian as the chartspace cabinets second or thirdhand castoffs of a poor chandlers stocks or built from scrap lumber some bosun hadnt missed the glasses from which they sipped though were good quality and spotless the dinnerware rather elegant meissen china from hamburg the flatware a particularly showy and heavy sterling silver not cheap pewter or iron and even the tablecloth was as white as newfallen snow with not a single faint smut from previous spills and washings like erato herself lewrie thought either grand or shabby lewrie could not fault the care lavished upon the brigsloop as he came aboard the manropes were goldennew manila served elaborately with turks head knots the battens freshpainted and sanded for a firm foothold the decks were nigh as white as the tablecloth every gun was newblacked and everything involved in sailtending or gunnery was in applepie order paint kenyon did not seem to care though and the crew either beggars in rags or fresh as sunday divisions and that seemed to depend on how young and fetching the sailors were they had mustered to doff hats and welcome lewrie aboard but it had been a sullen endeavour dutiful but lacklustre well i ain t a famous actress nor a nelson but still he had thought at the moment and with so many smugglers eager to sell and the prices so low on their goods the dinner was excellent a french onion soup loaded with fresh cheese and shredded bread bits deboned chicken breasts in wine and cream sauce a fresh pickedthatday salad to clear the palate followed by boiled unshelled shrimp with horseradish sauce then medallions of veal with haricot beans upon which they fed that moment lewrie was sure that a pear or apple confection would follow that and another exquisite choice of wine kenyon did not dine spartan im troubled by the presence of french soldiers when i landed for wood and water lewrie said after a bite or two more of the veal to be expected though sir kenyon said back the presence of a british frigate so close ashore simply must have drawn their attention i dont think so lewrie countered oh it could have been a company sent out tshake off the barracks dust and sloth i do allow but it happened just days after i enquired of our smugglers or our informants of a place to water jules papin that rogue kenyon scoffed cynically amused or jean brasseur know of him sir lewrie asked we might have come across him and his boat a time or two sir kenyon hesitantly supplied rubbing his chin as he tried to remember i suspect one of those two passed word to the french army so they could lay an ambush commander lewrie told him setting aside his knife and fork for a while too few men to spare doubts that his information was true for whatever reason something put a halfcompany of infantry on the coast road and i could not have alerted them to my intentions for i closed the coast from the north so no one watchin for us on the south shore would have seen our approach like i was from captain charltons flotilla come tpoach on my area thank god our sentries along the coast road spotted em before they were up level with the spring and we could lay our ambush well short of where they might have been put on the qui vive by their officer try to recall what impression this jean brasseur made on you sir lewrie pressed or whether you think papin is the culprit well i still think it mere coincidence sir but kenyon said wiping his mouth with his napkin and taking another deep drink from his glass brasseur hmm brasseur oh fellow who claimedhis family was once english thats the one lewrie answered as kenyon summoned his cabin steward for another refill of wine kenyon this day had a close shave had taken pains with his appearance but could not hide his thirst for very long making lewrie wonder how long the meal and their conversation would continue before he went facedown in the apple pie didnt really make much of an impression on me at all sir kenyon said after smacking his lips just another hulking ignorant frog fisherman all brawn and beef to the heel didnt ask dye find him fetchin lewrie thought but kept his face neutral gloomy sort sort of hangdog kenyon went on waving his glass about slowly eager enough when it came to selling us something but he made no impression sorry didnt offer you any information then lewrie enquired cant recall sir but then i dont remember asking for any no sad tale about suffrin under the terror no fears expressed bout his sons conscripted into their army lewrie prodded dont think he did no kenyon said sir he added well for a thinly populated piece of coast i dont think it coincidental that troops were there the very day that we were sir lewrie objected and to smoak them out heres what i wish you to do tomorrow or weather allowing commander kenyon lewrie told him mr winwood his evercautious sailing master had expressed doubts of how closely they could lurk off a lee shore now that the seasons were changing and a more boisterous autumn was advancing the next clear and calmish day i wish erato to close the coast bout four miles to the south of the maumusson channel twixt the savage coast and the lie doleronbout where we anchored and pretend to go ashore for a few kegs of water and a cord or two of firewood pretend kenyon said blankly goggling at him lewrie went back to his veal and beans for a bite or two then a sip of wine if the french now guard the spring and that stretch of beach and forest i wish to know it he told kenyon so far i dont know the strength of the local garrisons but i do desire to discover whether the local commanders have posted troops and guns there to prevent future landings and a rough idea of in what strength dye see uh aye sir kenyon replied close the coast lewrie instructed savage and i will stand off a mile or so further out come to anchor or fetchto whichever you deem the weather will admit of put down all your boats and act as if youre sending an armed party ashore for wood and water this side of the estuary is yours and eratos movements are by now mostly taken for granted by the frogs do you make your approach from the north as i did and there is no response then i may assume there arent any arguseyed watchers lurkin in the woods clingin ttree tops like red indians he japed after another sip of wine do you provoke a response though then well know for certain that the french now have a guard over the creek and the spring and that that halfcompany was sent out there apurpose after one of em or both papin or brasseur played us false but lew but sir after you massacred those soldiers tother day of course theyd be guarding the springs kenyon pointed out much like a tutor exasperated with a particularly dull student revenge once bitten twice shy call it what you will they see an opportunity to get their own back assuming were silly enough to try it on again well i dont think their presence now will be enough to prove your assumption of betrayal humour me commander kenyon lewrie told him with a wink and a nod do they shift troops and guns there thats a few less round royan the saint georges fort and pointe de grave fifteen miles of hard quick march from where they skouldbe when the time comes hmm i should see whether the french are there and what their strength is kenyon grumbled not quite finished chewing on a clump of fresh buttered shore bread because you envision an assault upon the forts eventually he looked slightly aghast exactly so sir lewrie gladly told him if the frogs dont shift troops id be very much surprised but we must know and i still hold that they had no business being there in the first place unless i was directed to the spring on purpose and set up for killing uhm how much of a charade must i play then sir kenyon asked sounding loath to even go through the motions and looking sick should i actually land on the beach march inland a ways sir and how far all the way to the spring how close to shore do you wish theres enough depth for a brigsloop to cometo within a halfmile offshore savage fetchedto that close certainly a short row for your boat crews and an even quicker return aboard should the frogs be tempted to fire upon you if theyre there of course lay on yer oars within musketshot of the beach if you wish as if you were wary and lookin the place over rightsharp before committing i surely do not wish you to really land unless in your considered opinion at the moment the french aren t there your judgement completely sir trail my skirts serve as bait kenyon gravelled sourly and all but spat bait like a piece of gristle he shot lewrie a dubious and bleak look for an unguarded second before passing a hand over his face which had broken out in a sickly sweat ill have savage within a halfmile of you and will swoop down to cover your withdrawal lewrie assured him your own sixpounders can engage shootin over the heads of your landingparty as they row out who knows with any luck at all our guns will slaughter a few more o the bastards our seeming attempt and its repulse may lead the french to reenforce their success luring even more troops away from the narrows or result in them sending a brigade up from bordeaux to garrison every point sir kenyon gloomily supposed aloud then we tried at the least lewrie told him and will have to content ourselves in cruising off this miserable place til the next epiphany at least the victuals and winesll be tasty the next calm day then sir kenyon resignedly said the next calm day aye suitable conditions did not come though until nearly a week later for with the arrival of autumn came more boisterous seas with gusting winds now and again roundtheclock showers and tall curlers breaking on the beaches of souwest france so hard the sands thudded savage perforce had to stand further out from the coast and tack sentrygo north and south under reduced sail with the shore lost in the mists and swirling rain the brigsloops and cutters attempted to maintain their vigils on the gironde but the weather now and again drove them out beyond the invisible line twixt pointe de la coubre and pointe de grave and even several more miles to seaward to avoid the risks of grounding on a lee and hostile shore should a real storm howl in from the open atlantic finally the skies cleared the violence of the windwhipped sea subsided and the tiny squadron could stand in to take up their guard positions once more erato signals affirmative sir midshipman grisdale eagerly reported very well mister grisdale lower the hoist lewrie ordered a point more to loord mister urquhart follow erato shoreward aye sir the first officer glumly replied then relayed that to the quartermasters on the helm is he still sulkin lewrie thought part amused part put out lt urquharts nose was out of joint over missing the opportunity for notice and glory by participating in the ambush the sight of souvenir shakoes hangers and such nighmade him growl and grind his teeth he was even pettish over lt gambles small part in the action even if all that worthy had done was trundle water kegs back from the woods to the beach without losing a single sailor to sprained fingers loading the boats and merely standing by mostlike anxiously and enviously himself wasn t my fault i wanted t walk on solid ground lewrie thought with a weary groan wasnt like knew the frogs d turn up just then and i gave him credit in my report to ayscough for restowinso damnquick told him so damn my eyesbut no hespeeved as a drunk bear a fine morning for it eh mister urquhart lewrie assayed spose so sir aye urquhart dutifully replied winds light enough to fetchto thout any risk of drifting on the beach lewrie commented once more hoping for a better response a mile off and north of erato so our guns arent masked by her and ready to get back under way quick as a wink think the french really have set themselves up yonder sir a fine morning for killing have they done so aye sir a fine morning for that urquhart answered sounding a tad perkier our larboard batterys ready for it sir im babblinlike a ninny lewrie chid himself and who the hell cares how he feels only one set o feelin s aboard this barge mine lewrie put those niggling petty details away and lifted a telescope to his right eye as erato began to round up into the wind hands aloft to reduce sail even further all her rowing boats already off the crossdeck boattier beams and towed astern were being hauled up close astern to be led round to the entryport kenyon would not let go anchors but fetchto eratos stern angled towards the beach one great spin of her helm and she could fall off her precarious balancing act and bare her own larboard pounder cannon to the foe assuming the french were there he pulled out his pocketwatch opened the cover with his thumb and took a look at the time ten minutes and the boats were yet to be loaded and sent off takin his own sweet time aint he lewrie muttered under his breath come on damn yer eyes get a move on off point coober sir the good weathers brought out some of the local fishermen lt urquhart pointed out from the starboard side of the quarterdeck about six miles off just outside the hook he said using the colloquial slang pronunciation the squadron had adopted thankee mister urquhart lewrie replied time i think to round up and take in sail though spanish reef courses and topsls let fly jibs and spanker as we planned aye aye sir finally all three of eratos boats were loaded with oarsmen and other hands armed to protect them a few middling kegs were visible amidships all three not the great butts usually stored on lower tiers but the sort spotted on the weather deck and mess deck for the crew to dip into to slake their thirst lovely day really lt adair could be heard to comment to one of the midshipmen and it was lewrie thought the sea was mostly calm rippling with a myriad of wavelets of silvery blue most artfully so more like a lake stroked by gentle winds than a salt sea the beaches were broad and inviting with waves raling in and out almost sleepily with light froth where they broke a myriad of sea birds were awing too and flocks of gulls wheeled and gyred round the fetchedto ships it was only the forests behind the beach beyond the overwash dunes or scraggly salt grasses that looked deep dark and foreboding coming so is christmas lewrie griped as eratos boats now within musketshot of the beach rocked and heaved slightly on the incoming waves the sailors resting on their oars and coxswains and the midshipmen commanding each boat peering intently through their telescopes at the woods lewrie raised his own glass to peer at them then swivelled about to look at eratos quarterdeck even at half a miles separation he could espy commander kenyon pacing the lee side of his ship his own telescope to his eye and now and then slamming a fist on the caprails of the bulwarks in frustration and fret a hoist from erato sir midshipman grisdale piped up breaking the hushed anxious silence its not for us sir its he fumbled with his code book for it was one rarely used and unfamiliar to him to his boats it would appear sir proceed the lead boat eratos cutter began to stroke shoreward slow to be sure with the brigsloops first officer standing in the stern a moment later and the other two the gig and launch started to follow didnt order him tdo that lewrie all but yelped in worry what the devils he playin at be ready to get a way on sir he called over his shoulder to lt urquhart the cutter was almost up to the gentle surf line a musketshot from the edge of the dense forest a pistolshot from the dunes with the two other boats still following on either quarter of the leaders boat in a deep v frogs came a howl from the mainmast tops damn my eyes lt urquhart cried one hand leaping to seize the hilt of his smallsword no matter how useless the gesture was get under way sir this instant lewrie barked open ports and run out the larboard battery mister adair to your stations for action gentlemen a twodeep line of french soldiers sprang from the earth just back of the overwash dunes where they had hidden themselves from view in the shallow natural ditches eratos cutter was frantically backing starboard oars thrashing ahead with larboard oars to try to turn her in her own length the boats coxn throwing his whole body on the tiller the rest of the boats were wheeling about too but a massed volley of musketry spurted from the muzzles of at least three companies of infantrymens musket barrels and the shallows about each boat got churned by a torrent of lead ball three bloody companies dye make it mister devereux lewrie asked of his marine officer more experienced with such matters aye sir but note their spacing devereux urgently said there must be fifty or sixty yards tween each company id suspect an artillery piece in each gap so they may fire upon erato without risking their own men two gaps say another pair on the ends of the line lewrie quickly surmised stunned by the suddenness of the french ambush four guns together mister adair solid shot and grape and order guncaptains and quartergunners to concentrate on the gaps between their troops and on the woods at either end as well might be guns there were guns great gouts of yellowgrey gunpowder smoke belched from the gaps from the flanks a second or two later there came the sounds of the explosions terrierbarksharp and tinny with distance sixpounders perhaps lt devereux spat perhaps as light as old regimental fourpounders captain four pieces would be right and fit what little we know of current french army practice savage was moving again falling off alee parallel to the seashore her clumsylooking clewedup sails billowing and starting to fill with wind her foreandaft staysls jibs and spanker filling with rustles and cracks a touch more to larboard mister urquhart lewrie demanded let her fall off to about a halfmile offshore before coming back to abeam the wind christ what a potmess lewrie groaned to himself peering at eratos boats they were now come about and were being rowed madly out to sea the gig and launch weaving from one beam to the other to make themselves unpredictable targets but still followed by a veritable hailstorm of bullet splashes and the occasional cannon shot the cutter though shed taken the full brunt of that first mass volley and while her oarsmen were bending their ash oars going almost fiat on their backs and panting like dogs at each stroke there were casualties among them in the ocular of his telescope he could see panicky sailors stumbling over each other to haul wounded men into the soles of the boat a dead man or two being heaved overside to make room for the living to replace them in the sternsheets the officer and a pair of tars were firing back the coxn bent low over the tiller almost hidden under the gunnls lewries view was blotted out by a white sheet of water as one of the cleverly hidden artillery pieces pounded a roundshot near the boat thankfully an over twixt the cutter and savage which raised a tall feather of spray that slowly collapsed upon itself the second cannon ball was much nearer a halfminute after the first and suddenly the gig on the lefthand side of the reversed v took a ball so close that half of the oars on its starboard side were shattered and it slewed about as if hulled heeling over so far for a moment that it surely must capsize closer to eratos pounders were barking at last their roundshot and grape clusters bowling through the centre company of french infantry scattering them like a cats paws would a boys toy soldiers forcing the survivors to stumble back into the woods for cover leaving their dead and wounded where they fell and seeing the appalling ease with which their fellow soldiers had been butchered the officers of the two wing companies ordered their own men to retire into shelter among the forest too their smoothbore muskets were almost out of practical range beyond seventy or so yards anyway and they had drawn their enemys blood a few stalwarts did continue to shoot fingerscrossedhopeful but there were no more massed volleys of an hundred or so muskets going off at once they left the rest of the fight to their artillery which was still banging away rapidly pardon captain lewrie but were i in their shoes id not count on the woods for shelter lt devereux said his face looking feral and eager better theyd return to the depressions behind the dunes which would just soak up both roundshot and grape what our eighteenpounders can do to them theyll discover to their sorrow lewrie completed for him mister winwood the last time we were here can you asssure me of the depth do we stand in a little closer than half a mile uhm ah the sailing master flummoxed looking stunned by the suggestion tis a making tide sir and there should he thirty feet or better perhaps but ah i can offer no assurances captain half a mile it is then lewrie growled in frustration pray place leadsman in the forechains mister urquhart directly aye aye sir you mark those guns mister adair lewrie called down to the waist very good do you direct at least two guns on each of em and scour the woods with the rest oh dear lord mr winwood moaned drawing his attention back shoreward the cutter slowest and most crippled of the three boats had been bracketed by two roundshot rocking her onto her beam ends to larboard then to starboard the feathers of spray so close that their collapse came down in a deluge that nearly swamped the boat erato was still firing quick as individual guns could be served kenyon no longer waiting for controlled broadsides sixpounder shot and grape lashed the trees and raised clouds of dirt and sand from the overwash dunes commander kenyon had reduced sail almost to nothing hed not sail away and abandon his sailors the french response when it came was to lift their aim from the rowing boats to erato herself and shot splashes began to blossom round her now stout fellow mr winwood congratulated if ye only knew lewrie sarcastically told himself eratos gig and launch had finally reached her sides though it was no longer a place of safety with the french artillery banging away at her after a close shot splash the boats hastily ducked round her bow and stern to the unengaged side so they could get back aboard at the starboard entryports the cutter still struggled crawling snailslow even though she was no longer a target still a heartbreaking two hundred yards short of salvation with the remaining armed men lending their strength upon the oars to spell those who were utterly exhausted their bodies mostlike shaking palsied with panic and weakness about another quartermile before we may open upon the leftmost artillery captain lt urquhart adjudged i make the beach to be about half a mile off should we come up to the wind sir aye make it so mister urquhart course due south and wait for it lewrie agreed mister grisdale signal to erato for her to make sail then windward else well either run right up her arse or shell lay there blockin our guns oh dear lord mr winwood commented again sounding like some badly milked cow it would appear the french have found the range to her sir sure enough eratos slack sails twitched to roundshot passing low over her decks and she shivered to a hit on her larboard side that raised a sudden cloud of engrained dirt peeling paint flakes and the usual small eruption of splinters still her hoist in reply was unable cock your locks lt adair instructed his guncaptains wait for it wait for it ready at your orders sir byyourbest judgement mister adair lewrie called back very well sir on the uproll firel smashing lungflattening heartskipping thundercracks huge gouts of powder smoke jets of flame and firefly swarms of hot embers shot from the muzzles of the greatguns hms savage stuttered in her statelyslow progress hull groaning and reverberating to the slamming of the explosions shuddering again as the brutally heavy pounders surged back from the portsills to be checked by breeching ropes bound round the guns cascabels through the bulwarks ring bolts thats the way you savages lewrie yelled the battlefever come over him at the first whiff of gunsmoke and the first crashing roars thats the way my bully lads thirteen of her pounders on the larboard beam four of her quarterdeck pounders hurled a blizzard of iron into the dark woods and even stout old trees swayed and thrashed like saplings assailed by the gusts of a west indies hurricane shattered limbs came whirling down pines with trunks as thick as a young womans waist burst twelve or fifteen feet from the ground and came lancing down among a cloud of splinters that first crushing broadside bracketed the leftflank gun position and the place where the lefthand company of infantry had gone to ground swab out up powder boys lt adair chanted pacing behind the recoiled guns now and then cautioning crewmen to overhaul the runout and recoil tackles and watch where they placed their feet else a man could be crippled for life in a twinkling shot your guns bloody grand mister adair lewrie shouted down making their young scot beam with pleasure serve the snaileatin shits again spikes and crowlevers came out so the men could shift aim for the centre positions wood quoins beneath the gun breeches were carefully adjusted for elevation adair looked up and down the deck and found every gun reloaded run out your guns clear away the tackle prime four fathom four fathom tthis line the larboard leadsman shouted from the forechains half point twindward mister urquhart lewrie cautioned take careful aim lets not waste em lt adair was yelling the finer your eye the more frogs we get to kill jus like ol mister catterall e is a quartergunner cried with a laugh referring to their former second officer who had died the year before in the south atlantic orrid mad for fried frogs waste your fire pulteney and ill curse like catterall too lt adair promised japing back guncaptains arms rose into the air to signal readiness cock your locks the final step done the arms went back up the guncaptains other hands drawing the lock cords taut as bowstrings on the uproll fire titanic roars more heavy shudders great clouds of powder smoke blotting out everything to leeward and only slowly drifting away and thinning but lewrie now perched atop the larboard bulwarks with a hand to shield his eyes could relish the avalanche of grape and roundshot that harvested trees like a farmers scythe for a joyous second before the smoke cloud took his view away uhm should he be doing that mister winwood sir midshipman grisdale timidly asked the sailing master oh this is nothing mister grisdale winwood replied in his usual phlegmatic way you should see the way he acts in a real scrap our captain is a man lorn to combat hms savage served the french positions yet another heavy broadside as she slowly cruised down the coast passing in front o erato which kenyon had at last gotten under her own slow way going up to windward just far enough for savage to shave by down her larboard side and with the guns levered round til the muzzles hot enough to scorch wood by then pointed as far aft as they could bear for yet another a parting broadside and there was not a single shot fired in reply by the french their light artillery might not have been smashed crews who served them might not have been slaughtered to a man but they had all been buried under enough fallen trees and scrap lumber to make a good start at building a small sixth rate secure the guns mister adair lewrie finally ordered as he hopped down from his perch atop the bulwarks damned fine work men damned fine shooting by every manjack when the bosun pipes clear decks and up spirits we shall splice the mainbrace stand out to sea sir lt urquhart enquired looking a lot perkier than he had an hour before action agreed with him it seemed if yed be so kind mister urquhart lewrie told him smiling back sorry we could gather no souvenirs this time well a bucket of whats left yonder sir is hardly what one might take home to boast of urquhart rejoined with a chortle lewrie gave him another grin and a reassuring nod then went aft down the larboard side past the quarterdeck pounders and the gun crews who were now sponging out to the taffrails and larboard lanthorn at the stern to survey the beach with telescope extended to its uttermost he could discern movement ashore a few french soldiers in white trousers and blue coats staggering about amid the manhigh reef of tree limbs digging for their comrades and dragging free the stunned living and the wounded astern erato had fetchedto once more as her cutter limped alongside at last men swarmed over her larboard side to the boat to help their wounded aboard and rope slings and a quickly rigged bosuns chair were going over the side as well the lieutenant in the cutters sternsheets seemed to have survived his ordeal which was a glad sight to lewrie had the man been killed or wounded and were lewrie to do the charitable thing he might have had to give up one of his commission officers into her charity lewrie queasily thought or guilt for it had been by his orders that erato and her crew had been placed in jeopardy and hed made an error didn t expect that sized french presence he gloomed infantry yes maybe one gun or two but i told kenyon tpretend tland not go all the way his cutters bow was almost tdry sand well close enough ashore that the sailors couldve stepped out and not gotten wet above their knees drab as kenyons careers been so far perhaps he needed t exceed his orders and get a line or two in the newspapers and lewrie could savour one good that had come from the action the french had reacted to his recent ambush and the slaughter of their soldiers overreacted really and had committed about a half of a regiment and what lt deveroux told him was the entire artillery complement of that regiment what little joy the french might have taken from their clever ambuscade he had dashed by decimating the soldiers and artillery pieces assigned to it so whatll they do next lewrie asked himself his lips curling up in a secret smile after they re done with cursin andpulhn their hair out call for more troops aye but where ii they put em i wonder lewrie could fantasise a host of barges coming downriver from bordeaux the frogs in a fury to complete the pointe de grave battery and transport another company of troops to guard it faster than they could march another company to the st georges fort perhaps with another taut grin he could imagine a whole string of hidden batteries down the cote sauvage by the tip of the maumusson channel the one by the creek and spring reestablished this time with even more troops and guns guns heavy enough to deal with a frigate and might they also try to defend every point st palais sur mer soulac royan and the hook of pointe de la coubre might they also fear that a british expedition might sneak past the guns of st georges and go for meschers sur gironde or even talmont where the blockade runners supposedly put in in hopes of a dark moonless night god amighty lewrie suddenly thought papin told me the fort by saint georges has and pounders nothing heavier so right now they cant span the river narrows not til the battery at pointe de graves finished oh scurry scurry scurry froggieand who tries tdefendevrything ends defendinnothing why a few more of those fleabites of his and they might end up transferring an entire brigade to the mouth of the gironde robbing peter to pay paul lewrie turned to pace back to the forrud end of the quarterdeck hands behind his back yet with a spring to his step he knew he had two things to do immediately one would be to speak to kenyon and ask of his losses try to atone for them without admitting that hed been wrong the second would be to run down papin and brasseur some other fishermen and get a sense of what the local reaction was and shell out a guinea or two for what information those two had gathered no a third thing to do compare what papin said to brasseurs version and determine which of the bastards was telling the truth chapter twentyeight welcome aboard captain lewrie hms chesterfields first lieutenant bade him with a smile as lewrie doffed his cocked hat commodore ayscough awaits you thankee sir whos the new arrival lewrie asked pointing with his chin towards the strange new gunner that cruised astern of the flagship oh thats he jersey sir the first officer confided as he walked lewrie aft towardsthe poop himself captain edward cheatham she joined us only three days ago and most welcome im bound lewrie said after the commodore has requested begged and god knows what else to get her she brought mail sir chesterfields first officer said with glee first weve received the last two months commodore ayscoughs clerk is holding yours and your other vessels id admire did you sack it all up and hand it to my coxn for delivery aboard savage if yed be so kind sir lewrie asked partly delighted and partly fearful of what dire news from his barrister the mail might contain i shall see to it directly captain lewrie a marine in full kit guarding ayscoughs greatcabins under the poop deck raised his musket in salute then returned it to his side to slam the butt on the oak deck with a loud cry of capm lewrie sah enter but hed best have a sheep with him came a muffled shout from within a prime sheep aye sir lewrie called back before he entered bleatin on the starboard gangway commodore ayscough being a scot was hellishfond of roast mutton or lamb and obtaining one from french smugglers was a standing request of any warship coming off the blockade captain lewrie give ye joy sir ayscough beamed as he rose from one of his collapsible leathercovered chairs in his daycabin yell stay aboard to dine upon it with us i vow his hand was out and a glad smile was on his face i swear youre a terror lewrie went at em like a ramcat hey take a pew sir and accept a glass of this lovely claret captain cheatham may i name to you one of my most energetic officers captain alan lewrie of the savage frigate leads our close watch of the gironde mouth lewrie this is captain edward cheatham of the jersey sixtyfour recently come to join your servant sir lewrie said with a bow of his head delighted to make your acquaintance captain lewrie cheatham replied he was an older fellow approaching fifty greyhaired and one who still wore his hair in a midshoulder long queue rather than the neat wee sprig just barely atop the uniform coat collar that most officers now sported or the younger ones who eschewed the queue altogether cheatham was lean leatherfaced and tanned the colour of golden walnut the commodore has imparted to me the inner squadrons most recent exploits for which i offer my congratulations lewrie thankee kindly sir lewrie replied feeling the need to go modest and selfdeprecating just keepin monsoor frog on the hop one does wish to be a frigate man again cheatham wistfully said they seem to have all the fun perhaps we may yet have some fun of our own ayscough grinned as he summoned a cabin servant so lewrie could get a glass and the others could get a topup depending on what lewrie here has gleaned from his sources mongst the french fishermen that is ayscough tapped the side of his nose as if to preface great revelations looking at lewrie like a tutor at his best scholar about to do his latin recitations before the rest of the faculty well sir what ive been told since our raid is contradictory lewrie had to admit after a sip of wine wondering if it was a lafite or bravemouton his time off the gironde had done wonders for his palate and thank god for clever smugglers what weve seen sirs is quite another matter after our second raid upon the savage coast cote sauvage rather the french have begun some new emplacements along it theres one at the base of point coober pardons again sirs the lesser ships have simplified local place names for their ease of understanding as i said at the base of the hook chart ayscough impatiently ordered and they ended leaning in over a chart laid atop the table twixt the chairs and the settee one here to close the maumusson channel to rochefort marennes and la tremblade lewrie pointed out one by the creek and the spring where we watered and one here where the pointe de la coubre peninsula begins right where the coast road curves soueast to royan sirs captain charlton told me of thisun ayscough said of the one furthest north pity he cant get to grips with it as you did lewrie the fort cross the channel on ile doleron prevents him else hed give it a daily bombardment as i expect you treat these others i dont sir lewrie confessed i want the french shiftin men and artillery to the savage coast its sixteen miles o march from there to royan and fort saint georges de didonne so should the french think were planning a large assault here he said with a stab at the lonely almost uninhabited forest with its road that led to la tremblade and marennes threatening the naval base of rochefort then thats fewer guns and soldiers to defend the completed fort here and the one theyre buildin here he said shifting his finger to st georges then pointe de grave which guarded the gironde narrows ye dont wish a deflated commodore ayscough all but babbled the pointe de grave battery is still unfinished and of late weve seen fewer workers not more as id expect lewrie continued we cant see far up the gironde but what little weve been able to spy out reveals more barge traffick comin down from bordeaux were the french intent upon finishin the pointe de grave battery quicker itd make sense for them thug the south bank of the river and put in at le verdon sur mer here he said indicating the bay harbour and cove and some have sirs but the bulk of what weve seen with our own eyes is barges huggin the north bank runnin close ashore tween meschers sur gironde and saint georges frogbuilt roads he scoffed and the other two senior officers shrugged and rolled their eyes and it was a given that a brace a dozen sailing barges could carry more cargo than an hundred supply waggons even if they had to employ sweeps to make headway into the wind and tides at times and bear everything an army needed much faster than heavy guns and waggons could trundle along bad roads what weve been able to see of the french emplacements on the savage coast sirs what artillery theyre entrenchin seem heavier than the sixpounder regimental pieces we encountered its possible that the twelve and eighteenpounders meant for pointe de grave have been commandeered to prevent the feared landing on the savage coast lots of french warships incomplete at bordeaux he speculated lots of artillery sittin idle as well they will finish the pointe de grave battery eventually sirs but not any time too soon and lewrie tantalised with a sly brighteyed smile for the nonce fort saint georgess twelve and eighteenpounders cannot close the narrows they havent the range and theres a mile or better of deep navigable river on the south bank by pointe de grave and le verdon sur mer sirs thats where i really mean to strike oh he quibbled i have erato and argosy maintainin a presence off the savage coast sirs with my frigate further out to sea to provide support cruisin slow and as close ashore as they dare go taking soundings sirs as if preparing the ground for ships of the line and deeperdraught transports aha capt cheatham exclaimed twigging to his scheme i trust youve included us in this plan o yours lewrie the commodore demanded with a pout oh indeed sir lewrie told him savage and all the rest of the innermost blockaders land on pointe de grave to demolish the unfinished battery with as many marines and armed sailors available from the ships of the line it was my intention that you sir with chesterfield now with the welcome addition of jersey perhaps with captain chaxltons lyme to reenforce you sail in and engage the saint georges fort with additional reenforcements of more marines and armed sailors from the lineofbattle ships which i hope will make a grand diversion a demonstration on the new french batteries near the spring and the base of the hook of point coubre so the french will be distracted long enough for us to destroy both emplacements on the narrows sirs capt cheatham was all ears to hear the nature of the various fortifications nodding eagerly as an old cavalry mount might when the bugle notes of form ranks by squadrons sounded just as well lord boxhams seventyfour gunners will only make a noisy demonstration captain lewrie cheatham finally said sand earth and log ramparts built low with gun embrasures protected with gabions til ready to be run out are almost impossible to defeat as the palmetto log and sand fortification at charleston south carolina defeated us fort moultrie aye when i was a lad a lowly lieutenant board a third rate in the first year of the american revolution we sailed in expecting to sweep all aside and take the city one of the richest ports in america but fort moultrie constructed as it was simply swallowed everything we fired at it for most of a day and was mostly undamaged when wed run out of shot and powder and had to sail away with our tails tween our legs when may we begin sir well lewrie hedged thatd be up to rearadmiral lord boxham sir for hes not seen a bit of this yet captain cheatham ill see to that no fear ayscough assured them eager for a chance to do something other than cruise and plod hell surely ask what gems of intelligence lead me to assume itll work commodore ayscough lewrie had to impart and i still dont possess solid information as i said in the beginning of our meeting what ive been told is contradictory sir ahem ayscough soured indeed he added frowning giving lewrie the sort of look a drunken blankminded student whod flubbed his walkingout recitations might get from the aforesaid hopeful tutor im told encouraging things by one of my principal informants sir bleaker tidings by the other and frankly im not sure which of em to believe lewrie had to admit after the wooding watering and massacre most of the fishermen have turned surly on us after the second incident surly turned to hatred and even our ships longest onstation commanders kenyon and hogue and our lieutenants commands cant get a kind word from the frogs who seemed the friendliest and most informative theyve become uncooperative even when it comes to selling us victuals and wines sirs lewrie bemoaned nothing is available of a sudden or if it is the price has climbed higher than that fellows montgolfiers hotair balloon best make the best of your sheep sir for i fear well not see its like anytime soon and til you discover which of them is truthful your planned operation cannot be advanced captain lewrie capt cheatham asked no sir it cant lewrie confessed going even further he also said now were one of our foreign office agents here one experienced at sifting truth from fiction and able to see through the duplicity of the french well frankly i feel a tad out of my depth captain cheatham well damme ayscough gravelled slumping in his chair and profoundly disappointed by the situation looking askance at his star pupil too as if profoundly let down by him as well chapter twentynine mine arse on a bandbox lewrie grimly thought all but wringing his hands in frustration who d trust me t scheme this out after dining aboard hms chesterfield commodore ayscough said in parting that he should go ahead and sketch out his plans for presentation to rearadmiral lord boxham on the off chance that he could find a way to discern which of the fishermen was telling the truth which to trust for the moment though he didnt even know where to begin lewrie sat at his desk in his daycabin as hms savage groaned creaked and gently shuffled along under reduced sail for the night before him on his desk lay tide tables ephemeris and personal charts now much doodledupon which agreed with the sailing masters a pair of metal lanthorns hung from an overhead deck beam slowly swept back and forth as regular as metronomes throwing meagre pools of light on the problem before him predawn was always the preferred choice for attacks that or the wee hours of the night was there enough of a moon to prevent confusion and dread among ones own forces low tide for a firm beach on which to ground or high tide so the ships boats had a shorter row less time for the enemy to react and fetch the supporting warships guns into closer range which which which tides the stage of the moon time of sunrise nothing seemed to concur to guarantee success and damn kenyons blood lewrie found himself fuming which was a grand distraction from his contretemps almost a welcome one a last matter lewrie commodore ayscough had imparted after capt cheatham had departed for his own ship commander kenyon sent me report of your most recent action and i must tell you that he is wroth with you he does not quite accuse but i gather from his tone that he feels you forced him to trail his coat to draw fire from the french which resulted in the loss of three hands killed five men wounded and minor damage to his vessel i gathered he thought youd done it from spite to work off some longstanding grudge i told him he was bait sir lewrie had angrily countered i surely did was hogue and mischief the brig appointed to watch over the northern approaches to the gironde id have used him and his ship instead kenyons instructions were to demonstrate not make an actual landing sir his boats were all but in the surf before the foe opened upon us but was there some incident in your past with him lewrie he thought me dishonourable once lewrie had weaseled lured a frog privateer close aboard by pretending to strike then firing upon them and setting them on fire with fire arrows kenyon was down with the yellow jack as was half our crew and it was our only chance we rehoisted colours a second before we opened sir burned her to her waterline and saved our important passengers secret despatches and our lives i spose hes resented me since though ive quite put it out of my mind years ago ive also made post whilst kenyons still commanding below the rates so is there any spite involved sir i suggest it is he who holds the grudge plausible ayscough decided stroking his chin while they stood on the starboard gangway waiting for lewries boat to arrive i must confess ive had my doubts of the man ever since he arrived onstation lewrie drinks far too much slovenly in his personal habits uhm the one time i was aboard erato i was struck by the ah strange aura about her the mood of her crew and the lack of uniformity in how they were accoutred as if kenyon plays favourites well perhaps some of his killed or wounded were betterdressed sir lewrie suggested with a bland face his favourites good god youre not suggesting ayscough had blanched have no idea sir lewrie had told him hoping that ayscough might figure it out on his own without having to recount what he had witnessed all those years ago which would sound like spite there they had left it lewrie rolled his shoulders and leaned his head far back to ease the onset of a crick before forcing his attention back to the charts and tables dont have a bloody due he whispered theyll find me out at last oh that bloody lewrie what a fool he was theyll say ever since being all but pressed by his own father in hed had a mortal fear of making a monumental cockup sooner or later as if he had spent all his career not one of his choosing playing the role of a competent commission sea officer but was at base a mere dilettante a sham a cackhanded cunnythumbed fraud and now that he had the rank and seniority the responsibility he would be found out chalky the younger cat halfopened his eyes and raised up his head from a tailtucked pawtucked drowse on one corner of the desk and toulon sprawled cross his lap looked up hopefully giving lewrie a loving head swipe upon his waistcoat at least you two still respect me lewrie muttered to them as he gave each some stroking christ he leaned back in his chair again running both hands over his hair looking up at the slowly swaying lanthorns and the deck beams for inspiration shouldve stayed a lieutenant a midshipman or stayed ashore on halfpay and become a buttockbrokerin pimp after the revolution it was one thing for him to spin moonbeam fantasies of blood and mayhem over the winetable but quite another to set a plan on paper with a dozen copies saved for later revelation a plan that could get a lot of good men killed or wounded if it was a halfbaked shambles ending in an egregious failure the countrys the navys and capt alan lewries repute could go smash like humptydumpty and its author cashiered for henheaded incompetence think think ye bloody halfwit he chid himself what is it ye wish tdo more tthe point what dye wish the frogs tdo smash those forts on the narrows thats what but how i need a few olord boxhams liners marines and sailors hmmm he considered that like the sketchy plan hed formed a year or more ago to seize new orleans and louisiana from the spanish one now mostlike mouldering in an occasionally flooded basement at admiralty or horse guards this one might never be implemented thankee jesus lord boxham might look at this one and reject it out of hand but if he liked it and it turned out to be a farce the local tides he considered the deepdraught ships of the line had to get within practical gunrange close enough to the shore to frighten the french into thinking that a massive invasion force was going to be landed deepdraught ships would have to back up his own light ships in the gironde too close ashore he shifted tables books and such on the desk and his personal mail still bound in twine and unopened fell off the desk to hit the deck with a loud thud ow he yelped as chalky sprang off the desk as toulon abandoned his lap in a prodigious leap to larboard and his claws dug in deep into his thighs for a sure launch right through his breeches and damned close to his wedding tackle say somethin sir aspinall asked drawn from his pantry as he was getting ready to hang up his apron oh the wee poltroons got a scare on poor darlins ow lewrie sarcastically reiterated as he checked his thighs for blood the cats landed with legs widespread low to the deck with tails bottled up and whisking rapidly looking at each other as if to ask what the bloody hell was that before stalking on stiffened legs to sniff noses with each other then sniff each others arses was about tsay sir tis nigh on two bells aspinall reminded him will ya be needin anythin more this evnin sir two bells of the evening watch pm was the time for all lights below decks to be extinguished every lanthorn and every glim so no accidental fire could break out the worst danger for a wooden ship chockfull of pitch tar resin gunpowder and sailcloth soon the masteratarms mr neale and his ships corporals burton and ragster would start their rounds no nothing more aspinall you go turn in lewrie told him leave the coffee warming on the candle dye please ill work a bit longer tell mister neale ill try not tburn us to the waterline aye aye sir and gnight aspinall replied and departed after a last reassuring set of wubbies for the cats start of the floodtide lewrie muttered to the empty cabins once aspinall was gone dawns always the best time but no according to the local tide tables the floodtide would be strongly making after the time of dawn shown in the ephemeris and the top of high tide and the slack would not come til am or thereabouts depending on lord boxhams iffy approval the weather and the state of the moons tug a week from then the slack would not arrive til off the cote sauvage and probably ten or twelve minutes later off royan worse yet lineofbattle ships on a decent westerly wind had fifteen seamiles to sail from the tip of pointe de la coubre to royan three hours or better before they could take up bombardment positions facing fort st georges and even if the french came down with a serious case of la chiassethe runs and scurried to the cote sauvage like a whole flock of beheaded chickens theyd still have three hours to see right through the ruse unless lewrie grumbled we turn it round on em like a threehanded jenny yes watch this hand he set all his sources aside fetched a blank sheet of paper from a drawer opened his inkwell and wetted a captured french steelnib pen to rearadmiral lord boxham aboard hms chatham he wrote my lord allow me to lay before you a plan for an operation against the french in the gironde the object of which will be to reduce both fort st georges and the presently unfinished battery on slam went the marine sentrys musket butt on the main deck oak masteratarms sah what lewrie barked impatiently yer lights sir mr neale ventured through the closed door tis just been struck two bells sir and workin late mister neale ill be careful lewrie promised aye aye sir neale replied sounding daunted but dubious and lewrie could imagine him shrugging and rolling his eyes at burton and ragster and the marine private now bugger off lewrie whispered as he began to lay out his scheme he laid the start of the letter aside for a moment to sketch out a drawing of the plan and begin a rough draft on separate pages from his desk drawer it would be a long night so he rose and poured himself a cup of that sour and bitter toolongontheheat coffee to prompt his wits and wishing that there was any sweet goats milk or that hed kept aspinall a bit longer there wasnt even time to unlock his sugar tea and coffee caddy so he drank it black hours later he leaned back eyes burning and his buttocks numb he flexed the fingers of his writing hand lewrie yawned widely just as seven bells of the watch chimed spaced in three quick pairs with a short pause between each set then a final ding that echoed on and on halfpast eleven he marvelled bugger it im too tired t read it now do the final draft in the mornin and let padgetts fingers cramp for a change what captains clerks are good for damn em the coffee pot had simmered itself dry long ago and he feared that aspinall would have a real chore to scour it fresh come morning lewrie fetched a cheap pewter candle holder from the pantry and lit a taper off the warming candle then snuffed it the swaying lanthorns over his desk were snuffed as well then he lit his stumbling way to the sleeping space as savage gently rolled and bowled along might not even make a lick osense in the mornin he thought as he tugged off his hessian boots breeches and shirt flinging all atop his seachest he pinched the candle at last and rolled naked into the cool damp hangingcots box setting it swaying wildly for a minute or two the upper halves of the sash windows in the transom were open and the night was almost nippish to get under the sheet and coverlet though involved displacing the cats who had snuggled up into a ball with each other awakened toulon and chalky assumed that it was time for a hit more adoration from a human and even after he had rolled over on one side and punched his pillow into shape they were damned persistent whose bed was it after all sleep on it lewrie thought once they had settled down in the lee of his knees and the nape of his neck and eight bells signal for the change of watch and the start of the middle peacefully chimed chapter thirty zut alors capitaine la m sieur but you mak ze grand emmerdement jules papin chortled over his first tall glass of rum mon cul eef you do hawn hawn officiers de iarmee you give la chiasse ow you say ze runs all medoc all saintonge is be like ze eadless chicken an soldats be march de long en large uhm ze backward an forwards papin gleefully related that a demibrigade perhaps two thousand men was rumoured to be on the way to reenforce rochefort marennes and la tremblade more troops about three or four companies had come up from bordeaux by barge at least as far as meschers sur gironde and heavy guns with them at least six pieces that hed seen himself and judged to be pounders they had all gone down the coast afoot or upon extemporised guncarriages though for hed seen them on the coast road a bit west of st palais sur mer when hed run a trawl near the shore perhaps papin speculated idly to set up their guns by the site of his murderous ambush and his humiliatingly sprung trap there was some anger and sadness among the locals over the death of so many soldiers no matter they werent local boys themselves he related too much a reminder of what had happened could happen to their own husbands fathers sons and kinsfolk conscripted into the army and now very far away more barges capitaine mais oui papin went on eying that fresh rum bottle jealously nord bank of river to pointe de grave not so much hein some say guns for zere are detourner diverted an beaucoup de travailleurs many workers ze armee hire to make fort on ze point i see go in boats do le verdon to royan i do wot go to le verdon moi for people oo live zere are tous les fumiers an ze regime des hautains salauds degueulasses all of them were shits and a bunch of stuckup disgusting bastards papin meant lewries time off the gironde was doing wonders for his command of colloquial french if not the drawingroom variety and what about fort saint georges msieur papin lewrie said as he poured the mans glass full with his own hand is open at rear as i say before papin said with a sly look wiz iarsenal hided in woods an zere is a furnace for heat ze shot in centre tree wall tree eighteenpounder two each ze twelves on each wall aussi make six twelvepounder six of ze sixpounder down in beach battery at foot n estcepas seven lets say nine gunners per pounder lewrie hurriedly speculated to himself all but counting on his fingers for a bit eleven for each pounder and eighteen french equivalents for powdermonkeys runnin cartridge from their magazine five men on each pounder another dozen boys say four lieutenants two captains and a major and thats uh bout all told he named that figure to papin who frowned over it shrugged in the gallic manner and guessed a lower number perhaps only an msieur law uhm ze alf compagnie infanterie zey ad to guard zem you ave already massacre an i see no more come encore still peutetre no more zan eight or nine remain of zem hein well thats encouragin lewrie thought leaning back to take a sip of his cold tea his mock rum un autre m sieur papin idly said sipping deep and scratching his unruly hair at the same time ze ozzer ting before you massacre before you bombard rumour say beaucoup de soldats beaucoup dartillerie are to go nord au channel coast but now non and thats intrestin lewrie thought could their new consul napoleon bonaparte so fear a british invasion cross the dover straits that he was fortifying artois and picardy against such or was bonaparte amassing an invasion army of his own against england in either case whatever pinprick or fleabite launched here off the gironde could disrupt either of bonapartes plans merci merci beaucoup capitaine papin for all your tidings lewrie warmly told him tanks mon cul papin growled tanks be damn m sieur i pass you school assignement better ze rum ze gold be ze reward hein aussi non to expect you buy from me ze bon marche ze cheap no more non gendarmerie ave spies are now angered an are now soupconneux uhm ze suspicious cannot bring you much an risk mus be repaid hein i curse zose fumiers bad as i mus curse you comprendre two hours later as savage made her daily rounds of the estuary the lookouts espied jean brasseurs boat just as shabby and dowdy as she ever was but this time flying a muchfaded pale blue long pendant from her masttip the agreedupon sign that brasseur had information to sell along with fish fetchto mister urquhart lewrie ordered we shall let our fisherman come to us ninepounders and swivels to be manned and loaded just in case pass the word for desmond and he is to ferry an inspection party over to his boat mister devereux do you oblige me to send four marines and a corporal with my coxn directly sir lt devereux crisply replied though i fear they must be deloused once back aboard shes a filthy thing permission to mount the quarterdeck sir mr maurice durant their emigre french surgeon asked from the foot of the larboard ladder from the waist aye mister durant the watch officer lt gamble allowed ah captain durant said once near the binnacle cabinet i hear we will fetchto out might i enquire how long this stillness may last sir able seaman brough is teeth are very bad and i must extract three of zem all at once quel dommage i wish to do this on deck sir not in ze cockpit or my sick bay and brough had put off the surgeons suggestions that he suffer those teeth to be removed several times til the pain was blinding and brough could not even take his daily rum ration without groaning lewrie strongly suspected that broughs mates and more than a few of the crew who served under the quartergunner wished to see him howl during her conversion from a french frigate to a british ship savage had at mr durants urgings remade the starboard half of the deck under the focsle into a most modern sort of sick bay near the galley for warmth but fairly open and airy which all the authorities deemed healthier than a lowerdeck compartment there just wasnt as much room for spectators as was the frigates waist very well mister durant lewrie decided carry on sir merci captain brasseur came almost emptyhanded this time apologising over the quality and quantity of his smuggled goods the indifference of the assorted bottles of wine the dayold loaves and the paucity of fresh cheese even the tightly woven straw basket of oysters clams mussels shrimp and crabsalong with a few gasping and weakly flopping fish caught that morningwas only half full brasseur took his ease in lewries greatcabins silently accepting two bottles of rum and one of spanish brandy from lewries stores and a glass of a better brandy a cognac from normandy smuggled to england by british scofflaws the cats of course once brasseur was seated made their usual great fuss over him damn em you fly your pendant capitaine brasseur lewrie said by way of a beginning you have news for me oui capitaine lewrie brasseur replied rolling his glass in his hands after a couple of sips pardon but time mus be short ze gendarmerie nestce pas zey watch us now and to spend much time togezzer will be suspect so say on quick as ye must sir lewrie urged barges yes more barges were coming downriver from bordeaux artillery was rumoured aboard them hastily stripped from idle ships of the line along the city piers and troops were being moved by barge or roads to the cote sauvage and the banks of the gironde all of which confirmed what jules papin had told lewrie not an hour earlier it was the details that were contradictory disturbingly so lewrie pretended to nod grin a bit and utter aha here and there during brasseurs rushed description of french preparations for repelling a british fleabite he even bothered to make notes of the salient portions of the tale but jean brasseur laid out a strong reaction to his ambush and his bombardment with little mention of how his fellow locals felt which lewrie thought odd but perhaps because the french people had no say in the matter and no one was asking their opinion anyway a demibrigade was rumoured moved to rochefort and the cote sauvage and a second demibrigade gathered from bordeaux and the provincial capital of saintes in saintonge was to come to royan and talmont to st palais sur mer to erect new fortifications supposed to be armed with proper pounder and pounder guns the fort at st georges would give up its pounders and pounders for heavier pieces and those lighter pieces would be sent cross the gironde to the unfinished battery at pointe de grave with his own eyes brasseur swore that he had seen the stone blocks meant to raise the ramparts higher being laid flat for gun platforms and some blocks of the low walls would be removed to make embrasures for firing i fear m sieur zat a halfbataillon of soldats will come to my poor village brasseur moodily told him an take over ouses of our people officiers ave marked doors wiz chalk so many soldats of which compagnie to each an my ouse zey will take an we mus feed zem hein he bemoaned looking frantic for a second mon dieu capitaine lewrie zey stay long ma famille will starve an if zey suspect anyone of disloyalty of consort wiz enemy if false accusations are made ze arrests ze massacres in ze vendee may appen all over again you see why i mus not be suspect by dealing wiz you might you wish to be taken aboard and taken elsewhere sir lewrie asked he didnt want the fellow scragged if you are in danger an escape for you and your family can be arranged mon dieu capitaine lewrie brasseur said as he set his cognac aside and wrung his hands leave la belle france we mus be cursed our famille long ago anglais outcasts now toujours outcast from new country but it may be zat or face ze guillotine merci msieur merci beaucoup peraps i mus ask you for zis well then lewrie said reaching for his coin purse to shake out three guineas ill not keep you so long that your police become suspicious capitaine brasseur daunting as the information you bring is putting yourself to further risk will not be necessary no fleabite capitaine lewrie brasseur asked a pity but wiz ze reenforcements oo come he heaved a deep negative shrug dont see how we could accomplish anything now lewrie found himself saying disgruntlement perhaps or a faint peevish suspicion of his own but he added nice idea but no future in it not anywhere near where you live msieur there are better places no matter he cryptically cut himself off still wondering which to take as gospel papins version or brasseurs ah jai oublie brasseur cried all but slapping his head forgetful of me i ave ze newspapers you ask for he traded coins for a wad of papers kept in the chest pocket of his fishermans smock zey mention ze raids on cote sauvage an ze reenforcements to assure our citoyens ze local people at last thankee kindly sir lewrie enthused even though he knew that most french papers lied like a rugas the frogs said lied like a bulletin from parisand he would need help from devereux and durant and lt urquhart to get a proper translation brasseur gulped down the last of his cognac stated a sum for his goods and pocketed his money lewrie walked him back to the deck then up the larboard ladderway to the gangway and entryport both men stopped though for a large crowd of sailors were now gathered round mr durant and his patient quartergunner brough who sat atop a seachest just aft of the mainmast trunk thisll be good lewrie told the frenchman durant now in rolledup shirtsleeves and stained leather apron was reaching into broughs gaping mouth with pliers he twisted and even lewrie could hear the sickly crunch of rotten roots mr durant jerked hard and the sailors whooped clapped and shouted fire one as durant held up the tooth like a conjurer whod just pulled a dove from someones nostril it was a large molar worthy of a dray horse stained brown with a lifetime of chawbaccy and black with corruption brough put a hand to his jaw spat blood but made no sound ge on wi ith he shouted to show his bottom oil of cloves brough durant offered but brough had surely been dosed with a double tot of rum already to which offer the poor fellow shook his head side to side tentatively it must be said no fankee thir brough insisted glowering at the surgeon as fiercely as he thought he could get away with this side of insubordination the thought that his pay would be docked for his treatment paying for his own agony might have had something to do with it care tmake a wager sir lewrie asked brasseur two to go and the odds favour him squeakin by the third fears of lingering too long aboard an enemy warship or no brasseur looked bloodthirstily intrigued with that better you than me mate smirk on his face go fer totheruns willy toffett urged surez christmas comin hell squeal like a shoat got money ont hey lads out came the second tooth as rotten as the first and with it a spurt of greyish blood and yellow pus which brough spat into a wood pail demanding again that durant get it over with yer borin me mister durant sir he made himself cackle to the gloomier quieting crowd of onlookers some of whom were now regretting their wagers out came the last and after swigging his mouth clean with sea water brough leaped to his feet arms aloft and dancing like a successful boxer fresh enough to gloat over his win huzzah mister durant lewrie called down most neatly done i vow and broughnother tot o rum and light duties for a day for ye stood it manful merci captain durant called back bowing at the waist after his pair of loblolly boys had taken charge of his pliers pail and apron ah he m sieur vous etes capitaine brasseur oui durant all but skipped up the ladderway to the gangway and began a palaver in rapid frog his chances to speak his nativeborn tongue were lacking aboard savage but for the hour a day he tutored the midshipmen and a few of the masters mates who might aspire to commission someday the rest of his waking onduty hours were conducted in english at which durant had become more than proficient but when a chance arose he would gladly seize it if only for a few minutes with another frenchman no matter his class or station and slang away brasseur on his part seemed to enoy it too after making a torturous way with lewrie and a nearly total lack of a common language between them i offer him my medical services for him or his crew sir durant said with chuckle for some reason capitaine brasseur refuses my kind offer you see he should not be delayed too long mister durant lewrie told the surgeon gendarmes spies and the guillotine hmm oh mais oui durant replied wincing au revoirs were said in haste fakes attention said for brasseur to take care and even more merci beaucoups along with bonne chance and good luck before the fellow went down the manropes and boarding battens to a waiting boat lewrie stood by the open entryport his cocked hat held high in salute with a smile plastered on his phyz though fuming that both his informants had given him diametrically opposed observations and he still couldnt fathom which to believe bastards he snarled vous menteurs fumiers lyin shits or is it fumiers menteurs tow an adjective le waggon green by god anything of note aboard his boat mister devereux he asked the marine officer the usual trash and nothing more according to corporal skipwith sir devereux said with a faint smirk hardly any catch this morning either he told me mister urquhart soon as desmond secures the launch pray do get us under way lewrie instructed we shall continue our little jog down towards point grave and see if there are any changes to the battery there might take a potshot at it do i feel surly and i do lt urquhart acknowledged his orders touched his hat and went to the quarterdeck lewrie thought a stroll to the forecastle and a turn down the starboard side might settle breakfast but your pardons captain mr durant said a quizzical look upon his face there is something i must mention i do not know if it is important but he said with one of his deep gallic shrugs walk with me sir lewrie offered and they set off forrud that fellow sir jean brasseur durant began raising an eyebrow in query he sells us more than fish and wine he does mister durant lewrie admitted tightlipped hands clasped behind his back none good really and he says he is from one of the seaside villages yes from le verdon down yonder aye lewrie said his attention fixed more on the neatness of the flemished piles of running rigging how lines were coiled over the pins in the rails and giving the taut stays a thump with his fist then that is very odd captain durant said with a frown on his face for in conversing with him i do not hear the accent of the medoc nor the saintonge or aquitaine either hmm lewrie gawped coming to a full stop to face mr durant hes not a local dye say sir when i study in paris to be physician sir i meet many young men from many provinces durant worriedly explained if one cannot speak perfect parisian well one is teased yes my own accent of picardy resulted in no matter yet because of this i may swear that this msieur brasseur has the accent i recall of fellows who come from provence this is very odd nestcepas captain yet he claims his familys lived by the gironde since the time of queen eleanor and one of our king henrys lewrie exclaimed his multiple granthers sposed tove been an english archer damn my eyes if hes said hed been in the french navy during the american revolution and what was in provence lewrie furiously recalled marseilles toulon nice all of em french naval bases christ ive been led round like a prize sheep hes been lyin from the start you couldnt be in error could ye mister durant all these years since lewrie pressed at medical college sir i was known as quite the witty mimic durant told him smiling in reverie for a moment almost preening over his old skill we all made poor provincials the butt of our japes for i received my share as well you see it is not an idle boast on my part to aver that i still possess my ear for accents he is surely from provence sir perhaps longremoved but this brasseur fellow sprang from there grew up there spent a good part of his life on the mediterranean coast another niggle sir which just now strikes me durant posed before lewrie could begin to splutter pardons captain but yours is a name which you have surely noted that people you have met overseas is difficult for them to pronounce the closest a frenchman may come would be something like luray yes lah lur luh ive heard a slew aye go on sir yet this capitaine brasseur says lewree as easily as what is the english phrase as easily as kiss my hand yes as if this fellow knows about you davance uhm beforehand sir mine arse on a bandboxl lewrie spluttered now that he had something worth spluttering about damn my eyes but that foreign son of a bitchs diddled me thinks he has damn is blood but o course the french sicced navy officers out here posing as fishermen to spy out our doings our intentions too by god well jean crapaud brasseurs got another think comin sir lewrie vowed in some heat and thankee mister durant id notve tumbled to him were it not for your keen ear and keener wit it was nothing sir durant preened in false modesty just an odd niggle in my noodle hawn hawn keep nigglin sir lewrie told him niggle away now were warned though were onl he crowed to mr durants mystification now i know which of em to believe and whod imagine jules papin an honest man well mostly so no matter as a friend noan acquaintance for ill not call him friend this side of hellsays the games afoot book iv wherefore with thee came not all hell broke loose john milton paradise lost book iv chapter thirtyone a spate of rough weather had forced several days delay after an anxious week more before rearadmiral iredell lord boxham had made up his mind and had summoned lewrie from the close blockade fetching commodore ayscough in chesterfield as well to thrash the minutiae of the plan to a dubious hash and a mere semblance of lewries original scheme then reassemble its various pieces into a cogent whole that process had required two councils of war a fortnights worth of dithering carping and faultfinding along with some flushed and angry faces a great deal of swallowed pride and here and there some gnawing of finger nails before lord boxham had given his grudging approval depending upon the weather of course and the veracity of the information which lewrie had to vouch for then had come another full day far offshore for the marines and landing parties of armed sailors to be transferred from their own ships to hms chesterfield hms lyme a brace of third rate s to hms savage from which they would be parcelled out to the brigs and cutters another council of war had to be held aboard savage to brief the newcomes officers midshipmen and petty officers to assign duties to bartoe shalcross and umphries to kenyon and hogue that one was conducted on a day of curling iron grey seas and greenish white spume and a sullen cold rain that lashed down from low grey clouds making them all think the idea halfdaft with winter gales expected by the end of the month and a bootless endeavour best left for the spring of the sash windows in the transom of lewries greatcabins had to be left halfopen at the tops the hinged glasspaned windows along the coachtop were propped partially open yet the air in the cabins was a frowsty warm and almostairless fug despite the coolness of the day and stank of foul bilge water unwashed bodies and hair of hot candles and lamp oil and damp wool uniforms so many officers puffed away on clay pipes that a pall of smoke clung to the overhead like the greasy cloud spewed from a muskogee indian firepit in a clans winter hud and no amount of wind cross the decks could suck it out as if lewries entire quarters had turned into a badly drawing chimney fetchto here just off the tip of pointe de grave as the brigsloops round the point and cometo on the upriver side lewrie said using tiny slivers of wood to represent ships atop the chart he had spread on his dining table savage will land lieutenant ford and his marine complement here whilst commanders kenyon and hogue will put lieutenant nobles marines there simultaneously it is tbe hoped he added with a brief rueful smile all our boats along with those borrowed from those officers respective ships of the line are to be towed astern ready to go and speed of landing will be crucial at the same time as we all sail in together in lineahead with the brigsloops leading and my frigate astern of all and with all the cutters in a short column a bit north of us penguin banshee and argosy shall proceed beyond point grave as we call it lewrie further explained looking round to continue eye contact with all the officers crammed elbow to elbow about the dining table look into the shallow bay east of the point to see what shipping may be anchored there we have conflicting reports of barge traffick so there may be some or there may not be in either case lieutenant bartoe the senior into penguin is to capture or burn whatever he discovers or continue on another two miles to what we term the dragons muzzle just off the northern arm of the breakwater of the harbour of le verdon sur mer then wait for support from commander kenyons erato and commander hogues mischief might i ask why that is sir a lt aubrey whose marines and sailors would be aboard the cutters asked i would have sixty men of mine own plus another thirty off the cutters all told we could land on the breakwater and march on the village taking the french from the rear as well its more than a mile from the place you suggest lieutenant and more than two miles march from the battery on point grave were the frogs garrisoned in the village in strength we could not take the battery and slight it then march that far quick enough to assist you lewrie explained both landing parties would just arrive tired its better that you and the cutters wait for erato and mischief to get the landingparties ashore at point grave then sail round to back you up before taking further action once they do arrive though all ships are free to sail right into the harbour if the pickings look promising and take a peek into the cove below the dragons jaws unfortunately sirs lt devereux wryly commented we aint as spry as our army brethren as stout of leg and lung from marching trotting and charging for practice almost weekly what and our main objective is the reduction of the pointe de grave battery and we dont know how long that will require lewrie further said nor how many kegs of powder must be landed to flatten it so any attack on le verdon must be up to commander kenyons judgement as best he sees it once he joins the cutters which til that happens will be under lieutenant bartoes command shipping is primary if it is there with assistance from marine and naval boarding parties then the village and harbour if it appears that we are not outnumbered besides sir lewrie said with a shrug and a twinkle going ashore on the village docks if such is practicable is a much shorter stroll which slight jape raised a collegial chuckle lewrie could not help casting a chary eye on kenyon who would bear a great deal of responsibility for the coming landings kenyon did not look all that well his face was waxy pale and he slumped in his chair hemmed in closely with officers hanging over his shoulders and peered blankly at the chart as though the closeness of the cabins did not give enough air to breathe his mouth hung slightly open and the nickering of his tongue over dry lips gave lewrie the impression that kenyon would dearly wish a glass of something both wet and intoxicating no matter the import of the moment god hes a slender reed lewrie bemoaned why couldnt hogue be senior his active commission but a day older than kenyons savage will remain off the point and will see that the powder kegs are landed once lieutenant fords and lieutenant nobles people are firmly ashore and will cover the main landings with our guns if substantial opposition is detected upriver of the point which might require my reenforcing commander kenyon will fire off a signal rocket right sir he prompted hoping to fetch the man back from catatonia kenyon snapped his head up to look at lewrie had to gulp before speaking from a dry mouth and said of course sir by rote yet we know that we may rely upon your support captain lewrie and that came with one of kenyons slyly snide looks though the others with no knowledge of the recent action off the cote sauvage nor the grudge that kenyon bore for his losses took as a companionable affirmation of mutual trust goddamn yer blood you lewrie wished to shout aloud cant i relieve him for drunkeness at least he ii bugger this up certain drunk as davys sow or from spite for gettin some o his molly boys knackered for better or worse though unfortunately he was stuck with him oh but if you turn this into a shambles jemmy ill see ye stomped on like a worm believe me sir hogue drolly commented are there frog warships lurking down at talmont youll see a royal fireworks of rockets in the air so you can come join the hunting uhm no lewrie said after the laughter died away lets take signals into account separated as we are if you discover frog opposition lieutenant bartoe send up two rockets and continue firing in pairs til fire a pair in reply then limit your advance into the river to the shallow bay north of le verdon same goes for you commander kenyon if enemy ships turn up after you sail round the point to support the cutters and i shall reply the same to signal my arrival to support you mister bartoe lewrie continued if no opposition is found afloat launch one rocket after you are off the dragons muzzle here he said tapping the chart with a fat lead pencil to which i shall reply in like manner do you espy large numbers of french troops in le verdon launch four rockets in a single salvo to alert us that we may expect opposition marching to confront our landingparties busy at the battery again same goes for you commander kenyon once youve joined the cutters and have had a good look of the village and small port then is an attack upon the harbour either practicable or necessary and knowing that you have left the beaches at the point send up only one rocket to let me know that youre going in anyone takin notes he asked suddenly peering about i am sir his clerk padgett spoke up from a far corner by the chartspace copies of the rocket signals for each captain and every officer of marines before we adjourn do ye please mister padgett lewrie instructed well gentlemen if no one has any questions no how about comments wish we were cross the river sir with the asault on the fort and all lt noble wistfully said in the sudden silence theirs the greater honour what i trust there will be enough honour and glory available to all sir lewrie replied with a grin speaking of might be best does commodore ayscough know our signals so should the french have armed vessels upriver chesterfield lyme and the liners can come to our assistance with their guns once theyve silenced fort saint georges i shall see to it sir padgett told him reaching into the chartspace for a fresh sheet of paper but recoiling quickly as soon as hed gotten hold of it for toulon and chalky shy of such a noisy gathering had taken shelter in the shelves tween books and were of a territorial mood ready to claw and hiss at anything that threatened to enter their refuge see to it captain lt urquhart also promised though it was going to be a foul and wet row over to ayscoughs flagship perhaps he would send a midshipman and save his clothing at any rate urquhart looked restless and pleased for he would be leading savages armed seamen onto the beach with marine lieutenant devereux his second uhm i do find a bit of oddness to this though captain lewrie the timing of our assault in broad daylight lt ford commented as he shifted uncomfortably from one foot to the other and our beginning a bit before the other operations sir marching distances mister ford lewrie told him tipping him a wink dawn the traditional time for an attack rises and our foes see us deep into the estuary in strength were not doing anything to threaten them anchored as we are sacre bleu and other such words of consternation hey then word comes by galloper that more warships are off the cote sauvage blazin away like billyoh puttin down an armada of rowing boats where probes were recently made french soldiers were killed and guns smashed and their defences still arent sufficient from those beaches perhaps a brigade perhaps an entire division could march on la tremblade marennes or rochefort hour or so later after theyve committed forces to reenforce the few troops they have there at the doublequick with their tongues lollin out and the troops from royan sent off too they find out that we re the real threat soon as we upanchor and its too late to march all those fellows back in time to counter us i thought of launchin things tother way round but it would take too long for commodore ayscoughs force to sail in as far as the town of royan and what they might have despatched to the coast up here to the norwest could have time tmarch back lewrie explained with a wave of his hand over the chart towards the cote sauvage this way we show them what they expect tsee and get their pockets picked as i did in london by a girl by name of threehanded jenny so all thats wanting is a spell of good weather sir hogue asked looking as if he wanted to go back aboard mischief now that the plan had been thoroughly laid out yes and pray god thats soon before we roll our guts out on this halfgale lewrie agreed so gentlemen as my coxn and my cabin servant serve out glasses id like to propose a toast to success to our landings and confusion to the french of course for this will be the last gettogether before lord boxham deems the weather suitable and since i cannot dine you all in as i most certainly should given the size of my cabins and the state of my purse lewrie went on tongue in cheek which a barrister in london seems to have seized allow me to offer you all a standup meal such as you would see at a drum or rout at home minus the musicians sorry tsayless i could borrow commodore ayscoughs bagpipers we have the makings for hearty sandwiches though or as my man aspinall always tells me should becalled shrewsburys since it seems that worthy called for sliced tongue and bread whilst lord sandwich was too intent on a losing hand to enjoy eating each statement brought a slightly bigger chuckle then a laugh do not though sirs be entreated into slipping my cats a bit on the sly lewrie cautioned for the little buggers are already well fed as fat as badgers and as my clerk mister padgett yonder may attest theyll only go for yer fingers after the charts were rolled up the slivers of wood discarded and a brace of seamen from lewries boat crew brought in heaping platters of sliced roast beef or ham pots of mustard or freshwhipped sauce a la mayonnaise with a large stone jar of gherkins in vinegar roasted potatoes sliced in half and sprinkled with bacon and cheese and dayold loaves of bread fat baguettes already quartered and ready for piling on ingredients jams jellies and apple turnovers occupied another platter and for the abstemious after the toast aspinalls blackened gallon pot of coffee to us sirs lewrie said raising high his glass of pomerol none like us in the whole wide world success when the day comes and confusion to the french commander hogue completed and with fierce growls of agreement and a huzzah or two they tipped the wine back and drank it down to heeltaps those few officers who been seated round the dining table were forced to rise and queue up by seniority to get at the food laid upon it kenyon included with a loud scraping of his chair on the canvas deck chequer and a ponderous old mans shuffling he slipped back his buttocks brushing hard on the sideboard almost stumbling his face was no ruddier that it had appeared when he was seated and his long thin combedacross hair looked even wispier and more pathetic kenyon made his way to coxn desmond who was refreshing glasses poured one down his gullet and demanded a topup before he wandered away from the victuals kenyon stopped and peered at lewrie who had retreated aft to his daycabins desk for a moment to stow the charts away and lewrie saw his slitset eyes and the nighlipless hardness of his expression as if kenyon had bit into a sour citron sorry i could not seat a round dozen but lewrie said with a shrug of apology he meant to be civil it is of no matter to me lewrie kenyon grumbled come aft sir lewrie replied making it a firm and whispered order theres fresher air by the transom windows you are firm in your understanding of your role commander kenyon when the time comes that is of course i am sir kenyon remembered to add i must hope that you will play your part as you did before there it was again that slightly lopsided mocking halfsmile which was so irksome why cant just knock him silly lewrie thought brighteyed and bushytailed on the day lewrie tried to jape off as our yankee doodle cousins say of eager readiness your part is most important til i may land the powder kegs for demolition and cover the landingparties with fire as you did for me sir well im sure you will fulfill that task elegantly kenyon answered with a soft voice for only them but his mouth screwing up his smirk into a sour and resentful rictus your first officer didnt have tgo right into the surf and i ordered a play at landing on the beach sir lewrie snapped back at him in an equally soft but harsh tone the frogs waited us out too long and you lost some hands and for that im sorry but was i given the task again id do it the same way with you or hogue bartoe or whoever was handy despite your longstanding grudge with me that is or should be put aside so we may do our duty sober flintyeyed duty sir lewrie pointed out noting that kenyons glass was suddenly empty and could not recall him sipping at it that quickly at last kenyons face took on a healthy colour though it was more suffused with stifled rage than a sudden healing he puffed up almost atiptoe as if he wished to strike out with his fists those men you cost me lewrie he gravelled in a rasping rattle in his throat my brave fine lads you and he almost teared up making lewrie feel embarrassed to see such a display of emotion like watching a proud steed expire on a fence post one wished to look away but it was too lurid not to watch been with me for years some of them so promising so lively and and pretty lewrie snapped and kenyon recoiled deflating into his loose uniform coat as if he was a petty thief nabbed in the taking of a silk handkerchief how dare you lewrie i iwillnotwarnyouagain commander kenyon lewrie measured out in heat you say captain lewrie or sir when you address me andyouwilldosowiththeproperdeference hear me sir i have never made mention of your particular proclivities but do ye fail me in your part of our coming assault by god i will youve already sent the commodore a letter of complaint you were the one who said a grudge lay between us that i sent you inshore to spite you and i do believe that ayscough or a board of five postcaptains may see who it is acted from spite five postcaptains was the minimum number required for a courtmartial on a foreign station or at sea in foreign waters all i ask of you is to do your duty commander lewrie hissed suddenly weary of the fellow chearly promptly and wholeheartedly as an ablerated man o wars man i hold no grudge or spite against you i put you out of mind years ago but do you continue in your obstreperous uncooperative and sulky fashion lewrie warned enough was said and kenyon once again realised that hed gone too far the first time months before when he was in drink and now in anger i will take my leave sir kenyon said tween gritted teeth pointedly setting aside his empty glass i will see that lieutenant noble and your first officermister cottle is itare provided a boat back to erato no need to deprive them of a meal is there commander kenyon course not sir kenyon said with a grunting sound he bobbed a short bow from the waist turned and went to look for his hat boat cloak and sword waving off lt cottle in passing the dining table forgive me if i do not escort you to the gangway sir lewrie said in parting wasted on the truculent kenyon once the man was past the door to the main deck and gone lewrie heaved a bitter sigh going to desmond to get a first glass of wine since his toast damn my eyes whats wrong with that man he wondered silently doesn t he know how close he is to losing his career sure an this pomerol whativers righttasty sor desmond said with a snicker as he poured lewrie a full bumper an soz them sammidges too capm took a sample did you lewrie wryly asked well sor furfy helped me tote it all in like desmond answered an faith whod pass up a nipr two here an there god help us lewrie chuckled picturing patrick furfy and his two large hands snatching up tasties like a street urchin who had just come upon an abandoned piemans cart be trouble wi thatun sor that commander kenyon beggin yer pardons fer sayin capn desmond said in a soft whisper inclining his head towards the sadlooking lt cottle theres a youngun jist dyin ttell a tale o woe board is ship arrah dont ken th meat of it but theres somethin odd bout that erato sor not that its any o my nivvermind sure you have no idea desmond how odd eraco is lewrie muttered and aye ill speak with him mine arse on a bandbox but youve become quite the busybody since i made you coxn he quipped me capms best intrestsre me own best intrests sor the fellow said turning blankfaced and deferent else oill nivver be in sich a foin psition begorra like sophie de maubeuge sounding more french when she went all coy liam desmond could put on the brogue when he worked a fiddle or was in a spot where wheyfaced paddy innocence might suit lewrie strolled among the officers sharing brief comments and gathering impressions of their capabilities or enthusiasm for the impending landings at last he got to lt cottle your captain left early lewrie began uhm aye sir cottle replied with a shy gulp unable to look him in the eyes knew each other long ago in the west indies lewrie prompted ended not liking each other very much so so commander kenyon has mentioned to me sir but the young man stuttered in nervousness loudly and often i take it sir lewrie said half in jest uhm aye sir cottle admitted with a brief rueful wince anything you wish to tell me about your ship mister cottle lewrie posed in a soft voice smiling so casual observers might think they were merely yarning anything which might endanger the success of the coming landings a problem of morale perhaps dont wish to speak ill of the hands they dont cottle stammered they havent come together as shipmates as crews do in my experience and theres bad blood captain lewrie because your captain plays favourites most shamefully and cannot master himself lewrie pressed lt cottle winced again so hard his eyes shut then could only nod and blush in shame they could be a fine crew sir were some of them weeded out erato could be a taut ship yet under a new captain who doesnt cosset the pretty lads and treat them like a private harem dye mean sir lewrie asked you know sir cottle gasped suspected lewrie countered is he healthy enough to carry out his orders sir of a mind to do so despite his grudge and his peculiarity i think so sir lt cottle stated hes a thorough seaman and cant be faulted at shiphandling yet he will rant at times in nonsense words just blurt out whatever springs to mind that had nought to do with hes cautious and conservative mostly sir not one to dare too much i took the boats in so close to the beach sir and i am glad tsee you survived sir lewrie congratulated i imagine he tore a strip off your hide yes you say he rants he dont look well thats for certain but is his mind sound i sometimes am forced to wonder sir cottle confessed now he had a welcoming ear at first he seemed sound but lately erato his first decent command sir and i cannot think that he would take such risks to lose it and his career but there is nought i can do to amend things aboard short of cottle whispered edging round the word mutiny which a courtmartial would call his attempt to usurp a senior officers place unsaid was the fact that kenyons ruin would be cottles too his career forever blighted by connexion to such a scandal i know its gainst the articles of war sir and the good book and a mortal sin but theres little i may do yet if something isnt done soon the bulk of our people will sling a few handsome boys over the side lewrie thought finishing cottles dread for him maybe kenyon to boot purge erato like the hermione mutineers did as first officer youre there to spur him in the right direction in action at least lewrie told him as for his personal life well hiding what he is all these years is slowly killing him we can see that that and the amount of drink he glugs down we let it continue sir lt cottle goggled at him no lewrie grimly said you brought the matter to a senior officers attention at long last i will see that it is amended just as soon as i am able christ listen tme prosin like an admiral lewrie marvelled at himself i cant do anything this instant since i may need erato tomorrow morning does the weather moderate but were you to write a report on it and send it to me ill pass it on to the commodore who will mostlike pass it on to lord boxham as if it was a redhot fire poker as quick as dammit would you do that sir aye sir i shall lt cottle replied sounding and looking much firmer in his resolves with what might be called a relieved smile on his face even a pleased one in point of fact enjoy my improvised buffet lieutenant cottle and pray for a spell of good weather in the offing lewrie concluded giving the man a last smile and turning away to sample a few tasties himself but even a sweet apple turnover could not rid his mouth of the bad taste that lingered despite his unwillingness to involve himself in such sordid doings he now knew that he must there was no looking the other way in the stern world of the royal navy and ending the illegality against article the twentyninth if any person in the fleet shall committ the unnatural and detestable sin of buggery with man or beast he shall be punished with death by sentence of a courtmartial and there was no ameliorating codicil that followed most other of the articles of war or such other punishment as the nature and degree of the offence shall deserve and the courtmartial shall impose no demotion no cashiering without halfpay death lewrie built himself a ham shrewsbury and stuck with mustard not too sure if aspinall had whipped up the eggylemony mayonnaise the right way or how long ago the sauce was like made dishes a foreign kickshaw which had carried more than a few trusting souls to join the great majority over the centuries which made him wonder is kenyon really well enough to continue his command he looks like deaths head on a mopstick and his teeth are chalkygrey how many times has he had a clyster full o mercury shoved up his prick tcure thepox live with the pox long enough and ones brain rotted away and ones nose collapsed was that why kenyon behaved so truculently with him that the syphilis had destroyed his higher functions to such an extent that hed just blurt out his innermost thoughts was he angry enough spiteful and resentful enough that could explain it god help us if thats so lewrie gloomed im not countin on a slender reed at all im forced t rely on a raddled pusspewin penis directed by a brain turned trotten swiss cheese god help the french lt noble cried posing a standup toast huzzah confusion to the french lt aubrey amended bugger all sirs death to the french i say lt ford proposed which pleased them all much better death to the french lewrie echoed and tipped his glass up chapter thirtytwo what are they waiting for major loudenne commander of fort st georges and the th heavy artillerie groused trying not to look too nervous before his anxious gunners who lounged beside their pieces with slowmatch burning and had been on alert for more than two hours surely if they intended to attack would they have not sailed in just at dawn msieur lieutenant yet they just sit there and now they seem to be signalling to someone ashore so many signals those are not signals major lieutenant de vaisseau brasseur said with a telescope to his eye as they stood atop the ramparts partially to hide his smirk at the armee officers nervousness and also conceal his disgust at being dragged away from the first time of leisure hed had in weeks nor are they flags those are the bloodies laundry they do their washing he said of the anchored british warships squatting about four miles from either shore and two miles out of major loudennes heaviest pounders range that makes no sense lieutenant brasseur loudenne spat to wash do they not need fresh water even at the low tide they would have to come up beyond the narrows to dip up water and that would be brackish even then they anchor and do their laundry with water from their own stores to taunt us major lt jean brasseur replied collapsing the tubes of his telescope and turning round the dossiers which we were sent from paris told of this capitaine lewries capability to make the grand jest there are other ships with his though which tells me that his superiors also possess his sense of humour this is a feint a distraction from the anglais true aim before you arrived i sent gallopers to general fournier asking for reenforcement major loudenne said with a grunting sound he had overreacted and general de division fournier and his infantry would not thank him for a fruitless march of fifteen miles but he still commands three demibrigades so perhaps the major of artillerie abruptly waved for his orderly in desperate need of a calming smoke the orderly produced two spanish cigars and a tinderbox flint was struck several times til the rag caught fire and both men bit off the ends spat them over the stone wall of the fort to the stoneflagged deck of the water battery below then bent over to light their cigars merci brasseur said before turning back seaward and opening his telescope once more resting it on the parapet and taking a better look at the anchored british ships savage there msieur major the brigs erato and mischief in our service she would be named the espieglerie these you know hein the cutters you see daily as well poor fellows no laundry day for them for they still plod back and forth on their usual patrols the larger ships that one is the lyme which has been seen further north off the lie doleron borrowed no doubt to make us think the invasion would strike here brasseur casually pointed out the two next largest are sixtyfourgunned ships which i do not recognise neither the two biggest which are seventyfourgunned ships of the line offhand i would say they carry four hundred and fifty marines and could muster halfagain that number in armed sailors before reducing their ability to fight and sail their ships you do not reassure me lieutenant brasseur major loudenne growled spitting a loose wet shred of leaf off his tongue i have less than one hundred fifty men here and my last twelve infantry were taken back into their regiment and sent to the cote sauvage but that is where the bloodies will attempt to strike major lt brasseur cajoled after the tale i told their capitaine lewrie of our fictional readiness here at the narrows the fool let slip that my family and i in le verdon would be safe and that the blow would be elsewhere on the coast and besides major lt brasseur added as he turned about to loll against the cool stonework of the parapet and grin part of my tale is true there are two companies of soldiers in le verdon and the pointe de grave battery and the artillery has come up from bordeaux and will be installed as soon as the battery is completed oui where else might the british land with the best hopes of success than the cote sauvage hein hardly any inhabitants there non before their raids no defences and no sentinels either once ashore they could march on la tremblade by the coast road and spread smirmishers through the forests to delay our own troops i suspect we will see anglais warships in the pertuis de maumusson to cut general fournier off and take marennes then they isolate your garrison and fortress troops on the lie doleron and attempt to take rochefort even the stoutest of their ships could not get past the forts guarding those approaches lieutenant brasseur major loudenne scoffed a bit rankled to hear a sailor speculate on military matters and we are prepared to meet them if they land on the cote sauvage now that general fournier has arrived i only wish that during the planning a regiment might have been posted to royan well major you have requested reenforcements and with the presence of bloody warships offshore surely you will get them oui lt brasseur assured him with a breezy smile even if nothing occurs here today most likely they will remain making your position here and over the river even more secure nestce pas this demonstration they make will only amount to an al fresco meal here on the walls speaking of alphonse the coffee is still hot loudenne asked his orderly then bring us two cups i must apologise msieur for calling you from your welldeserved rest but i needed the experience of our navy in this matter and the bounciest wench ive met in months major brasseur drolly leered it feels so good to be back in proper uniform but it is also good to be out of it hawn hawn delicate bone china cups and saucers were given them the freshbrewed arabic coffee that major loudennes brother had brought back to france from the egyptian debacle as he had escaped on the same warship that had fetched the new first consul napoleon bonaparte was poured from a matching china pot the sugar was from spanish louisiana off a neutral danish merchantman the spoons though were humble brass the same sort bonaparte was reputed to use and both major loudenne and lieutenant brasseur approved of their plebeian republican presence brasseur admired the cup and saucer in his hands in the old royal french navy he had risen no higher than quartiermaitre en second and would never be promoted beyond quartermaster the revolution had changed all that he enjoyed becoming an officer and the genteel life that came with it as comfortable and clean as a minor aristo in the old days if his recent covert work was not as pleasing as he wished promises had been made that he could return to his native marseilles and serve at sea haunting the sea lanes of the mediterranean you have had your breakfast lieutenant loudenne enquired a hurried one msieur major he replied please allow me to offer a second more substantial one as you said we will set up a table here on the battlements alfresco as you also said and enjoy this fine clear morning i would be lt brasseur began to say but stopped turning to look west and cocking his ears major loudenne frowned and turned his head that way too he scanned the sky looking for a hint that he was mistaking the sound he heard with a storm on the far horizon but it begins the major softly said heavy gunfire oui lt brasseur agreed for in his time he had heard the faint thunder of faroff fleets duelling broadside to broadside look there msieur he eagerly pointed out raising his telescope once more the colour of the haze above the pointe de la coubre oui it must have begun minutes ago and the sound is just reaching us more and heavier artillery than we possess behind the beaches of the cote sauvage hein those are british guns major loudenne gruffly commented there is little we may do about it now let us have our second breakfast oui lieutenant alphonse set the table the major thought it would stiffen his anxiouslooking gunners nerves to see him and the naval officer enjoying themselves as phlegmatic as artillerymen were supposed to be before they could sip their second cups of coffee and before a fresh tablecloth could be spread on the collapsible campaign table a gunner on the western face alerted them to the galloper spurring down the coast road from royan he will kill that horse poor beast loudenne said with a sniff within minutes the galloper a young officer of general fourniers staff rounded the end of the western third of the fort and came into the grassy courtyard between the ramparts and the buried magazine and forge reining in dramatically and leaping down to let his exhausted mount stumble on as a gunner took its reins the aide dashed up the long ramp to the central wall where the tricolour flag flew from a tall pole a white leather despatch case on a matching baldric over one shoulder spanking his hip he was immaculate in foreandaft bicorne hat natty blue uniform coat with a heavy gilt epaulet he even wore white gloves but the young aides trousers were soaked in horse sweat and reeked of ammonia with a youthful sense of importance though panting in his haste the aide opened the despatch case with a flourish and tossed off a salute general de division fournier sends word msieur major eight british ships of the line came in sight between the pertuis de maumusson and pointe de la coubre two groups of four when was this lieutenant loudenne gruffly asked over three hours ago msieur major the aide breathlessly related his chest still heaving i was sent with a message immediately but it is twenty kilometres so bon loudenne grumbled reading the despatch quickly four at the north end of the cote sauvage it would seem another four near the base of the pointe de la coubre peninsula the general says pardon major the young officer interjected but the group to the north took our entrenchments and batteries under fire just as i was sent away did they anchor lt brasseur demanded no sir the aide replied nor did the second group of four ships near the peninsula which i saw for myself as i rode along the coast road they were bombarding the entrenchments there as well and that was over two hours ago by now m sieurl and which way were they sailing lieutenant brasseur asked uhm oh the northern group was pointing south and their southern group was sailing north sir the aide told him to meet off the beaches where all eight may open fire upon the defences near the creek and the spring which the bloodies have already scouted aha brasseur concluded with a triumphal smile they fall into your generals trap major loudenne uhm where did those come from may i ask msieurs the aide asked and what are they doing he added pulling his own telescope from his overshoulder case eight ships of the line eight hundred marines lt brasseur told loudenne and four hundred sailors against general fournier and his six thousand hah it will be a slaughter sangfroid jenne homme loudenne was chiding the aide to be coolblooded and coolheaded toujours le sangfroid such excitement on your part unnerves others always keep your demeanour calm no matter how urgent the situation oui msieur major the aidedecamp replied though thinking that artillerymen were perhaps too phlegmatic like turtles and did you meet any troops coming this way on your ride major loudenne queried i had requested reenforcements as soon as those anglais ships turned up indeed major the aide reported the fiftyseventh of the line all six companies i met them about five kilometres north of saint palais sur mer but i also had orders for them from mon general to turn about and march back to the cote sauvage they might have made it back to la palmyre by now msieur major damn loudenne spat warily eying the anchored warships you return to your general young fellow brasseur enquired oui msieur lieutenant i hope i am not too late to see the battle the aide told him with a broad eager grin as little as i am used to horses i will ride with you oui brasseur instantly decided what a grand sight to see these anglais salauds bayonetted into the surf and slaughtered by their boats i will ride fast i warn you msieur the aide cautioned if you are not a strong horseman but we will need fresh mounts there are many in royan brasseur told him with a shrug what are they doing here though loudenne still fretted concerned about his lack of reenforcements what are they doing he snapped raising his telescope and resting it atop the parapet all three officers turned their glasses seaward all three saw hundred of enemy sailors clambering up the rigging standing atop the stout oak bulwarks and lining gangways of the anchored warships some were lowering mon dieuf the aide primly gasped they show their arses to us les anglais the bloodies are an uncouth people swine they mock us brasseur said with a snarl even though what the british were shouting could not carry that far he could imagine what came from those widely opened mouths they think they have deluded us and played their part in the charade oui let us get fast horses lieutenant we must get to your general vite vitel these ships hold nearly seven hundred potential fighters and i think i know what they plan that regiment you encountered must be alerted msieur the aide asked with a raised brow loudenne was not the only one who thought a sailor spouting land tactics presumptuous their main landing is on the barren coast oui brasseur impatiently snapped jutting one arm to the norwest but if the enemy lands behind your generals main line up the coast from here there is a road from la palmyre to arvert on the northern side of the cote sauvage major loudenne all but gasped and sangfroid bedamned from there to la tremblade it is less than four kilometres your general masses to contain them let half get ashore before his riposte hein but if there is a force in his rear it may not cause our defeat but lt brasseur pointed out with another of his iffy shrugs and who knows how many more anglais ships lurk offshore to follow up on their initial lodgement messieurs warn that regiment lieutenant the fiftyseventh loudenne sternly ordered they must keep watch near la palmyre for movement by these ships vite vite take my horse capitaine dournezs too go mes enfants by sunset we can stain the sands red with british blood chapter thirtythree mister gamble well have the peoples washing taken in now i think capt alan lewrie gleefully told the officer of the watch hoist from chesterfield sir midshipman dry called out the signal is prepare for battle sir once the dirty shirts are below mister gamble do you order bosun thomlin to pipe stations for hoisting anchor and making sail lewrie added checking the looseness of his hanger in its scabbard you are ready sir he asked lt urquhart completely sir urquhart crisply and firmly replied nodding his head as sober and grave as a churchman if he had been thirsting for action for significant honour and glory he had an odd way to show eagerness lewrie thought as are my seconds urquhart added hed chosen midshipman grace and wonder of wonders midshipman carrington now betterknown among the hands as mister foggy to help him keep good order of the landingparty of armed sailors why lt urquhart had chosen the young twit no one could fathom sympathy perhaps for a sprog whose head was so full of clouds and not much else or as a wag in the wardroom had speculated a noble way to rid themselves of a henhead more dangerous to savages people than the french should i fall sir urquhart solemnly intoned i have left a packet of letters to my kin in my seachest of course sir lewrie said stifling his own rising excitement and eagerness for a moment to reply in kind all cleared away sir lt gamble reported very well mister gamble pipe stations and hands to the capstan lewrie directed fleeting the messenger binding on nippers and preparing the decks to receive the thighthick anchor cable was to an uninitiated lubberly observer a form of organised chaos not even the gigantic threedecked first rates had enough room on their decks when hundreds of men breasted to the capstan bars and began to walk the contraption round for nippers to rush continually twixt hawseholes and capstan to lash the messenger to the cable for men with middle mauls to pound the turns of the messenger round the capstan drum upwards so it would not bind upon itself today was not so bad the river bottom was mostly gritty sand not so much sucking ooze and with only the best bower down the cable came in fairly quickly the hands at the capstan bars urged on by the marine boy drummer and the ships fiddler who despite the stricture that only portsmouth lass was acceptable aboard a royal navy warship played a lively version of the jolly thresher heave chearly lads lt adair called out moments later and it was heave and pawl get all you can after a look over the bows and he changed to surgeho heave and in sight up and down walk away with it lads bosun pipe hands aloft lt gamble ordered from the quarterdeck as the iron ring and the top of the anchor stock became awash and the newmodel geared capstan clanked merrily away trice up and lay aloft lead along topsl sheets halliards and jib halliards lewrie opened the face of his watch as he paced far aft by the taffrails staying out of the way of men who knew what they were about a quarterhour to get the anchor up catted and fished which wasnt bad time for a ton frigate streaming bowson to wind and tide ten more minutes he judged would have savage under way off the wind all hands on deck the running rigging squared away and the guns run out and loaded mister dry he told the signals midshipman of the watch it is time to break out form line of battle aye aye sir the young fellow answered almost tailwagging like a puppy in eagerness the cutters broke off their patrols coming out to meet her erato and mischief came to take station in lineahead of savage which idled under loose and nagging sail having fallen off the wind to face pointe de grave a look to larboard showed the other ships under commodore ayscoughs command were beginning to sort out in a lineahead column as well with the gunned twodeckers in the van so their heavier guns would be the first to engage fort st georges not much of a wind today sir lt gamble commented now that he was satisfied of the frigate being squared away surprisingly aye lewrie agreed looking up at the commissioning pendant as it slowly undulated like a boaconstrictorlong colourful snake seven eight knots o breeze id guess perhaps eight to ten he amended with a shrug half an hour or better before we come to gunrange of the point grave battery see the people all have a go at the scuttle butts itll be dry work then aye sir erato and mischief were now off their larboard bows a mile or so off beginning to haul their wind to steer souwest for a time til they had savage abeam their starboard sides mischief was hard on the wind whilst erato was nearer to a close reach to reduce the separation between them to less than a quartermile when they hauled wind again and fell into place in lineahead and mister gamble i spose its time to let our passengers on deck lewrie chuckled no point in hidin em below any longer aye sir and marine lt ford and his hundred men clattered up from the prestripped gun deck to join lt devereuxs fourty some of them looking sweaty and red in the face even though the morning had come cool and the approaching midday did not promise much of a rise in temperature some fanned themselves with their hats and some japed and elbowed their mates but the bulk of them devereuxs marines and lt urquharts landingparty appeared sobered by what they were to attempt with the chance to go bayonettobayonet with french infantry weve the depth to go within a cable of the point in your estimation mister winwood lewrie asked the sailing master who was also looking as if a final prayer might not go amiss argosy skirted the point after dark last week sir and by her soundings with the lead at the peak of high tide which should be winwood pulled out his pocketwatch and peered at its face just past four minutes ago we should have five and a half fathoms within a two cable range captain id not advise going closer for they did not trawl a grapnel looking for any wrecks which might have gone aground on the point over the years god knows what lurks below two cables it will be then mister winwood lewrie decided savages pounder greatguns and their pounder carronades could hurl solid shot at the stone battery with great effect at such short range and could switch to bags of grapeshot as well beyond musketrange fifty or sixty yards grapeshot would scatter rather far but it could keep any defenders heads down and still would have enough force when it struck the unwary or the unfortunate to reap lines of opposing infantry in windrows in army practice lewrie knew from his brotherinlaw burgess chiswick the one who would still talk to him defending artillery would switch to grape when a foes infantry approached within three hundred yards so he supposed his own pieces much larger and of greater calibre would suit he strolled to the hammock nettings overlooking the waist now arseholes and elbows thick with men and weapons he took another peek at his watch looked outward to erato and mischief which were close to within a single point off the larboard bows about to be occluded by a fluttering mass of inner and outer jibs it was time lieutenant ford lieutenant devereux and lieutenant urquhart he called down do find a way tmake yourselves thinner and flatter amidships if ye please mister gamble beat to quarters major loudennes personal mount and captain dournezs horse were gooduns and goers and lt brasseur and the aidedecamp whose name brasseur had learned was carnot were making good time along the coast road a spell at the trot a spell of cantering a few minutes at the gallop then checking back to an easier lope in cavalry fashionfor cavalry could not gallop all the time no matter how dashing they wereand the lone spire of the church in st palais sur mer was in sight a newly installed kilometre post by the side of the roadone of first consul bonapartes many vigourous edictstold them that they were within one kilometre of the town carnot felt inspired to put heels to his horse not to the full gallop though the image in his mind of dashing purposely through the town was pleasing to his martial ego but a fast enough pace to tell the world that he was on urgent duty bearing vital despatches and making the girls of st palais turn their heads in admiration the woods thin out at last msieur carnot told his nautical partner hiding a smile at how clumsily brasseur rode like a large sack of turnips ah theres the beaches again and the sea jean brasseurs thighs ached like sin his breeches were soaked with his own sweat and foulsmelling horse sweat that had seeped into the saddle skirts whilst his buttocks had gone thankfully numb after shrieking in dull pain and why he wished to see the coming battle he could no longer fathom st palais was a small dull place but there was rumoured to be a good tavern that served a decent meal and their wine would be a betterthanaverage bordeaux of course he was about to beg off plead a sudden need to return to royan he looked seaward as they left the last copses of pines behind and the lefthand side of the road became blue and open to the horizon with low windsculpted shrubbery dune grasses gritty sands and the low dunes between beach and overwash barrows what he exclaimed sawing at his reins to bring the brute he bestrode to a merciful halt where the devil are they they could sail much faster than we could ride uhm back there m sieur carnot pointed out one arm aimed upriver i do not believe they have moved a single metre no brasseur brought out his telescope cursing the horse under him as it shifted its shoulders tried to plod a step or two towards some likelylooking grass along the verge of the road mon dieu theyve made sail theyre under way god rot and damn them what is it msieur lt carnot asked they are coming they are going lieutenant brasseur spat going upriver towards the narrows they were not a feint to distract us from an attack on the cote sauvage they were after the forts from the beginning the fiftyseventh of the line carnot exclaimed we can get them to turn about and march back they are the only troops close enough to save fort saint georges i must ride on and tell your general fournier that there may not be a landing on the cote sauvage brasseur said with a snarl of impotent rage for he had been very badly fooled and the shame of it was just sinking in strangling his ego but something still might be saved it will take the bloodies hours to get their troops ashore form up and assault fort saint georges overrun the battery on pointe de grave and place explosives your general has cavalry quel dommage non msieur carnot had to confess he has only infantry and artillery the closest cavalry is going into winter encampment inland of rochefort to feed and rest their horses back to health most of our cavalry units are hundreds of kilometres from here standing ready on the eastern fronti ride on dammit brasseur barked do what you can i will wait for you and that regiment in the town for theres nothing i can do any longer oui msieur lt carnot said with a bright eager smile despite his sour surprise for it meant a gallant and glorious ride i am off like a rabbit bonne chance lieutenant brasseur bonne chance d vous brasseur echoed as lt carnot put his spurs to his borrowed horse and galloped away shod hooves throwing up divots of sand and dirt and go to the devil you idiot brasseur grumbled as he kneed his horse to a walk towards st palais he had no urgency now but for a satisfying meal a bottle or two and a welcome rest for his abused backside and thighs on the softest pillows the innkeeper had lt carnot could gallop on to recall that regiment dash up to his general to announce the deception that the anglais had pulled off brasseur doubted the lads arrival would be well received he would kill a perfectly good horse for nothing perhaps a second if he galloped all the way back to royan or fort st georges lieutenant de vaisseau jean brasseur dismounted at last before the pleasantlooking little seafront eatery unable to stifle a groan of pain and a wince happily the weathered wooden signboard boasted degustation des varietes de la region so brasseur could sample as many wines as he wished by the glass with his dinner as he most carefully sat himself down on a large feather pillow he made a mental note to write the ministry of marine in paris there was need to add something to capt alan lewries dossier that they did not yet know this man is capable of being a very convincing liar chapter thirtyfour as you bear mister adair you may open lewrie shouted to the waist of the ship starbd battery adair cried out as you bear fire all of savages boats and the ones borrowed from the same gunned third rate that had loaned lt fords marines were in the water and stroking hard for the beach that was the first flaw that lewrie had found in his plans with hundreds of extra men aboard it would be impossible to take the fort under fire with them crowded behind recoiling pieces it had been difficult enough to drop a kedge anchor from the stern take in all sail and snub the frigate to a stop two cables from the point with all squaresls batwinged up snug in the centres in sloppylooking spanish reefs he could feel the anchor dragging a little turn and see the stern cable judder slacken then go taut good enough though to place them within very short gunrange giving the boats a short row to the shore and most important not tiring the rowers to return to the ship and pick up the second half of the invasion force now at least they could muster the other half of the marines and armed sailors on the larboard gangway out of the way and fire over the heads of the men already on the water for long moments lewries view of the unfinished battery went as opaque as the wintertime coalsmoke fog in london as quartergunners directed guncaptains aiming points then allowed them to jerk trigger lanyards on the flintlock strikers delivering a slow and deliberate series of hammer blows of doubleshotted iron bow to stern hms savage shuddered and groaned to each discharge still unnamed and thankfully unfinished the small batterys walls bore no artillery with which to return fire soil and sand had been piled up in a wide flattopped base to support the weight of the completed fortification and made a shallow berm under the base of the walls lewrie doubted the stonework had yet to reach much above a tall mans head and the top of the uppermost course of stone blocks was yet level and even with not a sign of an embrasure for guns there were soldiers in the fort lewrie could see after the fog of powder smoke drifted eastward on the moderate wind shakoes ashen faces here and there a bicorne hat worn sideways in the french fashion at least two senior officers under enormous cocked hats adorned with an even larger egret plume dashing from one of the three walls of the shallow ushaped redan to observe and order their troops about not much damage done even with doubled roundshot captain lt gamble pointed out a nibble here and there the base of the wall is stout lewrie supposed aloud but the uppermost courses of stone are newlaid done so recently the mortar hasnt hardened they must have finished the parapets but have yet to raise but the outermost blocks to support the embrasures else wed not see heads and shoulders as you bear firel lt adair shouted after the guns were reloaded run out and the recoil tackles overhauled lewrie looked beyond the point to see erato and mischief come to anchor by their sterns streaming soueast their own boats rowing hard for the shore and their pounders barking away the cutters had run on round the point and only their masttops were visible as they entered the wide shallow bay above le verdon sur mer above the thunderous earsplitting roar of cannon lewrie fancied he could hear bongs as roundshot struck stone and the splintering of shaped rock blocks each strike raised large clouds of stone shards and showers of sparks like flints in titanic tinderboxes no it was the four pounder carronades of the starboard battery that were doing the most damage their massive roundshot might be slowerflying and they could not reach out much beyond four hundred yards but when they hit the batterys walls they dished out bites the diametre of serving platters and the depth of soup tureens shifting stone blocks inwards and causing miniature avalanches of stone chips to dribble down the face of the walls the boats were ashore bows grinding into the shingle sailors were leaping out to steady them knee deep in the light surf marines and armed tars were flooding ashore and officers with drawn swords a sergeant or two with their ceremonial halfpikes were sorting men out into skirmishers and two ragged lines as quickly as the boats were emptied their crews were shoving them off going up to their waists before leaping back aboard even as oarsmen were stroking backwater to fend them further off the beach crabbing them round once in deep water and returning to the frigate for their next load frog infantry there sir lt gamble was pointing see the french mister adair serve em grape lewrie yelled second pounder balls were set back in the shot garlands and racks powdermonkeys scrambled below to the magazine returning with flannel cartridge bags that held wooden top and bottom discs inside and inchround plumsized lead balls between a pause in the firing to ram them down atop roundshot the strain of running out the heavy artillery pieces right to the portsills some toil with crowlevers to shift aim some fiddling with elevating quoinblocks to ensure the spread of grapeshot went over the heads of the shore parties as you bear on the french mind fire lt adair bellowed an officer was chivvying thirty or fourty shakoed soldiers into a rough line two ranks deep flooding from the western face of the battery though clinging nervously close to it mans bloody daft lewrie grumbled what does he think hes facin big damned muskets lt fords marines were already firing the first rank kneeling and the second waiting to fire til the first rank had discharged their muskets catching the french soldiers at long range not doing much to harm them but quite a lot to daunt them and make them shrink back to their rear and cram themselves elbowtoelbow as if that was shelter even as their officer and their sergeants were shoving and cursing for them to open up their formation when the heavy roundshot howled through them and when a cloud of loosespaced grapeshota thousand or more ballsspattered sand and dirt round them hammered bodies smashed musketbutts tore off limbs and heads and cut a few of them in two at the waist they simply melted away dropped to the ground as if theyd never been there the survivors a sad few number dropped their muskets and ran round the western end of the battery and took off in terror leaving their formerly elegant officer on his knees his sword broken and his entrails spread before him as he vomited up blood on his white facings and waistcoat lt fords marines and sailors gave out a great jeering roar and began a quick advance on the battery muskets held extended with freshground bayonets winking wicked in the sunlight at the quick before the boats had gotten back alongside under the nowsilent mouths of the guns they were in the battery behind the walls and into the courtyard then appearing atop its firing platforms to the east lt nobles men appeared atop that wall too with british colours waving bravely even if the flag was only a small boatjack mounted on a boarding pike hold fire hold fire lt adair cautioned his guncaptains dont hit our brave fellows yonder flintlock strikers were taken away from the vents discharged guns were reloaded with single solid shot and the guns were run in and bowsed down securely well damme lewrie heard a faint disgusted voice say lieutenant urquhart midshipman grace and midshipman carrington stood on the larboard gangways after end looking as downcast as tots who had discovered lumps of coal in their christmas stockings lots tdo yet mister urquhart lewrie encouraged ford and his lot can stand guard up the point whilst you and your lads place the explosive charges and blow this place to flinders hey but of course sir urquhart replied eyes almost glazed by how quickly the battery had fallen no glory for him poor fellow do you and your party man the boats sir and see to the loading of the powder kegs and fuses lewrie directed quickly mister urquhart we must get under way and support the cutters should they have run into trouble lewrie looked out over the larboard bows scenting for a threat but eratos and mischiefs guns had also ceased firing and both brigs were shortening their stern cables and preparing to get under way too abeam to larboard nearly four miles across the gironde commodore ayscoughs twodeckers had come to anchor just off fort st georges guns pounding by broadsides deck at a time and were wreathed in gunpowder smoke now and then a stab of flame revealed a surviving french artillery piece responding almost lost in the hot iron sparkles as the place was being pounded into ruin by heavy impacting shot the sound of pounders and pounders bellowing came faint cross the river an overthehorizon stuttering series of thuds and thumps and the echoey rumble of distant thunder half an hour later and the kegs of black powder had been slung over the side into the boats and lt urquhart and marine lt devereux and their people could at last debark signal rocket sir midshipman dry announced pointing with an extended telescope cross the point a single one sir no opposition found very well mister dry mister adair clear away the larboard gangway and reply with one signal rocket lewrie ordered extremely pleased that no french warships were in the bay north of le verdon but chiding himself for thoughtlessness if lt bartoe in hms penguin had found opposing forces savages reply would have been fired whilst the kegs of gunpowder were still on deck and he winced and sucked his teeth to imagine how large the blast would have been if only a trickle of powder had caught a spark for wooden kegs could never be completely spillproof ready to proceed sir lt gamble told him at last touching the brim of his hat in salute hands to the after capstan suits me right down tme toes sir lewrie said with a grin a half an hour more to haul savage to shortstays to her kedge for mr winwoods worry of obstructions on the bottom had proven true and one of the anchors flukes had fouled on something the tide had gone slack an hour before and was just beginning its long ebb taking savage sternward about ready to tuck the cable under her counter and possibly damaging the rudder the weakly ebbing tide took the frigate like a foldedpaper boat though aslant the wind and quickly hoisting the spanker and the inner and outer jibs gave her just enough way to stand out from the beach into the river and reorient the anchor cable round so they pulled slantwise from dead astern to the larboard quarter and at last the fluke was freed the hands breasting to the capstan bars could almost trot about and the pawls clacked rapidly til the anchor was upanddown again and just coming awash now get way on her mister gamble lewrie said with an impatient sigh of relief erato and mischief had rounded the point long before and only their topsls and topmasts were visible above the low land hms savage stood out into the river wind abeam for a time and pointing her jibboom and bowsprit at st georges de didonne making a mile due east as staysls the forecourse and fore topsl and the big main topsl filled with wind the continuous gunfire from commodore ayscoughs twodeckers had subsided to a desultory thumping the cloud of spent powder smoke had thinned and beyond hms lymes bows rowing boats were swarming shoreward like a colony of scuttling cockroaches for all that lewrie could see with his day glass all return fire from the fort had ceased haul our wind mister gamble lewrie said now they had enough offing from pointe de grave we shall wear about to soueast by south aye sir and we shall finally get a good look beyond the river narrows lewrie gleefully exulted to one and all on the quarterdeck much like followin an ancient seachart into waters marked here be dragons or discovering the land of the lotus eaters in a portion that bears the caution terra incognita captain mr winwood solemnly said he might be making a quip but with winwood it was always hard to tell once worn about and a mile inside the inner river past pointe de grave the gironde widened to nearly six miles across a vast glittering expanse the small town of meschers sur gironde lay two points off their larboard bows and talmont the hideyhole for ships running the blockade much on the same bearing but further away the shallow bay above le verdon was to starboard and was disappointingly empty of shipping only some light rowboats were drawn up on the beach by some small huts commander hogues mischief was off their larboard side bearing down on a threemasted merchant ship anchored close ashore just above talmont one with no national flag flying at the moment and the crew huzzahed her for their frigate was in sight and any money mischief made off her prize was she good prize that is they would share no matter if that resulted in less than a pound apiece kenyons erato was just off the dragons muzzle about to enter the small harbour of le verdon and the three cutters were further south of her angling almost due west in pursuit of something even as lewrie eyed them with his telescope tiny puffs of powder smoke burst from penguins bowchasers and the sound of her light guns came as a pair of distant dogbarks theres nothing for us to do sir lt gamble commented one hand fretting fingers on the hilt of his sword no french warships no prizes in sight to be taken but for mischief s success doesnt always come with close broadsides sir lewrie told him with a faint smile and a shrug of his shoulders both the fort and the battery will be destroyed and the french will wear out a thousand pairs o shoes marching and countermarching and whatever reenforcements theyll have to send to prevent a second beating will be just that many less available to bonaparte for any future adventures of his god rot the little bastard met him once ye know indeed sir gamble marvelled toulon in late lewrie said explaining how his temporary command of a razeed french twodecker zele fitted with two heavy mortars had been exploded and sunk by napoleon bonapartes guns and how he and the survivors had made their way ashore to become bonapartes prisoners til rescued by a troop of spanish cavalry and how he could not give his parole and keep his sword not with french royalist sailors helping man his artillery and sure to be shot down instanter as traitors to the revolution right there on the beach the man still has my sword damn is eyes besides it wouldve cut rough to live comfortably waitin tbe exchanged while my people wouldve ended chained up in some french prisonhulk starvin and dyin of sickness but i hope tget it back someday lewrie concluded rocking on the balls of his feet with his hands in the small of his back go to paris once weve beaten em dig round in some palace and find it uhm what is he like sir lt gamble asked eyes wide with curiosity and a certain amount of new admiration for his captain well hes a shortun a minnikin and a fellow with an eye for gaudy uniforms as i lewrie began to say but midshipman dry cried out that erato had just fired off four signal rockets the signal that denoted french opposition in the village of le verdon alter course mister gamble lewrie snapped putting reveries aside and stalking to the hammock nettings overlooking the waist and gundeck bring her round to sousouwest mister adair it seems weve more trade for you sir refit the strikers and prepare the starboard battery for action four more rockets sir midshipman dry reported unable to be as stoic as a sea officer should be before the hands this time its from penguin sir what was it you said about nothing to do mister gamble nothing sir gamble replied with an avid smile be careful what you wish for lewrie gently chid him two very large guns erupted in the cove below the tiny seaport the sound like the slamming of iron oven doors followed by the barks and raspy woofs of the pounders of all three of the cutters as if they had formed line of battle to engage something substantial powder smoke beginning to wreathe the cove the british guns stuttering bowtostern as they bore a minute later eratos pounders bellowed too as she penetrated the harbour a quick look showed her beamon to the village and piers a look that forced lewrie to choose which fight he should support depth in the harbour mister winwood he demanded two fathom or less sir the sailing master said from memory after all his months of glooming over his charts erato will have tdeal with things on her own then lewrie muttered peering intently through his telescope aloft there any french warships in the harbour barges sir the mainmast lookout shouted down cupping hands about his mouth no warships theys a gunboat south of th port firin on th cutters three point off th stahbd bows an oared gunboat stand on into the cove mister gamble whats the depth there sir lewrie asked winwood four fathom within five cables of the shore sir mr winwood once more recited from memory even before he could confirm that from a muchmarkedupon chart spread by the binnacle cabinet but it turns very shoal very quickly sir even at the top of the tide there isnt a whole fathom by three cables distance warn us when you think were close as we dare sir leadsmen to the forechains and have em sing out regular lewrie said eager to get to grips with something besides dead stone walls but by the time savage had come to the aid of the cutters it was apparent that her help was no longer needed penguin banshee and argosy had closed with a very oldfashioned oared galley blasting off her sweeps with solid shot and grape ducked out of the way of a pair of wicked pounder bow guns and had smashed alongside of her crushing and splintering the last of her long oars to grapple to her men from all three cutters were swarming aboard the river galley and the french tricolour had already been hauled down and replaced by a british flag far off in the shallows two small boats full of french sailors were rowing for the beach like the devil was at their heels and there were even a few more swimming to escape capture my word sir an ancient lateener mr winwood said after a long look with his glass good for going close to the wind in the gironde where the winds are mostly westerlys but their like has not been seen in real combat since don john of austria beat the turks worth a penny or two with a museum perhaps lewrie japed i very much doubt it sir mr winwood soberly replied mister gamble swan us about into the river again til we may come hard on the wind and stand in to see what eratos up to he ordered sorry mister adair have your gunners stand easy erato no longer needed help either for lt aubrey his loaned marines and armed sailors were already ashore on the piers of the seaside village and her guns had fallen silent close off the breakwater lewrie could see other sailors aboard several large sailing barges near the jetties and the only resistance seemed to come from within a maze of small shops and houses and even then the expected burningtwigscrackle of musketry had subsided to an occasional pop across the river the tall pall of gunpowder smoke had mostly thinned and blown away up the gironde its large wispy haze drifting over the chimneys and church spire of meschers sur gironde where bells still pealed in alarm near mashers hms mischief was standing out for the narrows her prize close astern of her and flying the royal navy ensign over a danish flag lewrie pursed his lips worried that taking a neutral even one caught redhanded in enemy waters and full of french export goods would tie young commander hogue up for years in admiralty court and end with the prize restored to her owners with all expenses of the proceedings and the years of the owners loss while the merchantman was tied up in port in custody on hogues shoulders idve burned her and called it their fault lewrie decided a drunken mate anoverturned lanthorn woops but i doubt ayscough will let him keep her past sunset so all may be well if the commodore didnt say anything then he would warn hogue himself and strongly suggest he let her go after her cargo was put over the side of course no sense in letting blockade runners profit the cutters are coming out sir lt gamble pointed out with the galley in tow no value to her unfortunately bless me if erato isnt tied up along the piers though bring us up within five cables of the harbour mouth and well send a boat in to find out what theyre up to lewrie said idling his way to the larboard bulwarks fetchto when in close sir it seems all the excitement is over and theres no need for our services do you inform mister adair to secure the guns and stand down from quarters i havent the heart tbe the one ttell him its over aye aye sir lt gamble said with a twinkle in his eyes by the time they had fetchedto though a rowboat was coming to them with eratos second lieutenant of marines aboard she had barely touched the mainchains when the young fellow scrambled up the side as agile as a teenaged topman lieutenant thurston sir perhaps you do not remember me he said doffing his hat in salute lieutenant aubrey begs me report captain lewrie that we shall be ashore a while longer weve discovered nigh a ton of gunpowder aboard one of those barges we captured and theres heavy drays in the village and teams of oxen so lieutenant aubrey wondered if it might he needed at the battery to help blow it up sir take a few hours to load it all up and take it to the point sir but theres no more opposition my brief ends at the beach mister thurston lewrie allowed but my first officer is already laying charges and he might go ahead with the kegs of powder weve already landed no worry on that score captain lewrie the young fellow said lieutenant aubrey sent a party of runners to lieutenant ford on the point and they will delay the demolition until our powder is added to theirs oh a bigger bang lewrie chuckled just at sunset like a germanic opera i take it sir wouldnt know about operas and such sir lt thurston said with a briefly furrowed brow and a shrug of indifference it will be spectacular is all i know captain lewrie much of a fight ashore sir lewrie asked for a bit sir aye thurston explained with recalled relish short sharp but all in our favour there were about an hundred french infantry in the village but we routed them rightsharply and the ships guns and swivels took the fight out of them there came a few more faint pops from muskets perhaps a faint distanced scream as someone saw his deathwound or got bayonetted then it was quiet again weve taken five barges sir lt thurston happily related four filled with stone and mortar mixings the lastun loaded with the powder and the artillery pieces that were to go in the battery lieutenant cottle says hell scuttle or burn four in the deep river channel but wishes to tow out the fifth as prize i doubt a sailin barged survive her first deep ocean storm lewrie speculated but does mischiefs prize prove legitimate they could be placed aboard her and sailed to the nearest prizecourt oh goody that would be excellent mean tsay sir lieutenant thurston amended blushing at his youthful slip lieutenant cottle bade me say that he will sail out with the barges once we have the waggons on the way out of town sir and lieutenant aubreys men to escort them my marines and our sailors will be coming back aboard erato soon as they set off and what does commander kenyon say mister thurston lewrie enquired mystified by the absence of his name in the proceedings he join the great majority pray jesus he thought with imaginary fingers crossed for good luck uhm commander kenyon fell sir thurston reported going solemn for a very brief moment right as he stepped ashore upon the town piers he and several of his boat crew all at once a french volley the marine officer offered as the cause though looking a tad cuttyeyed to lewries lights about the only casualties we had sir i see lewrie intoned with a grave nod of his head though feeling hed break out in maniacal cackles and do a little jig of mourning if he didnt get below in private soonest couldnt happen to a nicer fellow he thought biting the lining of his mouth to prevent a broad smile and theres that problem solved for good an all by god my most utter condolences mister thurston lewrie managed to say with a straight face and a brief semblance of sorrow himself pray do you relate to lieutenant cottle that i shall take savage to anchor off pointe de grave for the nonce and wish him to join me as soon as he may be able so we may take all our people off before the battery goes up and my congratulatons to lieutenant aubrey and mister cottle to you as well sir on your quick victory and just at sunset after all the surviving sailors and marines were back aboard their respective ships the stonebearing barges had been torched and sunk in midriver and all the twodeckers cutters and brigs had made their crawling way back into the estuary against the wind but with a falling tide there came two spectacular explosions fort st georges split apart in a titanic roaring fireball first and stout stone walls collapsed in a roar as the magazine blew then kegs of powder at each wall heavy artillery pieces already slighted by having their trunnions sawed off and their muzzles packed overfull with powder and roundshot then choked with mud burst apart as fuses set off by the initial explosions reached the touchholes shattering hard iron like papiermache and the rubble from the walls came down like an avalanche on the flagstone deck of the water battery just as the charges laid underneath it went off as well blasting parapet and embrasures into the river and littering the beach major loudenne his two captains and four lieutenants standing by the bulwarks of hms chesterfield as prisoners to watch the ending of his fort all were later reported to be in tears at the sight then just as the sun touched the horizon the pointe de grave battery exploded too rectangular stone blocks went soaring into the sky silhouetted against the livid bluewhite blast of exploding gunpowder smoke lit from within almost pale yellow for a moment before turning ruddy amber and all the waggons all the construction timbers and scaffolding all the outoftown workers huts piled in the centre of the batterys future courtyard caught fire helped along by the barrels of lamp oil resin turpentine pitch and tar that lt urquhart had borrowed from bosuns stores to help things along and torched upwards in an instant volcanic plume of flames that lit up the night and glowed like a lighthouse long into the evening visible at sea for over ten miles til the wee hours just before dawn damn good work mister urquhart lewrie told him simply damned fine pass word to all your people they did grand work today i suppose i must feel gratified by it sir if there was little combat urquhart bemoaned still it does feel some satisfying as i told mister gamble not all victories involve blood and thunder lewrie cajoled well we did make thunder at least but we accomplished what we came to do and hardly any of our men were hurt and none killed while the french lost hundreds well there is that sir lt urquhart seemed to brighten as he absorbed that concept the greater good as it were exactly so mister urquhart lewrie said with a sage nod though in point of fact the greater good was rather hard for him to swallow too especially the part where the more senior he rose the smaller role he might play when his beloved greatguns roared oh it was all very fine to plan something then watch as it unfolded successfully but all hed done this day was stand round like a fart in a trance and observe the derringdo of othersl you did obtain some rather fine remembrances sir devereux said from the side lt urquhart had at least come offshore in possession of an elegant french infantry officers bicorne hat and that poor fellows excellently crafted solingen sabre scabbard and snakeclasp belt well hed had to pay landsman newcastle one of their volunteer black sailors three shillings for the hat and able seaman bannister a crown for the sword a fact that would be conveniently forgotten in a year or two once they were hung on his parents walls lord cocky dont nip my boots ye daft little bugger lieutenant devereux griped as the marine complements pet the champion ratkilling mongoose that had simply turned up after a drunken night ashore in the west indies pounced and tried to gnaw on his newblacked leather private cocky m was distracted from his mischief by lewries cats which resulted in a threeway tail chase round the quarterdeck you may thank me later mister devereux lewrie chuckled as he turned to look outboard to the ruined forts st georges was now but a massive lightcoloured pall of smoke the broad base of the cloud ruddy with subsiding fires and the cloud drifting eastward towards meschers and talmont like a slowly twisting towering phantom off the larboard quarter though the battery they had destroyed still burned as bright as the fabled egyptian pharos with tall flames licking and forking at the sunset sky turning the waters of the gironde narrows and the estuary astern to a rippling sheet of brass or polished copper commodore ayscough did well today gentlemen lewrie drolly said as he stretched and yawned no doubt of it and all credit to him and the ships under his command but he was more than ready to get off his feet pull his boots off and delight in what might prove to be his last freshfish supper for the locals would be a long time forgiving the destruction theyd caused along the rivers shores perhaps two bottles of excellent french bordeaux with it too the bravemouton would go well just you look at what we wrought today sirs he went on after another yawn no matter what anyone says by comparison our boom was a whole lot bigger than theirs chapter thirtyfive w hat marvellous good fun ah ha commodore ayscough chortled as the plates dishes of removes and the tablecloth were borne away and the fruit nuts cheeses and port bottle were placed before them havent had such a run ashore in years took his pipers with him captain charlton dryly added made a fearsome racket put the french off i will gladly allow though and the extra colours proved useful borrowed a page from young lewrie here ayscough said as he used a penknife to pare an apple his father sir hugo saint george willoughby rather clean and unused mooring jacks to serve as kings colours and a few sheets of our lightest sailcloth painted to represent regimental colours so the french would think we landed three regiments stead of the equivalent of one just as we did at balabac in the far east so long ago this time commodore ayscough gaily related one set daunted a french company come from cozes that and our musketry two of them caused the fort to surrender once we flanked round its open end and when a french regiment did turn up as we were reembarking on the beaches they sat down on their heels a bit south of royan and never advanced another foot well covering fire from our ships made that stretch of road a charnel house and theyd not have charged into that capt cheatham of hms jersey added with a merry chuckle theyd been marched pillartopost already and were dragging their feet and their musketbutts by the time they arrived with their tongues lolling out haw haw colours fooled em i grant ye sir ayscough tuttutted i do imagine though twas the sight and sound of my pipers in full regalia that put em off theres not a frenchman born whod tangle with the highland laddies aye twas a grand day indeed wish i could have gone ashore lewrie faintly complained you could not laddy ayscough told him snickering there were five other postcaptains under me all competent and chafing at the bitt to take over should i fall certain they could do it better why else do we toast to a bloody war or a sickly season surest way to promotion you however were under the circumstances indispensable to your small squadron lewrie oh hogue mightve taken charge hes an energetic lad but he was round the point with his own duties whilst you and savage were the vital backbone of the entire endeavour landing the bulk of our forces the powder it would have taken hours for a small boat to carry word to hogue kenyon or bartoe and hours more to accomplish the task and withdraw in good order it just feels that command of distant others not just your own deck is like laggin back somehow sirs lewrie told them comes with seniority captain charlton imparted giving lewrie a sympathetic look in the adriatic in spent most of my time envying you and the others lewrie all i did was despatch you to a chore then sit back and fret what senior officers are paid to do mind though gentlemen thencommander lewrie kept me up nights in frets of what mischief hed been up to lately i mentioned commander kenyon the commodore said turning grave do you gentlemen not object to the discussion of a professional matter or two none good who should replace the late commander kenyon lewrie you worked closer with erato what of her first officer as a replacement in an acting command sir i spose hed do mainwell lewrie replied but lieutenant cottle is in his first posting second in command of anything hes promising but young and green gawd you call someone else young lewrie flinched inside poor trustin bastards lookin at me like an equal a senior officer with wit enough t judge me ahem both captain charlton and captain cheatham said at the same time for both men had first lieutenants aboard their ships whom they thought more than worthy of promotion onto their own bottom and independent command most such promotions on foreign stations even if both lord boxhams and commodore ayscoughs ships were officially under the authority of faroff channel fleet were accepted by admiralty and were as good as permanent lewrie found the silent interplay amusing as both turned their eyes to ayscough who would have the final say which of the two prospective lieutenants had the better record or to whom did ayscough owe more favour or interest the royal navy sailed on a sea of interest and patronage which candidate might earn him future favours damme and i have a fellow of mine own in mind ayscough craftily told them opening the silent bidding and teasing them something horrid or rearadmiral iredell lord boxham commanding over us all might wish to put a name forward in point of fact sirs commodore ayscough went on carefully cutting a long spiral of apple skin which was beginning to resemble a very loose red spring lord boxham is quite taken by commander kenyon and his brave but tragic end and the capture of the artillery intended for the pointe de grave battery he intends i believe for them to go to london for display hyde park or saint jamess was cited as well as the strand embankments in tribute he said in tribute to whom sir lewrie slyly japed why to kenyon and erato lewrie of course ayscough replied allowing sarcasm free but subtle rein the kenyon guns the erato guns something along those lines our war with france drags on with so few victories since the battle of the nile and the last time that our army took a hand it was a disaster we shove mountains of money at weak and disappointing allies and are at present without any the people at home need something to make the struggle feel worth it though ayscough sourly mused dancing the coils of his apple peel like a spring atop the table given the late commander kenyons ah peculiarities eratos guns might be best peculiarties sir capt cheatham enquired with a sharp look health was failing fast ayscough almost grunted and he was a horrid drunkard and as lewrie here gathered from erato surviving officers kenyon favoured the windward passage he concluded in a conspiratorial whisper preyed on his most fetching seamen a molly by god capt cheatham erupted looking at lewrie and poxed to the eyebrows sir lewrie related in a soft voice dyin of it mostlike in the final stages of the pox when it erodes ones brain matter thats the only explanation for how he rambled so badly and the way he was so grudgeful and nighinsubordinate towards me i did put it down to how much he drank at first aye or his spite to find one of his former mids promoted beyond him but my surgeon tells me the disease robbed him of selfcontrol think a thing speak a thing sir put him in his place a time or two and i thought hed learned his lesson but bloody hell capt cheatham spat writhing in utter disgust for the topic for the mortal bestial sin for having to hear a word of it mostlike he waved urgently for the port decanter how does a backgammoner become a commission sea officer much less gain the command of a kings ship shouldve been found out years ago he was very careful to play jack me hearty sir lewrie explained when i served under him in the west indies one would never have guessed when he had all his wits intact and could be thoughtful of his publick face the one glimpse i got that roused my suspicions could have been explained away and i was just a middy so what did i know of things no in flagrante delicto just capt cheatham raised a stiff hand to ward off the rest and to shush any graphic description he found restoration in the port was he extremely discreet and kept up a stout facade well ayscough stuck in gloomily and remember the navy was very short of competent officers in and as the fleet expanded kenyon was mostlike nighanonymous with a mediocre repute round the middle of the lieutenants list just senior enough for promotion the stress of living a life like that sirs lewrie sketched out impatient for the decanter to pass his way too then comes a ship of his own at last and the strain and loneliness of command atop it a sense of bein second but to god at sea and with his wits goin fast and losin command of himself to boot we all have known captains who turned eccentric damme lewrie you would bring up my trained circus of breadroom rats capt charlton stuck in tongue in cheek to slice through their gloom it worked such an outre statement stopped them in their tracks and made them howl with relieving laughter declaring charlton a rare rogue and starting a period of shared reveries of just how eccentric some of their old captains had seemed to them when they were midshipmen or junior lieutenants thank god the poor mans gone then cheatham said with a sad moue on his face pouring himself another topping glass when the port got round to him again and for the good of his family the navy and his repute false though it may have been he fell with his sword in hand his face to the foe and his wounds in his front hear hear ayscough and charlton chorused do i tell em lewrie asked himself unable to keep a wince off his phyz for he had conducted the seaburials for kenyon and his men and had seen on which side of his body kenyon had been pierced before they had been sewn up in canvas and tipped over the side under a flag how did he fall captain lewrie commodore ayscough enquired after seeing his pained expression oh gawd lewrie cringed tell the truth and every manjack in erato is bound for the noose lie and face a courtmartial myself commander kenyon along with a midshipman and five of his boat crew lewrie began hesitantly they stepped ashore onto the town piers right after erato came alongside them facing the towns shops and houses on the waterfront there was a company of french infantry sheltered in them and lovely young fellows were they capt cheatham sneered ah in point of fact id spose so sir lewrie stumbled at the interruption weapons in hand all that preceding the marines who shouldve been first ashore there were french musket volleys and return fire swivel guns were fired at the windows and doorways to drive the frogs to cover so the landingparty could join them there is a slight possibility that their deaths were the result of a combination of fire sirs hostile and friendly mightve charged cross the muzzle of a swivel just as it lit off accidentallylike bout the same time as some frenchmen got a few shots off too there thatll explain it lewrie told himself trying to think of what clotworthy chute had told him of how to spot a liar or how to read a card player what cuttyeyed expressions liars and the confident wore and tried to plaster the exact opposite on his face blink too much or was it no blinking at all shrug too deep eschew a sheepish smile make firm eye contact what was it truth to tell someone aboard erato maybe two or three someones had fired their swivels about the same time in the general direction of the villages buildings but had sortakind of missed and had blown the entire party off their feet all the wounds from behind and no one had cared much at all even lt cottle could not say who had done it and from the cuttyeyed way he d looked when lewrie had put it to him cottle mostlike hadnt made all that much of an effort to find out who did it and probably would not in future either now the eratos would shut their mouths as tight as oysters and shrug their collective innocence oh it was murder most foul mutiny and a deathsentence for everyone involved whether by omission or commission the ones who did it and the ones who didnt but kept mum and abetted the perpetrators for those who refused for whatever reason to investigate or those who did but wrote a lying report indeed commodore ayscough sternly commented looking leery of such an explanation making lewrie feel as if his eyes would begin to water if he kept eye contact with him very much longer you find it a tad suspicious do you lewrie yes and no sir lewrie tried to weasel out wondering where inspiration was when you really needed it oh yes one may think that eratos crew the bulk of em might have felt shamed by kenyons doings and his blatant favouritism and personal tastes yet on the other hand it could have been accidental or premeditated here we go premeditated aye lewrie felt like chortling right out loud as a thought came to him as if whispered into his ear by some perverse wee winged muse by kenyon himself sir lewrie stated what kenyon oh rot murder and dumb mutiny feature this sirs lewrie went on both hands on the table and slowly rolling his port glass between them commander kenyon was sick enough to know he was failing fast that the pox was eating him alive despite his best intentions he knew he had little command of his lusts and just enough wit left to see the reactions of his crew he was aging badly his hair and formerly handsome features going too sirs lewrie improvised wasting away to a scarecrow and i had put him on warning that if he sauced me one more time hed be charged for it and brought before a court for insubordination and there went his naval career drab as it was he wasnt fetching anymore dye see sirs ye mentioned his family captain cheatham lewrie continued far as i know he had none or if he had theyd slung him into the navy as a lad soon as he began tact on his sinful predilictions mostlike and wrote him off so the navy the officers of his past and present rank were his family and could he no longer command himself his buried secret would come out and thatd be lost to him revealed as a sodomist quietly cashiered without halfpay if not brought before a courtmartial either way hed end up beached without ten pounds to his name and hed die a miserable ravin death in bedlam or some place worse thout a shred of dignity or honour mean tsay he deliberately was the first ashore willing to be killed at the head of his men stead of capt charlton said his head cocked over to one side as if he found it hard to swallow yet with a knowing glint to his eyes boresome as our blockade work had been til now sirs lewrie said with a hapless shrug it might have been his last chance to fall a hero to go out brave and glorious while he still possessed a last few shreds of rationality for his good name sirs perhaps perhaps for the good of the service as well lewrie suggested in the old days were one not aware of his perversion oned think kenyon a hellishgood seaman a very competent officer and a fellow dedicated to the navy i learned a lot from him in truth good of the service capt charlton said in the long silence as they mulled all that over ahem commodore ayscough grumpily said over the creaking and groaning of chesterfields working hull yayss i see we will never know what was in his mind at the time if indeed it was kenyons intention to end his life or whether it was an unfortunate mistake or whether he and his pretty lads were intentionally slaughtered capt cheatham growled and the guilty aboard erato have got way with it so far sirs as our commodore related to me our casualties were extremely light given the audacity of our landings some few wounded aboard the cutters in taking the galley hardly any aboard savage or mischief and very few wounded aboard my ship chesterfield lyme or the seventyfours most of the discharged dead came among the landingparties ashore yet erato lost eight killed including a cabin steward despite never taking any serious fire from the french indeed sir most casualties occurred among the landingparties capt charlton countered quickly and eratos losses were a part of the shore parties bravely standing into the harbour of le verdon and right alongside the piers against an entrenched company of french soldiers who had to be rooted out with the bayonet and cannon fire that is very true captain charlton aye ayscough mused with a spritely grin twould be a damned shame was our victory marred by such a scurrilous suspicion as well planned as our adventure was all thanks to captain lewrie no one could possibly expect to succeed with none of our own blood shed do you agree captain cheatham well now sir cheatham huffed up taut ringers curling on the stem of his glass mean tsay should we not delve into the matter deeper put the question to the eratos people rearadmiral lord boxham must be informed ayscough went on he may wish courtmartials held which would result in eratos crew being broken up among the rest of the ships of our squadron once the guilty are sifted out and a new crew and slate of officers appointed into her ill not have any of them cheatham hotly exclaimed theres no telling what they might imagine they could get away with next time nor would i wish my worst watch officer to go into her rearadmiral iredell indeed must be informed of the possibility that kenyon and his favourites fell accidentally intentionally or by a mutinous deed of the moment capt charlton suggested but it is his decision as to what to do or whether it is his appreciation of the matter that a rough form of justice was done either way and the rot aboard her had been excised you make a good point commodore he said why mar a rare if minor victory for the good of the service it might be best did lord boxham put an officer of his choosing in command of erato put the crew on notice that theyd best be true blue hearts of oak from now on and with the chiefest cause of their grievance gone well cant believe this lewrie gawped to himself ayscough and charlton turnin a blind eye twhat amounts t murder an mutiny for thatspretty much what it was wasn t it never thought id see either of em bend the rules that far send her home lewrie said into the tenseness the heat coming off cheathams glowers what they all pretty much barked at the same time erato cant keep the sea more than four months without replenishment of stores sirs lewrie said with a shrug she needs to be victualled let lord boxham place officers into her men of his own selection whoever is her acting captain will surely be confirmed by admiralty as a commander so long as the war continues pluck cottle her first officer out and place him aboard one of the seventyfours as replacement for the lieutenant whom lord boxham names as the secondincommand thurston too in charge of her marines for theres no guilt attached to him either yet and theres no reason he should suffer then once in a home port erato can be given a refit whether shes due or not and in the interim the crew guilty or innocent or merely suspect can be reassigned to other ships in the channel fleet even if it was kenyons intention to die by the enemys hands he quickly added and no ones guilty the scattering of her peopled draw no unwanted notice sirs happens all the time captain cheatham of jersey still looked sour but he did nod his head in sullen agreement while ayscough and charlton immediately looked relieved taking lewries scheme as a sensible suggestion well we must leave the details of it to lord boxham agreed gentlemen ayscough asked a toast then fill your glasses damme the ports almost gone and well need another bottle soon heres to the memory of commander james kenyon a fallen hero rather sir if i may lewrie stuck in perhaps the memory of commander kenyon might be uhm best soon forgotten oh quite lord yes commodore ayscough said with a cynical laugh all topped up gentlemen then heres to the late commander kenyon and the erato guns they all drank their glasses dry reflective of a ritual empty of real sentiment and an uneasy silence fell over the greatcabins dye think hogue will keep his prize sir lewrie dared ask or is she not good prize marvellous prize ayscough bellowed gleefully by the time mischief was alongside her not a shot fired mind her master and crew had gone over the side and rowed for talmont like the very devil was at their heels only people left aboard were a halfdrunk ships boy and a onelegged cook and both of em swearing they were danish but all they could speak was dutch ha ha her master left so quickly he abandoned her three sets of papers so he was surely up to something beyond smuggling wine and brandy to rotterdam bungfull of bordeaux lewrie capt charlton confided with joy casks and kegs and crated bottles of it shes bound for england not lisbon wine to portgual like carrying coal to newcastle wouldnt fetch a shilling to the pound in lisbon but landed in england shes worth thousands ayscough heartily agreed lucky dog hogue his fortunes made and no master or ship owner to sue for her return abandoned salvaged must he claim so ha ha and in the merchant service of the batavian republic a french ally something to cheer sir lewrie posed with a smile punch sir for you make a fmeun even if well all feel like the wrath o god in the mornin he told himself but they needed some good cheer they had a victory to celebrate a punch by god yes give me the punchladle ill fathom the bowl lewrie sang right out pounding his fists and swaying from side to side now from france we get brandy from jamaica good rum sweet oranges and apples from portugal come add the good old hard cider that england controls give me the punchladle ill fathom the bowl even capt cheatham joined in the chorus getting into the spirit of things as their spirits and flavourings were being mixed and the hot water was fetched and they all swayed as they loudly sang along ill fathom the bowl ill fathom the bowl give me the punchladle ill fathom the bowl epilogue on the most exalted throne in the world nothing but our arse michel de montaigne chapter thirtysix the early afternoon was overcast and cold requiring lewrie to button the lapels of his uniform coat doubled over to trap what little warmth he had and huddle inside the folds of his voluminous and heavy boat cloak with the collar turned up to the base of his cocked hat so the light but cutting wind along the strand didnt freeze his ears off as he along with his barrister mr andrew macdougall his clerk sadler and his brotherinlaw burgess chiswick paused in their stroll from whitefriars street to a chophouse in savoy street near the thames normally the walk was not all that difficult but for the fact that it was two days before christmas and the strand the finest shopping district in the civilised world was infested with hordes of people out to obtain their turkey their ham or goose new suitings and gowns ordered weeks before in which to preen at routs drums balls holiday athomes and divine services children by the thousands noses and gloved fingertips pressed to large bay windows of stores to drool over the toys displayed were underfoot as thick as roaches round a buttertub hopping skipping shrieking and tittering in boundless expectations and when their parents werent looking practicing icesliding on the sidewalks where old snow had melted then frozen overnight to a delightful slickness some imps without parental supervision the usual street urchins also practiced their aim with snowballs at the odd passerby and all their parties coats bore white smudges from successful hits though lewrie macdougall burgess and sadler had given as well they got rich titled working class the working or idle poor criminal and honest all were out looking for presents alighting from coaches embarking into coaches walking afoot as densely crowded as corn rows and could not help but jostle each other now and then which was just toppingfine for the pickpockets and snatchers aha there they are sirs sadler cried clapping his mittened hands together as they paused before somerset house where crowds briefly gathered children mostlyto gawp at the erato guns parents stood by impatiently for the most part allowing their offspring a brief edifying and patriotic experience before dragging them off so they could be about their errands and giftbuying there was a temporary wooden plaque a brace of soldiers to guard the cannon but that didnt stop young lads from crawling all over them so thoroughly that not a speck of new snow remained atop the barrels or truckcarriages as they peeked down the untompioned muzzles pretended that they were loading and firing them and competing in which lad could go boom bang or pow the loudest while impatient governesses or dads tapped their toes let us see them sadler pled his employer dashing across the street to paw them over and marvel for a moment or two seen em lewrie laconically said seen odder in inja burgess said chuckling just clappedout old naval pieces sure tburst with a proper charge down the bores lewrie added feeling hungry an outstanding feat of arms een so captain lewrie thanks to you mr macdougall congratulated his own eyes alight though he would not lower his dignity to go cross the street and gawk though you do not receive your proper credit for their taking were i an officer in the navy id sue commodore ayscough had been right their victory in the gironde minor though it was had been blown all out of proportion in the papers the marine chronicle the times the gazette had printed the official report released by the admiralty writ large on their front pages as if it was as grand a triumph as the glorious first of june the battle of cape st vincent camperdown or the nile and ayscoughs canny prediction of how such news could enthuse the populace had proven true as well after seven years of unending war new and higher taxes on a whole host of new items the scandal of paper fiat money soaring costs for just about everything a couple of lean crops and a dearth of good news from overseas britain needed cheering news and the bulk of them had pounced upon it as eagerly as they would their christmas gifts unfortunately for lewrie though who needed a deed to bolster his own odour with potential jurors the papers had taken lord boxhams account as the seniormost officer involved and lewries name was mentioned in that report just once in connexion with delivering marines and armed sailors from lord boxhams ships under command of his officers to take the battery with the brief assistance of cannon fire hms savage capt a lewrie provided brisk fire upon the battery until our parties were ashore and well engaged a career ender that mister macdougall lewrie said with a wry laugh doesnt matter really other senior officers sent their reports to admiralty so they know who authored the plan besides if such a suit were possible i doubt i could afford it and do i call a titled rearadmiral a liar in public itd be more a cause to duel than go to court i only hope that some artist paints them before theyre taken from public view mr sadler bemoaned once he rejoined them feeling very patriotic at the moment even a coloured woodcut print wont that anger bonaparte over in paris does he see a copy ha ha english lads capering all over his precious artillery huzzah sadler exclaimed enthusiastically peering at the captured pieces as if he wished to paint them forever in his mind thumb in his eye mister sadler thumb in his bloody eye mr macdougall cackled in like joy well shall we go on sirs i must own to feeling more than a tad peckish and the chophouse awaits they continued their walk reaching the crossing of bow street and onwards towards cecil street and fountain court nearing savoy palace but even before reaching the chophouse the aroma of food and cookfires wafted off the thames forcing sadler and lewrie to hasten their steps towards the river the piers and the landing stages frost fair sir mr sadler gaily declared the ice is not so thick as i recall when i was a lad but the frost fair will likely go on forever just like england is it not sirs a delightful tradition of an english christmas there before them below the edge of the empty quay the thames was frozen over from one bank to the other thick enough for carriages and sleighs to cross it avoiding the toll for london bridge ruining the lord mayors christmas pedestrians plodded carefully over thick ice or practiced their icesliding games too adults as well as children along with the wonderful scents from the many cooking booths or gaily coloured pavilions the light cold breeze brought them sounds of music of cranked hurdygurdies brass bands of shrieking children and the snorts of pitponies put to work as rides the jinglejangle of belled harnesses and reins from the onehorse sleighs and a happy hummumm from the thousands of shoppers and celebrants the precarious dancers who dared some sawdusted places all celebrating a delightful london tradition time out of mind which would you prefer mister sadler lewrie asked the weedy little scribbler a chophouse feast or a stroll through the frost fair perhaps a sleigh ride and something meatish on a skewer like as not burned to charcoal no thankee burgess demurred laughing been to inja as i said and eaten more than my share of dubious frost fair spread out wide before his eyes was a carnival a circus a series of epic snowball fights and impromptu football matches even one criquet game in which the players spent more time on the flat of their backs than upright and the ball could skitter half a mile or more on a good pitch and lewries eyes lit up with youthful joy as he considered spending the rest of the day down there for hed had little reason for holiday cheer so far his appearance before kings bench was firmly set in the first week of hilary term just after epiphany sunday and with the date at last known admiralty had decided that a wellfound fifth rate frigate such as savage could not sit idle in port awaiting his return to her if things went his way which admiralty obviously doubted so they had sent orders down to portsmouth that he was to be relieved of command and another postcaptain sent into her so lewrie was for the first time since beached and on halfpay and odds were even were he most honourably acquitted there would most likely not be a welcome return to hms savage and the circle of officers warrants petty officers and hands hed come to know so well his solid support was now trimmed to aspinall his cook and manservant coxn liam desmond and his mate patrick furfy and the cats once beached lewrie feared there might not ever be another seagoing command it would be easy enough for admiralty to look past him let him slowly climb in seniority on the postcaptains list pay him the portion of halfpay and allow his taint slowly evaporate as a bad memory like a fool or cripple whod been yellow squadroned oh when hed delivered all his accounts to admiralty people there had been polite and civil not even brusque with him at all though there had been a few cooling their heels in the waiting room who had glared at him most officers and civil servants once theyd either recognised him or learned his name had gone shy and cuttyeyed as if they really wished to cry my god youre tkatunl or turned so bland and distracted by other things that they might as well have given him the cut direct some had seemed genuinely sympathetic those who approved of his slave stealing but some made coweyes to his face and troweled it on much too thick pissing down his back til out of his sight so they might snigger over his predicament and lewrie could not decide which half galled him the most he felt a raging need to hop down the nearest landing stairs and go do something innocent silly and mindless go cut capers on the ice and plaster people with snowballs chat up just anyone even toothless harridans from wapping or billingsgate circus cross the river there burgess said at his elbow in a soft voice wigmores peripatetic extravaganza theyve set up their winter quarters in southwark near vauxhall gardens peripatetic lewrie scoffed hes found a dictionary was travelling no longer good enough doing a grand business im told burgess said shrugging his shoulders mostlike to warm himself than anything else gentlemen my feet are freezing mr macdougall griped shivering and punctuating his statement with an actual brrr we need to thaw out in front of a roaring fireplace at the chophouse no chance well run into the beaumans there is there lewrie asked as he reluctantly turned away from the river after a final peek cross the thames to see if he could espy anything exotic or circusy if he couldnt make a fool of himself at the frost fair then dinner in a warm place would have to do so long as the said warm place came with lashings of drink and yes at the moment images of hot punch or mugs of mulled wine laced with spices and halfaboil from the insertion of a redhot fire poker would suit as would hot chocolate heavily laden with sugar and rum lord no alan burgess hooted as they resumed their brisk pace into savoy street your father and mister twigg have seen to that the last i heard the beaumans had been hounded far out past islington ran out of london lodgings months ago lord what have they done lewrie wondered aloud there are few hoteliers or lessors who want loud mobs in their streets day and night rocks through the window glass pamphlets put up gainst their doors damning them as allies of slavers heaps of horse dung piled on their stoops people of the quality barging in at all hours denouncing them and running off their other renters your father reckons that even the worst lodgings cost them four or five times the going rate for the annoyance and to cover damages their black bodyservants absconded macdougall added cackling in glee members of the abolitionist society made known to them that slavery doesnt exist in england and that the beaumans hadnt any claim over them they took leg hail just weeks after your appearance in court and have found paying employment hugh beauman and his regal young wife are now reduced to the very dregs of servants who as soon as theyre told how rich the beaumans are and how beastly can demand triple wages and odd it is alan burgess gleefully told him as they neared the chophouses doors how so many of them who will take their wages and abide their brute ways come from mister twiggs people struth theres more than bodyguards and bullybucks in twiggs employ servants hear and see everything dont ye know hellishgood thing for the nation to have ears and eyes working for foreigners who mean our country harm or keeping an eye on devils in human guise london became too hot for them macdougall said as he opened the heavy oak door even mplain clothing and disguises every time they ventured out here came a shower of shit and garbage think of it no galleries no shopping no theatre drury lane the haymarket covent garden a coffeehouse all denied them i could almost pity them almost mind that they could not obtain a decent meal such as we do now ha ha good afternoon mister sloane a table by a fire he cried to the proprietor just as lewrie was about to enter though a snowball smashed into the back of his cocked hat knocking it off his head and he spun about looking for the culprit ready to scoop up a slushy handful and retaliate with a wellpacked icy stinger of his own damn my eyes thats he gawped no couldnt be he got a glimpse of a young woman in a furtrimmed green cloak a hint of ravencoloured hair under the hood before whoever it was disappeared round the corner of a building into the busy strand for just a fleeting second he wondered if it had been eudoxia durschenko no couldn t be her he told himself as he entered the doors to hand over his hat cloak and sword belt to a servant though whoever had hit him had done it square right in the centre of the upturned back of his hat and eudoxia had been raised to be a crack shot with a firearm or her recurved asian bow circus cross the thames we were talkin of it and any impish young miss with dark hair id take for eudoxia coincidence besides hurt as she was in cape town when she found i was married id more expect an arrow tween my shoulder blades macdougall was an enthusiastic regular once he had discovered a new place to dine and evidently had given this new chophouse quite a lot of his custom the last few months or so and in his line of work brought people he represented as well who mostlike became regulars too assuming they hadnt been hung or imprisoned that explained the grand table they were given right by one of the fireplaces that was stoked and drawing so well that waves of heat could be seen coming from it in airy ripples and air could be heard whooshing in the flue it was almost medieval with all the brass and dark polished oak walls the overhead beams and stout tables and chairs lewrie unbuttoned his coat lapels before sitting down away from the waves of heat some things could be overdone and he didnt wish to be one of them by the time they had fed hot drinks all round macdougall heartily suggested mulled wine or hot cider punch or candled brandy mulled wine for me lewrie declared as did burgess sadler went for chocolate and brandy obviously a man with a sweet tooth now before we order captain lewrie i must tell you my good news macdougall said with a cherubic impish smile worthy of a puck and rubbing his chilled hands together in joy we now possess all the affidavits and depositions necessary for your defence sir including a letter from your old friend former leftenantcolonel cashman now of wilmington north or south carolina i can never keep which is which straight stating that your black volunteers intended to run away to sea as true volunteers along with a dreadful account of how harsh were their lives had they not since he was a rueful slaveowner for a time himself his account is most emotional and compelling i intend to have it read just before putting your surviving black sailors up to testify so they may expand upon cashmans then youd better grow wings or learn tswim like a seal if thats yer intent mister macdougall lewrie all but yelped im no longer in command and savage has a new captain for all i know she may have already completed restoring and sailed for god knows where hmm thatll never do macdougall fussily prosed on once hed gotten his lower jaw back in place from a ghastlylooking gasp good god above well has she departed well simply have to get her back thats all there is to it ill have a word with admiralty get twigg to toddle over there and use his influence failing that the lack of live witnesses could be grounds for a continuance til their return what lewrie barked astonished mean tsay i could wait months til next hilary term tget this settled is she ordered halfway round the world it might he years fore shes back you silly bloody civilian sod lewrie silently fumed i knew ye sounded too good tbe true ye tomnoddy just trot over and ask admiralty t whistle up a frigate im good as hung swingin and danglin dontye know theres a war on ye ignorant gawd alan has allies in commons and lords burgess said with a hopeful sound somewhat akin to whistling past a graveyard to lewries ears a bit of pressure from politicians might help exactly so sir macdougall rejoined sounding like a fellow clutching straws too wilberforce and his people as well who are in both houses of parliament may employ their interest and patronage links with the navy they must be oh what is the military term for it mister chiswick mustered sir burgess eagerly supplied lashed aloft lewrie sourly muttered under his breath after he had gotten his breath back mustered exactly macdougall perked up as though this snag was but a minor quibble soon to be amended ah our drinks are here i dare say though that foul as the weather has been there is a good possibility that captain lewries ship former ship is still tied up in port civilians lewrie fumed some more aghast at the fellows lack of knowledge and wondering did the beaumans prevail could he have a quiet minute alone with the man so he could strangle him to death he must think we dont go tsea in snowstorms when its too cold or wet even without captain lewries black sailors there are the former bodyservants of the beaumans macdougall blathered on after he had taken a sip or two of his hot brandylaced cider they can tell the court horrific tales of how badly they were treated why with any luck they might have known some of the volunteers themselves if they ever visited that particular beauman plantation on portland bight and may speak for them and their motives in stealing themselves and seeking freedom in the royal navy uhm now burgess was doubtful and was about to explain the vast gulf twixt house slaves and field slaves and the prejudices the welldressed wellfed and lightly worked house servants held about their darker more helpless kind burgess matched eyes with lewrie a fellow who had also seen real slavery in action the arrival of a man in a blue apron and the houses unofficial livery with the slate menu bearing chalkedin specials interrupted him oh good macdougall exclaimed chearly they have both the venison and the jugged hare today capital lewrie felt like lowering his head to the tabletop and banging away til he knocked himself temporarily senseless that or the urge to spend the rest of the day and the evening amassing a ragingly good drunk uhm perhaps a dab of haste might be ah lewrie hinted oh right sorry mister sadler but i will make it up to you do return to the office and write out a special plea for those members of captain lewries crew to be kept handy for their appearance before the lord justice macdougall instructed turning very businesslike we have the names and ranks already from the depositions and witness list copy to admiralty copy to lord justice oglethorpe and a copy to mister twigg fast horse to portsmouth with the orders to stay in port as soon as you receive them mind twigg will be grand help in that yes sir mr sadler said with a resigned sigh then finished his hot drink wiped the cocoa froth from his upper lip and arose to reclaim his hat and greatcoat and gloves even if she sails twill be the fault of the admiralty that i cannot present my complete defence macdougall gaily said and solid proof will be at hand that the lord justice issued an order for her to be held a continuance will naturally be granted instanter now how does the turtle soup all round sound to you sirs scuse me sir another waiter intruded as the first began to scribble their desires youd be bein a captain lewrie sir lady said tgive ye this sir a lady lewrie found new cause to gawp aloud as he spun about on his chair and craned his neck to see who the lady in question was all he could see in the chophouses crowded tables though were men and only the rare matron dining with her husband he took the note and opened it careful to act nonchalant and not let either burgess or his barrister get a peek at it over his shoulder the first couple of lines though were written in some incomprehensible script that put him in mind of his equally unfathomable lessons in greek long ago for all he knew it could be a bill from some foreigners laundry service whered hed left a bundle years before and had never returned to reclaim or pay for yet poor darling man i lern of trile to com for taken black felloes to mak them free and am so angre they trect yoo so bad lern too yoo are alone now i forgive yoo for break my heart holy shit he thought stunned it was eudoxia who clobbered me i think much of yoo all time since yoo sail away to fite french i miss yoor company and never we go shooting or hav outside dinner race horses ilk we say we do sum day in africa time i see yoo last i say something in cyrillic in yoor leters is

pray for yoo and be in cort is trile begin eudoxia a lady hey burgess enquired trying not to sound too eager to know who it was from hed been in the middle of the lather tween lewrie and his sister caroline since getting back from india and any new dalliance would only make things worse not that things were anywhere near good already an admirer who wishes me well in court burgess lewrie lied folding over the note again and slipping it into a coat pocket not before the final line hed first missed caught his eye i hit with snoball good yes and did the lady request a reply lewrie asked the waiter who still hovered expectantly nossir the man said jus popped in long nough tpoint ye out and gimme th note thankee for deliverin it lewrie told him digging into his breeches pocket for his coin purse and giving the fellow a crown coin he turned his full attention pointedly so to the other waiter who held the slate menu roast venison and jugged hare did ye say that does sound toothsome turtle soup for me as well tbegin with seeing it is christmastime id admire a bit of your goose with the raspberry jam sauce somewhere along the way a salad between of course right very good sir what lewrie all but yelped once he looked up to his partners at the table who were both eying him rather charily at that point a fellow cant have supporters and admirers in your absence captain lewrie macdougall sternly said with several slow negative shakes of his head mister twigg your father sir hugo and major chiswick here have adverted to me that your relations with your wife are strained and they had confided to me the reasons why dye see sir as your legal representative in a serious matter it is my professional advice to you captain lewrie that such doings must be kept strictly in check and the reverend wilberforce and other supporters of yours who are so far true admirers of yours must not hear of any new escapades so long as your trial continues else they will withdraw all support publicity tracts favourable letters to the papers and monetary aid placing the financial burden of your defence upon your own purse ye mean they havent heard already lewrie gawped finding it hard to believe that his fathers formerly bad repute would not be enough to put them right off and the acorn dont fall far from the oak and all that nonsense surely twigg must have filled them in somewhere along the line he could not help thinking you are sir or so i have led them to believe with what little i have had to reveal macdougall most carefully said a victim of a jealous termagant oh i say burgess disputed in defence of his sister a colonial loyalist from the carolinas macdougall prosed on his voice low and frowning heavily to show that it wasnt personal as if he disagreed with a disagreeable charade three children enough in her mind and yet jealous in the extreme and the long separation demanded by your service to king and country hasnt helped her suspicions those anonymous letters complete fabrications have driven her to distraction and you have been estranged from your wife almost since the war with france began primly moral the members of the abolitionist society and the clapham sect may be but they are also realists at bottom and know as ministers of the gospel surely must the limits of a mans resistance to temptations of the flesh they also know that such temporary dalliances ones which dont result in rival affairs of the heart and the rending of families are sometimes unavoidable as evinced by men of the upper class who take mistresses to spare their wives the perils of further childbirth deplorable but sometimes necessary dye see i can fuck but i better not kiss on the way out the door lewrie thought in puzzlement the ministers tolerate prostitution mine arse on a bandbox missed that wheedle in the good book im fine as a martyr to the cause of abolition ye mean just shiny enough tbe their paladin lewrie rephrased it most cynically so long as i dont blot my copy book before the trial uhm that is pretty much it sir macdougall confessed so it would redound to your vast discredit should you ah dally with anyone so long as your legal proceedings last else they throw me to the lions wash their hands like pontius pilate lewrie pressed hustle me to the gallows themselves rapidly macdougall assured him with all gravity i spose i can go out in publick though can i not see some plays dine lewrie asked trying to sound casual and innocent as the driven snow outside which in point of fact was turning into a grey slush from all the coal smoke and fly ash from the umpteen thousand chimneys in london go see the circus or oh a very bad idea alan burgess quickly cautioned wincing for he knew exactly whom lewrie might run into he had met met the lovely lithe eudoxia in cape town actresses and circus persons would be a real scandal better you take in the citys entertainments with reverend wilberforce a pack of eunuchs dye know where tfind some lewrie quipped this side of the ottoman empire or a venetian castrati choir they peered at him like a brace of buzzards eyes flintyhard well youre right both of you lewrie finally answered i see the risk and i thank you for your sound advice still he thought with mental fingers crossed they didnt ask me to swear an oath my trial gets carried over a continuance did macdougall call it itll be a long boresome winter and a spring too me ashore where i always get in trouble idle hands the devils workshop all that no wife no visits home no seein the children til theyre back at their school no homemade christmas pudding would there be all that much harm if i saw the circus again their new shows he seriously considered that eudoxias father arslan artimovich still had his daggers and his spinecracking whip and his lion cubs might now have grown so large that they could be sicced on him to drag him down and maul him to death yet she did need help with her spelling i worry about you alan i really do burgess told him so do i burgess lewrie ruefully rejoined so do i afterword the criminal justice system of georgian england was much like a description of most peoples lives in those times or of a winters day nasty brutish and short lawyers could double in brass first for the defence then for the prosecution at their next trial fears of the star chamber procedures where people were accused but never met their accusers facetoface never were told the charges against them til they were dragged into that infamous courtroom held incommunicado and tried in secret no sunshine laws then with no access to capable legal counsel and executed the next day or so kept england from developing a permanent standing district attorney system for quite a long time witnesses and accusers still could not be crossexamined at the time of lewries proceedings and the accused could not testify for himself but merely beg for mercy if the verdict went against him so id like to thank john kitch attorneyatlaw here in nashville for enlightening me on the deadly maze of justice as it was practiced in the late s and early s believe it or not he did it for free quite unlike some learned and tenured law professors at one of our prestigious universities which shall remain nameless three syllables rhymes with wilt who i was cautioned would charge for their information by the billable hour fifteen minutes equals an hour like i had staggered into a house and killed all eleven people inside just because they were home or needed another divorce reference books to order and keep forever as is my wont on how english common law was practiced in court in those days are scarce as hens teeth as we say down here in the south though albions fatal tree by hay linebaugh rule thompson and winslow pantheon books was helpful even if it dealt more with capital punishment than court procedures as was a chapter in what jane austen ate and charles dickens knew by daniel pool simon amp schuster other than that even the everhelpful folks at daviskidd bookstores shrugged like turkish rug merchants and went ah dunno after doing books in print searches for me if someone out there knows of a better source get in touch with me for i fear that alan lewries legal troubles are not yet over and he might end up in one of those hundredyear cases in chancery i bludgeoned my editor at thomas dunne books john parsley to include a map of the mouth of the gironde and the southwestern coast of france this time more like begged and pleaded really so readers could flip to it and mutter every now and then when a placename was mentioned so far as i know there were no forts or batteries erected at the narrows of the gironde during the french revolution or the napoleonic wars though had been napoleon bonaparte i would have insisted upon them fitted with bloodygreat pounders to boot medoc saintonge and aquitaine are rather flat much like the carolinas and georgias low country as lewrie pointed out and its a great pity no one every really goes there not even the french when it comes to vacation or holiday time most frenchmen and frenchwomen head for the mediterranean to provence and the southeast coast the cote dazur from toulon to nice even if the beaches are gritty and gravelly the rentals and hotel rates are astronomical and the sea is as oily as the houston ship channel perhaps light sweet crude and diesel fuel saves on suntan lotion the whole stretch of coast from rochefort to the spanish border where lewrie blockaded could be a european myrtle beach sadly there is only one touristy development mentioned in my guide book an ultramodern sort of lowrent disneyland by the small town of la palmyre it was mentioned in the novel so flip back to the map at this point find it and go huhh and aint this educational its on the north bank above royan flip back to the map again all in all even the guide book doesnt call southwest france all that picturesque and quaint but then neither are beaufort north carolina or the dunes at hatteras unless you delight in places like ye olde shipwreck tavern come on in get wrecked which i do and have the teeshirt to prove it the chateaux of the region though do produce some of the finest wines in the world and give testing tours like the napa valley and do you see a sign that reads degustation it does not mean throw up here but means you can go into a local restaurant or tavern and sample local wines by the glass well maybe it does mean throw up here if you stay long enough commander james kenyon and his secret life well sir winston churchill once quipped that life in the royal navy was in the bad old days nothing but rum sodomy and the lash if you thought that gay men these days have it rough most of them preferring to stay in the closet to avoid trouble consider what it was like in being found out caught in the act could result in being put in the stocks outdoors in all weathers subject to the abuse rocks rotten fruit and vegetables of passersby and could result in death some could after release from the stocks be branded and marked forevermore much like a thief which resulted in a much slower deathsentence of shunning unemployment being hounded from one parish to the next and ultimate starvation in the royal navy the punishment decreed in the articles of war was indeed draconian youre caught you hang oddly though life in the royal navy for common seamen was like the aforementioned winters day nasty brutish and short as well desertion rates were so high that sailors were not trusted off of their ships with shore liberty very often instead after six months or so at sea bumboatmen rowed out to ships put out of discipline fetching shoddy goods smuggling rum and gin and renting out whores for as long as a sailor could afford to keep her on his rations and rum issue his temporary wife hence a wife in every port and the mess decks became the scene of drunken orgies with coupling tween the guncarriages with some blankets hung from the overhead for privacy so be careful when you call someone a real son of a gun for thats what the bastards resulting were called obviously keeping up to eight hundred men aboard a third rate ship of the line from a good drunk a run ashore a chance to put the leg over a girl in a real bed not a hammock in privacy was unnatural causing desperation and its just for now sodomy and buggery much like the temporary homosexuality found in prisons today during world war ii many us navy ships in the pacific in constant active service of two or three years duration with only quick port calls for fuel ammo victuals and new movies perhaps an afternoon on an island beach with two beers and some ball equipment called liberty were rumoured to have developed daisy chains belowdecks much like prisons indeed and the old navy term of pogey bait equalled the modernday bunk punk a young lad who must yield or get hurt real bad by older harder men equally obvious is the fact that only a tiny minority of sailors submitted took part or developed a taste for such doings for most of them were righteously heterosexual and had been raised in those more strictly religious times to think it a mortal sin yet there would always be some who until they were pressed into the navy leaned that direction and found one or two fellows of their persuasion aboard any warship no matter the dire punishment if discovered there is also something else working in such situations as it does in prisons today harsh conditions make harsh men of the survivors some might have developed a taste for the sense of power and control over the weak meek and obedient whatever the reason sodomy in those days was always a worry for officers to stamp out but when its one of the officers who is homosexual as i write this in late october masterpiece theatre on pbs is running william goldings to the ends of the earth from his trilogy of the same name and the very first episode deals with the death of a parson who might have been weak certainly naive who dared go into the focsle to preach the gospel but ended up drunk and sodomised by some of the sailors and one of the officers aboard was there to witness it and possibly urged them on resulting in his dying from the shame was he a willing participant or not blame the victim as a secret molly he brought it on himself and get out the brooms to whisk it out of sight and out of mind ive always felt a sympathy for james kenyon from the first two lewrie novels in which he appeared shoved off to sea by his family to make a man of him then dismissed from their cares banking his life in a naval career at which hes rather good yet tiptoeing in dread of being found out and having to play the hairychested upright man the bluff jack mehearty expected of a sea officer and tarpaulin man everyone in the eighteenth century was twofaced one projected ones public face a carefully crafted creation that pleased society and a private face when the shoes were kicked off the neckstock undone and one could cuss spit and belch there was an odd character named col hanger a british army officer who sometimes wore his uniform sometimes civilian suitings and sometimes ladies dresses and hats make fun of him and hed challenge you to a duel and mostlike slice you into ribbons he as a
