the devil in the belfry by edgar allan poe everybody knows in a general way that the finest place in the world isor alas wasthe dutch borough of vondervotteimittiss yet as it lies some distance from any of the main roads being in a somewhat outoftheway situation there are perhaps very few of my readers who have ever paid it a visit for the benefit of those who have not therefore it will be only proper that i should enter into some account of it and this is indeed the more necessary as with the hope of enlisting public sympathy in behalf of the inhabitants i design here to give a history of the calamitous events which have so lately occurred within its limits no one who knows me will doubt that the duty thus selfimposed will be executed to the best of my ability with all that rigid impartiality all that cautious examination into facts and diligent collation of authorities which should ever distinguish him who aspires to the title of historian by the united aid of medals manuscripts and inscriptions i am enabled to say positively that the borough of vondervotteimittiss has existed from its origin in precisely the same condition which it at present preserves of the date of this origin however i grieve that i can only speak with that species of indefinite definiteness which mathematicians are at times forced to put up with in certain algebraic formulae the date i may thus say in regard to the remoteness of its antiquity cannot be less than any assignable quantity whatsoever touching the derivation of the name vondervotteimittiss i confess myself with sorrow equally at fault among a multitude of opinions upon this delicate pointsome acute some learned some sufficiently the reversei am able to select nothing which ought to be considered satisfactory perhaps the idea of grogswigg nearly coincident with that of kroutaplentteyis to be cautiously preferredit runsvondervotteimittisvonder lege dondervotteimittis quasi und bleitzizbleitziz obsolpro blitzen this derivative to say the truth is still countenanced by some traces of the electric fluid evident on the summit of the steeple of the house of the towncouncil i do not choose however to commit myself on a theme of such importance and must refer the reader desirous of information to the oratiunculae de rebus praeterveteris of dundergutz see also blunderbuzzard de derivationibus pp to folio gothic edit red and black character catchword and no cypher wherein consult also marginal notes in the autograph of stuffundpuff with the subcommentaries of gruntundguzzell notwithstanding the obscurity which thus envelops the date of the foundation of vondervotteimittis and the derivation of its name there can be no doubt as i said before that it has always existed as we find it at this epoch the oldest man in the borough can remember not the slightest difference in the appearance of any portion of it and indeed the very suggestion of such a possibility is considered an insult the site of the village is in a perfectly circular valley about a quarter of a mile in circumference and entirely surrounded by gentle hills over whose summit the people have never yet ventured to pass for this they assign the very good reason that they do not believe there is anything at all on the other side round the skirts of the valley which is quite level and paved throughout with flat tiles extends a continuous row of sixty little houses these having their backs on the hills must look of course to the centre of the plain which is just sixty yards from the front door of each dwelling every house has a small garden before it with a circular path a sundial and twentyfour cabbages the buildings themselves are so precisely alike that one can in no manner be distinguished from the other owing to the vast antiquity the style of architecture is somewhat odd but it is not for that reason the less strikingly picturesque they are fashioned of hardburned little bricks red with black ends so that the walls look like a chessboard upon a great scale the gables are turned to the front and there are cornices as big as all the rest of the house over the eaves and over the main doors the windows are narrow and deep with very tiny panes and a great deal of sash on the roof is a vast quantity of tiles with long curly ears the woodwork throughout is of a dark hue and there is much carving about it with but a trifling variety of pattern for time out of mind the carvers of vondervotteimittiss have never been able to carve more than two objectsa timepiece and a cabbage but these they do exceedingly well and intersperse them with singular ingenuity wherever they find room for the chisel the dwellings are as much alike inside as out and the furniture is all upon one plan the floors are of square tiles the chairs and tables of blacklooking wood with thin crooked legs and puppy feet the mantelpieces are wide and high and have not only timepieces and cabbages sculptured over the front but a real timepiece which makes a prodigious ticking on the top in the middle with a flowerpot containing a cabbage standing on each extremity by way of outrider between each cabbage and the timepiece again is a little china man having a large stomach with a great round hole in it through which is seen the dialplate of a watch the fireplaces are large and deep with fierce crookedlooking firedogs there is constantly a rousing fire and a huge pot over it full of sauerkraut and pork to which the good woman of the house is always busy in attending she is a little fat old lady with blue eyes and a red face and wears a huge cap like a sugarloaf ornamented with purple and yellow ribbons her dress is of orangecolored linseywoolsey made very full behind and very short in the waistand indeed very short in other respects not reaching below the middle of her leg this is somewhat thick and so are her ankles but she has a fine pair of green stockings to cover them her shoesof pink leatherare fastened each with a bunch of yellow ribbons puckered up in the shape of a cabbage in her left hand she has a little heavy dutch watch in her right she wields a ladle for the sauerkraut and pork by her side there stands a fat tabby cat with a gilt toyrepeater tied to its tail which the boys have there fastened by way of a quiz the boys themselves are all three of them in the garden attending the pig they are each two feet in height they have threecornered cocked hats purple waistcoats reaching down to their thighs buckskin kneebreeches red stockings heavy shoes with big silver buckles long surtout coats with large buttons of motherofpearl each too has a pipe in his mouth and a little dumpy watch in his right hand he takes a puff and a look and then a look and a puff the pigwhich is corpulent and lazyis occupied now in picking up the stray leaves that fall from the cabbages and now in giving a kick behind at the gilt repeater which the urchins have also tied to his tail in order to make him look as handsome as the cat right at the front door in a highbacked leatherbottomed armed chair with crooked legs and puppy feet like the tables is seated the old man of the house himself he is an exceedingly puffy little old gentleman with big circular eyes and a huge double chin his dress resembles that of the boysand i need say nothing farther about it all the difference is that his pipe is somewhat bigger than theirs and he can make a greater smoke like them he has a watch but he carries his watch in his pocket to say the truth he has something of more importance than a watch to attend toand what that is i shall presently explain he sits with his right leg upon his left knee wears a grave countenance and always keeps one of his eyes at least resolutely bent upon a certain remarkable object in the centre of the plain this object is situated in the steeple of the house of the town council the town council are all very little round oily intelligent men with big saucer eyes and fat double chins and have their coats much longer and their shoebuckles much bigger than the ordinary inhabitants of vondervotteimittiss since my sojourn in the borough they have had several special meetings and have adopted these three important resolutions that it is wrong to alter the good old course of things that there is nothing tolerable out of vondervotteimittiss and that we will stick by our clocks and our cabbages above the sessionroom of the council is the steeple and in the steeple is the belfry where exists and has existed time out of mind the pride and wonder of the villagethe great clock of the borough of vondervotteimittiss and this is the object to which the eyes of the old gentlemen are turned who sit in the leatherbottomed armchairs the great clock has seven facesone in each of the seven sides of the steepleso that it can be readily seen from all quarters its faces are large and white and its hands heavy and black there is a belfryman whose sole duty is to attend to it but this duty is the most perfect of sinecuresfor the clock of vondervotteimittis was never yet known to have anything the matter with it until lately the bare supposition of such a thing was considered heretical from the remotest period of antiquity to which the archives have reference the hours have been regularly struck by the big bell and indeed the case was just the same with all the other clocks and watches in the borough never was such a place for keeping the true time when the large clapper thought proper to say twelve oclock all its obedient followers opened their throats simultaneously and responded like a very echo in short the good burghers were fond of their sauerkraut but then they were proud of their clocks all people who hold sinecure offices are held in more or less respect and as the belfryman of vondervotteimittiss has the most perfect of sinecures he is the most perfectly respected of any man in the world he is the chief dignitary of the borough and the very pigs look up to him with a sentiment of reverence his coattail is very far longerhis pipe his shoebuckles his eyes and his stomach very far biggerthan those of any other old gentleman in the village and as to his chin it is not only double but triple i have thus painted the happy estate of vondervotteimittiss alas that so fair a picture should ever experience a reverse there has been long a saying among the wisest inhabitants that no good can come from over the hills and it really seemed that the words had in them something of the spirit of prophecy it wanted five minutes of noon on the day before yesterday when there appeared a very oddlooking object on the summit of the ridge of the eastward such an occurrence of course attracted universal attention and every little old gentleman who sat in a leatherbottomed armchair turned one of his eyes with a stare of dismay upon the phenomenon still keeping the other upon the clock in the steeple by the time that it wanted only three minutes to noon the droll object in question was perceived to be a very diminutive foreignlooking young man he descended the hills at a great rate so that every body had soon a good look at him he was really the most finicky little personage that had ever been seen in vondervotteimittiss his countenance was of a dark snuffcolor and he had a long hooked nose pea eyes a wide mouth and an excellent set of teeth which latter he seemed anxious of displaying as he was grinning from ear to ear what with mustachios and whiskers there was none of the rest of his face to be seen his head was uncovered and his hair neatly done up in papillotes his dress was a tightfitting swallowtailed black coat from one of whose pockets dangled a vast length of white handkerchief black kerseymere kneebreeches black stockings and stumpylooking pumps with huge bunches of black satin ribbon for bows under one arm he carried a huge chapeaudebras and under the other a fiddle nearly five times as big as himself in his left hand was a gold snuffbox from which as he capered down the hill cutting all manner of fantastic steps he took snuff incessantly with an air of the greatest possible selfsatisfaction god bless mehere was a sight for the honest burghers of vondervotteimittiss to speak plainly the fellow had in spite of his grinning an audacious and sinister kind of face and as he curvetted right into the village the old stumpy appearance of his pumps excited no little suspicion and many a burgher who beheld him that day would have given a trifle for a peep beneath the white cambric handkerchief which hung so obtrusively from the pocket of his swallowtailed coat but what mainly occasioned a righteous indignation was that the scoundrelly popinjay while he cut a fandango here and a whirligig there did not seem to have the remotest idea in the world of such a thing as keeping time in his steps the good people of the borough had scarcely a chance however to get their eyes thoroughly open when just as it wanted half a minute of noon the rascal bounced as i say right into the midst of them gave a chassez here and a balancez there and then after a pirouette and a pasdezephyr pigeonwinged himself right up into the belfry of the house of the town council where the wonderstricken belfryman sat smoking in a state of dignity and dismay but the little chap seized him at once by the nose gave it a swing and a pull clapped the big chapeau debras upon his head knocked it down over his eyes and mouth and then lifting up the big fiddle beat him with it so long and so soundly that what with the belfryman being so fat and the fiddle being so hollow you would have sworn that there was a regiment of doublebass drummers all beating the devils tattoo up in the belfry of the steeple of vondervotteimittiss there is no knowing to what desperate act of vengeance this unprincipled attack might have aroused the inhabitants but for the important fact that it now wanted only half a second of noon the bell was about to strike and it was a matter of absolute and preeminent necessity that every body should look well at his watch it was evident however that just at this moment the fellow in the steeple was doing something that he had no business to do with the clock but as it now began to strike nobody had any time to attend to his manoeuvres for they had all to count the strokes of the bell as it sounded one said the clock von echoed every little old gentleman in every leatherbottomed armchair in vondervotteimittiss von said his watch also von said the watch of his vrow and von said the watches of the boys and the little gilt repeaters on the tails of the cat and pig two continued the big bell and doo repeated all the repeaters three four five six seven eight nine ten said the bell dree vour fibe sax seben aight noin den answered the others eleven said the big one eleben assented the little ones twelve said the bell dvelf they replied perfectly satisfied and dropping their voices und dvelf it is said all the little old gentlemen putting up their watches but the big bell had not done with them yet thirteen said he der teufel gasped the little old gentlemen turning pale dropping their pipes and putting down all their right legs from over their left knees der teufel groaned they dirteen dirteenmein gott it is dirteen oclock why attempt to describe the terrible scene which ensued all vondervotteimittiss flew at once into a lamentable state of uproar vot is cumd to mein pelly roared all the boysive been ongry for dis hour vot is comd to mein kraut screamed all the vrows it has been done to rags for this hour vot is cumd to mein pipe swore all the little old gentlemen donder and blitzen it has been smoked out for dis hourand they filled them up again in a great rage and sinking back in their armchairs puffed away so fast and so fiercely that the whole valley was immediately filled with impenetrable smoke meantime the cabbages all turned very red in the face and it seemed as if old nick himself had taken possession of every thing in the shape of a timepiece the clocks carved upon the furniture took to dancing as if bewitched while those upon the mantelpieces could scarcely contain themselves for fury and kept such a continual striking of thirteen and such a frisking and wriggling of their pendulums as was really horrible to see but worse than all neither the cats nor the pigs could put up any longer with the behavior of the little repeaters tied to their tails and resented it by scampering all over the place scratching and poking and squeaking and screeching and caterwauling and squalling and flying into the faces and running under the petticoats of the people and creating altogether the most abominable din and confusion which it is possible for a reasonable person to conceive and to make matters still more distressing the rascally little scapegrace in the steeple was evidently exerting himself to the utmost every now and then one might catch a glimpse of the scoundrel through the smoke there he sat in the belfry upon the belfryman who was lying flat upon his back in his teeth the villain held the bellrope which he kept jerking about with his head raising such a clatter that my ears ring again even to think of it on his lap lay the big fiddle at which he was scraping out of all time and tune with both hands making a great show the nincompoop of playing judy oflannagan and paddy orafferty affairs being thus miserably situated i left the place in disgust and now appeal for aid to all lovers of correct time and fine kraut let us proceed in a body to the borough and restore the ancient order of things in vondervotteimittiss by ejecting that little fellow from the steeple
