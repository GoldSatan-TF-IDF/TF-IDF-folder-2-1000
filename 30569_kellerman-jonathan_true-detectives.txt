jonathan kellerman true detectives in memory of marcia biloon chapter august alleged airconditioning said darius fox whats your take john jasper motor pool morons set us on bake or broil jack reed laughed and used a meaty freckled forearm to clear sweat from his face scanning the nightdarkened dumpsters and buttsides of shuttered lowrent businesses that lined the alley he sucked on his parliament and blew smoke out the cruisers window as darius kept the car moving forward at ten mph ten years ago to the day the manson family had butchered sharon tate and a whole bunch of other people if either fox or reed was aware of the anniversary neither thought it worth mentioning crazy charlies crimes might as well have been on another planet bigticket outrage on highend real estate fox and reeds southwest division shifts were filled with nonstop pennyante crap that sometimes blossomed into stomachchurning violence reality that never made the papers because as far as they could see the papers were works of fiction fox said man its a steam bath reed said alleged as in this is a motor vehicle more like a shopping cart with a cherry on top fox had prepped for driving the way he usually did handvacuuming the drivers portion of the bench seat then wiping the steering wheel down with his private bottle of purell now it was his own sweat coating the plastic hand me a tissue jj reed complied and his partner rubbed the wheel till it squeaked both men continued to study the alley as they crawled nothing good one half of the shift had passed jack reed said alleged as in jimmy carters a commander in chief now youre getting unpleasantly political thats a problem night like this it is truth is truth darius it was peanut boy helped that loony towelhead back into eyeran and look at all the crap that brought down no debate on farmer bucktooth being a nitwit john jasper i just dont want to pollute our precious time together with small things like international affairs reed thought about that fair enough im known for my fairness slow shift the usual drunk and disorderlies at mexican dance halls on vermont a couple of falsealarm burglary calls an assortment of miscreants warned and released because none of them was worth the paperwork the last call theyd fielded before embarking on alleyduty was yet another noise complaint at a usc fraternity already taken care of by the campus rentacops by the time fox and reed arrived rich confident college boys saying yessir and nossir scooping up beer bottles from the lawn hurrying inside to continue the merriment wink wink wink reed smoked his parliament down to a shred pinched it cold between his fingers flicked the remnant out the window he was a ruddy blond fireplug five nine on a good day two hundred muscled pounds thirty but looking older with skin leathered by the sun and a nose flattened by high school football a haycolored crewcut topped his bullet skull a naturally grainy voice was coarsened further by two packs a day three years out of the service all his time spent running an armory in germany he said tell you what alleged is darius la nights cooling off night like this might as well have stayed in bull shoals and missed the opportunity to ride with me reed grinned perish the thought damn heat said fox dabbing sweat from his straightedge mustache he was a tall rangy black man thirtyone years old a former air force mechanic whod been told by many people that he was handsome enough to act jack reed a smalltown arkansas boy was comfortable with black people in a way northerners could never be he found la scary everyone pretending to love everyone else but the streets hummed with anger working with a black mansitting side by side eating talking trusting your life to a black manwas a whole different level of comfort for a transplanted southerner and he was surprised how fast hed gotten used to riding with darius knowing what darius was thinking without darius having to put it into words he could only imagine what his cousins would say if he bothered to talk to them anymore which he didnt all that ignorance and stupidity was history he contemplated another cigarette as darius exited the alley drove a block entered a neighboring back lane more garbage and accordiongrated rear doors same old same old both patrolmen were bored and crazyhot darius used his forearm to wipe sweat off his chin shiny nails flashed jack resisted the urge to kid his partner about the weekly manicures night like this no sense being tiresome jack had been to dariuss neat little bungalow in crenshaw for barbecues and the like played with dariuss little boy made chitchat with the woman darius was supposed to be committed to till death do us madeleine fox was a smallwaisted curvy strongfeatured white girl who thought she was an artist but had no talent anyone else could perceive great teeth and hair even better body those big soft jack imagined darius getting close to her sliding down the bed and putting his manicured hands on jacks own face and body and hands transferred to the scene feeling like a shit he shut down the movie lit up another parliament you okay said darius yeah you got fidgety pumping those knees like you do im fine okay okay what you fidget when somethings bugging you nothings bugging me okay jack said all that intuition apply for detective big fun said darius sitting on my ass all day typing no more stimulating conversation with you not to mention fringe benefits jack had been riding with darius for thirteen months knew the perks his partner was talking about comped meals donations of merchandise by grateful civilians last week both he and darius had gotten brandnew pocket calculators from an arab with a store on hoover after theyd busted two kids trying to shoplift cassette tapes dariuss favorite perk had nothing to do with tangible goods police groupies hit the right cop bar at the right time and they swarmed like ants on molasses sad girls for the most part not jacks thing but he didnt judge sometimes he wondered though darius married to a goodlooking downright sexy girl like maddy nice backyard cute little aaron jack ever got married he was pretty sure hed never step out sometimes he thought about maddy those teeth the rest of the package sometimes that brought on headaches and long itchy thoughts mostly when his crappy little single in inglewood got real quiet and penthouse wasnt gonna cut it darius said wind blows the heat in then the heat just sits down and stays until another wind finally decides to kick its ass out of town jack said tonights weather report is brought to you by cal worthington dodge now for the latest on them dodgers darius laughed nasty night like this almost a full moon on top of the heat youd think wed be having more fun people carving each other up said jack people shooting each other full of holes said darius people stomping each other till the brains ooze out of their cracked skulls people strangling each other till the tongues are sticking out like limp salamis for a moment i thought you were gonna say something elsehey look at the landyacht pointing up the alley to a big white car idling maybe ten yards up pulled to the left lights off but the security bulb of a neighboring building cast an oblique band of yellow across the vehicles rear end darius said caddy looks pretty new how come its smoking worse than you he rolled closer and each of them made out the model big white fleetwood matching vinyl top fake wire wheels tinted windows shut tight someones a c wasnt alleged darius rolled close enough to read the tags jack called in the numbers oneyearold caddy registered to arpad avakian address on edgemont street no wants or warrants darius said east hollywood armenian bit of a drive to southwest jack said maybe something worth driving for real worth driving for both of them thinking the same thing without having to say it no logical reason for arpad armenian or whoever was using his wheels to be in this crapdump neighborhood in a newish luxury boat unless someone had a serious jones dope or sex or both guy with a fresh caddy had the potential to be a fun bust bit of diversion from the braindead locals they usually dealt with if arpad was polite they might even let him go with a warning some of those hollywood armenians owned stereo stores and the like nothing wrong with chalking up another grateful civilian darius got closer put the cruiser in park got out of the car before jack could place his hand on the door handle jack watched his partner hitch up his trousers approach the caddy with the cop swagger that originated when you learned to walk with all that heavy gear on your belt like making your way on the rolling deck of a boat eventually you came to like it darius walked right up next to the caddy shined his flashlight at the drivers window holding it high the way they were trained to prevent it being grabbed his free hand hovered near his holstered and jack felt his own paw settling on his weapon nowadays everything had to be logged so he called in the stop caught a bad connection on the radio tried twice more before reaching dispatch meanwhile darius was rapping on the window tinted almost black it stayed closed police open up the caddy sat there smoking away maybe suicide or a carbon mono accident normally you had to be in an indoor situation to asphyxiate yourself with exhaust but jack had heard about venting gone bad open up now darius put that menacing edge in his voice youd never know this was a guy who loved his weekly salon manicure the caddys window remained shut as darius repeated the command he reached to unsnap his holster and jack moved for his own gun and opened the cruisers passenger door just as he got to his feet the window slid down silently whatever darius saw relaxed him he dropped his gun arm smiled jack relaxed too license and reg the night cracked three shots in rapid succession each hit darius square in the chest each caused him to buck he didnt fall back the way they did in the movies he sank down into a sitting position hands flat on the asphalt as the caddy lurched into gear and shot forward at first glance just a guy resting crazily jack thought hes okay then darius pivoted half faced jack what looked like motor oil leaked through dariuss tailored navy shirt his face was that of a stranger jack screamed and fired at the fleeing car emptying his revolver as he ran to darius oh man oh jesus oh man lord jesus later hed learn that one of his bullets had pierced the caddys rear window but that hadnt slowed the big car down darius continued to sit there three wet holes in his chest jack cradled him put pressure on the wounds hold on dar youre gonna be fine just hold on hold on hold on darius stared at the sky with dull sightless eyes his mouth gaped jack felt for a pulse gimme something cmon cmon gimme dariuss skin turned to ice jack began cpr covering dariuss cold mouth with his own like breathing into an empty cave darius lay there still as the heat that had blown in from the desert and decided to stay chapter by now aaron fox understood mr dmitri once a level of trust had developed hed stay out of your face aarons favorite type of client real deep pockets made mr dmitri the perfect client before his first meeting with the guy aaron had done his usual research googling leonid davidovitch dmitri and coming up with two dozen hits the most informative a ragstoriches tale in a business journal moscow born trained as an electrical engineer dmitri had been stuck for fifteen years in a deadend communist job measuring noise levels at restaurants and filing reports that never got read at the age of thirtyseven hed emigrated to israel then the us taught night school math and physics to other russians tinkered in his kitchen inventing numerous objects of dubious value ten years ago hed patented a tiny waferthin stereo speaker that produced outsized sound and was perfect for carsespecially highend sports models with their limited cabin space aarons porsche had been outfitted with dmitris gizmo when hed had it customized and the fidelity was kickass the article estimated mr dmitris net worth at a couple hundred million and aaron was expecting to meet some tycoon sitting behind an acre of desk in an overthetop inner sanctum crammed with imitation fabergé and god knew what else what he encountered was a short bald stubbylimbed bullnecked man in his late fifties with a pietin face blued by stubble sitting behind a plywood desk in a nowindow hole at a factory in a sylmar industrial park dmitri was maybe five five at least two hundred lots of that muscle but also some fat dark brown lasersharp eyes never stopped moving two hundred biggies but the guy wasnt spending it on wardrobe shortsleeved pale blue shirt baggy gray pleated pants gray new balances aaron came to learn that it was dmitris uniform cheap digital watch fakeo tongueandgroove covered all four walls of the office same for the door giving the place a claustrophobic feel that first meeting hed played it safe clotheswise not knowing what kind of rapport hed have to develop with the client that kind of individual attention was one of the many keys to aarons success variety was what he liked about the job one day you might be meeting at koi with a pathetically tucked youthchasing record producer still thinking he could pull off hiphop chopsticking miso black cod and waiting as the client struggled for nonchalance inside hes rotting from insecurity as he fumbles to explain his reason for hiring a detective finally the confession he needs to know is his twentysevenyearold fourth wife blowing the goodlooking guy someone saw her with at fred segal or is darrett really a gay hairdresser she took along as a shopping buddy situation like that you dont dress down to the clients level but you dont wear a suit aaron met the poor fool wearing indigo diesel jeans a slatecolored retro egyptian cotton tshirt from vagueline unstructured black linen jacket perforated black santoni driving shoes the following day he was at a downtown law firm corporate client talking through a sixhundreddollaranhour mouthpiece needing someone to check out the goingson at a temple street construction site where tools and building materials were disappearing at an alarming rate for that one aaron chose a navy pinstriped paul smith madetomeasure pearlgray ferré shirt maroon sego tie blue pocket square brown kidskin magli loafers enjoying the feeling of good threads because tomorrow hed be made up like a skuzzy psycho homeless bum wheeling a shopping cart past the excavation for aarons first meeting with mr dmitri he selected an olive zegna soft threebutton hed found at the outlet in cabazon maize buttoncollar shirt and brown linen tie from barneys bittersweet chocolate allenedmonds wingtips for all mr dmitri noticed aaron couldve pranced in wearing leotards and a codpiece guy was ready to offer him the job knew aarons rates including the premium expense allowance had a big fat retainer check faceup on the desk big fat retainer may i ask who referred you sir dmitri picked up something that resembled a rubiks cube but had about twenty surfaces to it and squares embossed with greek letters without glancing at the numbers he whirled rapidly checked out the result put it back down certainly you may ask foghorn voice dmitris accent turned it into syertenly you mayyesk smiling who referred you sir dmitri said serinus canaria another foreign guy didnt ring a bell im sorry sir but that doesnt dmitri said common canary aaron stared little bird said dmitri no more smile you want the job or no aaron glanced around the office for signs of some special interest in ornithology nothing on the hideous paneling except curling posters of mr dmitris patented soundmyte speaker in newage designer colors aaron said tell me about the job good answer mr fox the first assignment had been shockingly simplepilfering from dmitris shipping bay the culprit had to be one of six clerks and within thirtysix hours aaron had the idiot on hidden cam slipping speakers into four backpacks stashing one after the other into the trunk of his camry slamdunk threethousanddollar tab aaron wondered why a man of mr dmitris technical abilities had bothered to hire out testing aaron if so hed passed because the second gig arrived two months later and it was anything but simple one of dmitris secretaries was concerned that her seventeenyearold honorstudent daughter was fooling around with a gangbanger named hector george morales find out mr fox ill take it from there nice of you to do that for an employee sir heres the check morales turned out to be a serious badass thirdgeneration mexican mafia with a fivepage juvey sheet aaron cadged out of an lapd records clerk using a hundreddollar bribe ten additional pages recounted a pattern of adult felonies morales was suspected of several murders but had only been convicted of a single adw serving half of a tenyear sentence at chino thirtythree years old the fool hung out with extremely bad guys in clear violation of his parole aaron caught him and honorstudentbutnotsosmart valerie santenegro on video emerging from an east la motel near the county coroners office reported to mr dmitri and offered to use his lapd contacts to get hector busted good idea mr fox hector got sent back up for another ten and valerie was shipped to dallas to live with her married sisters family mr dmitri said good and peeled off a wad of bills ten extra hundreds whats this sir appreciation mr fox go buy more fancy shirts over the past six months aaron had handled two additional assignments for the russian industrial espionage involving a competitor that took him to eugene oregon for three weeks of serious hightech observation and another inhouse theft at the sylmar factory this one involving truck drivers every suspect turned up guilty which was no big surprise guy like dmitri didnt hire you unless he had a pretty good idea what was going on aarons business in general posed few whodunits lots of proveits the fifth case was different dmitri played with his megarubiks you are well mr fox great im thinking perhaps i should call you aaron that would be fine sir you may call me mr dmitri aaron laughed yes it was a joke an edge to the russians voice said dont even think about getting familiar aaron said dmitri as if testing out the sound from the bible your parents are religious not really sir mosess brother yes sir if you only knew this new one said dmitri maybe we wont learn the truth one of my bookkeepers is maitland frostig masters degree in mathematics but he prefers to work with addition and subtraction mr frostig always looks sad more recently he is apparently sadder i say apparently because i dont get involved with emotions this year the christmas party my wife said that man is extremely depressed like we used to be in moscow i looked at maitland frostig with new eyes and agreed but i forgot about him dmitri ran a hand over his shiny dome my wife did not forget she is a psychiatrist in soviet union they tried to make her inject dissidents with drugs she refused and was sent to gulag we never had children im sorry sir regina talks i listen i called in maitland frostig for a meeting he says everything is okay i tell him no it isnt small smile i say it with confidence because my wife is never wrong in general sir thats a good philosophy of life you are not married statement not a question aaron was certain dmitri had hired someone to check him out before writing that first check maybe one day hed find out who havent found the right woman maybe said dmitri said anyway i tell maitland frostig something is wrong and he tells me the story he lives alone a widower since his daughter is four now the daughter is twenty and she is missing caitlin frostig for fifteen months she is missing the police do nothing someone that age said aaron no sign of foul play theyll file it as a missing person and put it aside i made some calls got the file sent to homicide detectives nothing which division i dont know where was the girl last seen maitlands house is in venice twenty and still living at home yes venice is pacific division shrug dont bother me with details police do nothing my call was before i know you now i know you chapter forget yesterday what have you done for me today moe reedscarletfaced panting biceps swelling to their full nineteen inches put down the curlbar and tried to catch his breath his arms pounded all of him pounded hundred forty pounds on the bar four sets of fifteen reps each no doubt some felonious scumbag in a prison yard was outlifting him at this very moment but for one of the good guys moe figured he was doing okay jobwise was another story leaving the spare bedroom hed set up as a home gym he walked to the bathroom dripping sweat on the carpet toweled off stripped down stepped into a cold shower after as much of that as he felt like enduring he cranked up the hot water and shampooed his wheatcolored crew cut soaped up the rest of his thick ironhard body and dried off the soap part used to take longer his own hands no longer aroused him not since liz he thought about calling her just to hear her voice remembered shed just gotten back from that bone conference in brussels would be suffering through her usual jet lag better to give her some time by seven am he was dressed in the usual blue blazer khakis white shirt and striped tie and black oxfords breakfast was hot tea three bowls of special k and nonfat milk chased with a boneless chicken breast by half past seven he was climbing into his latest heap a rustscarred dodge the drive from north hollywood to west la could be brutal and he wanted to be at his desk early even if the detectives figured him for a hot dog who needed to prove himself forget yesterday what have you done hed been part of the team that closed the marsh murders highprofile great pr for the department success had earned him a nod from deputy chief weinberg and quick approval of his transfer from pacific to west la division since arriving at his new desk the only attention hed received from downtown were memos on the case he thought he was leaving behind in re caitlin frostig nice girl caitlin from all hed gathered for the last eight months shed been nothing but a thorn in his butt hed made it to pacific homicide a year ago not bad for twentyeight got assigned to a nobrainer gang shooting that he closed in seventyfour hours his second case was caitlin frostig already missing for half a year by the time her file got transferred from the unsolveds of an old d who dropped dead of a heart attack not a homicide case strictly speaking but someone with pull moe never found out whowanted the case prioritized he started the way youre supposed to with family in caitlins case that boiled down to a mumblynerd father whod raised her alone since she was little but didnt seem to know much about her beyond the obvious the other man in her life was a boyfriend named rory stoltz who came across so wholesome that he set off moes antennae also nine times out of ten its romeo who kills juliet this romeo turned out to be alibied for the night caitlin walked out of the riptide moe dug into stoltzs background anyway turned up nothing but allamerican lad basically caitlins male counterpart still living at home waiting tables at the same place studying hard both of them a students at pepperdine malibu rorys eyes got misty when he recounted meeting caitlin in a philosophy class moe questioned him to the nth nothing there caitlins dad let moe search her room no sign of foul playnone anywhere in the little frame house on rialto south side of venice hipness encroached all around the neighborhood but maitland frostig hadnt changed a doily since his wifes death sixteen years before real quiet real depressed guy moe got permission to trace caitlins discover card no recent activity no california jane doe dbs matched the missing girl and from what moe could gather shed led an exceptionally boring life studying hard working at night no social life other than rory stoltz moe rechecked stoltz came up empty turned to missing persons databases working his way east until hed covered the entire country he even tried police departments in mexico for what that was worth last step was dealing with canada which was no easy feat place was huge and the cops were cautious still he managed to cover our northern neighbor zilch as milo sturgis would say he talked to sturgis about caitlin because the lieutenant had been his guru on the marsh murders be honest moses sturgis solved the marsh murders and you tailed along talk about continuing education working with someone that seasoned was a semester at homicide harvard wanting to learn more from the lieutenant was the reason hed requested transfer to west la if he lost caitlin frostig along the way because her file bore a pacific division number all the better once news of his request got out the wisecracks from the other pacific ds were a pain in the butt changing your sexual orientation detective reed is that eye shadow or just too much ecstasy at that boystown dance club whats it called oh yeah do me bob dont ask dont tell most of all please dont swell moe ignored them when hed started with sturgis to be honest there was that initial discomfort hard to believe a big gruff guy like that was who cared what people did in private the thing was the job and sturgis did the job some yearslots of yearsthe lieutenant ended up with the best close record in the department moe let the jokes sail past if the transfer didnt come through staying here would be hell it came through the frostig file traveled with him second day at his new desk he left the big detective room and knocked on the doorjamb of the tiny office set well away from the big detective room sturgis was in there unlit cigar in his mouth big feet on his desk reviewing what looked to be cold cases what moe told him sturgis said sounds like youve done everything thats what i thought but any suggestions loo not from what youve told me okay thanks you might wanna check with dr delaware this is a psycho case said moe youre assuming shes dead sturgis stretched played with the cigar kiddo everythings psychological but that doesnt mean we need shrinks for it mostly its a matter of connecting dots but this kind of thing sometimes he comes up with an idea out of left fielddidja happen to notice the coffee situation out in times square still hot said moe ill get you a cup cream two sugars delaware was friendly enough but no wisdom there either and moe figured this was one that wouldnt close unless some bones turned up somewhere if she was dead boring life like hers maybe shed gotten an itch for more last week hed made his way through the maze that was federal records for the second time as far as anyone could tell no one had commandeered caitlins social security number no other signs of identity theft the unused credit card did make him wonder if the girl was alive what was she doing for dough maybe working in a small town where the locals werent nosy or shed joined a cult run away with the circus met a rich guy and got swept off her feet any of that was true she wouldnt want to be found he thought about that pretty face the slender body the cloud of blond hair six feet under or discarded with haphazard brutality in some remote gully or weighed down and dumped in deep water psycho killer watching her fade from view time and bacteria doing their inevitable thing death one moses zero chapter aaron met with maitland frostig at the mans crummy little i house hed already introduced himself to frostig at work entering frostigs cubicle in the accounting bay of mr dmitri s factory letting him know hed be taking on caitlins case expecting some sort of grateful reaction but frostig just nodded and kept staring at his computer screen aaron glanced at the screen columns of numbers frostigs fingers rested on the keyboard poised to resume typing skinny whitehaired guy saggy skin sunspotted hands looking a lot older than the fortyseven listed in his personnel file finally he said thank you mr fox aaron suggested tomorrow night eight pm frostigs residence frostig said sure his fingers started moving numbers shifted frostigs employment record was spotless ten years at lockheed eight at amgen the rest at soundmyte inc ma in math and certified as a cpa before starting at the aerospace giant which meant passing rigorous tests but hed settled for bookkeeper with a much lower pay scale someone who didnt like to be challenged or losing his wife had knocked him low maybe grief was why frostig looked so old now his only kid was gone poor guy still there were all kinds of ways to cope and if aaron found himself in that situation hed be up on his feet feisty and furious sparring with bad god transforming righteous anger into constructive energy that wasnt theory he knew about loss doorbell rings early one summer morning mom trudges over to see whats up still in her pajamas those blearily gorgeous blue morning eyes of hers aaron tails her like he always does earning his nickname my little puppy dog wearing his batman pjs the taste of froot loops sweet and slick in his mouth cartoons playing on the tube just another morning except it isnt mom opens the door big unhappy men stand there and look nervous and start to talk mom loses her balance falls to the floor aaron rushes forward but the big men are handling the situation one of them glances at him and the guys lip trembles and hes a toughlooking man the kind who wouldnt be bothered by anything small and thats when aaron knows something terrible has happened we bear our own crosses still aaron couldnt help the small bit of contempt that he felt facing frostig in his crappy little living room the guy hunched all weighed down unfocused advertising the fact that lifes been beating him up at regular intervals might as well wear a kick me sign the best revenge was living well coldcock bad god and move on he said i know this is tough sir yes the room was cramped dim crowded with cheap furniture anything not peach or green was fake pecan not a stick of upgrade since the eighties and the tv was one of those old heaps with the puffy gray screen no cable or satellite box was frostig one of those guys whose lips curled at the idea of entertainment a single photo of caitlin stood on an otherwise empty coffee table high school graduation picture the inevitable canifinallyunlockmyface grin pretty girl tan some freckles peeking through lots of nice thick straight blond hair intelligent brown eyes under carefully crafted brows no mom in her life but she knew how to be feminine definitely nice enough for guys to notice maybe the wrong guy had noticed maitland frostig continued to sit there looking as if he were dreading a prostate exam aaron said appreciate your meeting with me sir even though it shouldve been just the opposite what would you like me to tell you mr fox anything sir anything said frostig as if the word were foreign thats pretty broad you know her better than anyone said aaron frostig blinked shes a good girl let me show you her room a short walk past a kitchen that appeared unused took them to a tenbytwelve space pink walls a single high window beige drapes that managed to clash beige bedspread on a twinsized mattress a cheap desk took up half of one wall the dresser across the room was similar boxy no style five drawers the only decorative touches were three framed prints of flowers that looked as if theyd been cut from an old book no posters no cute girlie touches no mementos of adolescence have you changed anything the suggestion seemed to offend frostig of course not caitlins a serious girl pardon this seems like the room of a mature serious person more like a jail cell frostig said caitlins extremely serious backed into a corner as aaron checked out the closet pawed through drawers white cotton underwear and bras levis two pairs of black slacks an assortment of madeinchina tops the overall feel budgetconscious leaning toward conservative pepperdine was a baptist school is caitlin religious were not churchgoers aaron went through the closet again the girl seemed to have no outside interests is anything missing sir no one goes in here i vacuum the rug thats all there dont seem to be many personal items mr frostig caitlin keeps cosmetics in the bathroom the upper shelf in the medicine cabinet is hers is this guy thick i was referring to yearbooks diaries that kind of thing if you havent found them theyre not here said frostig caitlins not sentimental philosophy major said aaron tossing in one of those irrelevancies that sometimes shake people up so they say something impulsive yes frostig fun dad aaron had entered the case figuring a voluntary rabbit was unlikely now he wondered how long could any sane person live here okay he said lets sit back down and you can tell me about the last time you saw your daughter the last time was that morning said frostig seven forty am i leave the house at seven fortyfive to be at work by nine sometimes i arrive early and get an early jump caitlin wakes up at seven and has breakfast while im having coffee she leaves for pepperdine at different times depending on when her first class is generally we see each other at night except when caitlins working late in which case im asleep by the time she arrives home but i hear her come in its not a mansion the last time anyone saw her was leaving the riptide just before two am tell me about her job there riptide said frostig no the they probably think thats avantgarde his mouth turned down she worked there for four months prior to disappearing im sensing you didnt approve its a bar they might call it something else but its a bar and that means people drinking too much youre wondering if that had something to do with her disappearance i felt caitlin could do better than work in a bar caitlins opinion was that the locationon the way home from pepperdinemade it convenient i suppose thats true strictly speaking but there are other restaurants she could have chosen whyd she choose riptide her boyfriend worked there rory stoltz nod tell me about him said aaron nice boy from what i saw the police talked to him he has nothing to offer you dont suspect him why would i often people are harmed by those they know frostig blinked everyone says hes a nice boy caitlin says hes a nice boy she talked to you about him frostig scratched his chin caitlin isnt one for discussion she told me she was dating him she didnt ask my permission do you have children mr fox no sir if you ever do youll see that higher education can cause a certain confidence to set in thinking shes grown up and maybe she isnt said aaron frostigs eyebrows rose shes grown up always has been college made her think that was sufficient for making important decisions as in working at riptide i went over there mr fox it was my first stop when caitlin didnt return home the second was pepperdine which was useless because caitlin commuted wasnt considered part of campus life whatd you learn at riptide what youll learn if you waste your time there they looked at me as if i was a nuisance they werent helpful not in the least frostigs voice tightened his eyes were scalpelcuts caitlin worked her usual shift nothing unusual happened ive learned from websurfing that the clientele is a mixture locals who like to drink and socalled celebrities such as people ive never heard of the management claimed no one had an altercation with caitlin no one followed her out the police claim they followed up on that they even suggested that she ran away voluntarily which is utter garbage shes never used her credit card and her car hasnt turned up this is california wheres someone going to go without a car guy was unwilling to imagine his daughter beyond the borders of the golden state seeking her own truths out in the big bad universe aaron said good point im glad you see it that way mr fox the police certainly didnt fifteen months and they dont see it as a suspicious disappearance he doesnt said frostig one detective and obviously not very experienced i havent talked to him recently because whats the point whens the last time you did talk to him eight months ago it was obvious further contact with him wouldnt be useful i phoned his superiors but those calls were never returned frustrating frostigs look said what else is new what have you done personally to look for caitlin i havent hired any other detectives if thats what you mean i mean anything the web said frostig im on it constantly plugging in caitlins name checking missing persons sites ive logged onto philosophy chat rooms because caitlin was interested in philosophy people talking about the meaning of life people will talk about anything mr fox the computer grants permission to communicate was caitlin into cyberspace she didnt have her own computer said frostig we share talk about lack of privacy a voluntary rabbit was looking more and more feasible aaron said whatd you guys do divide up the time we guys said frostig frowning caitlin used the computer for academic purposes homework term papers but feel free to examine the computer i was just offering an example of the lengths to which i go to find caitlin what else can you tell me about caitlin sir about caitlin said frostig as if redigesting the concept what an oddball half an hour in this place and aaron felt ready to molt his skin voluntary rabbit was climbing toward probability maitland frostig said shes a good girl with a good brain shes neat and diligent and reliable sounded more like a boy scout than a daughter i dont want to think said frostig about where she could be after all this time what was the name of the police detective you spoke to the police said frostig are utterly useless even so sir youre going to waste time going over old ground on mr dmitris dollar aaron forced himself to smile generous man your boss frostig turned his back headed to the living room walked through the room and positioned himself by the front door aaron said is there some reason youre uncomfortable with my taking on your daughters case because youre black absolutely not race hadnt entered aarons head frostig had seen nothing but the color of aarons skin its not you mr fox im not hopeful thats all fifteen months and no ones given me the time of day now thats changed mr frostig i suppose it has frostigs smile was unsettling i apologize if ive been rude i certainly havent intended any rudeness none observed well thats polite of you mr fox im sure youll do your best aaron opened the door and let in a sliver of evening he said the name of that police detective sir reed said frostig moses reed youre wasting your time aaron walked to his car head spinning in a whole new direction chapter the big detective room echoed just moe reed at his desk and d delano hardy in a far corner on the phone talking to someone about a court appearance hardy had as many years on the job as sturgishad partnered with sturgis back when the lieutenant still did that moe still feeling like a trainee had made it his business to eavesdrop when the older detectives talked delano s case sounded like a gang shooting bad guy nabbed early easy confession routine nothing to learn moe was just about to pay attention to his own work when tension snaked into hardys voice and his volume rose turned out this bad guy was a fifteenyearold girl and her lawyers were pushing a child abusediminished capacity defense on top of that she was hispanic and hardy was black so the race card was going to be used to sully the confession hardy grunted drank coffee grunted sturgis made those same sounds when he was pissed maybe that was the mark of decades on the job or getting old moe wondered if someday hed end up sounding like a wounded steer he tasted his own coffee long cold drinking out of one of those bodyoutline mugs from the coroners gift shop present from liz cute but it didnt improve the taste of droom swill flipping through the frostig file he found rory stoltzs cell number phoned got voice mail rory sounding cheerful and confident whatever grief hed mustered was long gone at the landline rorys mother answered and as moe identified himself he searched the file for her name martha work number the peninsula in beverly hills where she was a roomservice coordinator have you found caitlin she said unfortunately not maam im trying to reach rory why doing followup rorys busy at school any idea when hell be free hes an adult said martha stoltz i dont keep tabs on him does he still live at home silence its not a trick question maam i dont understand why youre calling detective reed you talked to rory what three four times asking the same questions over and over it was very upsetting to rory he felt you were trying to trip him up i wasnt maam moe lied sometimes we need to do that just to be thorough it really bothered him that you could suspect him rory was so fond of caitlin no one was more upset when she disappeared i hear you maam but sometimes we need to reinterview well rorys in plain sight living his life before moe could respond she hung up why all the anger maybe shed had a bad day or she really was fed up with her only child being drawn into a murder investigation he called pepperdine administration tried to wangle rorys class schedule out of a perky secretary then her supervisor no go maybe someone with more experience couldve pulled it off maybe not at ten am he took a walk the way hed seen sturgis do covering half a mile of the workingclass residential neighborhood that surrounded the station no slambam insights he phoned liz she answered sounding groggy but when she said its you her voice lightened and she appended sweetie did i wake you no im just lying here with a monster headache and thinking about everything thats piled up while i was gone poor baby what bugs me moses is i know the physiology of jet lag did everything i could to hydrate but no matter how much water i pump my eyes are gritty and my skin feels like crepe paper moe imagined that chocolatebrown paper smoothing under his touch youll be fine before you know it how was the flight the usual delays and they ran out of beverages except for booze talk about dehydration she laughed the guy next to me was about a thousand pounds he popped two ambiens and snored like a choochoo the entire flight try climbing mount fleshy to get to the john moe laughed along with her well now youre back and ill take care of you good i could use some care moses when do you want to hang unless something breaks ill be free at four five caitlin yup you transfer and they send it along said liz totally unjust itll work itself out you shutting in all day i was planning to go to the lab to clear my desk but im feeling so punk i think ill pass so anytime want me to order something in whatever you want see you at five with bells bells huh plan on sliding down the chimney oh man he said symbolism this early in the day liz cracked up you bring it out in me moses thats why were going steady feeling better he turned back detoured for a maple bear claw from a coffee shop on santa monica ate it on the way and reapproached the frostig file with elevated blood sugar concentrating on the interviews with rory stoltz trying to tease out anything he mightve missed across the room del hardy said well look who the smog blew in chortles and palmsmacking highfives made moe glance over del was on his feet grinning at aaron aaron pretended to ignore moe kept shooting the breeze with the older detective not deferential to hardy relaxed a peer moe pretended to ignore aaron back aaron said something to hardy in a low voice and hardy laughed again something to do with del s case had aaron been hired by the fifteenyearold hitvixens lawyers to stir up trouble but if del saw aaron as the enemy you couldnt tell from his posture just the opposite two guys shooting the breeze two black guys they couldve been a rumpled dad and his much cooler son moe the invisible man he buried his face in the file moses aaron was standing over him grinning as if he hadnt just shined moe on moe couldnt care less about clothes thought his blazers and khakis were just fine for the job but sometimes when he saw how aaron put himself together he felt underdressed todays hautewhatever was a slimfit black suit white shirt orange tie as bright as a caltrans cone worn with one of those oversized knots that took up a whole bunch of space and screamed serious gq moes knot was always slipping it felt loose right now but he resisted the urge to yank now del hardy was staring at him perplexed by moes unresponsiveness moe said hey morning bro busy yup busy on caitlin frostig moes chest tightened why shes mine now said aaron in addition to being yours moe shut the file what are you talking about im talking about free enterprise moses who hired you mr frostigs boss why not frostig himself bookkeepers salary affording my daily i think not we need to chat bro nothing to chat about aaron placed a hand on moes shoulder moe removed it its going to be that way moses theres nothing to talk about the case is nowhere maybe i can find a somewhere miracle worker aaron grinned its been known to happen moe turned away moses on those marsh murders i dont think id be exaggerating if i said i played somewhat of a role this is different how about a look at the file nothing worth looking at cmon moe forget it aaron shrugged from what mr frostig said i guess i shouldnt be surprised about what his feeling is you never considered caitlin worth your time moes face got hot he knew hed turned beet red something aaron could always avoid he can feel what he wants not going to change the facts i agree said aaron with what frostigs opinion not being worth much hes a weirdo strange affectthats shrinktalk for offkilter emotional responses who knows he could be one of those asperbergersthats an autismspectrum disorder i know what it is been reading up on psychology actually moe had going through a pile of books dr delaware had suggested interesting stuff but none of it relevant to caitlin frostig moe smiled his face continued to flame aaron said maitland doesnt bother you do i see him as a suspect nothing points that way not a suspect moses a factora contributing factor as in caitlins got one parent and unfortunately that one parent is a weirdo and she finally has enough of living with him and decides to book a rabbit said moe youve got evidence of that ive got nothing except a big fat retainer that id like to deserve thats why im here instead of taking the cs around the track at laguna seca which is what id planned to do before mr dmitri frostigs bosscalled me in vacation time well earned moses no one forced you to take the case mr dmitris an important client he beckons i come that makes you sound like a dog aaron laughed were all dogs bro only question is are we going to eat quality chow or scrounge in the trash come on give me a look at the file ill take you out to lunch and we can brainstormi pay dmitri pays either way you dont how about the peninsula martha stoltzs workplace moe said why there i like the menu thats the only reason aaron laughed what other reason would there be cmon lets do it over the black silk of aarons broad shoulders moe spotted del ano hardys eyes watching taking it all in moe thought of the jovial exchange between hardy and aaron aaron said be flexible bro moe stood placed the file in a drawer and locked it okay i get it bro said aaron get what youre the man im hired help peninsula s fine said moe great menu said aaron i hear the room service is pretty good too chapter november maddy watched the baby sleep the chair by the crib was a city of hope thriftshop find salmon silk tulip seat with a grimy sloan label underneath and only a few stains maddyd paid thirty bucks considered it the find of the century shed placed it in the living room dragging it from the van by herself arranged it next to the fireplace with a cute little table that held a vase of silk flowers just like they did in house garden the day she set it up she poured herself an unfiltered apple juice waited for darius to come home he arrived two hours late reeking of beer and other women gaped at what maddy had done and burst into laughter and pronounced the new addition beaucoup faggy hoisting the chair easily he carried it to the garage later when darius was sleeping maddy went out there draped the silk with a clean white sheet and sat filling her nose with garage dust motor oil old cardboard the metallic perfume of dariuss halfrestored harley sometimes she still went out there and sniffed the air very little had changed but the tulip chairs honor had been restored no one to complain when she moved it into the babys room from time to time dariuss voice rang in her head pink for a boy jesus girl you are going to turn him into a firstclass swish and if you think that means hell grow up polite and artistic think again ive seen what those guys do to each other when they get all pissed off and nambyjealous maddys eyes puffed the baby stirred she hoisted herself up tiptoed to the crib stared down at the pink smooth face round as a dinner plate blueeyed little angel like one of those renaissance paintings angelic disposition too as if he knew enough not to upset the applecart five months old and already the freckles hed need protection from the sun and god knew what else she touched his soft little tummy feeling the swell of ample nourishment through terry cloth blue jammy darius would approve the baby smiled in his sleep maddy said angel you have no idea a slamming door whisked her out of her reverie and she hurried out of the room shut the door softly continued into the kitchen ready to shush the obvious culprit how many times had she told him aaron was a smart boy maybe he did it on purpose one thing for sure he knew what was coming because he shouted mommy as if theyd been apart for months and flashed a thousandwatt smile that smile she couldnt help but spread her arms as he ran toward her aarons little head made contact with her belly he nuzzled her she got down on one knee and held him tight taking in that littleboy smell school clothes grimy with dust he still managed to look more puttogether than any other fouryearold on the face of the planet good to see you mommy how was your day oh you charmer maddy hugged him harder aaron squirmed away i must have froot loops please baby its too pleeeeeze its important oh my belly needs froot loops needs it so bad dancing around the kitchen not even pretending to take himself seriously sometimes she thought he was forty not four he swayed eyes as big as the universe im so hungry mommy little con man maddy fought not to laugh the preschool teacher had been more diplomatic aaron is a charming boy but sometimes he relies on social skills a little too much blood ran thicker than froot loops i will fall over tired mommy on my face without froot loops shh baby moes sleeping baby moe said aaron turning pensive he is my brother and i love him he stagewhispered he wants me to have froot loops without

had caused her to lose respect within weeks of their marriage she said dont do it again aaron should never smell that on you im sorry honey forget it love you honey maddy didnt answer either way said jack by the time they returned to the kitchen aaron was at the table snarfing from a huge bowl of froot loops his free hand grazed a glass of milk so saturated with chocolate that undissolved clumps floated on the surface like water lilies cereal speckled the floor not too big of a mess considering the boy had always been coordinated hed climbed up to the cereal cupboard taken the time to close the door move the chair back into place when he saw her he opened a mouth full of technicolor mush and said yum jack winked and said hey that looks good from down the hall came the chuffing of baby moes initial wakeup cries time for his snack maddy left the kitchen freeing her left breast chapter instead of heading for the parking lot moe began walking toward santa monica boulevard aaron said were hiking to the peninsula forget the peninsula too rich for your blood moe picked up his pace okay i bite where we going suzy qs that dump too cop for your blood said moe bacon on sausage on lard on trans fat with a side of ldl cholesterol suit yourself bro a flush spread from moes pecs up to his face his fatherthe man whose name aaron had never takenhad dropped dead of a heart attack at thirtynine last year moe had finally dug up the death report the deceased had fallen off a bar stool probably cold before he hit the floor moe ate a lot of skinless chicken breasts suzys too much for you to handle lets do indian aaron said that place where they worship sturgis that a problem for you life is beautiful ive got no problems four steps later you like working with sturgis why wouldnt i no reason so tell me what youve done on frostig moe sped up to a near jog aaron said aerobics and chutney in the am im always open to new experiences the bespectacled woman who ran café moghul recognized aaron the moment he pushed the door open she flashed him a neon smile brighter than her aquablue sari moe thought a whole different greeting from the first time aaron had walked in on a marshmurder sitdown and the woman had reacted to a black face with instinctive anxiety despite aarons custom suit the easygoing grin the deliberately unthreatening posture all those strategies his brother used to put people at ease moe had his feelings about aaron and they made empathy a huge nuisance but once in a while he let himself imagine what it would be like to be aaron always having to present yourself sir the woman gave a little flourish and bow please anywhere you like that day aaron had eaten nothing drunk half a glass of clove tea but picking up everyones tab and tipping big had bought him some social status as they settled at a corner table the woman said is the lieutenant coming as well no maam said moe she appeared to notice him for the first time turned back to aaron he is okay moe said hes fine maam i havent seen him in a few days the storefront café was sturgiss secondary office the woman viewed the loo as a human guard dog a role hed earned by ejecting a few homeless whacks and just being big and mean looking moe said ill send him your best we have fresh lamb in a very nice curry aarons hand slipped down toward his flat abdomen and moe figured hed give some excuse and order tea aaron said sure and bring healthy vegetables for detective reed while they waited for the food aaron checked his blackberry moe said people to do things to see aaron clicked off the peninsula s where rory stoltzs mama works you changed your mind because you dont want to make it easy for me whatever you want to do on caitlin i cant stop you unless you cross the line in terms of what i can give you like i said theres nothing and martha stoltz is a waste of time i spoke to her this morning she had nothing to say so youre actively working the case so they tell me the food arrived heaps of lamb stew for both of them bowls of every veg the kitchen could offer the bespectacled woman said tell the lieutenant how good everything is when she left aaron looked at the banquet and shook his head not up to it said moe a little early in the day no moe began eating with simulated gusto undigested breakfast sat in his gut but damned if hed wimp out maybe lamb was better than beef cholesterolwise another hour of lifting and a run would keep him virtuous tonight after seeing liz if he went home aaron said tell me about rory stoltz i interviewed him four times hes alibied for at least one hour after caitlin left the riptide stayed on to clean up after that he went home where mommy claims he stayed claims shes his mother you pick something up hinky about her moses you didnt hear me the first time shes useless aarons clean jawline rippled he took a breath mo maybe i fucked up somewhere along the line but if i did sturgis doesnt think so i went over the murder book with him and he said nothing was missing same for delaware you went to see delaware because at sturgiss suggestion sturgis sees caitlin as a psycho case sturgis doesnt know what she is no one does including delaware but a girl driving alone late at night there are all sorts of possibilities bad guy on the road said aaron except her car hasnt been found so the psycho collects wheels as trophies or he dumped it somewhere psycho garage said aaron heres an image for you rows of vics vehicles each one with a skeleton propped behind the wheel youve been hollywooding too long little brother you are right about that but maybe thatll work to my advantage why maitland frostig said riptide gets celebs i was there said moe all i saw were juiceheads and old surfers maybe you hit an off night stoltz still work there dont know ill find out when i talk to him unless thats a problem talk to him all you want kids not going to give up anything because if he does have something to hide hes had fifteen months to live with it and get his story straight nothing hinky about him said aaron but still you wonder moe glared at him what youre sounding like a shrink bouncing back what i say bro ive got nothing on stoltz except that he was the boyfriend was said aaron so you definitely see her as dead hey said moe maybe shes partying in dubai or whatever white slavery aaron grinned always loved that phrase as opposed to normal slavery the racial allusion surprised moe he said you dont see her as dead yeah i probably do except for what i said before she mightve wanted to get away from daddy she didnt even have her own computer they shared what college student doesnt have a laptop so maitland could be one of those controlling types and girls do wanna have fuuhn she was a virgin said moe supposedly aarons brows arched daddy told you that martha stoltz did howd it come up she was talking about what a perfect couple caitland and rory were allamerican both virgins what was her point in telling you moe shrugged im just quoting it wasnt weird said aaron middle of an interview and she volunteers about their sex life lack of sex life i figured she wanted me to see rory as a choirboy because he isnt if hes got a secret life its stayed secret from me said moe whatre you gonna do hightechbug his bedroom aaron smoothed his tie tugged the big knot tighter theyre both virgins like mamas in the backseat with them hey said moe im open to anything you find out rorys chapter president of the ted bundy fan club ill get interested but i talked to him four times and he came across exactly what he claimed to be which is cleancut pepperdine student thats a baptist school we talking holy roller normal cleancut kid said moe seemed genuinely torn up about caitlin but not overthetop emotional like he was trying to prove something virgins said aaron wonder if hes still that way fifteen months later you planning a fifth chat the case is still open aaron drank water moe said i dont want you stepping on my toes last thing on my mind bro but if i tell you to hold off youre not going to listen gas or acid or whatever was rising up his food tube his belt cut like dental floss from what three pieces of lamb and some eggplant what did they put in this stuff moses cant we just put it aside put what aside sos same old shit aaron laughed remember when i told that idiot counselor he was just digging up sos and he near about fell off his shrink chair moe stayed silent you dont remember bro dr gibson said moe as if called upon to recite mr gibson said aaron had a masters he shook his head working for the school system filing paper at night he moonlights pretends hes an analyst didnt stop mom from liking him mom said aaron she also liked that massage therapist with the bad breath and the huge mole on her chin and that polish nd we all thought was an mdkussorsky master naturopath guys doling out little vials of water with invisible ingredients and moms telling us we have to take it for our allergies meanwhile she takes in two cats he laughed again sos moe thought about fakeshrink gibson and couldnt muster up any glee hed been fourteen aaron eighteen the two of them going at each other constantly sometimes it got physical mom having no idea my father was a hero so was my father what youre saying he wasnt youre saying that all im saying little bro is fuck you fuck you a whirlwind of scuffle fists flying mom hurrying in trying to break it up the next day she announced everyone was going to family therapy shed met quentin gibson ma at yoga class guy makes house calls wimpy skinny ponytailed british tool letseveryoneexpresstheirfeelings useful as a tissuepaper condom moe felt himself smile put a brake on his lips aaron leaned in closer i promise not to step on your feet that assumes were dancing so nothing im going to say is going to work nothing has to work do what you want even if that was my style i wouldnt handle it that way bro stop doing that doing what bro aarons caramel eyes widened ive been doing that your whole life exactly aaron ran a long graceful finger along his hairline okay detective reed moes colon churned he fought to conceal another belch aaron exhaled slowly this is what i am going to do lapsing into that schoolteacher tone moe hated i will check with you before i interview stoltz his mommy or anyone else you deem important if i learn anything relevant youll be the first to know moe forked food around his plate detective brother reed is there anyone else you deem important just caitlin said moe if you run across her tell her to give me a ring the bespectacled woman came over looked at aarons untouched plate not a trace of irritation as she said may i wrap that for you to go sir chapter aaron watched the little pink house it was just after ten pm for three hours hed done nothing but watch nice night in the valley more than a few stars peeking through a charcoal felt sky the street lined with neat domiciles quiet and peaceful he sat low in the seat of the opel drank green tea ate the second half of a pastrami sandwich listened to anita baker on his ipod moe had walked out of the restaurant committing to nothing aaron tipped the indian woman generously then drove to heinz the mechanics place on pico where he garaged the cs and picked up the opel deceptive little thing with its dingedup body and flat brown paint the engine was a rebuilt bmw i enhanced by heinzs magical hands the best of several loaners the german kept around while he worked on carreras and ferraris and such fifty bucks bought aaron twentyfour hours smoked windows were perfect for the job at hand he logged the expenditure into his blackberry driving home he cellphoned a source at the county assessors office learned that rory stoltz owned no real estate but martha greta stoltz paid property taxes on a singlefamily residence on emelita street in north hollywood thanks henry i owe you laughter you sure do checks in the mail it sure is the call was a luxury property rolls were public records but saving time was a bargain in the long run for mr dmitri henrys fifty got logged aaron couldve stretched that but deep pockets like mr dmitris you had to be careful not to get piggy address in hand he gpsd the precise location as he drove home to his place on san vicente off wilshire speeddialing continuously using red lights to work the blackberry his building was a decoflavored duplex built in the twenties one of the final reminders that the area had once been residential aarons neighbors were lowrise office structures skyscrapers on wilshire cast long shadows across his roof hed picked up the property at a foreclosure auction for a ridiculous price spent the next five years remodeling doing a lot of the work himself last year hed billed two hundred ninetysix thousand dollars in fees collected nearly all of that and this year was looking at least as good but without the bargain purchase hed still be living in a condo he unlocked the gate around the small front yard disabled the security lock released both bolts in the door removed his snail mail from the internal slot the first floor was work land allblack wood floor where it wasnt berber carpeting gray suede walls chrome and leather and glass furniture sheets of lexan were bolted to the inner surfaces of conspicuous windows invisible unless you knew to look the décor expressed all the hightech efficiency clients craved this afternoon work land was silent every message and email cleared during the drive he loved operating as a solo act checking one of three fax machines he was pleased to find a fresh clear copy of rory stoltzs drivers license courtesy an illegal search by a source at dmv hundred bucks kaching folding the page neatly to keep from creasing the subjects face he headed upstairs to play land worked out in his gym showered whirlpoolbathed shaved feeling loose and confident he sauntered starknaked and swinging a key ring down a subtly lit plumcarpeted hallway toward what had once been a rear bedroom the space was guarded by a securityhinged door of fiery teak an ebony silhouette of a tophatted boulevardier graced the center of the wood aaron unlocked and stepped in the same teak covered the walls and the coffered ceilings recessed lighting set off billiardtablegreen carpeting the twentybyeighteen room was sectioned by doubleheight industrialquality stainlesssteel racks hed snagged at a bargain price from carlyle and tout when the brentwood haberdasher went under the left side was devoted to suits sport

silk ringing the entire room above the racks was teak shelving bearing clear plastic boxes containing sweaters and shoes the latter identified precisely magli olive suede wingtips paciotti black buckle loafers edmonds cordovans about half of the clothing still bore tags aaron walked among his treasures fingertips grazing silk sea island cotton merino cashmere alpaca he stopped at the columbo cashmere and mink nothing like it he loved that coat ten minutes later hed made his pick for tonight what the welldressed man dons when sitting on his ass for protracted periods of tedium came down to a loose brown linen shirtjacket with four flap pockets tailored to conceal his mm beige cargo pants of the same carefully rumpled fabric that provided another quartet of compartments cream silk socks buttersoft pigskin santoni driving shoes by four pm he was back in west la sitting in the girliecute front room of liana parlats girliecute condo off overland liana always friendly seemed especially happy to see him and he wondered if some of her gigs had dried up due to the writers strike she served him coffee and homebaked whitechocolate chip cookies and offered him a share of the lean cuisine lasagna she was just about to nuke aaron declined the food but finished three cups of lianas always excellent kenyan she put dinner on hold and sat opposite him perched like the lingerie model shed once been on the edge of a louis xiv repro chair done up in puce brocade still gorgeous at fortyone the mop of black hair glossy and carefully layered the flawless ivory skin allowing her to pass for late twenties liana had the charisma and talent to be a movie star after fifteen years of failure shed settled for the anonymity and respectable income of commercial voiceovers freelancing for aaron supplemented her retirement fund theyd begun as lovers continued as friends and occasional business associates onceinawhile bootybumps did no damage aaron was proud of his ability to maintain complex relationships the exception being moe liana said for this one i was thinking perky slightly nasal wholesome go for it he gave her the unlisted number hed obtained from a source at the phone company sat by as she punched numbers ever the method actress she cocked her head altered her posture squinted somewhat stupidly transforming into a valley girl hi is rory there putting a little more headcold into it oh oh okay im in one of his classes and was wondering no its not that important ill try later thank you so much click mommy expects him home by six thirty thank you baby now for the fun part he gave her riptides address on ocean avenue two blocks south of colorado partially gentrified stretch with that giant loews hotel pulling in respectable folks but dingy motels and cheap apartments persisted as did lowrent bars and last year thered been a hostage situation a captain from west valley named decker whom aaron knew casually ending up a bigtime hero aaron said caitlins father said she considered the location convenient since she went to pepperdine thats twenty miles from pepperdine said liana but on the way home to venice ah drive most of the way home so you dont have much to go when youre really tired i guess it makes sense i drove by the place at one thirty am last nightaround the time caitlin was last seen its pretty spooky lee park as close as you can use the hotel go valet if you want liana smiled and be sure to bring back the receipt that would be nice mr all business aw you know thats not true sweetheart youre hearing the message right personal safety is all were not exactly talking mean streets darling ivy at the shore is what three blocks up a block can make a difference lee last night there were bums pushing shopping carts and lowlifes hanging near a couple of motels if something feels even a little off dont get brave fine she said but ive been to industry parties at loews terrific charm the valet and maybe hell let you park free liana laughed and nibbled an eighth of a cookie this girl caitlin how long did she work there four months youre wondering if she ran into some psycho either there or nearby i dont know enough to wonder anything lee go in there order a drinksoft if you think hard will impede you dont feel pressured to come up with anything huge just check the place out get a feel for the ambience whats my motivation mr de mille two hundred for the first four hours forty for each additional hour ooh she said generous client huh rhetorical because she knew better than to press for details they serve food at this gin joint probably bar food at least ill stick with my lean quee just ambience huh if anything specific to caitlin comes up thats a bonus but i dont expect it after fifteen months theres no reason for anyone to talk about her but if someone does that would be significant dont bring her up in conversation lianas liquid blue eyes flashed now im insulted sorry said aaron i just want you safe paddle out slowly and watch for sharks didnt know you surfed aaron had years ago working his way up to the active waters of county line beach he said i dont im just good at metaphors he handed her rory stoltzs dmv photo then a copy of the snapshot of caitlin hed gotten from maitland frostig cute couple virgins said aaron according to rorys mother liana crossed sleek legs you find that unbelievable dont you well she said i was once a virgin blinking until i wasnt at pm the little pink houses front windows went dark early to bed for the allamerican kid aaron could live with a dead end first night hed give it another hour nine minutes later the front door swung open and rory stoltz wearing a dark shirt untucked over black jeans his pale hair mussed with great intention ambled to his hyundai and backed out of the driveway forgetting to switch his headlights on until he was halfway up the block aaron waited until stoltz reached the corner kept his own beams off and trailed from a distance when stoltz turned south on lankershim aaron illuminated and joined the traffic flow keeping three car lengths back in a neighboring lane he managed a clear view of the hyundai rory stoltz turned right on ventura then left on laurel canyon continued south toward the city aaron let a mercedes and a range rover get in front of him before joining the convoy stoltz drove slowly and cautiously braked too early around curves and held up progress until the mercedes grew impatient and started tailgating the hyundai pulled aside and let the benz and the rover pass aaron got in front too hoping rory wouldnt turn off on some side lane he didnt staying on the canyon all the way to sunset switching on his left turn signal well before the intersection both cars headed east on the boulevard three blocks later rory slowed just west of coldsnakes black stucco and red lavarock façade the usual fools were lined up behind a black velvet rope a samoan doorman in a white leather jumpsuit and a toosmall bowler scowled just to keep in practice his bulk obscured the entrance stoltzs hyundai had the nerve to pull behind a ruby stretch hummer and a limegreen lamborghini gallardo the little car looked like a wart on the hummers ass aaron waited for mr derby to wave the kid out of there instead the samoan allowed the hyundai to stay seconds later rory got waved in fools craning to see whod earned the privilege mr allamerican kid had vip status at one of the hottest clubs in town virgin indeed chapter moe reed drove to the peninsula hotel noon was approaching and he figured he had a decent chance at catching martha stoltz on her lunch break the hotel parking valet regarded his unmarked as if it carried disease moe handed him the keys keep it safe its scheduled for the lead position at daytona the valet pretended deafness inside the lobby was full of highend tourists and industry types it took moe twenty minutes of wangling his way up the managerial command to locate martha in an empty banquet room conferring with half a dozen roomservice waiters she spotted moe and her lips folded inward as if shed just downed a laundrysoap martini she was a tall leathery woman with efficient copper hair a strong chin and downslanted eyes she resumed talking some of the waiters watched moe his phone vibrated in his pocket liz saying hi he texted back tied up hr ok big m as he clicked off martha stoltz adjourned the meeting and the waiters dispersed afternoon mrs stoltz has something come up since we talked this morning if only said moe tension around the downslanted eyes pulled them level deep green with amber flecks then i dont understand like i told you maam im updating maam hows rory what hes doing where can i reach him we already covered that we really didnt maam you told me i shouldnt be talking to him youre making it sound like im being like im hindering you im not detective reed i just dont want rory subjected to any more stress being questioned was that stressful for him honest people arent used to dealing with the police detective being asked the same questions over and over wouldnt that bother you and now you show up unannounced in the middle of a workday simply because im his mother that stresses me im truly sorry maam i figured i might catch you on break martha stoltzs laughter was brittle break whats that busy day huh busy life detective reed this place is a small city i cant afford to be distracted please dont take this the wrong way but i find it extremely offputting having my son harassed im not aware of any harassment maam the clipboard shifted from one hand to the other ive watched enough of those police shows to know the attention always falls on someone the victim knew but youve already covered everything with rory moe rocked on his heels if it was my kid id feel the same way maam unfortunately the case is being reopened comprehensively waiting for her reaction none if rory doesnt want to talk to me thats his prerogative but that would make you more suspicious she said its a catch is he still at pepperdine junior yearoh no dont humiliate him by coming onto campus humiliate him the police showing up in front of his peers how would you like that moe thought she was overreacting and heck if that didnt make him wonder fair enough he said where else can i reach him he still lives at home but i cant give you an exact schedule hes an adult detective comes and goes as he pleases moe said does he still work at the riptide riptide said martha stoltz theres no the her knowing look said hed just failed a vital exam and no he doesnt work there shortly after caitlin went missing he had to leave had to anything that reminded rory of caitlin was difficult he grieved detective where does he work now the clipboard pressed against her chest he registered with a temp agency wanted to concentrate on his studies and not be tied down to a rigid schedule is he temping for anyone currently hesitation mrs stoltz i dont want to put rorys job in jeopardy by telling me who he works for if you come looking for him while hes on the job hell be finished he loves this job detective the pays excellent and we have two more years of tuition then law school if he chooses to go that way maam i can call every agency in town until i find out what i need why dont we just keep it simple and mason book okay he works for mason book as a personal assistant delivering the news with resentment but also some pride the actor said moe instantly aware of how stupid that sounded no the podiatrist martha stoltz said now you see why discretion is so important part of rorys job is shielding mason from unwanted publicity calling the star by his first name meaning rory probably did good old la informality or martha stoltz had been reading too many stupid tabloids thought celebs were her buddies theyre just like us no theyre not he said is mason doing okay with what from what i understand hes had personal problems kind of an understatement given the actors drug issues and wellpublicized suicide attempt last year they all have personal problems marthas eyes circled the banquet hall from the a list on down to the ds theyreworking here for fifteen years i could tell you stories she stiffened but i wont and neither will rory maam said moe i couldnt care less if mason book grows two additional heads or turns purple when he drinks same for any lister from a through z im here to find out what happened to a nice young woman named caitlin frostig toughguy bravado in his voice now whos acting i know that man is suffering caitlins father i phoned him shortly after caitlin vanished to offer support one parent to the other he thanked me and hung up and i realized id been stupid presuming i had something to offer him empathys damn weak tea detective her eyes drooped i lost a child myself seventeen months before rory was born her name was sarah she had the most gorgeous brown eyes youve ever seen and she was three months old when i found her in her crib not breathing im sor when rory was nine his father passed so i figured i could offer mr frostig something by way of understanding but no one can ever really know how anyone feels thats just poppsych nonsense were put on this planet for a few years just us and our shadows detective reed maybe theres someone up there pulling the strings i dont know anyone who tells you he does know wants your money or is trying to get elected to something maam rorys a good boy please dont put his job at risk its perfect for him gives him a toehold in the industry rory wants to act rory wants to be an entertainment lawyer or maybe an agent its all about connections he was so lucky to connect right at the top mason may have had personal issues but he treats rory well and rory loves working for him softening her voice hes really a nice young man mason i mean rory brought him here for breakfast and i served him personally and he couldnt have been more gracious great said moe what is success hasnt made him obnoxious yes she said that is nice isnt it chapter riptide was ripe with the odors of tequila aftershave and slightly rancid cooking oil liana parlat took a stool at the far end of the sparvarnished bar aware of male eyes shifting as she crossed the length of the room long dark room kind of tunnellike off to one side a doublewidth doorway led to a small dining area no one in there she could see the action was at cocktail central a few couples in their thirties the rest men batching it beach boys on soundtrack dont worry baby her favorite made it easy to smile the smile snagged the ponytailed bartenders attention and she ordered a grey goose greyhound rocks twist pink grapefruit juice if you have it ponytail grinned sorry just regular thats fine i can splash in a little cranberry if youd like for color you know said liana maybe i would rather have a seabreeze good choice the guy got to work and seconds later the extralarge cocktail was set down in front of her orange slice which she liked maraschino which was all wrong yum she said enjoy sipping slowly she took in the flavor of the place good vibrations came on nice but earlier stuffthe surf songswouldve fit better with the décor she figured it was mostly original rough plank cedar walls lacquered coils of hemp rope ships lamps circular glass balls a couple of buoys at least two captains wheels she could spot and she bet there were more in the dining room all of it probably a throwback to the bars previous life as a workingclass drinkery before arriving shed revved up the old mac and read up on the place found a threeyearold gushing travel piece from the times that emphasized a festive jimmy buffett ambience and the occasional spontaneous appearance of celebs britney paris brangelina mel mason even the governator supposedly they favored the meyer rum tsunami as if anything those people did was spontaneous inane but what else could you expect from a paper where half the entertainment articles were press releases fed by studio publicists obsolete too because liana found no recent namedrops so any star appeal was history celebs like sharks needed to keep moving to breathe not that she needed the internet to know that when shed walked over from loews there wasnt a pappo or limo in sight a few homeless guys though aaron had been right about that one of them gave her the willies as his watery eyes followed her twentyyard traipse and she imagined him snagging caitlin and dragging her into an alley rather than ignore him she stopped and stared him down chancy move but she had to follow her instincts the bum shrank back resumed pushing his cart up ocean clattering and bumping on sidewalks long in need of repair too bad those guys didnt have to hang special license plates from their carts i m cray zee she sipped and used her eyes discreetly someone at the other end of the bar laughed the track switched to jan and dean dead mans curve eerily prophetic of jans auto crash happy song about tragedy at least the floors were clean oak no sawdust cliché liana knew all about clichés she trucked in them for a living using her voice to sell feminine hygiene products grocery specials whatever using her looks and her brains to gig for aaron not exactly what shed dreamed about back in south dakota but at her stage in life any role came up you took it tonight shed gone for sultry but subdued black vneck sweater with a triangle of white cammie hiding some but not all of her cleaves snug gray woollycra slacks that hugged her like a lover the absence of panty line suggested bare skin underneath but her entire lower body was sheathed in support hose everyone said she looked young for her age but liana prided herself on selfawareness so no sense pretending butt and belly were the way theyd been when she auditioned for playboy twenty years ago a starlets entire lifetime sometimes it seemed like yesterday shed walked out of the playboy session beaming at the photo editors praise two days later he called to let her down gently twentyfour hours after that he phoned to ask her out the perfect retort had jumped into her head sorry but i limit my social life to men with normal penises shed said sorry luigi but im involved with someone twentytwentyone years ago gawd a baritone voice said come here often just loud enough to rise above the music liana glanced to her right the nervously smiling face she encountered belonged to a slightly overweight but decentlooking guy around her own age working a beer mug sandy hair five oclock shadow nice masculine features hed probably been hot ten years ago dark suit pale blue dress shirt open at the collar sensible shoes whats a nice girl like you doing in a place like this he said glad i worked out this morning cause i can tell youre no easy pickup your mother must have been a sculptor cause youre in great shape i thought perfection was an ideal until about a second ago liana stared he shrugged smiled despite herself lianas lips curved in imitation the guy said now that ive used up all the fresh material id better lug out the hackneyed stuff you write for leno if i did he wouldnt be beating out letterman he extended a hand steve rau in lieu of pressing flesh liana gave a small salute and returned to facing forward her top had ridden up exposing an inch of back she tugged it down moved her head in time with the music ouch said rau but goodnaturedly lianas peripheral vision spotted motion his hand gesturing for another beer as it arrived liana managed another of her famous sidelongs and took in the cut of his suit decent but nothing custom or exceptional the shirt was pinpoint oxford cloth eighty bucks give or take the shoes were nondescript black loafers but they did look like calfskin bottom line solid not junk not haute maybe nordstrom working for aaron shed picked up a few things steve rau said id offer to buy you another but you havent made much headway on the first and you might go military on me again aping the salute liana chuckled the bartender said some nuts or shrimp steve no thanks gus you come here often aaron just wanted her to soak up the atmosphere but here was an opportunity she rehearsed an entry line discarded it searched for another rau made it easy for her by saying this is my second beer and my last for the record liana swiveled gracefully gifted him with more face and body the warm sincere smile you are nothing if not temperate temperate sane dependable gus can vouch for me is gus called upon to do that regularly rau got flustered laughed only for the last three months he showed her his left hand pale circle of skin on the ring finger as they say an amicable split liana said didnt know that was possible its not oops dont worry said rau im not going to get all maudlin and mawkish a dual guarantee huh the music veered back to the beach boys little deuce coupe the two of them sipped in silence liana working slowly because that was her style even when she wasnt on the job a man needed to be kept slightly off balance she said seeing as youre a regular you know im not visiting la i ask because sometimes women come over from the hotel no im a native if you didnt count military bases in six other states rara avis said rau rare bird quo vadis said liana non sequitur ipso facto so steve what do you do other than drink heineken and indulge yourself in latin rau motioned to the bartender gus what do i do when im not hunched over in selfpity gus said youre a spy doubleo something huh rau said gus is embroidering i work at randthe think tank were not far from here on main you get paid to think the official title is security analyst as in stocks and bonds as in shoe bombers and suicide belt morons some edge had crept into the mellow baritone but im not going to insult your intelligence by making it out as some covert civilian contractor deal my degrees in economics i play with statistics try to spot trends lately i have been doing more financial analysis than security its about as exciting as watching beard stubble sprout still said liana at least you know youre doing something important how many people can say that on some lofty theoretical plane i guess thats true but half my time is filling out grant applications and going to meetings i used to do something even more bloodstirring want to guess college professor rau stared its that obvious youve got a phd i said i had a degree i extrapolated rau laughed liana said stanford chicago whered you teach community college all that came up were nontenured positions so i switched gears i was really committed to teaching figured rand would be temporary its been twelve years so much for spotting trends liana smiled silence settled between them for several moments before rau spoke up so what do you dofill in name here laura she said fishing out the alias shed used for the playboy shoot because it didnt sound that different from her real name laura layne sometimes she carried pink satin business cards in her purse had she brought any tonight twentyone years ago rau said same question laura what occupies your days im in between obligations she said my cv includes teaching preschool executive assisting interior designing housesitting and before all that waitressing big surprise ah said rau how many pilots have you been in its that obvious rand doesnt pay me for not reading big print well said liana rand wouldnt have gotten their moneys worth this time actings not my thing like i said im a california native not some kid off the bus from iowa sorry said rau for assuming may i dig myself out by suggesting you take it as a compliment as in looks like an actress liana swiveled on her stool and offered him a full view of the goods i get that all the time and yes i do take it as a compliment rau mimed wiping his brow phewso i ask this at great riskof all the gin joints i was at loews having dinner with friends it broke up early theyre all married with kids and needed to return to their mundane lives i wasnt quite ready for a quiet night with kurt vonnegut slaughterhousefive welcome to the monkey house never read that one i met joseph heller once catch did you yup said rau i was in fifth grade and he gave a speech at the u and my dad was on faculty therein the med schooland he insisted on taking me wanting me to soak up some antiwar fervor at ten i was pretty apolitical dad wasnt dad was a highly principled man putting rough emphasis on the word and for a second raus face toughened up anger turned him appealingly masculine liana said so he dragged you along he dragged me and after the speech he insisted we both go up to heller going on about how the guys a genius meanwhile id daydreamed through the whole thing dad pumps hellers hand makes sure i shake too then he goes off on this big oration about catch being the ultimate antiwar masterpiece heller looks at him and says its not about war its about bureaucracy poor dad it fazed him but only temporarily during the ride home he informed me authors sometimes didnt understand their own motivation motivation said liana a med school prof im putting money on psychiatrist raus smile was wide warm nice teeth you should think about rand like theyd take me youd be surprised i sure would several beats so youre in between obligations said rau sounds nice it can be rau scratched his temple laura im not good at this but since youve already had dinner i know suggesting we shift to the dining area is out of the question so is i imagine blowing this gin joint i didnt hear a question in there steve but yes i think ill stay put rau beat his breast bowed his head aargh hopes dashed asunder liana touched his jacket sleeve smooth fabric maybe better than shed initially appraised steve i wouldnt be a very smart girl if i waltzed off with someone i just met of course would it be totally out of line asking you for your number poor guy was blushing why dont you give me yours liana expected another burst of selfdeprecation but he seemed pleased as he fished into his pocket drew out a battered wallet then a rand business card on the surface everything looked kosher easy enough to verify she slipped the card into her purse this one might come in handy steve rau said anyway like i said im really not good at this practice practice practice said liana giving him another arm pat how long has riptide been around the change of subject relaxed rau as riptide maybe five years it got that name when some movie honchos bought it no one famousproducers and the like before that it was a neighborhood bar called smileys before that it was the riptide i dont know exactly how old it is but probably at least forty years making that sound antique liana suppressed a flinch no more the she said industry honchos thought it was hipper no they were cheap a storm knocked down part of the sign they stuck on that neon martini glass instead subtle said liana rau chuckled this is tragic laura what is i meet a highly intelligent woman who looks like a movie star and shes smart enough not to be impulsive liana smiled i guess if you did agree to go off with me id wonder about your judgment he shrugged story of my life ambivalence and secondguessing my ex said it drove her crazy my lack of quote unquote constructive recklessness why it took eleven years and division of assets for her to reach that insight she couldnt explain deep blush sorry that was stunningly awkward and inappropriate hey said liana youve been through it three months is pretty fresh papers came through three months ago weve been separated for three years his look said it had taken him a long time to give up hope steve i for one appreciate that you understand about the need for caution a girl cant be too careful even in a nice place like this rau didnt answer it is a nice place she asked never seen a brawl said rau and gus keeps his eye on the in ebriation level yeah its nice back when the celebs used to show up two three years agoit could get a little different different how long stays in the bathroom he touched his nose obviously underage girls fake ids people getting up and dirtydancing when the music didnt call for it sounds like fun gobs laura i stopped coming for a while things are a lot quieter now and im sure the owners are feeling it in the pocketbook but i for oneand ill bet i speak for all the regularsdont miss those days celebs said liana they do get entitled rau got more aggressive with his beer taking two deep gulps he dribbled a tad and wiped his lips with his napkin how come the egomaniacs dont come here anymore steve they moved on laura thats what they do its all about the next big thing ah she said rau emptied his mug looked over at the bartender but when gus pointed to the tap he shook his head liana said so two years since its been celebbed up two three heres the irony laura back then with all the bodyguards and drivers and such hanging around youd think it wouldve been safer than milk but thats when there were some problems he wrapped both hands around the empty mug the music had switched to brian wilson singing about the wonders of his room what kind of problems steve forget it said rau last thing i want to do is spook you because i do want you to come back staring at her soft brown eyes liana said im a big girl not importantancient history come on steve i dont spook easily rau knuckled his forehead brilliant rau what happened im not saying it had anything to do with this place im sure it didnt because it happened outside oh lord im bad at being single liana wet her lips with seabreeze shed taken in maybe a quarter ounce felt sharp and on her game as she waited the guy out he said you really want to know i do a girl who worked herein the dining room as a hostessback then they served more foodshe left after her shift was over and was never seen again but nothing happened to her herewere talking a year and a half ago something like that so i guess some celebs were still here at least thats the way i remember it the irony like i said then something else happened shortly after a couple tourists staying at loews dropped in for a few drinks and also vanished that i heard on the news they mentioned riptide as the last place the couple was seen after that i stayed away i can see why you were spooked not spooked just maria had broken off marriage counseling i was by myself im sorry now youll never come back steve i do not allow myself to be ruled by the misfortunes of others laura all i do day in and day out is immerse myself in the misfortunes of others this afternoon it was devising algorithms to predict the correlation between economic downturns and the rise of insurgency in malaysia hows it looking for malaysia you dont want to know suddenly he stood taller than shed thought and really not that heavy hint of a soft little gut but broad square shoulders and long stronglooking legs tossing bills on the bar he held out his hand great to meet you laura i mean that this time liana pressed flesh his was cool dry smooth if for some reason you do come back i hope its a night that im here sighing he pressed his lips to her fingers dropped her hand quickly and shook his head and muttered dork before she could reassure him he was gone poor steve said someone up the bar that wife of his really racked him up chapter half the cookie said liz wilkinson moe reed said pardon as in oreo we are fifty percent of a cookie baby or maybe seventy seeing as all the crèmes here reaching under his butt she squeezed her smooth brown body rested atop the hard bunches and swells of his pale freckled musculature hips touching everything glued together theyd finally stopped kissing he said didnt oreo used to be a dis black on the outside white on the inside im adapting it for my own purposes creative im glad you agree she laughed he loved that sound moments later liz with an oreo the dark parts all crusty and the crème is soft isnt this more like a reverse oreo she propped herself up looked into his eyes now youre a philosopher he craned to kiss her when their lips parted he pressed his mouth to her long smooth neck she lowered her weight back onto him mr literal im with a trained scientist i want to be accurate he rubbed her back trained scientist natural gorgeous liz smiled to herself felt the sting of bone against bone and shifted her pelvis the movement an innocent attempt at comfort produced a new swell below i can tell youre sincere detective reed because the forensic evidence is in plain sight she sat herself up ran her hands over those slablike pectorals knowing what human skeletal muscles looked like beneath the sliver that was skin visualizing moes striated sheath the boy was solid rockhard everywhere she touched him stroked him he looked up at her wideeyed guiding him back in she rocked slowly doing it at first for his sake because boys behaved better when they were satisfied to the point of stupor but soon they were fitting so perfectly and moving so perfectly lizs eyes closed and her head began swaying flaps of her long hair grazing moes chest she straightened her locks religiously but some texture remained and he said he liked that now the ends tickled his nipples and he turned his head to one side oh man shifting his hands to her breasts she said exactly twenty minutes later they sat at the breakfast room table of her condo on fuller avenue off melrose drinking peach fresca and eating takeout deli sandwiches the neighborhood was intensely ironic postmodern hipster but liz had no interest in any of that for all the time she spent at home a motel wouldve served just as well mother and father had chipped in for the down payment tossed in some extra for furniture one day shed have to buy something nicer than the foldable card table at which they were eating ikea cases to hold all her books the mattress on her bedroom floor meanwhile the simple life served quite nicely thank you moe sure didnt care about interior decorating his own place in the valley was neat and clean but except for that gym it looked like a college dorm room lots of books there too pleasant surprise she watched him chomp his sandwich skinless turkey breast because of the cholesterol issue liz had ordered the same even though she preferred beef love mother had always preached was all about compromise if only mother knew one month out of a stanford phd in physical anthro lizs dissertation on microchanges in humidity and visceral muscle decomposition had landed her a postdoc with eleanor hargrove at the lapdaffiliated bone lab the following year funding came up for a real job at the lab and liz snagged it the position meant long hours spent with mummified skin studying the finer points of rot and shred the awful detritus that came with finality lots of travel to conferences because eleanor wanted the lab to get exposure all of which liz had expected and generally relished what hadnt been in the game plan was hooking up with a guy let alone one whose formal education had ended with a criminal justice ba from cal state northridge lizs parents were full professors with yale degrees poli sci at howard for mother sociology at gw for father she still hadnt told them about moe the first time she and moe met she was waistdeep in marsh muck pulling up frags of human skeleton moe the first d at the scene had stood on the banks conferred with hargrove not noticing liz at all then hed spotted her and darn if he didnt take a second look long second look shed been intrigued by him from the beginning so young and intensethat earnest boyishness you didnt see much anymore cute too in a celtic way when he asked her out she accepted without hesitation despite the fact that moe wasnt her type lightyears from her type her upbringing in the rarefied world of black academia had funneled her dating contacts to articulate men with advanced degrees and accomplishments to match men whose skin tone matched hers half a cookie moe reached over and touched her hand in that gentle way she adored the athletics of the previous hour had rubbed him pink in spots and the blotches hadnt faded delicate boy he never tanned strawberry yogurt was the last thing liz had figured shed ever find attractive go know she kissed his knuckles he said you are unbelievable keep thinking that moses i always will he assured her like a sixyearold promising to be good not a trace of postmodern irony that was a novelty shed rehearsed her little speech a hundred times hes highly intelligent mother intuitive anything but simple all of it true but it rang hollow trying too hard she was twentynine and moe was barely that both of them paying their own bills they didnt have to answer to anyone right he finished his sandwich she pushed half hers toward him im full finish it thanks five bites did the trick hungry boysometimes liz couldnt help but think in kid terms when she was with him she adored the way he held on to the guileless part of himself despite the job wondered how the job would play at the georgetown salons mother favored no she didnt she knew how hed be treated he got up and cleared the table rolled his neck liz said got a crick not really she stepped behind him and massaged that incredibly dense hunk of neck oh wow thats great any reason for all these knots detective reed not really two beats later im back fulltime on caitlin pressure from above thatll screw up the trapezius all right hey he said no big deal ill work it i know you will but sorry for the hassle baby anything interesting at the lab no new cases she said catching up on grant applications he turned to face her slipped his arm around her waist want your own massage no thanks youve loosened me up quite well sir he smiled a flicker of anxiety sprinted across his eyes splitsecond storm then it was gone what she said its a loser liz you cant create facts on the ground baby i know it sticks me with a crappy close rate right at the outset you closed the marsh murders moses sturgis really did that now that i wont listen to moses you and sturgis its not like he didnt give you credit hes a gentleman maybe so said liz but he was only doing what was right yeah aarons on caitlin too that caught her off balance howd that happen caitlins fathers boss is footing his bill aaron thinks all he needs to do is chew through enough billable hours and hell close it oh sure maybe hes right liz at this stage how would he know if its closable or not she said moe didnt answer she massaged him some more cmon lets get mindless and watch some tube sure said moe but the evening had changed during the months liz and moe had dated shed met aaron fox exactly once six seven weeks ago while walking up the leafy pathway to moes moms house meeting maddy for the first timean experience in itself halfway up a black man appeared around a bend moe tensed up and for a second liz wondered if the guy posed some sort of threat a brief handshake and moes curt introductions dispelled all that but the entire time moe never relaxed aaron on the other hand had been nothing but mellow one of those people who make you feel youve been friends for years growing up in dc shed seen that brand of charisma in politicians and financial types distrusted it instinctively as moe and aaron made small talk on the pathway liz tried to figure out how moe knew him maybe another cop then what was he doing visiting moes mom sensing a long story she bided her time a personal trainer no something more he definitely had made her baby tense maybe moms young black boyfriend aware that she categorized people too quickly she still couldnt stop herself good looking but spends way too much time at the mirror great clothes same issue hed been nothing but polite with polished diction and intelligent eyes but way too smooth what liz termed upper division player not all that different from the guys shed dated prior to moe minus the ivy league polish what did he do for a living a lawyer making a house call possibly or something in show businessan agent moe said maddy had once aspired to stage and screen never got very far or an acting coach guy was handsome enough and the clothes and that snappy little porsche out by the curb said he was doing just fine or pretending this was la maybe thats why he came across as instant friendexpecting to be recognized liz couldnt recall ever seeing him on anything by the time hed walked off shed compiled a dossier moe watched the porsche speed away a browwrinkling frown implying disapproval conspicuous consumption wasnt moes game something else he and liz had in common elizabeth mae you really need to make more of the looks god gave you the sports car was long gone but moe continued to stare down the street liz took hold of his treetrunk arm cmon i want to meet the woman who gifted you to the world they resumed their walk liz couldnt control herself does aaron work with your mother hes my brother as in he aint heavy as in sibling no really baby seriously i wish i was kidding over the next few weeks liz teased out details of the brothers upbringing both of their fathers had been cops both were deceased maybe that was the issue one dad stepping in for another all that blendedfamily tension if so mama had made her sons lives even more complicated an apparent serial marrier madeleine fox reed guistone entley but we dont talk about entley dear had buried her third husband fifteen years ago a wealthy orthodontist and visionary entrepreneur stan guistone had invested in enough real estate to ensure his widow a lovely lifestyle two years after his death shed tried yet again divorced shiftless bum entley within months the woman kept framed photo portraits of hubbies one two and three propped on her bedroom dresser a fact that liz had gleaned during that same sunday visit after ducking into maddys private bathroom because the main one was occupied by moe two cops in uniform and a squat beetlebrowed whitehaired man in a widelapeled suit aaron was a clone of his father moe was built heavier and thicker than his father and his fine symmetrical features were maddys but the coloring was there maybe something around the eyes the ears too officer darius fox rip officer john jasper reed rip dr stanley edgar guistone dds mph mba ditto the woman was bad news for the morbiditymortality stats three husbands two kids if shed had a child with dr g the poor thing mightve ended up looking like a depressed raccoon now curiosity about moes family history was nibbling her brain even harder but she resolved to take it slow pushing issues didnt work with most men and it sure wouldnt work with moe between her travel and the openended schedule of a homicide detective the two of them needed to use their time together wisely no sense dashing good times with the emotional ice resulting from mention of aarons name still that level of sibling hostility did intrigue her she had two brothers and adored them both sean and jay had suffered through some friction but they got along great now played golf together for gods sake moses and aaron on the other hand a stupid person might assume race was the problem because stupid people always jumped on the obvious solution to explain complex problems the littleperson fallacy she called it in honor of a case during her internship the corpse of a threefooteight woman had been found moldering in a menlo park apartment too decayed for an obvious cod postautopsy dr lieber the medical examiner had asked everyone to guess those brave enough to venture opted for spondyloepiphyseal dwarfism and the health issues that went along with that truth was the woman had smoked three packs a day and died of throat cancer liz had spent enough time with moe to know that he really was that rare colorblind american and now maybe she understood why whatever her effect upon male longevity maddy must have been an independent thinker marrying a black man back when that was still a big deal then a white man from the deep south maybe growing up with aaron had made moe comfortable enough to resent aaron with no fear of the r word coming up but still not comfortable enough with liz to talk about why he couldnt stand his brother maddys house up in the hills teemed with ghosts but as far as liz could see the woman didnt feel haunted unlike her younger son one day liz would figure it out chapter twenty minutes after aaron found a watch spot across the street from coldsnake rory stoltz was still in the club the line in front hadnt moved much though desperate types clung to false hope behind the black rope the whitesuited ape in the bowler did his best to pretend they didnt exist not a paparazzo in sight but that didnt account for stoltz being allowed to park up front and saunter past the bouncer kid was obviously meeting someone inside but a hyundai aaron checked his cell for messages a couple of trash calls and a text from liana back home safe call tmrw motion in front of the club rory stoltz emerged all by himself keeping his eyes on the hyundai aaron pulled away from the curb stoltz drove east to highland avenue traveled south to santa monica boulevard where he headed west making a big loop that seemed pointless unless he was interested in cruising the heart of the gay hooker stroll so maybe this had something to do with alternative lifestyle but what did that have to do with nearly half an hour in a hetero dive like coldsnake aaron followed stoltz as the hyundai sailed by languid young men and heshes in various states of camouflage stoltz never even slowed to look at the goods just kept driving all the way to la cienega where he hooked north and got back on sunset the hyundai continued until it was one block east of coldsnake then turned left one big useless circuit this time stoltz bypassed the scene out front and parked just shy of the alley that ran behind the club switching off his lights but keeping his engine running kids playing some kind of game the logical guess was dope rorys initial stop had been meeting with customers taking orders problem was the kid had just driven around not stopping to pick anything up so maybe the goods had been in the car all the time and stoltz had spun a yarn about taking a special trip to pick up premium product which of course would cost a wee bit more was allamerican boy that clever of a marketing consultant whatever the details he wasnt what he seemed moe had missed the boat completely by dismissing the kid so quickly aaron drove two blocks past the hyundai circled back with his own lights off positioning the opel in a cozy spot three houses north he waited for stoltz to get out of the car kid just sat there five minutes ten fifteen at seventeen two figures emerged from the alley and made their way toward the hyundai two men tallish from the shaggy outline of their breezeblown hair and the way they walked white guys as they got closer aaron saw that one was real skinny the other beefy the heavier one seemed to be propping up slim jim midway to the hyundai he paused to look around checking for the cops stoltzs clients came to him easier to rabbit if things got complicated virgin indeed aaron bounced his eyes between the hyundai and the two men ten feet from the car skinny went loose and beefys knees bent as he worked at keeping his pal upright looks like someone doesnt need any more controlled substance as the men approached the hyundais lights switched on and the brights flashed twice the signal for come and get it pathetic addicts beefy walked skinny straight to the hyundai keeping one hand on skinnys arm the other on the passenger door it took a while to tuck skinnys long frame in the back of the car put your hand on his head and press down dude thats how we do it on the job used to do it once beefy had skinny inside he straightened looked to be conversing with stoltz then he slid into the front passenger seat and shut the door onsite smokeup nope stoltz drove away this time the hyundai sped north into the heart of hollywood turned left on selma another gay pickup zone so maybe this was a sex thing rory with two guys still pretending they were straight aarons head spun with possibilities as once again stoltz bypassed corner loiterers drove to laurel canyon hooked right at the first opportunity up a narrow winding side road once the opel turned onto the quiet street aaron squelched his lights hoping some random hollywood division cruiser wasnt out trolling for traffic money the road turned steep and the hyundai stressed its four cylinders climbing zipping around curves making frequent turns chugging up brief obscure lanes lined with darkened hillside houses no streetlamps all aaron needed was a headon with some idiot on a cell phone descending obliviously rory stoltz knew exactly where he was going putting on maximum speed as he spurted along a series of skinny black ribbons of asphalt swinging abruptly onto what at first appeared to be a driveway but turned out to be swallowsong lane a yellow sign warned no outlet aaron parked just short of swallowsongs mouth cut his engine jumped out quickly continued on foot even steeper it paid to stay in shape big houses here lots of foliage high hedges sports cars under tarps nightblooming jasmine sweetened the air nocturnal smog wafting up from hollywood fought that aaron made it to the top just in time to see the hyundai pass through electric gates iron gates supported by stone posts lots of baroque scrolls medallions whatever aaron peeked through saw a curving driveway lined with italian cypress winding out of view address numerals on the left column he copied down the numerals returned to the opel and sat endured two hours of nothing before concluding allamerican boy was unlikely to show himself not a dope deal some kind of party he drove back home flipped the lights on at work land looked up the address on his reverse directory got a phone number hed wait until morning to call assistant technical manager henry q stokes at the assessors office then he remembered that henry sometimes took work home was the guy an earlytobed type if he was too damned bad he tried henrys apartment in west covina seven rings before henrys voice came through on the other end thick with fatigue and irritation its me what the thisll be more than a ulysses said aaron two benjamins so dont go bitching what time is itoh shit its two twenty man top of that you screwed up a dream about paris hilton and her mom one oh oh one swallowsong lane hollywood hills henry breathed hoarsely aaron said did you get that it cant wait two dr franklins sound like it can you could drive down tomorrow check it out yourself thats always true and yet i call you henry were talking exigent circumstances more like an exigent expense account yours is not to question why mr stokes aaron repeated the address henry said two twenty for thatare you taping this why would i be henry cause thats what pis do its one thing at work i use an extension open to everyone this is my friggin home line i dont tape that guy with the mafia connections he probably said the same thing mafia bullshit said aaron mario fortuno hes a wannabe henry not to mention a resident of the federal penitentiary at exactly said stokes because he taped i dont tape my friends henry and whats the big dealyoure accessing public records for a small fee free enterprise im so reassured why would i want myself on tape said aaron no answer henry have we ever had anything but cordial business relat yeah yeah which is why calling at two thirty in the morning isnt exactly friendly i was sleeping man that dream two hundreds worth waking up for my friend two plus an additional fifty for fantasy theft not a chance you had to be there man said stokes you think paris is hot you should see her fine said aaron two bens and a general grant stokes sighed ill never get the moment back hold on ninety seconds later he returned to the line voice clearer youre getting a bargain dude and i dont want to be associated with any part of this no matter how many dead prezzes show up for the party who owns the house said aaron you dont know if i knew why would i be calling you verification said henry i cant verify something i dont know hank and as you always remind me i can always drive down to that moldy archive you guys keep and find out myself not exactly said henry this case you drive down and paw through the ledgers what youre gonna learn is that the deed is owned by a holding company called malibu sunset trust and thats all youre gonna learn you on the other hand know that aaron you really need to promise me this isnt going to go anywhere public and that you dont tape i promise said aaron i mean it dude i promise henry said the tax trail leads from this malibu sunset outfit to vision associates inc of beverly hills to newport management trust then clear out of state seven stars management las vegas your basic paper chain said aaron now give me a person henry breathed hard vegas said aaron youre worried about some mob thing dont sweat it the place is all corporate now people in stretch pants and bermuda shorts lining up at the buffet henry said lem dement aaron checked his own surprise his mind swelled and pulsed and raced henry said nowm going back to sleep maybe if i really behave paris and kathy will show up again hey maybe the sister whatshername will also put her little aaron hung up and switched off the voiceactivated tape recorder the internet could be aarons best friend but with someone like lem dement overkill could render his computer useless a single jab at the enter button flushed out page after page of blogocrap he started with wikipedia and fanned out lemuel houston dement born in flint michigan fiftyfour years ago had been raised by a uaw organizer and a ford motor secretary both admirers of trotsky houston and althea dement despised capitalism on general principles loathed their respective jobs in specific raised their only child with a borderlineparanoid worldview taught that school was just another bourgeois trap young lem obliged with chronic misbehavior and rotten grades that belied his iq a month after high school graduation he was riveting axle bolts on the ford assembly line ten months of that lit up the exit sign in his head and he gave community college a try decent grades enabled a transfer to wayne state studying sociology for three years then transferring to u michann arbor where he talked his way into the film school once in he chased women smoked dope and dropped acid did minimal work barely passed cursed with a sluggish metabolism that heaped on pounds and a face reminiscent of a boiled potato dement was compensated with a sour yet strangely appealing charisma that made him moderately successful with women a gift for dialogue and the ready quip and most important an innate understanding of how to lie with a camera nearly thirty and broke he slept with the right woman and lucked into a gig directing industrial safety training loops by day he shot his closeups of snarling machinery spliced with stock footage of mangled limbs nights were spent on his art pseudodocumentaries starring friends and neighbors that highlighted the malevolence of every corporation in a new york times interview years later dement described those days i never spent a second in therapy but i sure understood my true motivation my parents thought what i did was fascistlackey garbage and i wanted to redeem myself in their eyes then they died in a house fire i was a basketcase for a long time but in the end being orphaned freed me twentytwo months after learning his parents had left more debt than estate dement wrote directed filmed and exhibited a docudrama about pollution in lake erie at the ann arbor film festival maybe it was the deliberately grainy use of black and white maybe he was just ahead of his time no one paid much attention to brown water next came an exposé of an alleged cabal among gm the catholic church and the zionist organization of america half of dements crew quit over that one several lean years followed during which dement pushing forty married to a former dancer and saddled with a slew of kids worked as a truck driver and a drywall installer then a populist assembly candidate from flint named eddie fixland needed someone to produce campaign commercials on a shoestring budge dement got the job by working for free fixland won his seat in the house and though two years of scandal got in the way of reelection his campaigns classwarfare ads featuring long shots of dying rustbelt towns and sunkencheeked retirees living in trailers caught everyones attention dement became the goto guy when you wanted hardedged cinémapolitique he grew prosperous moved to a big house in bir mingham rewrote and reshot his lake erie film using a bigger budget full color megadoses of the innuendo and hyperbole hed perfected working for fixland brown water version ii was nominated for an oscar won a statuette lem made a brief nasty speech moved to la took meetings fielded offers using other peoples money he shot an exposé of emergency room practices spiced with gobbets of gore inspired by his factoryaccident flicks red rooms was nominated for an oscar and mightve won if a heartrending portrayal of a nineyearold blind poet prodigy hadnt surfaced just before the submission deadline upon hearing the verdict lem was reputed to have fidgeted in his seat at the kodak theatre and murmured how can you beat a fucking walleyed helen keller incarnation he denied the quote the next two years saw dements fortunes dip as he tried his hand at serious cinema a tale of shakespearean lust garnered more plagiarism suits than profit a historical action film depicting both sides in the civil war as slavering selfserving barbarians went straight to video as did a postmodern shakeup of othello that recast the tragedy as a metaphor for the arabisraeli impasse with a villain named iago bernstein lem dements name faded from the buzzosphere as did tabloid shots of the now threehundredpound artiste at the right parties bursting out of a custom tuxedo his trademark limpbrimmed fishing hat studded with lures perched jauntily on a massive grizzled head dement went into seclusion to center myself emerged three years later with a fourhour unspeakably violent depiction of the earliest days of christianity shot during a thirtytwomonth stay in turkey given its creators sensibilities everyone expected saul to paul the moment to be an indictment of organized religion what they got instead was a paean to the severest aspects of fundamentalist dogma that trumpeted the virtues of forced conversion and portrayed arabs phoenicians mesopotamians and jews as hooknosed heretics in a fullpage variety ad lem dement announced ive been born again in the truest sense my art and my heart are now focused upon sacraments of truth purity and redemption quickly condemned as racist agitprop by the hollywood establishment and the mainstream press and protested serially by muslim and jewish civil rights groups the film enjoyed a limited release in leased art houses and church auditoriums word of mouth grew theater chains signed on within three months saul to paulhad taken in four hundred million dollars foreign revenues added another hundred fifty lem dement announced his retirement to a life of contemplation and moved to a multiacre estate in malibu same city where rory stoltz went to school honing his industry ambitions where caitlin frostig had gotten straight as aaron pushed back from the screen paced his office malibu was more a concept than a locale stretching thirty miles up the coast but the pepperdinecaitlinrory link couldnt be ignored aaron considered waking henry again to find out if lem dements spread was anywhere near the sprawling campus decided against it if henry had managed to revisit his dream busting his fantasy a second time would breed too much ill will plus at the early stages of the investigation he needed to be careful about tunnel vision caitlin goes to school in ditto rory rory has the gate clicker to a hollywood hills house owned by dement whose main crib is in he flashed back to the house on swallowsong the winding driveway implied a bigview lot highpriced real estate maybe the place housed one of the stoners rory had chauffeured in a hyundai had to be camouflage so did leaving the club through the back that was celeb behavior was oneor bothof the stoners a vip that synced with rory waltzing into coldsnake aaron returned to the keyboard paired rory stoltz with lem dement and googled did you mean demented roar no i didnt meddling cyberwienie he sat there for a long time feeling his brain turn to sludge three ten am what he craved was sinking his teeth into the case ripping and shredding like a rabid dog until the facts bled what he did was slog upstairs to play land undress fold his clothes neatly over the brassandteak valet slip naked between frette sheets guessing caitlins face would appear in his dreams he hoped she would back when hed been on the job hed embraced the classic homicide ds selfcongratulation we talk for the dead and sometimes the dead talk to us chapter moe arrived at his desk at eight am thinking about the rory stoltzmason book connection two messages from aaron sat next to his computer crumpling and lobbing easy twopointers into a nearby wastebasket he googled the actor nearly four million hits midway down the second page were accounts of books earlymorning suicide attempt by wristslash paramedics responding to a call at the hollywood hills house of heartthrob facts were in short supply but no shortage of lurid rehash anonymous sources claimed mason book was addicted to every drug known to humankind the hushhush vip admission to cedarssinai had cost a heavy six figures for a oneweek stay moe found a couple of grainy dark infrared shots of a guy who mightve been book being ushered into a black suv at a hospital service door another hit quoted a plea by books unnamed mouthpiece to respect masons privacy during this difficult period mason needs to concentrate all his energies on getting well he thanks everyone for their support moe was about to log off when he noticed the date of books wristslash printing the citation he left the d room turned around a sharp corner hustled over to the familiar unmarked door and knocked yeah its moe loo s not locked the room was so small that opening the door brought sturgiss rhino frame into immediate closeup almost like being charged by a bull and after all these months still kind of jarring to moe the lieutenant had squeezed his bulk into a wheelychair long legs propped on his flimsy desk additional cold cases were stacked to the left of a cold computer screen sturgiss heavy jaw flexed got a second loo sturgis removed the cigar and rolled it from finger to finger like a carny doing a trick he pointed to a chair in the corner moe didnt consider himself claustrophobic but he didnt like to be hemmed in he remained standing in the doorway and told the loo about rory stoltz working for mason book riptides past life as a hollywood hangout saving the best for last book had slit his wrists exactly one week after caitlins disappearance sturgis said youre wondering if he did something to her and felt guilty i know its remote loo but right now its all ive got remorse as a motive is predicated on book having a conscience does he dont know sturgis laughedthat vaguely threatening phlegmy chuckle of his hes an actor moses a dopefiend actor which is maybe repetitive but sure check it out why not pick up any new cases nope said reed me neither damn slow for a second moe thought sturgis might offer to work caitlin but the loo just cursed and rubbed his face if the citizens know whats good for them theyll start killing other citizens so we can earn our pay for all the service were offering we might as well be goldbrick politiciansnot that im demeaning all your good work on poor caitlin im demeaning it loo havent learned squat some cases are like that sturgis jammed the cigar back in his mouth picked up a file flipped through it shook his head like this one so cold i could use it to ice my knee sayonara lad moe said one more thing book was admitted to cedars your partner is in charge of the er there right sturgis shut the file moses theres something called doctorpatient confidentiality i know sir i was just wondering if perhaps he could direct me to some kind of source go ask him richard silverman md hes listed in the cedars registry thats okay with you im not his parent moses im hisunfathomable smile partner during moes brief absence aaron had called a third time moes fist closed around the slip with sudden crushing force that surprised him rather than go for the easy layup he aimed at a can fifteen feet across the room swish three points perversely selfsatisfied he got dr richard silvermans number and called silverman sounded busyharried evenand moe dropped the loos name before introducing himself what can i do for you detective kind of frosty no oh yeah hes mentioned you no reason for sturgis to mention him he asked if the doc could direct him to someone with information about mason books hospitalization silverman said i assume you dont mean our official spokespeople thats correct doctor book wasnt my patient but i still cant talk to you not that i would if i could apart from legal issues there are general ethical principles i understand that doctor but you were hoping that because of milo i might relax my standards moe didnt answer silverman said im not trying to give you a hard time its simply something i cant do i understand doctor its just that this is a murder investigation and a really tough one he summarized caitlins disappearance making her out to be a saint pumping more pathos by describing her father as a withering tragic figure silverman said poor girl her mom died when she was young she was all her father had said moe and mason books relevant to this because honestly doc he might not be but i need to follow up on any lead i get turns out caitlins exboyfriend works for book which in and of itself doesnt mean much but then i learned that books suicide attempt happened one week after caitlin disappeared and i felt i had no choice but to a week said silverman im not getting the point itll probably turn out to be nothing doc but what if the boyfriend did collude with book on some terrible deed and book felt guilty and thats why he cut his wrists do you suspect the boyfriend not yet sir then i still dont understand sorry for bothering you doc silverman said book never went through the er got sent straight to special imp you could try someone there but i doubt youll be successful whats special imp as in important vip inpatient ward if you like living dangerously ask milo i got him placed there last year when he got shot whats dangerous about asking him said moe hes not into all that sharethefeelings stuff so you got the loo vipd but that doesnt mean i have a pipeline to anyone at special imp good luck detective reed the unspoken line you ll need it one hour into a more detailed computer search for articles about mason books suicide attempt moes phone rang homicide detective reed three hundred north corsair lane detective reeds proud mother hi mom how are you darling

land at ten am aaron had her check ready she made a show of tucking the paper slowly between her cleavage im jealous he said laughing she removed it dropped it daintily into her kate spade resumed sipping from the demitasse of espresso aaron had brewed in that cute copper italian machine he kept in the kitchenette next to his office yum mr fox you are one class act aaron fooled with a piece of lemon rind nice shirt said liana new nope never seen it before never got around to wearing it before been hanging in the home haberdashery for eleven months tell me about this rand guy dont worry hes for real aaron first thing i did when i got home last night was look him up on their website hes there picture and all does exactly what he said he did chasing terrorists playing with numbers she said government contracts aaron said doesnt mean hes not whack hes not dont be paranoid talking to strangers lee aaron tsktsked i thought that was the point of last night the point was soaking up ambience getting a feel for the place its not the décor you care about its the clientele kind of hard to tease that out without talking to strangers said liana and no doubt dr rau doesnt look like a leprous summer squash liana stared at him youre not serious i care about you lee just because you meet a cute guy stop right there mr fox graceful slim fingers tightened around the demitasse handle though if i had to rely on you for nurturance where would i be aaron aaron slapped his chest i am mortally wounded doing it with levity unlike steve whose chestpound last night had been an outward jest but laced with serious regret liana leaned across the glass slab that formed the top of aarons desk what we have mon amour is a form of aerobics healthy strenuous satisfying for what it is and altogether transitory as opposed to mr rand whos a deeply spiritual guy just brimming with empathy and sensitivity all of which you know from a onehour bar schmooze this is ridiculous she said you gave me an assignment i did it aplus exactly lee youre valuable i want you around for a long time oh for gods sake its not like im dating him but youve considered it liana smiled youre jealous no im protective thank you but im quite capable of taking care of myself liana put her cup down whats gotten into you i just dont like the notion of mixing business with pleasure lianas eyes slitted ill remember that the next time someone bootycalls me at three am she sprang up tossed her hair turned heel wait said aaron sorry yeah im being stupid you mean a lot to meas a friend as a freelance grin as the sexiest firmest stop okay okay sit down please liana exhaled a couple of times please lee she returned to her chair crossed her legs let the jersey skirt ride up all the way to sleek white thigh commandment one make em suffer aaron said i was out of line my excuse is this case i cant put my finger on it but theres a certain i dont know a dark aura circulating around it i know that sounds hokey and i cant give you a rational reason but theres something beneath the surfacesomething psychy going on as in paranormal no no none of that crap as in creepy and sleazy and warped if you tell me theres nothing weird about mr rand ill go with that but dont you think its strange that he mentioned caitlin right off the bat dr rand said liana hes got a phd and it wasnt off the bat there was contexttalking about the bars celeb days the irony of something happening when there were bodyguards all over the place and he didnt mention caitlin by name just by incident plus he told me about the rensselaers and they turned out to be a dead end so its not like hes fixated the rensselaers said aaron glancing at the internet printout liana had brought shed used couple vanishes riptide santa monica as the search heading reproduced an article from the rensselaers hometown of buckeye bridge pennsylvania ivan and bettina formerly owners of an antiques store had cut town to escape a bigtime ebay badcheck mess used their illgotten gain to finance a west coast vacation the fbi had traced the couple to la then lost the scent and gotten sneaky filing a false missing persons report with several socal police agencies and convincing local stations to give the disappearance airplay two days after the broadcast an alert west hollywood sheriff had spotted ivan and bettina leaving dan tana after a huge italian dinner the buckeye bridge beacon reported tomato sauce stains on ivan rensselaers brandnew white silk shirt purchased on rodeo drive aaron said so doctor rau knew about their disappearance but not their being found as i said hes not fixated gets paid to think huh aaron what is it about him thats wedging itself in your buttcrack bringing caitlin up the first time he meets you to me thats just off lee dudes out to pick up a beautiful girl why set the mood with creepy crimeespecially a crime against a female it just doesnt fit it doesnt fit because hes not a player aaron unlike someone else we know hes kind of a nerd actually not physicallyoh whats the diff ill never see him again never intended to happy if you mean it one thing that does come out of it are those bodyguards and limos be harder for a whack to abduct caitlin right outside the bar though she left after her shift so maybe that means nothing still her car was never found so its likely she drove somewhere and got snagged could be anywhere from santa monica to venice or beyond said liana if she got jacked meaning focusing on riptide could be a waste rau mention any celebs by name liana shook her head only names were the ones i showed you from the times a name not on that list just came up lee lem dement that asshole liana hissed be nice if he did have something to do with it her intensity surprised aaron you dont approve of his religious views i dont approve of him because i once caught an upclose look at him and his psyche where and when shortly after that biblical splatter flick of his opened san marino someones gigantic house near caltech not the usual industry types church folk captains of industry grace before the canapés crucifixes on every table back then i didnt know you used to pass trays for a caterer to pay bills it was summer the party was outdoors everyone was dressed for the heat except mrs dementgemma shes wearing a longsleeved black sweater over a chanel frock and way too much makeup what caught my eye was the look in her eyessomething i recognized right away because my older sister hooked up with a guy who beat the crap out of her it was years before that bastard had the courtesy to die i could never convince sybil to leave him gemma looked like an abused woman said aaron not just looked aaron was said liana fury had deepened the blue of her eyes hollow haunted theres no mistaking it when you see it because of my experience with sybil im primed so while i served shrimp on toast i kept sneaking glances at the two of them didnt take long for me to catch it squeezing her arm just a little too tight as he propelled her around the room treating her like a prop never talking to her once when he thought no one was looking he flicked the back of her neck with his fingernail had to sting howd she react she didnt thats the point numb and compliant a good little robot no one except me seemed to notice because everyone was focused on dement all the money he was raking in the fat pig that stupid hat he had fishhooks in his hat with a tux no less no one said a word a few hundred millionll do that said aaron were there any other but wait folks theres more liana held up a finger a while later i go to the ladies roomthis mansion has a giant powder roommakeup area for guestsand gemmas there and shes got her sweater off but when she sees me she snaps it back on but not quickly enough to hide the bruises all up and down her arm im talking livid aaron like shed been put through a compressor i pretend not to stare while she pretends to be apathetic fixes her hair lays on even more pancake but im getting a closeup look and its obvious why shes plastering the stuff on shes got more bruises on her neck and shoulders plus a definite swelling behind her ear this is a woman who gets used regularly as a punching bag she clenched a fist hypocritical asshole please tell me hes involved aaron said it might shake out that way but all ive got right now is a real estate link to who he told her about rory stoltzs earlymorning adventure on the strip the gated estate on swallowsong liana said sneaking a couple of celebs out the back way no idea who too dark too quick too far away said aaron one guy was skinny the other more of a football type neither of them was dement younger thinner aaron dement beats his wife who knows what he does to other women please please tell me youre going to follow up on him of course how old were the two guys stoltz drove home i cant be sure lee could be twenties thirties dement has a whole bunch of kidssix seven hes in his fifties so he could easily have spawn in that range junior living in a house daddy owns maybe but that still says nothing about caitlin the link im following is rory liana grew silent aaron said ill follow up on dement lee i know im being emotional you cant imagine the hell my sister went through and my parents and the rest of us were a closeknit family gordon made all of us bleed aaron had never seen her like this family made things complicated ill bloodhound dement maybe the police have somethingdomestic violence calls covered up aaron stood walked from behind his desk paced liana said whats wrong working with the police on this one its complicated chapter madeleine fox reed guistone was a woman of serene temperament the shifting hues of her tuscaninspired house on half an acre of beverly hills pob hillside suggested otherwise which just went to prove the classic detective caution thought moe assume means make an ass out of u and me as he pushed his unmarked up the junipershrouded lane that led to moms manse his memory dredged up mocha to salmon to sage green to coral to the eyesearing siennaorange mottle hed seen eight weeks ago but he mightve missed a few stages he reached the top expecting something even more outrageous nope still flamerust villa de borghese the pigmentinfused plaster slapped on so thickly the house appeared lumpy random patches of phony exposed brick completed the picture typical pathetic totally la grab for a reality that had never existed in the first place first time hed seen it hed muttered disneyland but told mom it was gorgeous this evening parking in the circular motor court next to his mothers red mercedes convertible the theme park crept back into his consciousness and that brought back memories moe plagued with ear infections and motion sickness as a young boy had always despised the anaheim ode to corny heaving his cookies after a single spin on the teacups meanwhile aarons leaping into a matterhorn car conquering the alps over and over again maddy and moe waiting until he finally got his fill moe clutching his stomach just thinking about the matterhorn contempt on aarons tenyearold face as he points out a crumb of vomit on moes tshirt a guy who called his office space work land some people never got real moe walked past the florentine fountain murky and leafstrewn as usual dribbling happily under a gently setting sun that mom hadnt painted maybe in deference to dr stan guistones memory stan had lived in the house on north corsair for four decades before marrying mom and until hed died shed changed nothing including the photos of his deceased first wife set up like icons on an altar table in the cavernous entry hall during her years with stan mom had windexed miriam guistones portraits religiously poohpoohed his offer to redecorate held on to every stick of miriams clumsy victorian revival furniture shed put up with the original graybeige exterior that even stan thought was dreary dr stan was a good man he deserved that level of consideration one week after he was laid into emeraldgreen forest lawn turf the painters showed up at the house as did the trucks from goodwill byebye agatha christie hello georgia okeeffe delivery vans bearing rooms full of the blocky serapedraped southwest revival motif mom had come to love during her yearly centering trips to santa fe moe crossed the courtyard to the house the front door opened and mom trotted out in ballet slippers her painting smock was a rainbow riot paintpollocked turquoise leggings still channeling georgia with carefully tinted and highlighted chromewhite hair worn waistlength and frenchbraided makeup calculated to look invisible chunky silver and turquoise glinting from fingers wrists neck ears windseamed and thirty soft pounds heavier than her prime maddy looked ten years younger than her sixtythree or so she said everyone said her own mother had been hale at ninetyone when shed died in a car crash genetics and lifestyle one out of two isnt bad boys she ran up to moe threw her arms around his waist and hugged him hard stood back and touched his face as if appraising a sculpture you look great mosey vital and fit and purposeful despite the stress moe kissed her cheek you can tell all that in two seconds a mother knows taking his hand she guided him through the manses big vaulted rooms into the kitchen that looked out over sycamorestudded canyons and the roofs of those less fortunate in the real estate game moe noticed another redo since his last visit some of the cabinetry had been painted turquoise and drawers bore cutouts of eagle heads like it mosey very appropriate use it or lose it said maddy im referring to creativity and changeshaking up the vitals coffee tea postum vodka or red bull youve got red bull no but i can have pink dot deliver she laughed you still take me seriously god bless you so whatll it be how about some water ice or room bubbly or flat ice flat is fine my healthconscious baby here you go a nice chilled bottle of evian which is naïve spelled backward in case you havent noticed moe sat and drank maddy lingered near the eightburner wolf range where a single pot simmered what are you working on artwise mom coloring within the lines she lifted the lid peered inside rabbinic cuisine is nearly ready still on the kosher kick huh said moe ready to convert if the sausages are an indicator maybe i should look into it she straightened her braid peered out the kitchen window at her palm garden offering a profile to moe he saw new wrinkles loosening around the jaw time did its thing no matter what she said no darling as you well know nothing organized is for me including religion ive decided the most tactful approach is to embrace everyones deity but not too seriouslythink of it as constructive idolatry last time you called it theologic diversity that too mosey she sniffed the pot ah the sausages talk about something to pray for maddy ever at war with conventional wisdom lost no time telling anyone who listened how deeply she adored la time to stick it to all those pastyfaced new yorkers who bash us for a hobby as if proving her point shed set out last year to visit every ethnic enclave in the county sampling food dry goods religious gewgaws dvds and cds over a twentymonth period she worked her way through little tokyo little saigon little india the cuban enclave on venice boulevard in culver city armenian outposts in east hollywood and glendale the heart of the orthodox jewish community in picorobertson it was on pico that queues of people trailing to the sidewalk led her to the kosher sausage place spontaneous discussion with a yeshiva student waiting for a veal brat comprised her semitic education boys did you know that kosher basically means legit not only does the animal need to be killed quicklywere long past the vegan thing rightbut a qualified rabbi needs to inspect the lungs which in these days of global warming and smutty air seems pretty darn appropriate to me the religiously sanctioned wursts quickly became those sausages you and your brother like so much mosey even though maddy generally devoured three at a sitting and neither brother had ever expressed an opinion one way or the other the sausages were tasty enough but at this point in moes life food wasnt important he got up peered into the pot a dozen links simmered planning a banquet maddy blinked just in case youre hungry you do look a bit thin are you eating right darling ive actually gained a couple of pounds and im fine all muscle im sure whats your approach three squares or fast all day and feast at nightlike the muslims do on ramadan theres no pattern mom i try to be moderate maddy beamed up at him my gorgeous husky little one so tell me about your life not much to tell im working like a demon im sure just doing the job mom mosey she said youd never be satisfied with just doing anything from first grade on you were a little waterwheel churning away ive never told you about the time your preschool teacher called me in that church school the one i sent you to because they gave scholarships what was the teachers name mrs whatever anyway the class had just learned about the israelites slaving away in egypt and mrs whatever thought you looked confused so she talked to you afterward and asked you if you were okay and you gave her the gravest look and said i could be a good slave i like to work hard maddy touched his cheek again so adorably earnest mrs southwick thats it helen southwick was concerned that you were overly mature whatever the heck that means moe had heard the story a hundred times minimum he smiled maddy said tell me about your life they sat at the table where moe finished his evian and maddy sipped from an oversized mug of postum gooped with honey everythings really routine mom what cases are you working on nothing special hushhush confidential said maddy even for close blood relatives naw just nothing special oh well i suppose it all boils down to one person killing another do you think youll stick with homicide why wouldnt i people change darling people yearn for change im fine several moments passed maddy looked at her watch generally time meant nothing to her moe said got something scheduled i just want to make sure those sausages dont get too puckery springing up she returned to the stove a few more minutes another evian darling before moe could answer the thud of a door closing echoed from the front of the manse footsteps grew louder no surprise on moms face she forked a sausage hummed before moe could speak aaron was in the kitchen maddys older son received the same kisses hugs and praise shed bestowed on moe unlike moe aaron turned the lovefest into a duet you look absolutely gorgeous mom hairs great that way you should keep it long youve got the mien for thatcool necklace look at that stone arizona turquoise right great specimen looks like a cat in the natural grain exactly what an eye hopi tewa outstanding aaron peered into the pot mosaic wursts lets hear it for cultural diversity any cajun in there two said maddy just like you asked for moe left the kitchen aaron caught up with him at the fountain cmon you cant be that touchy moe racewalked to his car aaron kept pace youre that much of a diva that youre willing to hurt her because youre feeling all pissy after all shes been through whats she been through life aaron touched moes sleeve moe grabbed his brothers hand and flung it off hard enough to throw aaron off balance aaron stumbled back caught himself brushed nonexistent dirt off his gray silk trousers fine be an asshole i learned from the best you learned nothing from me thats your problem moe felt his face turn to oak didnt know i had a problem aaron mimed a bellpress mr reed fedex delivery carton full of insight being delivered to your door moe groped for his car key you are an utter and complete baby said aaron talk about arrested development and dogmatic dysfunctional syndrome now youre a shrink dont have to be to know your rigidity is getting in the way of the job i called you four times today what else could i so you collude with mom i didnt collude i boys both men swiveled to see maddy standing in the doorway holding two plates heaped with sausage dinners served come and get it moes not hungry said aaron ill stay moe muttered oh sure and make me the bad guyfuck off one second mom i just had to get something from the car look lets forget the personal shit im here because of the job as in i might have a lead for you maddy called out hurry boys i bought ice cream for dessert what kind of lead said moe later said aaron and for the record i didnt collude mom called me and suggested we all get together soon it made her happy to think about she said its been two months since shes seen you so i figured whens the last time you were here aaron didnt answer need a calendar said moe boys maddy walked toward them balancing the plates with aplomb all those hardtimes waitress shifts at dupars not wasted the foods getting cold boys the rabbis wouldnt approve dinner was brief but seemed long maddy faked ebullienceor maybe she really was that selfcentereddoling out affection to each son with obsessive equality as if love like any other medicine could be calibrated in doses it was the same blithe painfully fair approach shed taken when they were young seemingly oblivious to her losses the money problems that forced her to doubleshift the acid stares and mutterings of neighbors each time she moved her curious multiracial family into a newly rented dump when they lived in crenshaw it was the black folks who derided in the valley the puritans changed skin tone but not intent maddy had been raised by racist hypocrites knew all about mindless resentment she went about her business wrapped in an imaginary blanket of righteousness and selfdetermination that worked but it took its toll so did constant laying on the love to her two little hooligans if aaron and moses had been able to crawl into her head theyd have found a surprising alarming place crammed with dark corners shadows dead ends the decaying memorabilia of a lifetime of adventure and misadventure that had tapered to boredom now she was set up financially with the house the travel the hobbies du jour empty space in the kingsize bed could she take twenty thirty more years of this torpor no challenges nothing to rebel against two kids who looked like men but had never grown up was the psychic abyss dividing them somehow her fault she didnt think so shed always been so stop no way would she introspect and get all dopeymopey about their issues she deserved better than that her therapist agreed with her she said ready for dessert boys vanilla cherry for aaron chocolate ripple for mosey you two are nothing if not ironic when the table was clear she took them to her secondstory studio and showed them the huge bicolor canvases shed been working on variations of lightdark if either of them got the joke they didnt let on mosey said nice mom aaron said really nice mom maddy noticed a thin spot on the edge of one of the paintings squeezing pigment onto her palette she sat at her easel began filling in the boys stood around as she daubed stood back to gauge painted some more the paint was not sitting right badquality acrylics shed noticed a definite change in the last few batches squeeze moisten lift brush lay it down when she looked up half an hour had passed and the house was blessedly silent chapter moe said so whats this bigtime lead the sun was down and the courtyard cobbles were a strange deep purple a sad color moe wanted out of there aaron kept his reflexive reply to himself whats this bigtime attitude he recounted rory stoltzs hyundai adventures moe said so aaron tamped down frustration by touching the fabric of his sport coat super s from milan silkysmooth nothing better hed bought the jacket in three shades you looked at stoltz early on but he came across clean he didnt come across he had an alibi stayed behind at riptide even after caitlin left but that doesnt mean he couldnt have met up with her later but hes not top of my list i hear riptide catered to celebs back then i dont know who got rory into coldsnake but it had to be a vip im still working on that that means rory has an attraction to that world what if some famous type did caitlin and rory protected him moe thought mason book was skinny made perfect sense rory allegedly loves this girl but he allows her killer to go free so he can run dope errands dope errands and maybe more moses he was still in that house until well after three maybe sleeping in that says hes wormed his way into a higher income bracket as a gofer who wants to be an entertainment lawyer or an agent makes perfect sense aaron said he thinks its a start moe said nothing youre not impressed by any of this you saw stoltz chauffeur two clubrats we dont know if theyre in the industry how about this then the house he drove them to belongs to lem dement moes arms folded across his chest youre letting info out in dribs and drabs i need you to be interested before i waste my time moses im busy spit it all out aaron forced himself calm one dement owns the place two i have a source says dement beats his wife neither of the two guys was dement but he does have a slew of kids seven to be exact and five are sons boys learn how to treat women from their daddies or from having no daddy i worked the web found photos of three junior dements the two oldest fit the build of the heavier guy i saw moe pulled out his pad names japhet and ahab aaron grinned japhet is twentyfive and ahabs twentyeight ahab used to be a heavymetal dude goes by ax if you find a criminal history on either of them id appreciate hearing about it meaning you didnt turn up anything if theyre bad boys theyve avoided the press all i found were a couple of party photos with ax trying to get his face in the shots where were the parties not at riptide if thats what you mean im talking oscars week the grammys the usual postceremony crapthe standard the design center skybar everyone stoned pretending they want privacy but theyre really out to make the tabs any genuine celebs in the shots said moe you better believe it tom julia sean george the old seeandbeseen in one picture ax was trying to make it look like he was a pal of mason book trying how books all snuggly with a hollowcheeked supermodel and ax is leaning in between them a fifth wheelwhat moe said what do you mean what your eyes just dropped like lead sinkers i was just thinking books tall and skinny maybe hes the other guy you saw sure but there are tons of skinny guys in la aaron stood back why am i getting that book interests you because rory works for book as a pa aarons jaw grew rigid now whos dribbing and drabbing i just found out when how i dont need to explain my methods your methods aarons smile was unsettling you change your mind about the peninsula then the moment im gone you probably went over and reinterviewed rorys mommy fine youre the man and im hired help grateful to be clutching your coattails but keep with that attitude and good luck closing caitlin swinging his car keys violently he headed for the porsche moe said thanks for the vote of confidence aaron stopped turned the point you seem to be missing is i do have confidence in you moses if i didnt i wouldnt waste time sharing info and believe me theres plenty of braindead morons with gold shields i wouldnt give the time of day caitlins iced over bro youve got parts of the puzzle ive got others the smart thing would be to cooperate like that damned song you always listened to on sesame street i hated sesame street that was you no no no moses electric company was my thing morgan freeman at his best so we play sharezies said moe maybe i get my clearance up either way you rake in nice dough like thats a felony you play too loose it could be felonious i cant afford to jeopardize the investigation like im going to infect you with something give me a break moses i worked the job i know the drill and the hard truth is either way im going to keep digging as in looking into mason book the moment my ass hits my desk chair because theres more to him than youre telling me he bugs you and im going to find out why the timing is what bugs me said moe books suicide attempt was exactly one week after caitlin disappeared really what a guilt reaction its a possibility books an actor and probably a longterm dope fiend so hed have plenty of reasons to be messed up mentally oh man said aaron ive had a bad feeling about caitlin almost from the beginningsomething psycho now im visualizing bigtime ugly as in as in one of those vicious gangbangssomething that went too far for them to let her leave alive as in book and some buddies maybe one or more of the dement boys because theyd know firsthand about abusing women maybe rory himself for that matter they killed her to keep her quiet said moe or even uglier she died in the process lets say books high when it happens a few days later his head clears he realizes what hes done and cuts his wrists of course that means the guys capable of feeling remorse same thing sturgis had said moe said his name pulls up four million google hits i spent hours couldnt find a single useful factoid on the suicide attempt other than he was at cedars for a week on the vip ward special imp said aaron youve been there big smile not as a patient but ive visited top floor city view nice carpets private security out in the hall not that it means better medical care in fact i hear sometimes you dont want to be a celeb in a hospital why not people like that never hear the word no everyones afraid of them normal patient squawks about getting woken up middle of the night to check vitals staff says roll over anyway vip patient squawks staff backs off the case i was involved in was two years ago grandson of a gazillionaire goes in for minor knee surgery ends up with no legs im not going to tell you it was cedars or any other place in specific but trust me special treatment runs both ways whos your contact at special imp aaron shook his head dont have one theyre tighter than the pentagon but this is good somethings shaping up risking a hand on his brothers shoulder cooperation big bird would be proud moe twitched but didnt yank the hand off what weve got is mutual interest now tell me everything you know what makes you think i havent moes turn to smile fine said aaron but i really did give you the crux dont waste your time searching for other disapperances of riptide clients because there arent any there was a couple named rensselaer shortly after caitlin dropped off the earth turns out they were on a fugitive run from a checkkite thing got found the only other tidbit that could possibly interest you is lem dements got a big spread in malibu sixtyplus acres used to be a summer camp rumor has it hes building his own church there how close to pepperdine ten miles north which would put it farther from riptide so i dont see anything profound there with a big spread be easy to hide a body aaron nodded how did i miss that must be sleep deprivation what else said moe thats it cross my heart how about we continue to do our separate things either of us gets something interesting we confer ill do the calling said moses from my personal cell aaron smiled got a phobia of cooties got a phobia of being associated with something that could go extralegal i already told you you going back inside to be with mom just to say goodbye say it for me moe strode to his unmarked got in drove out of the courtyard when he was gone aaron felt like the only man in the universe chapter instead of driving to lizs place moe sped east on sunset through the strip aiming his gps at the hollywood hills his quest took him up into a pretty neighborhood dark and secluded lots of gated properties not much visible from the street exactly what a celeb would want especially one with a guilty conscience after months of nothing he was getting hyped up about caitlin rory stoltz gofering for mason book didnt mean much by itself and when you got down to it neither did the timing of books wristslash but toss it together aaron thought it worth pursuing the gps lady offered a soothing welcome as he reached the mouth of swallowsong lane moes unmarked crown vic was conspicuous up here the no outlet sign clinched it park below and continue on foot as he climbed swallowsong the air felt cracklycoppery electric like something was ready to ignite from somewhere higher in the hills a coyote screamed something was getting killed welcome to real life he found the property soon enough big gates fancy metalwork darkness beyond no indication anyone lived there maybe no one did and it was just one of those party houses used for doperaves porn shoots that whole lifestyle he lingered imagining caitlin stepping into a humongousview house maybe a bit scared but awestruck drinking more than she was used to or worse before she knows it her soft tan body is stretched out on a strange bed and moe cut his inner movie and began the downward climb it was nine eleven over an hour past the time hed told liz hed drop by he phoned her from the car she said so sorry honey for what being late i just got home meetings out in la puente construction dig for a shopping center unearthed some remains they needed to make sure its not an indian burial site i figured id get back on time but a big rig rolled over on the freeway i tried to reach you but my battery went dead were you waiting long not a sec im just on my way now he said my own excavation oh that makes me feel better she sounded tired moe said still up for hanging out as in chips and dip she laughed yeah i think i can muster energy for hanging out she greeted him wearing a baggy red tee and sweats hair pinned up carelessly no makeup a can of coke zero in one hand kissing him quick and hard she fetched him a beer this is a test seeing me at my worst not much of a challenge they sat on the couch um one more thing moses its that time of the month came on a little early hey he said we can drink white wine watch oprah reruns talk about our feelings or shoes dont push it they drank beer talked about nothing watched a project runway rerun because liz liked the show and moe found it hilarious after five minutes some guy bitching about not enough time to stitch an aline whatever that was moe felt himself nodding off before he could shake himself awake lizs head grew heavy on his chest seconds later she was sleeping he switched off the tube managed to dislodge her without disrupting her dreams covered her with a throw and walked silently into her bedroom where he activated her laptop an hour of websurfing produced consensus mason book had been plagued by drug problems since his adolescence in nebraska the former michael lee buchalter was a selfadmitted crappy student and high school dropout whod done pills weed paint whatever to get through night shifts at a fetid meatpacking plant outside omaha driving to la on a whim buchalter worked a series of deadend jobs until a female studio head watching him hose her benz at a weho car wash was struck by the lanky touslehaired midwesterners awshucks star quality i thought finally someone both men and women could relate to a jimmy stewart for our time if jimmy had snorted heroin cleaned up and renamed by his patron tutored by acting coaches book demonstrated a surprising ability to don the identities of others was a star within eighteen months his affair with the studio head lasted another half a year at which time she found someone younger no sign that being dumped had affected book hed gone on to headline a series of madcap boxoffice smashes always emitting lowkey selfeffacing aplomb then came the wristslash moe probed for details beyond tabloid basics got nothing the internet was nothing more than a grindstone sucking up kernels of data and reprocessing until any substance was gone he switched his search to lem dement hoping for a direct link to the house on swallowsong came up empty mason book lem dement was just as useless he paired the houses address and the suicide try zip book had been emtd variously from his hollywood hills lair view crib above sunset or bachelor pad overlooking the strip an image search produced page after page of redcarpet photoop thumbnails starring book and a slew of actresses moe found surprisingly few candid paparazzi shots and every portrait was complimentary playing on the actors lean body aquiline slightly oversized features amiable slouch heavy mop of tooyellow hair books smile was custommade for the camera even a couple of photos taken after the wristslash were kind the guy actually looked pretty happy nearmiraculous recovery soft treatment from the photo corps meant the candid shots were anything but and moe was pretty sure he knew why book like the smartest celebs had worked out an arrangement with the digital leeches when you catch me i oblige with a couple of money poses in return you dont make me look like a strungout hype on the other hand books ability to sneak out of coldsnakeif he was the skinny guy aaron had seensaid he wasnt being papstalked maybe the guy was old news and no one cared guy hadnt made a movie in how long moe clicked keys three years in industry terms that could be jurassic he returned to the image gallery checked out the kind of woman book favored in public a whole lot of women with some variation in hair color and skin tone but the dominant armcandy flavor was leggy and blond no rarity in la but both criteria fit caitlin frostig picking up the hostess why not book was thirtythree had never been married and one tab termed him still on the prowl had the actor taken that literally nice story line but no facts to back it up and moe started to wonder if a few suggestions by aaron had launched him on a massive wrong turn aaron had leeway but his options were limited to buttnumbing scut and reinterviews of witnesses he needed to get out on the street and do something he peeked into the living room liz had stretched herself out on the sofa her face mostly covered by the throw moe sat back down faced the flat black window that gazed into cyberspace lem dement children produced references to the directors huge brood slew of kids clear slap in the face of overpopulation religious fanatical tribe moe was about to try something else when he turned to the thirtieth page of citations and came across a oneyearold malibu sunrise article about dements plan to build a replica of a wooden church in krakow poland that had been destroyed during world war ii the reporter had some trouble grasping why anyone would want to construct a personal house of worship but the tone was gushing hollywood biggie creates one big happy family lem dements new fundamentalist leanings might be at odds with westside sensibilities but rich and famous trumped everything the puff piece was illustrated by a photo of the entire clan posed in front of a logsided building dement looked relaxed wearing his fishhook hat and a plaid shirt wife gemma a fairhaired stickfigure whose prettybutpinched features contrasted with dements ruddy porcine mug looked stiff and uncomfortable the two of them flanked the kids standing as far from each other as possible the three youngest kids were towheaded bronzed and prepubescent with that easy smile that came from being brought up soft ambrose faustina and marguerite glowed with optimism not so mary giles and paul miki the skinny sullen teenagers posed behind them at the back scowling were a pair of longhaired bearded hulks in black tshirts pugpusses and barrel torsos shouted no paternity test required japhet and ahab dement couldve been twins moe wouldve cast them as evil twinshillbilly pigfarming mutants lurching down from the hills in one of those familygetslostinthehinterland splatter flicks japhet waving a chain saw ahab swinging grappling hooks you wouldnt even need to change their names moe clicked for a long time before finding the picture of ax that aaron had described yup ahab ax dement son of director lem did appear to be horning in on mason books body contact with a tall starved blond beauty another half an hour produced something that had eluded aaron mason book had been spotted by one of the free weeklies in a club named ant during a gig by axs band demented the actors presence was deemed the most memorable aspect of a drearily predictable prozacinducing thrillingaslettuce attempt to meld the least redeemable aspects of metal and emo the date was three weeks prior to caitlins disappearance moe searched for info on the band nothing same for the club logging onto the lapd search engine he entered his password got okayed asked doj ncic and every other satellite of the big cop in the sky what they knew about ahab dement dmv reported the guys middle namepetrarchas well as a couple of speeding tickets and six parkers issued to a dodge ram pickup registered at a solar canyon address in malibu if ax was a felonious bad boy hed gotten away with it the letdown brought on a wave of fatigue moe checked on liz again saw scurrying motion beneath her eyelids a faint smile on her lips dreaming away at warp speed maybe even about him settling on the floor he watched her for a while then thinking about chain saws and grappling hooks he covered her feet dimmed the lights let himself out chapter mr dmitri folded his reading glasses slipped them into his shirt pocket along with aarons expense accounting taking a bite out of his kebab pita he studied aaron wish there was more to report sir but these things take time russian trains take time mr fox sometimes they dont arrive this train will arrive dmitri sipped orange soda through a straw aaron eyed his own lunch billed as a burger looked like a burger how could you go wrong but the seasoning was weird cumin or something smelled like an old persons closet dmitris secretary had woken him at seven am calling for a lunch appointment with the boss some place called ivans burbank boulevard north hollywood aaron put on a good suit for what he expected to be some russian hangout thicknecked guys in black leather jackets listening to balalaika music feasting on blinis caviar whatever those types liked ivans turned out to be a takeout falafel joint with two outdoor benches for seating and now aaron was looking out to a pigeonspecked parking lot as clunkers drove in and out the air was hot and noxious reeked like a snotclogged nose the good old valley he wondered if moe ever ate here nah not healthy enough dmitri said you think this actor could be involved its worth pursuing because there is nothing else the timing of the suicide attempt and the fact that the boyfriend now works for book is suggestive maybe the actor and maybe dements son maybe the son is a nasty bigot like his father wouldnt surprise me said aaron but that is maybe not relevant the girl was white at this point its hard to say whats relevant and what isnt dmitri chomped got hummus on his meaty chin swiped himself clean five hundred dollars for special communications the bribe for that weasel ogeara at the cell phone company twoyear relationship and the lowlife ups his rate fifty percent the excuse mario fortunos bust had kicked up the danger level aaron said i dont think you want to know the details dmitri was amused you are engaging in kgb tactics aaron laughed dmitris pudgy forefinger nudged the waxed paper beneath aarons burger you dont like allamerican food its great aaron bit down to demonstrate earned himself a moldylaundry tongue sir has mr frostig talked to you since i started on the case no why for the time being id keep him out of the loopnot give him any details dmitris brow furrowed you suspect him of something no sir i just want to be carefultruth is when i talked to him he seemed almost ambivalent like he wasnt sure how he felt about reopening the investigation in my experience thats an unusual response dmitri tented his fingers okay we will keep him out of the loop tiny smile perhaps the loop will turn into a parabola or a hyperbola or a fibonacci series rising to his feet dmitri waddled to his volvo drove away fast leaving aaron to clean up merry ginzburg had told aaron to meet her at a place on hillhurst near her office at the abc studio on prospect he got there on time fifteen minutes later she still hadnt shown the ambience at food tube made up for all the selfconscious imsohip vibe ivans had lacked limegreen walls inlaid with glass tiles listed at weird angles the ceiling was crimson vinyl the floor was chartreuse cement aaron felt trapped in the guts of some giant reptile gaunt blackclad servers huddled in a corner trying to avoid three middleaged women tackling food that looked as if it had been reclaimed from a compost heap aaron and the trio made up the lunch crowd no one had offered to seat him so he picked a corner table waited a good five minutes until a sixtwo redheaded girl deigned to come over his mint tea order made her grimace something wrong i just hate all kinds of that stuff tea he said yeah he sat there for another seven before the mug of hot dishwater arrived not his day for cuisine boredom was cramping his head when out to pick up women he played coy if they asked what he did for a living then dropped the truth strategically what he never let them know was how much of the job was phoning and schmoozing and waiting around he wanted to get out there and do something maybe hed call someone tonight go out for a decent meal he was still trying to figure out who the lucky girl would be when barret ogeara phoned from a number aaron didnt recognize prepaid what do you think im gonna leave a trail what did you learn that maybe mason books got social problems what kind of problems stud like that said ogeara youd think hed be texting getting texted nonstop by chicks the studios producers whatever what i got for the last ninety days is he calls movie line blockbuster beverage warehouse and oh yeah he does communicate with dements kids cell ax huh chop chop ax calls for lots of takeout likes italian and thai books only other highfrequency contact is someone named rory stoltz who i first thought was a chick but then i looked him up because hes also got an account with uspaid for by books business manager as a matter of fact and the middle name listed on the account is jeremy so thats three guys yapping we talking gay aaron said how often do book and stoltz talk once twice a day sometimes as much as six sometimes late like three four am let me in on it foxy we talking queerios in a bowl with milk and sugar what else you learn barret holding back huh meaning book really does bat for the other team all that studly stuff is pure bullshit oh man theres nothing to believe in anymore youre way off then whats the deal you dont want to know look up rory stoltz for the last year and get back to me asap whoa whoa whoa said ogeara first of all you know i never trace past ninety days because after ninety everythings encrypted and sent to a separate data bank at our headquarters so the feds can snoop on anyone they damn well please second another romp is gonna cost you another five c cut the comedy said aaron its all part of the same assignment whos joking everythings recorded here man its worse than the cia each time i log in im putting my job in jeopardy not to mention my nonfelony status and subsequent ability to vote in national elections for the sleazeball of my choice its the same gig ogeara says you a hundred more period five brings it alive hundred fifty said aaron you jerk me around were through hear that sound said ogeara it aint rain its my tears suit yourself said aaron clicking off three minutes later merry still hadnt shown up when ogeara called from a different number two seventyfive or its splitsville and i demand alimony two even and get back to me yesterday two twentyfive and would you settle for right now youve already got it two twentyfive says i might spit it out barret i managed to go back four months dont ask how but the picture doesnt change much back then books still getting a few calls from caa but then the agent yak dies stoltz and book keep chatting regularly and guess what stoltz sometimes calls ahab dement i knew this was some faggot thing because the only other highfreq number for stoltz is at the peninsula hotel in bh the three of them are obviously surfing the chocolate pipeline in some fancy suite right am i gonna read this on drudge tomorrow meanwhile you sell the info and get a ferrari no and no said aaron do one more thing no charge oh sure look at it this way barret seven fifty in cash is coming your way unless something goes wrong with the mail youre threatening me i did the match you owe the scratch bye barry getting overly familiar said ogeara why do i sense youre intending to screw me over theres no reason for conflict barry just do something simple seeing as you work so fast ill stay on the line he spelled out the assignment cursing ogeara relented just as the info came back merry ginzburg stepped into the restaurant saw aaron waved aaron said checks in the mail cut the connection switched off his cell when merry reached his table he got up did the doublecheekpeck bit merry was thirtyseven short and curvy and pretty with luxuriant auburn hair and the saddest blue eyes aaron had ever seen once a calendar reporter for the times shed been hired by the network affiliate to cover the industry delivered occasional gossip bits at the tail end of slowday news broadcasts budget cuts had led to a buyout of her contract in eight months she hadnt been on camera in ages which explained the pink juicy couture sweats no makeup hair tied up with a scrunchy sorry handsome sudden meeting with suits back in business said aaron merrys headshake was long and mournful just the opposite theyre trying to whittle down my buyout you believe that three months of negotiations just to get to the current state of being reamed and now they want to start all over again bastards said aaron what is it about the industry that attracts sociopaths i know why theyre doing it they figure ill have to hire a lawyer which will chew up most of the money so ill cave jabbing a middle finger in the air she said think again corporate assholes the redheaded stick ambled over everything okay ms ginzburg everything sucks bring me the albacore on sprouts medium rare on a multigrain roll no mayo no mustard no any other crap but i do want a ramekin of blackened tempeh bits and some soy sauce on the side the redhead pouted ill have to get my pad when she was gone merry said like thats so hard to remember we shouldve gone to mickey d so whats uphold on ectomorphas returning red said okay merry repeated the order and throw in some avocado when they were alone again aaron said ax dement probably an utter shithole like his daddy probably hes not even z list aaron hes a waiter so why would i care aaron said which restaurant merry cracked up not as in wannabe actor darling as in waiting for daddy to die trustfund baby big trust fund i dont know dear im theorizing daddy pulled in half a bill on that blindfaith abomination unless he hates his kids why wouldnt he dribble a little into their grubby little waiter palms she looked over at the klatch of idle servers hey skinny folkyeah you can a person get some water puzzled stares no one moved water h oh jesus she got up filled a glass from a pitcher whispers among the cabal when red emerged from the kitchen they said something to her and red frowned and approached the table still or sparkling ms ginzburg tap and more hot water for denzel washington the cabal began buzzing as if plugged into a socket red stared at aaron aaron grinned shes kidding reds frown said she wasnt sure who to believe merry said hot wawa when the fluids arrived aaron said what do you know about dement senior hes richer than god because of that holyroller crapathon but no one will work with him because of the antisemitism you know honey said merry hollywood wasnt started by the irish that said if the upside was big enough dement could be hermann göring and someone would rationalize a reason to finance his next flick lems problem is he considers himself an artiste now that hes rolling in dough he wants to be creative uncommercial projects wacky projects from what i hear as in a druid musical or more pseudodocumentaries on sexy topics like colitisim kidding about that but the druid thing could be true bottom line if dement had come up with anything marketable in the last three years hed be shooting right now merrys sandwich came arranged sloppily on a plain beige plate redhead turned to leave merry barked more water the girl whined something inaudible aaron said ho injoke dear heavy water they use it in nuclear reactors the implication being im going to blow this place up unless someone leases a working brain im impressed i was a chem major premed at duquesne for about three days decided honest labor wasnt my thing everyone said id have a shot at national anchor now the suits are dumping me and ive got as many prospects as lem dement at wilshire temple sorry said aaron maybe ill go back to pittsburgh live with real folk dont ill miss you sure you will anything else you can tell me about the dements dont know the kids but ill bet theyre a nasty bunch just look at that movie violence for its own bloody sake couched in piety bad rolemodeling too talk is lem pounds on the little woman really can i prove it she said but shes got that look you know longsuffering and a friend of mine did some camera work on the jesus flick swears the one time she showed up on the set he saw bruises on her neck he was thinking i could use that but a all they let me do was happy news and b without something close to proof theyd never run it domestic violence said aaron interesting i hate that term sounds like the house is punching you hes a wifebeater aaron she bore him seven kids talk about insane she nibbled her sandwich aaron said mason book merry stopped chewing now sir youve piqued my interest why books a screwedup junkie but hes still got potential to relist himself with the as all that charisma and he can actually act whats going on aaron some crazy thing between him and dements kid something hot i could use to springboard myself back into uncivilization not yet mer she put the sandwich down aaron this is a real bad time for me im being treated like a thimbleful of spit my retirement funds not what it should be because i thought the good times would never end and i havent been laid in so long i might as well stitch up the honey pot my parents would love me back in pittsburgh so they can itoldyouso forever if youve got something big brewing you have to cue me in aaron stirred his tea theres nothing to tell but there could be its possible she grabbed his sleeve oh lord give me a clue you know im discreet aaron had tested merrys ability to keep a secret three times by feeding her fake leaks twice shed passed one time shed failed theres really nothing way too early if something does develop youll be first i swear her grip on his arm tightened first doesnt count i need to be only promise me an exclusive the one you gave me on that celebutard earned me brownie points for a month deal said aaron her hand loosened dropped off she whispered cant you at least give me a hint if you can find out more about any link between book and ax dementwithout arousing attentioni might end up with more than a hint book and dement she repeated as if committing a phrase to memory weve got to be talking dope because books never met a drug he doesnt like and seeing as dements a waiter with nothing going on but spare time he probably smokes sniffs shoots whatever just to keep from dying of boredom aaron said nothing merry smiled oh denzel she said raising her voice you are nothing if not strong and silent over in the corner the servers quaked with confusion chapter moe ate raw vegetables listened to police calls watched the mouth of swallowsong lane it was eleven pm and hed been there since nightfall dressed for the long haul in a baggy sweatshirt and jeans brown corduroy car coat at the ready if he needed to hide his gun the chance it would get that exciting was low during the last three hours only one vehicle had rolled toward the no outlet sign pale blue prius driven distractedly by a ponytailed cellphoning brunette in her forties moe had noticed the vehicle in the driveway of a neighboring property so no link to the house at the top of the hill the calls on the police band were the usual disturbances burglar alarms likely to be false a few traffic stops that required further attention when license checks turned up wants and warrants a deep throbbing rumble from the intersection made him switch off the radio a black dodge ram truck rolled down from swallowsong barreled through the stop sign sped past before moe could run the tags or see who was inside but make model and color matched ax dements drive aggressive hunk of metal strutted high on oversized blackrimmed wheels from the sound of the engine lots of aftermarket beef not your typical industrybrat ride but in that family portrait ax had been working the rural shitkicker bit the truck was long out of view but moe could still hear it his choice was follow or wait around on the off chance mason book would go tooling by either alone or chauffeured by rory stoltz for all he knew book was in axs passenger seat right now playing good ole boy but if so moe didnt see it as a club prowl the ram would attract too much attention on the westside were book and ax slumming looking for some unsuspecting female to gang no serious reason to believe that but moe turned the ignition key by the time he reached sunset traffic was sludged up everyone too irate to let him in he idled and cursed his indecision then a burst of horns and shouted curses directed him to the source of the jam the black ram was five yards up perpendicular to the flow blocking every eastbound lane easy enough to reconstruct what had happened the truck had bullied its way into the slowmoving stream only to get stuck when the light turned red the light turned green all the vehicles east of the truck took off but the ram didnt budge leaving its western neighbors stranded more cell phone distraction no too much time was passing for that no engine breakdown the ram was growling move it asshole cmon dickbrain moooove burst of horns dumb move on axs part if mason book was a passenger unless book was too stoned to care or he liked the attention the honks grew deafening the rams brights flashed twice talk about a screwyou move more noise the rams drivers window rolled down and a thick tattooed arm rightangled upward flipped the world a giant bird asshole what wrong with you a huge black guy in blue velvet sweats got out of an infiniti and moved toward the truck moe unlatched his seat belt had one hand on his mm the other on his door handle when the ram revved loud and peeled out the black guy gaped then everyone started honking him scowling he ambled back to his car drove off within seconds sunset was moving again and the ram was nowhere in sight it took a while for moe to muscle himself into the flood of happy travelers and by the time hed reached twenty per he spotted the truck nearly two blocks up butelevated by the sprung chassis and big tiresan easy target he made a few lane changes gained ground got a block behind then three car lengths where he stayed tossing a carrot stick into his mouth he chewed in rhythm with the pounding of his heart the truck stayed on the boulevard all the way through hollywood and into echo park driving through dark blocks of the gussiedup thrifts posing as antiques shops and the flybynight boutiques that signaled the districts flimsy gentrification laundromats latino bars and liquor stores cast their votes for old school off in the distance the gridlit downtown skyline beckoned this far east fewer cars traveled sunset moe hung back lucky move because the ram veered without signaling and parked dousing his lights moe swung to the curb at the end of the preceding block reaching for his binoculars he framed the truck hard to see much in the dark sovietsurplus infrared scopes like aaron probably had would be nice the ram sat there same way it had when wreaking momentary havoc on the strip moe checked out the terrain quiet block lots of shuttered windows one functioning establishment marked by a smudge of neon at the far end he refocused the binocs made out the sign the t ll tale in sputtering red above a blue happy mask similarly malfunctioning probably the tall tale poor bulb maintenance your basic lowrent alky bar if mason book was a passenger in the truck was he figuring he wouldnt be recognized here risky so was the possibility of some juicehead taking a random swing maybe whoever was in the truck had no intention of getting out and this was a dope pickup if the quarry did enter the place could moe chance going in he thought about that for a while decided hed dressed perfectly for the part what aaron called moes wardrobe would fit in a whole lot better than aarons overpriced italian stuff but clothes only made the man to a point his muscles and obvious health would stand out hed lay on some stoop and shuffle hang his arms in a way that narrowed his shoulders mumble when he spoke like the bar wasnt his first stop of the night all that became hypothetical when two people exited the bar and walked toward the truck big person smaller person as they got closer details blossomed small had long hair unmistakable female curves big shuffled and slouched the two of them reached the truck and held a brief sidewalk conference with whoever was inside then they continued walkingin moes direction passed moe and gave him a look tight clothing for her baggy for him she swung an undersized purse had a loosehipped walk kind of theatrical the two of them stopped at a compact car three vehicles behind moe the man took a long time to get his keys out dropped them cursed loud enough for moe to hear finally they were both in the car and the black trucks lights had switched on the cara dark corollapulled away first driving with its own beams off for an entire block the ram pulled away sped up until it was on the corollas butt continued to follow closely forgetting the lights and the way the corolla weaved signaled an obvious dui moe hoped no patrol cars were around hoped the idiot didnt hit someone and leave moe feeling guilty for the rest of his life the truck and the car headed toward downtown but stopped short of the bright lights out of hollywood division and into rampart where central american gangs thrived and the potential for random bullets and other bad news was high the corolla pulled into the parking lot of a place called the eagle motel the ram followed more faulty signage this time a cracked plastic panel featuring a poorly rendered leering raptor more buzzard than national symbol making matters worse the crack ran down the birds beak made the mascot look downright goofy smaller signs promised cable tv and movies on demand the layout was typical a dozen rooms around a ushaped parking lot a darkskinned clerk sat in a glaringly illuminated front office iron grating protected the door but to moe all that light made the clerk a sitting target ax dement got out of the ram but no one exited the passenger side dement had the same badasshick getup hed displayed in the family photo plaid pendleton jeans motorcycle boots sleeves rolled to the elbows exposed chunky inkedup forearms greasy hair was tied back in a ponytail a full unruly beard framed a nose that looked as if it had assaulted someones fist big guy like his dad hitching the jeans dement junior swaggered to the motel office pushed a button pulled open the iron grate then the door emerged within seconds swinging a key on a chain quick transaction a regular ax dement nodded at the corolla which moe now had a fix on mudbrown mashed in several places primered in patches he wrote down the tags as dement lit up a cigarette made his way to a room on the northern arm of the u most distant room of twelve that corner of the lot swathed in darkness the toyotas occupants got out the woman had teasedup dark hair and a coarse blasé face midthirties anglo five two in stiletto heels white tank top short red skirt the purse was black patent leather gigantic red hoop earrings swung alongside a squarish face good overall figure but a little thick and loose in places like someone whod once been toned but had given up she ran a finger over her lips fluffed her hair gave a little hip wiggle that the guy with her didnt notice because he was fumbling with a cigarette pack he was olderforty fortyfive anglo five ten or eleven skinny except for a protruding gut bald on top but the hair on the sides was longstreaming down to his shoulders a bushy mustache banditoed a weakchinned unmemorable face a hugely oversized white tee tented over sagjeans moe wondered if he wasnt the only one concealing firepower the man lit up started walking toward the room ax dement had entered the woman followed teetering as the asphalt fought her heels one time she tripped and had to flail to maintain balance her companion never noticed moe hurried out of the crown vic stood as close to the room as he could without being spotted no knock they walked right in quick flash of incandescence before the door shut your basic hookerpimpjohn dope party moe hazarded a jog over to the ram no passenger so mason books plans for the evening didnt include this level of slumming for all he knew book didnt even live at the house on swallowsong that was dement juniors place just another industry brat living off daddy for all he knew the skinny guy aaron had seen leaving coldsnake wasnt even mason bookno that didnt make sense stoltz worked for book why would he be driving anyone else in the middle of the night for all he knew stoltz was on the job tonight had come by to pick book up right after moe left the scene for all he knew none of it related to caitlin frostig returning to his car he ran the corollas tags expecting nothing then the info flashed on the mdt screen and he was pierced by an icysteel hit of adrenaline that needle of excitement jabbing his brain a few more keyclicks and he was in heartpumping cardiac marathon mode wanting to pounce chapter ax dement left the motel first after thirtytwo minutes of party moe antsy the whole time watched him go and decided to stay until the couple exited hoping a couple would exit given what hed learned talk about guilt to his relief the woman stepped out tying her hair in a high ponytail heading straight for the motels front office she got buzzed in without ringing the bell once inside she placed her hand on the clerks shoulder smiled squatted and disappeared from view the lights went out for just under three minutes the woman exited the office massaging the back of her neck waited by the corolla until her companion appeared he staggered to the car she rubbed his bald head and the two of them got back in the corolla bumped out of the parking lot turned right on sunset again the idiot forgot to turn on his lights this lapse extended for three and a half blocks the idiot had a name courtesy moes mobile terminal raymond allison wohr street moniker ramone w every mope considered a nickname his birthright male white five eleven one eighty brown and brown a dob that made him thirtyseven an address in la puente that was probably outdated a little younger than moes guess but no surprise given wohrs history the mdt had spat out a twelvepage sheet and that didnt include the sealed juvenile record nearly two decades of arrests mostly dope lots of weed possessions a few intents to sell the herb pills cocaine a heroin charge that went nowhere wohr had served lots of county jail time awaiting trial meaning he was no bigtime player and no one cared enough to go his bail despite that his winloss record wasnt bad split nearly evenly between acquittals and convictions the latter had sent him on periodic trips to various branches of the california penal system where wohr had been judged a possible affiliate of the aryan brotherhood but never a member meaning the gang didnt want him because he was too stupid unpredictable or lacked courage but was willing to use him for lowlevel scut during wohrs intermittent spells of freedom he amassed traffic violations resulting in a license suspension still in effect the corolla was registered to arnold bradley wohr two years older same address in la puente no criminal record the older lawabiding brother giving his clunker to ray out of pity family loyalty whatever too bad arnie youve left your lawabiding self damn vulnerable raymond wohrs vehicular infractions included a couple of speeders a trio of failures to make a full stop some tickytacky licensereg stuff in la puente that was probably a local uniform knowing ramone was a mope and harassing the fool the kicker was fourcount emdriving without headlights and two duis both of which wohr had managed to beat as if not busy enough ramone w had also managed to rack up a slew of petty larcenies the smallchange shoplifting and sneakthieveries that financed an impoverished druggies chemistry experiments now he was pimping shopworn street girls to hollywood brats moe calculated how much of wohrs thirtyseven years had been spent behind bars came up with just over fourteen not counting juvey time your basic turnstile con nothing particularly interesting until you got to wohrs latest involvement with the criminal justice system eighteen months ago hed been hauled in by hollywood homicideby petra connor and raul biro talk about your small copworldas a person of interest in the murder of a woman named adella bertha villareal no charges had been filed against wohr and as far as moe could tell the case remained open adella villareals body had been found three months before caitlin frostig stepped into darkness and melted away there were limits to what the computer could teach him the details he needed were in a bluebound hollywood murder book hed call petra in the morning now he followed wohrs illegal wheels west on sunset but this time the corolla bypassed the boulevard at virgil continued north to franklin turned left back into hollywood the quieter seamier east end of the district where european tourists sometimes ended up on deserted creepy side streets hoping to spot someone like mason book but more likely encountering someone like raymond wohr said felon pulled in front of a cheesylooking apartment building on taft and franklin and let his hooker girlfriend off she looked cross as she turned her back on wohr entered the building as moe jotted the address wohr continued south on taft parked just above hollywood boulevard slouched head down hands in pockets straight to a bar not dissimilar from the t ll tale bobs evening lounge cheap plywood door painted red porthole window a bit of nautical shades of riptide moe watched as wohr paused to light up a cigarette tossing the match on the sidewalk ramone w flung the door open two minutes later moe was inside too at the far end of a sticky urethaned bar nursing a bud staring down at souvenir drink coasters from longdead vegas casinos trapped in the varnish like insects in amber his fellow drinkers were half a dozen rummies well into their cups seven including raymond wohr rubbing his hairless crown and tossing back double bourbons a cop show played on a fuzzy tv a grubby paytoplay pool table topped with wrinkled felt had attracted no comers wohr chainsmoked and drank and tried to follow the show when he could keep his eyes open on the screen bigbosomed blondes intimidated bad guys who looked like waiters at the ivy everyone doublehanding their guns in absurd poses tossing around perp and forensics moes beer tasted diluted and sour and he avoided it while sneaking quick looks at ramone w up close wohr looked way older than thirtyseven with silver streaking the long side hair pitted gravelly skin a lumpy rummy nose kangaroo pouches beneath exhausted eyes it took fifteen minutes for the mope to finish drinking in all that time hed talked to no one no one had talked to him six doubles and to moes eye wohr had entered the bar intoxicated still he managed to stay on his feet was able to open the door on his second try moe tossed cash on the bar was back on taft in time to see wohr enter the same ratty building as the woman in the white tank top pimping his girlfriend a man of sterling character he drove back to west la division found the big droom empty except for a nightshift detective named edmund stickley filling out paperwork lots of empty desks but stickley had chosen moes moe had talked to him a few times one of those older burnouts who liked catching cases at shifts end passing everything along he said reed youre up past your bedtime nightlife aint no good life said moe but its high life the lyric is my life said stickley got something to do ill move dont bother i just need a screen stickley shifted to a neighboring desk anyway moe logged onto the reverse directory plugged in the address of the apartment building on taft obtained eighteen landlines running to that address raymond wohrs name wasnt among the registered users seven were female he began working his way through the list found a match on his fourth try alicia constance eiger thirtytwo twopage biography emphasizing dope and prostitution blond and brown in her most recent mug shot nearly a year ago deep lines scored her face the nightlife indeed moe googled her name combined with murder victim adella bertha villareal pulled up zilch same for villareal by herself the media hadnt covered the crime and no one close to the victim had created a website the criminal data banks also came up empty as did missing persons sites no easy link to caitlin too bad maybe because the cases werent connected nothing else to do before daybreak moe felt like jumping out of his skin but left the station and drove toward the onramp changed his mind and stayed on pico going east took beverly glen to sunset and sped east climbing toward swallowsong lane for the second time he found his eyelids lowering he tuned to a hardrock radio station cranked it loud none of that worked and he was considering pulling over for a catnap when highintensity headlights snapped him alert some idiot speeding toward him racing down the narrow street passing within inches of the crown vic moe strained to catch a glimpse of the fool silver porsche cabriolet top up drivers window open aarons face expressionless as he downshifted for the next curve chapter when moe was six years old a girl in his class whispered in his ear your brothers a monkey moe had just started first grade didnt know if this was part of getting out of kindergarten he ignored the girl and returned to his addition workbook the girl giggled later out on the yard she brought an older boy probably a thirdgrader to where moses was bouncing a ball by himself the way he liked to do this is my brother she said the big boy smirked moe looked around for aaron none of the fifthgraders were on the yard bounce bounce bounce the big boy punched air and moved closer he and the girl laughed he said your brothers a monkey nigger and placed his hand on moes chest moe lowered his head and charged churning his arms like they were a machine his hands turned into rocks and his legs were real fastkicking robot legs that couldnt stop suddenly the big boy was on the ground and moe was sitting on top of him and he still couldnt stop moving tasting blood but not feeling any hurt anywhere and red was shooting out of the big boys nose along with snot and the big boy was screaming and crying each time moes fist pounded into the boys head and his body he made a hopeless noise kind of like oh no it took two teachers to pull moe off the big boy did nothing but cry in the principals office moe got a bad feeling from mr washington and refused to talk until mommy showed up he whispered everything into her ear she listened and nodded and translated for the principal thats certainly not good mrs reed if it indeed happened that way it happened that way mr washington moses never lies washington black as coal broad as a garage door said indeed trust me mr washington youll never meet a more honest child the principal studied her then moe has he ever caused problems before mr washington this is first grade mrs reed weve only been in session for two weeks call his preschool moses had an impeccable behavior record for him to do something like this there had to be a good reason theres never a good reason for violence mrs reed ah said mom i wonder if the protesters in selma alabama feel differently not to mention residents of the warsaw ghetto the navajo i dont believe i need a history lesson mrs reed im sure you dont and im sorry for being presumptuous however if that kind of racist sentiment is common among your student body its no surprise thered be some sort of our student body is excellent mrs reed lets not get off target moses beat a boy bloody now im sure you believe hes a good boy but this isnt what youd call a good start under no circumstances can any sort of physical actingout be tolerated no circumstances whatsoever of course not sir and he will be duly punished i can assure you mommy never punishes me oh no moe tried to catch her eye but she kept looking at mr washington like moe wasnt in the room mr washington said i suppose we can call this to a close with a warning for moses and for your other son whats aaron done nothing yet im trying to ensure it stays that way therell be no personal vendettas absolutely no attempt on anyones part to get even what about the other side said mom will they be warned as well side said mr washington thats confrontational terminology mrs reed i didnt mean it that way sir i just wanted to make sure that no one aggresses against my boys your boys will not be aggressed against what i need from you is an ironcast assurance that they wont bother anyone else they will not i swear suddenly mommy was touching moe squeezing his hand like she did when holding him back from traffic maybe a little harder he looked at her what was on her face had nothing to do with comfort or safety flat like a mask he shivered mommy squeezed again mr washington said well i sincerely hope youre right because here we are just two weeks in and already moses is skating on thin ice he shuffled some papers mommy said everything will be perfect perfect washington smiled his desk clock ticked so as not to keep this exclusively negative mrs reed i will tell you that aaron is one of our top fifthgrade students as well as an excellent athlete that would imply a certain degree of selfdiscipline you bet said mommy aarons always been superdisciplined washington lowered his eyes to moe and this one this one as well sir washington picked up a pencil studied the eraser mommy said both my boys are wonderful they never give me a lick of trouble its good that you think so mrs reed have a nice day you too mr washington thank you for your flexibility the principal hoisted his enormity from a creaking chair came over to moe cast a gigantic shadow son your mother says youre wonderful dont make her change her mind moe mumbled whats that son speak up mom never lies an honest family said washington lowering a huge hand onto moes quaking shoulder clutching moes now sweaty fingers mommy led himpulled him through endless beige school corridors into abrupt stunning sunlight across the play yard and past the guard at the gate morning mr chávez morning chávez always friendly turned away mommy pulled moe harder he said ow silence she always talks this is different oh no when they were inside the van she said belt up buster were going for a ride where baskinrobbins leaning over she kissed the tip of his nose even toughguy heroes need jamoca almond fudge by the time aaron came home an hour later on the uppergrade bus moe and mommy were waiting at the kitchen table with the ice cream and glasses of milk aaron breezed past them the door to his bedroom slammed mommy said well that was different and went after him moe heard loud voices ringing through the door he sat there for a while finally got up to listen dont need his help not the point aaron it was a vile thing to say and he was trying to defend you dont need his defending what we call spur of the moment darling he didnt think he just loves you so he acted loved me hed mind his own business think youre being a little harsh on always embarrassing hes so weird everyone calls him a retard because he stands around by himself and bounces that stupid ball and doesnt talk and i have to always stick up for him and say hes not a retard since he came to school its been well id certainly hope you stick up for him retarded thats horrid acts so weirdwhatever just tell him to stay out of my face okay silence okay mom he really needs to stay out of my face aaron i really dont understand this attitu hes making me look like a fag who needs to be protected i can protect myself okay the only reason hes trying to be a bigshot hero is cause youre always talking about how they were heroes but they werent not both of them my dad was a hero jack was just a stupid drunk who sat there while sharp report oh god im so sorry honey i didnt mean to hit you ive never hit you how did that happen silence aaron honey please talk to me i dont know what got into me please forgive me please please he brings problems oh aaron yeah yeah i forgive you later when aaron came out of the room saw that moe had been listening he sneered what do you want hero i i i i i i blah blah blaaah shoving moe aside aaron continued to the kitchen mmm kinda hungry gonna get me some bigtime hero ice cream it was that same smug mocking tone moe heard over the phone eight am still tired the laughter in aarons voice when moe said what caused moes hands to clench i said nice to see you last night however briefly thought youd want to know that rory stoltz picked mason book up just after you left the first time aaron had been able to watch him unseen he had been unaware of aaron until hours later the porsche speeding by big brother wanting moe to know youre sure it was book no one but moses i got a clear look through the passenger window older than he looks on screen haggard like hes been through some rough times whered stoltz take him nowhere in particular they just drove where all the way to ocean front im thinking yes theyre going to stop at riptide but stoltz turned the other waynorthgot on pch kept in the slow lane and cruised under the speed limit now im thinking theyre gonna head over to lem dements place in solar canyon maybe do a little earlymorning praying negative again they made it as far as the colony turned around went home ten minutes after stoltz drops book off the gates open and he drives away himself moonlight cruise up the coast said moe sounds kind of romantic yeah i thought about that maybe books got a secret life and his heads in stoltzs lap but anytime it was safe i got close and they were just sitting there book looked like he was heading for a funeral so if he did give the kid head he did it at olympic pace i honestly dont think it happened moses stoltz is books gofer books got insomnia he makes a call the kids there to do his bidding thats the whole point of walkingaround guys they make you feel important my question is whats book losing sleep over dope can do all sorts of things to your cycles true but what weve been guessingguilt over caitlincould also explain it not that i saw overt guilt more like stupor so how was your night uneventful sorry you missed the action moonlight cruise said moe sounds like you didnt catch much either a beat okay said aaron but at least we know for a fact that book crashes in dements house whether or not ax lives there remains to be seen no it doesnt moe said something actually happens feel free to call before aaron could answer he clicked off punched in a number at hollywood division chapter petra connor was one of those women you could get distracted by if she wasnt so smart and businesslike that you forgot she was a girl thin as a model but none of that braindead dullness in her wide dark eyes flawless ivory skin the graceful moves of a dancer or a runner shiny black hair that she wore in a neat functional cap the few times moe had seen her she wore black pantsuits and this morning was no exceptionsomething with a little stretch to it tailored to hug her fatless frame while concealing the bulk of her weapon her partner raul biro moe had never met before leaving the station hed stopped in at sturgiss office inquired about the guy the loo said really bright works like a dog probably gonna be a star moe didnt want to be paranoid but he was still wondering what that meant as he drove to hollywood station when he met biro he was surprised the guy looked like a kid though his hair was from another eracombed back and slicked at the sides sprayed in place on top aztec features the build of a lightweight wrestler aaron wouldve approved of biros smooth tan suit white shirt powderblue tie all puttogether like he never expected to get his hands dirty sturgis said he was a worker go know the three of them sat around a table in a hollywood interview room after some small talk about sturgis delaware the marsh murders petra patted the blue folder to her left thin not a good sign adella villareal not one of our triumphs biro clicked his tongue moe said maybe my dead end can intersect with yours petra said that would be nice lets do some showandtell moe did the polite thing and talked first summarizing his history with caitlin the links among rory stoltz mason book and ax dement dements motel party with raymond wohr and alicia eiger no reason to mention aarons involvement in the retell it sounded like an air sandwich eigers a new name for us so we asked vice said petra they know her your basic aging street girl they didnt know her as shacking with wohr and back when we questioned wohr he claimed there was no woman in his life biro said at least not a live one moe said villareal was his girlfriend if only it was that simple said petra no thats doubtfullets start at the beginning adella was hit on the back of the head but not hard enough to kill her we figured that for a subduing blitz before she was strangled manually she was fully clothed no signs of sexual assault no forensic evidence of any sort she flipped the murder book open turned pages slid the file over to moe fivebyseven shot of a really pretty hispanic girl holding an infant wrapped in a blue blanket and flashing a megawatt smile moe had checked out adella villareals stats last night twentyfour years old at the time of her death a dmv photo that showed her as darkhaired decent looking but nothing like this same girl no question about it but this portraitmaybe happinessmade her beautyqueen gorgeous with long lustrous hair curled at the ends lightened to chestnut streaked with honey a fitted white blouse and brown slacks showed off nice curves moe said when was this taken petra said twentytwo months ago phoenix her familys house the baby was a month old she flew home to show him off boy named gabriel four months later she was dead biro frowned night she was murdered she had the baby with her he hasnt been seen since moe said oh man petra said if i was the praying type id ask god to make it a kidnapping biro said we looked into that never got any sort of lead no whacks with fake pregnancies no other snatches or attempts moe said whos the dad good question petra said adella grew up in a conservative family dads an auto mechanic mom provides home health care for old people i was also raised in arizona know her neighborhood solid working class lots of religion adella was a decent student high school cheerleader until tenth grade when she started hanging with a different crowd got into some dope trouble ended up posing for the wrong kind of pictures her parents found out there was a huge scene adella ran away to la high school porn said moe biro said she got wangled into some nudies by a guy claiming to work for hustler what he called art shotsgetting explicit with herself petra said by todays standards no huge freak but by her parents standards she was speeding in the fast lane to hell after she left there was a total breakdown in communicationzero contact until one day the bell rings and adellas standing there with a onemonthold paternity never came up because adella never volunteered and the family didnt want to pressure her afraid shed leave again theyd never hear from her despite their treading on eggshells she only stayed three days mom woke up found her bed and the crib empty she and adella had just bought the cribfun shopping trip poor woman was upset now shes shattered family gave us names of some tough kids adella hung with in phoenix as well as the photographer we worked them all no dice the villareals are salt of the earth but the sad truth is theyre clueless about adellas life for the last eight years biro said she lived in a single on gower not a dump but nothing fancy slept on a foldout couch with the kid next to her in a portacrib most of what was in there was babystuff we found some pay stubs traced back to a poker club in gardena where she cocktailwaitressed for three years until a few months before the pregnancy wohr tended bar at the same place but only for a month before he got fired for not reporting his felony record we got interested in him because surveillance cameras showed her walking with him to her car several times and another dealer remembers the two of them hanging out during smoke breaks wohrs sheet is thick but theres no violence against women but you know how it is guys get away with stuff decide to kick it up a notch we looked at him right away petra said once we found him hed been off parole for a while last address was way out of date one of our cruisers finally spotted him on the boulevard he claimed to be living in la puente but that turned out to be his brothers house where he crashes from time to time we never did put him at a local address moe said now hes got one pimping and living with a hooker said biro interesting brother arnold said moe the car wohrs driving illegally is registered to him maybe somewhere down the line we can leverage that biro said youre figuring to lean on the reverend hes a minister runs a small neighborhood church feeds the homeless has a wife two kids all of them about as wholesome and straight as it gets moe groaned petra said but feel free to talk to him to anyone weve put this one in the fridge welcome anything new does your gut say dont bother with the rev with wohr period theres no evidence implicating wohr but our guts not strong on this one he have an alibi for the time frame of the murder thats part of the problem were not sure of the time frame adellas cell phone record breaks off thirty days before she was found but she wasnt dead nearly that long coroner estimates two three days tops she dcd the account switched to payasyougos hiding something said moe biro said if she was hooking throwaways would come in handy looking at his partner petra said we did have one personold woman living in the same building who thought she was hooking but she had nothing to back that up just intuition no one else felt that way in fact every other neighbor we talked to said that one was loony they liked adella said she was quiet minded her own business concentrated on the baby now that youve told us wohrs pimping it opens up possibilities adella did have moneynearly four thou in a wamu account and she was long gone from the casino biro said problem is weve got nothing saying wohr was pimping back then and im having trouble seeing him with someone like adella on his payroll were talking a big step upward for ramone w moe said what about cell phone records from before she canceled the account mundane stuff said petra takeout baby shops southwest airlines to buy her ticket to phoenix she booked both ways clearly had no intention of sticking around we got into her computer and she didnt use it much some online ordering of clothes for her and the kid some ebay purchases of kiddie books and toys biro said when we questioned wohr he said adella was a casual work buddy he walked her to her car for her safety he volunteered knowing she lived in hollywood but denied he lived here though he did admit to coming down on the bus hanging around the boulevard when we asked him why he gave a dumb smile and said to have fun all of us knew he was scoring maybe selling he really wasnt trying to hide what he was too far gone said moe just his general demeanor he came across more dumbass loser than conniving psychopath and that was verified by our vice guys and a couple of uniforms who knew him moe glanced at the photo petra said poor little thing we found the babys vaccination records in adellas apartment western pediatric there was no regular pediatrician adella used the clinic the nurses who remembered her said she was a happy attentive mom showed up on time into breastfeeding one nurse did recall a comment adella made about her boobs finally being put to proper use which led us to wonder if she was back to posing stripping whatever or had never stopped we canvassed topless clubs photographers who do that kind of thing never turned up a lead moe flipped to the murder books frontpage summary body in griffith park back of fern dell near the stream biro said crawfish got interested moe said thats pretty close to her apartment reasonably close said petra but the park wasnt the killspot just the dump her place wasnt the crime scene either we still dont know where it happened once the coroner gave us that threeday frame we had wohr picked up again and talked to him guy was unfazed said hed been drinking on all three nights produced backup from other juiceheads at the bar bobs where you just saw him hes a regular by itself thats no alibi the murder couldve happened during the day but nothing indicates guilt either you felt strongly enough to question him twice biro said hes all we had petra said we figure whoever killed her picked her up somewhere because her car was never moved from her parking slot at the apartment the seat adjustment fit her height there was no sign anyone but her had driven it maybe she was freelancing to pay the bills ended up on a real bad date if we could tie her to wohr or to any other pimp wed be dancing in the hallway moe she did drugs in high school what about later on biro said nothing in her apartment and her blood was clean moe turned back to the picture youre probably right about being a bad fit for wohr she had the looks to play in a bigger league but that couldve led to some highrolling clients like a zillionaire directors kid petra said sure but from what you saw last night ax dement doesnt go highend biro said maybe hes into variety male psychology its all about novelty petra laughed as opposed to women who crave the same darn thing over and over she turned to moe youre looking at dement because he hangs around with mason book and youre looking at book because hes caitlins boyfriends boss moe said and because books suicide attempt came only a week after caitlin disappeared biro said crushing guilt in an addict movie star anythings possible but those types selfdestruct all the time just because theyre stupid metal in his voice petra grinned my partner loves actors what i love said biro is when i tell people i work hollywood and they get after me for autographs people as in cute girls said petra thats a problem huh pard the problem is i got nothing to show em working in hollywood doesnt mean you get hollywood its westside has all the fun moe said robert blake was the valley biro ticked his fingers oj hugh grant heidi fleiss mario fortuno paris and mischa and lindsay and every other celebutard who duis for fun and profit moe said hey a lot of that was the strip complain to the sheriffs phil spector was out in altafreakingdena petra mimed a pistol aim blam talk about wall of sound all three detectives laughed better than thinking about whodunits with no serious leads moe shut the murder book thanks for your time guys for lack of anything else im going to try to find out how a mope like wohr connected with a trustfund baby like ax then maybe we can backtrack to book andor stoltz then to caitlin and adella biro said maybe ax gambles his daddys money away including at the poker palace moe said or hes into buying sex and loves to slum or ax and wohr hooked up at a postoscars party weaker laughter no ones heart was in it petra said if you can wait around well copy the whole book for you that would be great biro said you busy on the westside not too it was like that last year for us months without a single murder the times wrote about it hexed us we started this year with that decapitation that linked to a serial case of sturgiss one week after that two gang things go down and theyre still wide open petra said four kids gunned down in front of a party and no one saw a thing weve got a pretty good idea whos behind it son of an allegedly reformed banger who scored a big city grant to keep guns out of the hands of people just like him and his offspring moe said meaning pretend to work it hard but dont do squat without the mayors okay listen to him said biro so young yet so cynical one of sturgiss favorite lines moes appreciation for the loos influence climbed a notch he said ill go with you to the copy machine on the way over petra said whos your partner on this no one chapter aaron sat in the opel within eyeshot of swallowsong lane listened to music on his ipod and fought the erosion of confidence billing mr dmitri for hours of surveillance was okay up to a point he had to produce moses being involved didnt help hand his brother a simple case aaron had no doubt moe could close it but a deepfreeze whodunit maybe he was being too hard on bro letting a lifetime of relationship get in the way blood ties be damned he and moses had turned into strangers had they ever been anything else complicated well they could always blame mom one of a kind thinking about her made him smile she never stopped smiling except when she did bagpipes and tears so many men in blue some of them are also crying mom in black veiled big blue shapes looming over his fouryearold self talking about dad off to one side jack sits there crying harder than anyone all of a sudden hes living in the house it had seemed like the very next damned day years later when aaron had acquired snoop skills he went looking for the marriage certificate found it easily enough in the county archives mom and jack had tied the knot three months after the funeral civil ceremony probably one of those deals where couples waited in line to get their ninety seconds of semiattention from a halfasleep judge despite that hed never think of it as anything but the next damned day that was the point a fouryearold needed to construct his own reality and hell if he hadnt coped never opening a fresh mouth to jack even when jack nodded off in the middle of a chess game or monopoly or watching tv never ratting jack out when he picked aaron up from school stinking of booze poor little aaron had a new daddy everything was going to be just fine meanwhile poor little aarons waking up in the middle of the night sweaty and shivering seeing his real daddys smiling face getting tossed up in the air by his real daddy tossing the football man this feels so good feels so damned damned good then real daddy lying in a pool of rich deep blood smiling up at aaron despite the blood and the pain mouthing goodbye little man aaron lived with the dream for years never told anyone about it because that would be chickenshit new daddy new baby pink and freckled as jack unable to do nothing but squall and crap and suck on moms as aaron grew older he craved details about dad mom had no problem pulling out the photo albums talking about the love they shared what a wonderful man a handsome man a smart man jack sitting off by himself watching the tube able to hear but it didnt even bother him what kind of man was that when aaron was seven he built up his courage got jack alone asked jack what had happened jack avoided looking at him thats just a real sad story son im not your son jack reached for his glass of vodka or scotch or whatever was on sale at the liquor store aaron walked away and jack didnt follow that decided it for aaron hes a coward maybe that helped kill dad freeze him out jack dealt with aarons rejection by being superpermissive sometimes indulging aaron behind moms back that only decreased aarons respect for the intruder who slept with his mother no spine the way hed corroded his own liver was proof positive of that when aaron was thirteen jack went out with no style falling off a damned stool no bagpipes mom crying but in a different way when aaron had a year of patrol under his belt he went looking for the original case file finally found it at parker center stashed like any other hopeless unsolved on a dusty metal rack waiting until the records clerk left he pounced drymouthed weteyed heart churning like a drillbit what he found was two pages of poorly punctuated copprose describing the basics of patrolman darius foxs untimely demise and an unsigned paragraph at the end blaming dad and jack for being careless sitting on the cold concrete floor of the records vault crying silently and hoping to god no one walked in aaron pored over the arid memorial went over it again again the anonymous author of the blameconclusion suggested that august be used as a teaching tool but the case had never come up during aarons training aaron nosed around the academy library in elysian park finally unearthed a fifteenyearold manual that included the case among several examples where failure to observe procedure produced disastrous results most of the blame visited on dad for letting his guard down but that was based on jacks report that dad had let his gun drop when the cadillacs drivers window rolled down so where the hell were you aaron returned to the vault planning to photocopy the file forced himself past emotion tried to squeeze something evidentiary from dads behavior a seasoned cop relaxing meant hed faced someone he didnt consider threatening or knew suddenly the file was nothing but paper and ink he stuck it back and left without copying one day hed work the case when he had enough money to kick back for an extended stretch of time really concentrate he was doing great financially each year better than the previous his retirement fund was looking okay and his equity in the house was growing so maybe sooner rather than later how would mom react how would moe react let the damned chips fall at twelve fortysix am headlights slapped him alert white jag with the top down driving down swallowsong middleaged couple woman at the wheel man looking grim six minutes later a painfully slowmoving dark range rover rolled down and passed two gaylooking guys the passenger mussing the drivers hair causing the suv to swerve toward the opel then correct jerkily hoots as the suv rolled away must be nice to enjoy your own stupidity aaron stretched as much as the opels seat would allow his eyes felt like theyd been rubbed with beach sand he moistened with the drops he carried in his dopp kit popped another cancoke not jolt lets not push the endocrines too hard hed taken two sips when the black ram pickup appeared running the stop sign as usual aaron was ready spotted mason book slumped in the passenger seat that same zombie stare hed spied during the drive to the colony with rory stoltz moments later aaron was easing back and forth in light westmoving sunset traffic playing the opel like a trombone slide sneaking in splitsecond stares that coalesced into a single image like pictures in a flip book ax dement wearing a black leather jacket despite the heat greasy hair tied back in a tail broke the speed limit by ten mph as he puffed a doobie in plain sight lynyrd skynyrd thumping out the drivers window all bassenhanced rch kid really piling on the outlaw thing where was the confederate flag and the gun rack they were in beverly hills now a city teeming with cops but illegal smoke was still blowing out the trucks window so ax was a serious risktaker maybe because daddys dough had buffered lifes sharp edges or he was just too stupid to be afraid aaron shifted to the right hazarded another look at mason book the actor sat low stared straight ahead mouth small and tight indulging in nothing but misery the ram continued west all the way to the beach and down the ramp to pch big surprise here we go again mason book craving ocean breeze had found himself another chauffeur for all his outward depression book was the star ax just a pseudomacho hangeron who came panting like a puppy when book commanded ax had his foot to the pedal and keeping up with him worried aaron all he needed was some highway patrol hotshot pulling him over black man at the beach as they neared the colony aaron braced himself for a turnaround but this time the truck kept on going picking up even more speed past the pepperdine campus where caitlin had once studied and rory still did where malibu began turning rural heading to daddys spread in solar canyon latenight mass at the family church but the ram zipped right past solar kanan dume zuma broad beach hooked a quick right that caused aaron to kill the opels lights as he downshifted he watched from twenty yards back as the truck pulled off at the landside entrance to leo carrillo state beach about a mile before la county gave way to ventura and some of californias prettiest sand and water on the land side where the truck was were trails leading to campground and wilderness hikes a couple of years ago a cougar had mauled a mountain biker to death not far from here aaron rolled a little closer trying to spot the trucks taillights the angle of the dip into the lot and the surrounding brush hid the ram to aarons left the poorly limned ocean was more sound than sight steady whoosh of tide in and out like lazy sex aaron had driven by this spot tons of times on trips to oxnard ventura ojai santa barbara but the last time hed actually stopped at carrillo was his sophomore year in college hed taken a girl there to explore the tide pools stretch out on clean white sand pretending to care about starfish and sea anemones in order to get some romance going hoping to catch a glimpse of dolphins because chicks loved dolphins toward sunset he and what was her name had spotted a pod of flippers and that had done the trick great session in the back of his car what was her name brunette half black half white like him said she wanted to be a psychologist ronette ronelle defreeze long lithe body green eyes pretty head turned to one side as she concentrate detective fox he edged the opel closer got twenty feet from the entrance to the park where a sliver of the lot was visible the truck was parked fairly close to the highway blocked by yellow gates that closed off the park after dark impossible to see if it was occupied or not gee thanks starless night that day with ronelle aaron had parked just past the yellow gates concentrating he dredged up memories ranger booth list of regulations entry road shaded by trees ax and book were either sitting in the truck or had exited to proceed on foot either scenario was risky a darkened vehicle illegally parked could easily attract attention from a patrolling park ranger so would the marijuana reek sure to cling to the trucks interior but this was a guy who sped through bh toking up maybe the boys had been here before knew it was safe because ranger patrols were infrequent if budget cuts stuck a handful of smokeys with covering miles of wilderness that made sense what did that say about the safety of campingsomething aaron had always considered a pathetic grab at phony machismo and this was carrillo hed heard rumors about the place the good old days of the manson family other assorted whacks running cannibal parties under full moons human sacrifices blood rites not to mention your gardenvariety sexual psychopath lurking behind every pine cmon jimmy and judy mom and dad have found a superneat place to set up our little sterno stove and cook our wienies and our marshmallows even if the rumors were tall tales what was the pleasure in waking up at sunrise with achy muscles and a mouthful of dirt some rabid raccoon or weasel or whatever farting on your head what were mason book and ax dement doing here at close to two am one way to find out nope too risky encountering the two of them would blow his cover and render him useless moe would love that first commandment of the job thou shalt not fuck up he settled down for another bout of inactivity twentyfour minutes later he saw two figures return to the truck so they had taken a walk the ram backed away from the yellow gates swung onto pch hooked an illegally acute left turn that took it across the doubledouble starting up the opel aaron checked for ongoing traffic completed his own iffy turn pushed the car up to seventy moments later with the ram just starting to come into view red lights flashed in his rearview wonderful before aaron could respond the chp cruiser flashed its brights patience man whats it been a nanosecond next the idiot would be bellowing over his loudspeaker aaron pulled over at the first hint of turnoff the cruiser glided to a stop twenty feet behind it took a long timeway longer than usualfor the chippie to approach careful to keep his hands on the wheel aaron watched the patrolman head his way through the side mirror young just a kid big and poutymouthed and heavy slow deliberate john wayne waddle one hand resting near his gun black man at the beach the chp officer stopped five feet behind the opel just stood there no reason to be worried kiddiecop youve already taken your sweet time running the tags following proper procedure hefting his flashlight high the way they teach you in every police academy the chippie advanced some more stopped again hand on his gun aaron sat there finally step out of the car sir pasting his best guilelessharmlessawshucks look on his face aaron complied at exactly the pace he wouldve appreciated back in his uniform days smiling as the officer blinded him with his flashlight keeping his mouth shut because anything he said would be wrong chapter the reverend arnold wohr had business in the city insisted meeting at the station would be no trouble at all moe wouldve preferred to get a look at the la puente house maybe catch some sign ramone w still bunked out there occasionally but given the revs easy cooperation he was in no position to argue ramones respectable sib showed up ten minutes early the senior brother by two years arnold looked a decade younger a trim balding man in an unstylish spotless gray suit white shirt blue tie brown shoes moe searched for some family resemblance to raymond wohr found it in skimpy chin endowment arnolds gaze was steady and clear his handshake cool and dry moe thanked him for coming asked what kind of business he had in la this business detective i didnt want my family involved in what anything to do with ray whats he done sounds like youre used to being called by the police the police the parole office when ray was still on parole the liquor store in my neighborhood when theres a sudden cigarette shortfall just after rays been there to purchase a stick of chewing gum luckily the owners a member of my congregation youve been cleaning up after him for a while you cant pick your relatives detective but you can try to help them moe said would you consider ray incorrigible arnold wohr frowned if i didnt believe in change i couldnt stand up every sunday and preach it i guess you hear all the time how different you and ray are not really said arnold few people see us together ray doesnt come by much ray was arrested when he was fourteen detective for stealing peach brandy from a supermarket then shoplifting sneakers from a walmart he spent a few months at a youth camp the day he was released mom and dad threw him a welcomeback party he repaid them by emptying moms purse in the middle of the night and sneaking out we didnt hear from him until his next arrest a year later also for theft that time he got sent to adult jail and never bothered to let us know he was out mom and dad were solid working people we had plenty of discussions trying to figure out what ray was escaping from my parents died wondering after i got out of the military my search for answers led me to the ministry wanting to understand ray ray people like him you turn all the facts overthe psychology the sociologybut they dont explain it so you look to a higher power the devil made ray do it the reverends frown caused moe to regret his flippancy he said sir i dont mean to make light of the situation its all right detective i know that faithbased notions of good and evil dont wash in todays society but no ones given me a better explanation for my brothers behavior you see him as evil arnolds eyes rose quickly dropped to below moes level i see ray as misled im not saying some unseen arm is guiding himits not a matter of a demon with a forked tail more like rays negative energy overpowered the positive that sounded newage or all faith simply boiled down to belief in the invisible moe said do you have any idea why i wanted to talk to you reverend i have an idea now said arnold wohr when i asked for you downstairs they informed me id be going to homicide im terrified but hed wanted the interview away from his family even before thatexpecting something bad arnold wohr suspected there was more to his brother than dope and petty theft time to soften him up moe said well i dont mean to scare you but we are investigating your brothers association with a homicide victim association is ray a suspect not yet but he might be would that surprise you reverend rays never been violent yes of course it would surprise me moe slid adella villareals happyface color photo from her murder book and showed it to arnold a tremor plinked the corners of the guys eye sockets then slowwalked to his hairline shes dead my god you know her i met her once she was with her babyin that same blue blanket dear lordwhat happened moe said where and when did you meet her ray brought her for easter not last eastertwo easters ago barely a month before adellas murder moe said easter dinner wohr nodded wed stopped inviting him years ago because he never responded so wouldnt you know when hes not invited he pops in holding some flowers hed obviously picked out of someones yard with this woman that was the second surprise ray bringing anyone he always came alone the third was that shewhat was her name something spanishelena adella villareal yes thats it adella the third surprise was her not being the type of person youd expect ray to associate with how so reverend she was well groomed politea really nice young lady excellent mannersshe insisted on helping us serve different from the other women in rays life arnold sat back ive never met any other women in rays life detective its just it seemed as if she and ray didnt fit not that ray wasnt trying to be on his best behavior when ray shows up its always for money that day he didnt ask for any was dressed decently collared shirt clean jeans i told myself maybe shes a good influence you saw them as a couple i didnt know what to think but there he was with her and baby so yes of course i assumed i remember thinking poor baby if rays his dad lord forgive me moe produced a mug shot of alicia eiger arnold said whos that another friend of your brother this would be more what id expect how did ray introduce adella to your family just hi were here this is adella my wife ran off to set extra places no point embarrassing the girl you assumed ray was the babys father but at some point that changed there was nothing romantic going on ray and adella hardly talked to each othermostly she talked to my wife about the baby mostly she focused on the baby and ray not the least bit interested when adella got up to nurse himhe was a boy cute little thing lots of hairray just kept shoveling food into his own mouth the way he learned in prison hooking his arm and hunching protecting his food said moe exactly do you have children detective no sir in the early stages its all about physical caretaking feeding burping changing then more of the same adella seemed to relish that she ate so little at the table that we prepared her a little care package frown ray cleaned his plate then moved on to hers said something like shell never get to it no sense wasting good grub when ray and adella did interact how did he treat her you think he killed her reverend where the case stands right now is ray knew her and because of his criminal record he needs to be looked at hes never been violent sometimes people do things they never get arrested for arnold didnt answer would it totally shock you if ray did kill someone arnold wohrs eyes trampolined you just said you have no evidence thats true im just asking detective the idea that my brother no i really cant see it rays never been violent never but but nothing sorry said moe i thought i heard a but arnold wohr crossed his legs tugged at a lapel if you had evidence of course id no no i just cant believe ray would ever go that far but if he did something like that of course id want him put away where he could never hurt anyone else anyone else moe echoed is there something you need to tell me about your brother arnolds eyes zipped to one side like a shotgun slide he stared at a spot on the wall im not sure what youre asking detective sounded clear to me reverend i could be totally off base here but ive been picking up some serious concern on your part maybe because you know something about your brother that no one else does silence reverend i understand about family loyalty but protecting the innocent is what were both about arnold stared at him you look young but youve been doing this for a while havent you you are my new best friend moe smiled you look a lot younger than your brother the virtues of clean living said arnold then he laughed my wife says that i tell her its more the absence of dirty living his attention shifted to the floor yes i do need to tell you deep breath what you picked up isnt concern about ray being violent not in the strict sense of causing physical harm moe waited i feel like judas detective judas betrayed a savior doesnt sound as if your brother fits into that category the savior arnold corrected are you a religious man detective depends what day you catch me fair enough i know its my moral obligation to be truthful but this is i guess if i could be sure it was relevant but i cant rays hurt someone in your family no moe shifted closer spread his shoulders establishing dominance what then reverend head shake reverend theres no morality in delaying this is a homicide case adella villareal was strangled and dumped her baby hasnt been seen since wohrs hands covered his face my god i think we both know what god thinks about that ray never hurt her arnold blurted his hands dropped but he frightened her my daughter my younger daughter sarah shes thirteen caught him watching her through a window her bedroom window nod the girls share a room eve was out with friends sarah caught ray peeping dear lord yes when did this happen reverend six months ago ray was back to his usualfilthy tshirt baggy shorts the rubber sandals he stank of alcohol back to asking for money said moe this time he had a story hed turned his life around was now a great investment i gave him everything in my walleta hundred and ten dollars he asked for more i said no he cursed and left is that when you gave him your car my caroh the toyota no that was donated to the church last year i thought my wife could use it so i paid the church full bluebook value but it wasnt practical ive got a second job i install prefab cabinets and sometimes francine and i need to deliver materials to a site we purchased an old suburban and gave the toyota to ray instead of money i was short on cash figured hed sell it you never signed over the pink slip i didnt no sir oh did ray do something with that carhit someone while drunk no reverend back to your daughter you helped your brother out and he repaid you by snooping on sarah was that before he asked for a handout or later arnolds jaws clenched sarah didnt tell me until several days later shed been looking upset and i finally got it out of her i thought it was something about school friends i never expected to hear that what did she say happened she was in her room getting ready for bed spotted movement from the window caught a clear glimpse of rays face then he disappeared she was sure it was ray that mustache of his is pretty distinctive fortunately shes a modest girl wears a long nightgown but just the fact that he was out there sarah was more angry than scared and you doubted it was a onetime thing we talked about it as a family and my older daughter eve said shed always gotten a strange feeling from ray he never actually did anything but his presence made her feel uneasy eves a bright perceptive girl makes you wonder about a darker side to your brother was adella was there that kind of assault as well instead of answering moe said is there anything else in rays history you want to tell mesexually speaking like when you were growing up no no nothing that i knowwill he be charged with snooping on sarah do you want him to be the reason i didnt report it in the first place was i didnt want to put sarah through anything traumatic and she insisted thats what she wanted we talked about it as a family and came to a decision ray was to be barred from the house forever it seemed the best solution now youre telling me ray may have committed an act of perversion no sir i never said that but you didnt deny it when i asked you if adella was assaulted moe took pity on the guy she wasnt reverend wohr and to be honest i dont see how ray can be charged for snooping too much time has passed even if youd reported him at the time i doubt he wouldve been charged being spotted on the other side of a nieces window when shes fully clothed when he wasnt trespassing can be explained away easily he was out there smoking just happened to pass by looking straight at wohr if hes never done anything along those lines before he hasnt said wohr not with my girls then no cop wouldve busted him sirnot here or in la puente but the sexual element was definitely worth looking into thank you said arnold for trying to make me feel better im being honest reverend i appreciate you coming all the way out here and doing the same wohr squirmed there is one more thing detective something ray said the last time i saw him part of that speech about getting his life together he could see i was skeptical so he got specific claimed he was representing people in entertainment representing how i asked him that but he just repeated himself representing like he was some sort of an agent then he brought up adella said remember her highclass arnie shes what im talking about i said ray if you need money just come out and say so and stop spinning yarns arnold shook his head i never talked to him like that something mustve come over me he started using foul language jammed his palm right up in my face said fill the collection plate scrooge that irritated me i smacked the bills into his hand hard he made some blasphemous remark how if the god squad behaved this way god must be a loser at that point i knew he had to leave before i did something id regret i was still smoldering when sarah told me what happened it was like lighting a match to my soul i called my brother left a message telling him to get help for his perverted impulses told him i never wanted to see him again and hes honored that request six months ago not to the day detective give or take representing a dead woman anything else you want to tell me reverend arnold shook his head wheres ray living i dont know sir no sense in a confrontation between the brothers at alicia eigers crib you dont have him in custody no sir so he really isnt a suspect not at this point okay said arnold wohr sounding more regretful than relieved something else on your mind reverend if you do put him in custody detective reed id like to know so i could visit him see how i could help chapter back at his desk moe distilled droplets of fact from his interview of arnold wohr brother rays scumbag image had filled out nicely no violence on his sheet but the guy was sexually twisted enough to peep a thirteenyearold the entertainment connection ramone w had bragged about was another nice nugget tying in to ax dement and the eagle motel sex dope or both probably both was wohrs industry biz limited to a fringe hangeron like ax or had he actually networked with serious money types with unhealthy appetites if wohrs reach did stretch to alist dope fiends like mason book this could get really interesting mountains of money to indulge the gimme gimme gimme ramones boast of representing adella might mean he really had pimped her or he was making himself more than he was she had accompanied him to easter dinner with her baby who ramone showed no interest in the creepiest part was ramone bragging about representing adella long after her murder no official violence in his sheet but he was callous enough to exploit her memory in order to cadge money out of his brother arnold and his family had been confused about the relationship between his brother and the surprisingly polite young lady because citizens like arnold and his family had no clue moe thought about the revs description of the interaction between ramone and adella no affection no conversation scooping food off her plate when she went to feed the baby why would adella a devoted mom hang with him no reason but money the easter visit had probably been ramones idea of a joke bringing highpriced flesh to his devout brothers house on a sacred day callous and meanspirited toss in ramone peeping his own niece during a visit to ask for yet more money and you ended up with a really nasty picture cold uncaring sexually impulsive exactly the combo delaware had listed during the marshmurder investigation when describing the classic kinkwired careercriminal psychopath meaning ramone was capable of anything moe fetched himself coffee drank amid the low buzz of the droom visualizing technicolor flashframes filled with mindsearing brutality caitlins pretty young face contorted in agony adella villareal thinking she was a pro but getting the worst kind of surprise two goodlooking young women as different from each other as any two people could be united in death the baby moe had to get air or hed start hitting something making his way past half a dozen other detectives he hurried out to the hallway that led to sturgiss closetsized office racewalking past the loos closed door he repeated the circuit a couple of times got drymouthed and itchyeyed and bought a coke from the machine before returning to his chair phones continued to ring men and women with intent expressions talked on the phone clicked computer keys del hardy caught moes eye and gave a little salute moe half expected him to come over ask how aaron was doing waving back he returned to adellas murder book not expecting to find anything just wanting to look as preoccupied as he felt his eyes kept returning to the photo pretty dead girl caught smiling all that joy because of a tiny blueswaddled form gabriel a tiny bud of humanity with an angels name four grand in adellas bank despite no job had the challenges of single motherhood led adella to work for ramone w moe thought about how shed dropped in on her folks with the baby snuck out soon after without saying goodbye not unlike ramones unannounced dropin at his brothers so maybe the visit had been adellas idea a girl who liked to play games was that why she refused to say whod fathered the kid because daddy was useless so why get him involved or just the opposite daddy was real useful because he was rich and famous had paid adella off not to go public then why whore because more was more or whoring had conceived the babymoe shut the file to get the pictures out of his head concentrated on setting up a logical sequence of events adella parties with rich industry guys maybe at a gig set up by ramone w she gets pregnant figures out which rig is the daddy asks for money to keep her mouth shut gets some at the time of her murder the baby was five months old and shed died with k in her account less than a grand for each month of gabriels existence maybe it had taken a while to come to an agreementtwo months for arguments sake making two and a half k per month but that was left over after expenses say two a month leaving an estimated gross of k a monthround to sixty grand a year to an industry honcho chump change to someone like adella serious money until she gets greedy asks for more or maybe shed accepted an initial lowball offer because the joy of motherhood hormones whatever had numbed her brain or rich daddy had promised more somewhere down the line either way she realizes shes living in a crappy single budgeting for pampers and pablum meanwhile rich daddys living large house in the hills private jets vip rooms on demand premium tables at koi the ivy wherever those types stuffed their faces moe was certain aaron could rattle off the names deciding to cash in bigtime she leans on rich daddy becomes a problem call in ramone w or someone like him a psychopathic lowlife capable of anything one question why wouldnt rich daddy keep her happy by upping the support because hes a narcissistic asshole used to doing things his way sees no reason why some vagina he pumped who shouldve taken precautions has the right to share the lifestyle why the hell hadnt she aborted in the first place because shed set out to screw himliterally and financiallyfrom the beginning shell just keep asking you ll never be free better to eliminate the problem two problems the pictures rushed back into moes head little blueswaddled package moldering somewhere the rest of the world became background noise as he hunkered down trying to logic out how caitlin frostig fit into the picture caitlin had worked at a bar where celebs had once hung out maybe that included ax dement andor mason book adellas pimp supplied sex and drugs to ax dement maybe also to mason book maybe maybe maybe something missing then it hit him rory stoltz knew everyone caitlin book and dement had the allamerican boyambitious maybe too ambitious been sucked into something dark and nasty did his adoring mommy sense that about her only child did that explain her hostility when moe cornered her at work rory stoltz allamerican walkingaround guy did his duties including passing cash to adella or to a hired killer worse if rory was the glue connecting adella to caitlin this stretched all the way to mason book how did caitlin figure in maybe rory had told her too much and caitlin a moral girl freaked out now shes a problem would rory go along with offing his girlfriend caitlin was dead and rory was still working for mason book the world hed entered women were to be used discarded when no longer useful uhoh one little logical obstacle at the time of adellas murder rory was waiting tables at riptide not working as books heelandfetch moe thought about that decided it wasnt an insurmountable problem just because rory hadnt been formally hired didnt mean he wasnt bootlicking the actor how many crimes had grown out of boozesoaked bar conversation a whole bunch of wrongtime wrongplace what if book had sensed something weakspined about rory hey wanna help solve some problems kid what if rory had earned the pa job because hed passed the amorality test passing the test but flunking life moe logged online and looked up employment agencies in la narrowed the list to half a dozen that specialized in personal assistants private chefs chauffeurs other industrytype jobs an hour later hed confirmed that rory stoltz had never registered with any of them expanding the search to an additional six agencies even though they didnt specialize in highlife gigs brought the same answer same for the pepperdine student employment office where moes easy lie about being a lawyer whom stoltz wanted to work for was believed no questions asked new skill set hed never been a good bullshitter mom always kidded him about his face being a oneway mirror into his soul nothing like onthejob training and maybe the same applied to rory just another california kid hoping for a toehold in the industry master stoltz had learned all sorts of new skills stuff you couldnt put on a résumé no agency registration wasnt proof rory had been hired because of a relationship begun at riptidemoe had yet to place mason book and ax dement at the barbut it did add weight to the balance scale so lets assume for the moment that rory had connected early on to ax dement and book and lost his moral footing quickly either because he didnt have much to begin with or celebrity charisma and wealth were a lot more seductive than cramming for exams and backseat tumbles with caitlin this was a citythis was a worldwhere people got famous for showing up where sex tapes were careerenhancing nothing was beyond the pale why not sell out your girlfriend if it meant something big moe revisited the screenplay hed outlined turned it over again and again each time it got uglier made more sense now how to prove it focus on the victim a film crew was actually shooting in hollywood jamming up la brea between melrose and sunset and the drive to adella villareals last known residence on gower took a smogchoked hour when moe finally reached the address he found it surprisingly uncrappy a nice twentiesera sixunit châteautype with all sorts of fancy moldings and trim painted peach with a burbling fountain out front no answers at the three groundfloor units but no big deal adella had lived on the second the tenant now residing in her single was a cute young asian woman in a white coat a kaiser hospital name tag said karen chan md rii medicine chan looked around eighteen despite eyes drooping with fatigue as she braced herself in the doorjamb and informed moe the unit had been spotless when shed moved in but talk to mrs newfield next door she knows about that girl talked to me about it what she say that my predecessor was murdered and it was never solved like that was supposed to scare me but the rents great and with what they pay residents no way im leaving then i found out the girl hadnt even been killed here so whats the big deal why would mrs newfield try to scare you im not saying she did it was more like sharing the anxiety like shes still freaked out anyway i need to get some sleep going to be on call again before i know it moe thanked her and continued up the corridor his knock was followed by a strained who is it through the door police who police maam about what adella villareal two beats hold on the door cracked an inch dark eyes peered out behind a chain moe parted his blazer showed the badge on his shirt pocket hold on silvernailed fingers fumbled with the chain the door swung open quickly as if destined for that position the woman who stared at moe was his height and broadhipped seventy seventyfive with shoepolish black hair cut in a pageboy grayshadowed brown eyes were a pretty good match to her nail polish thickly powdered skin was the color and consistency of wet tissue paper she wore a pearlgray kimono printed with mauve fish diamondcolored gems strung around a scrawny neck were too huge to be real detective reed maam youre new did he look that green pardon the first time the cops sent a woman i was in the hospital with gallstones my husband talked to her totally useless what with his memory leonard said she was pretty kept going on about it trying to get my goat he succeeded i burned his dinner for a week she came back and talked to methe female didnt seem interested in what i had to say moe smiled id have thought said the woman that shed be interested seeing as leonards memory is useless did you call to let her know you were available thats my responsibility youve got to be kidding true said moe well im here maam a new one said woman looking him up and down theyre growing em young nowadays im interested in anything you have to say maam may i come in im ida newfield sure why notuhoh hold on wait wait wait show me that badge again along with some printed id you look like a cop but a girl cant be too careful after thirty seconds of squintyeyed bifocaled scrutiny ida newfield let him into her living room hed expected musty overstuffed clutter found very little of anything gray felt walls matching carpet one lowslung charcoal leather couch a chromeandglass coffee table a single black lacquer chest with no handles all the warmth of an airport terminal like aarons place ida newfield announced sleek isnt it im an interior decorator did houses you cant even imagine drawing a remotecontrol module from a kimono pocket she clicked a grinding noise accompanied the ascent of a fortyinch flatscreen tv from a slot in the top of the black chest nice said moe its all about negative space said newfield pushing another button and causing the tv to descend know what that means stuff you dont see all the stuff that surrounds the stuff you do see she corrected meaning sanity because space feeds the soul she didnt get that hooking a thumb at the wall shared with the unit next door not she the doctor she the other one the one youre here about she was clean enough but stuff was everywherebaby clothes cribs her pullout bed bottles food ugh head shake have you heard george carlin on stuff first you acquire stuff then you need stuff to take care of your stuff and places to store your stuff man was a genius i almost did his house years ago moe said so you knew adella villareal not in the sense of friendship but i sure know what she did what did she do as if you dont know moe waited you dont said ida newfield oh come on she had sex for money im a feminist and that offends me deeply how do you know she because she went out late dressed like a tart because she offered to pay me to take care of her baby when she had to work suddenly always at night ive raised my own two the last thing i want to do is burp and change pooey diapers no sirree how often did she go out dressed like a tart i wasnt out in the hall keeping count i saw her that way by accidentlets say six times does that work for you what a getup youd think men would tire of the old clichés and show some imagination what kind of getup tartcouture she tried to hide it under her coat but i knew what was going on fishnets skintight microdress that shes falling out of fiveinch spikes tiny little purse for her condoms a lot different than what she pretended pretended what that she was just a nice young mommy ida newfield clucked her tongue a nice mommy should live with a daddy or at least another mommy i dont judge but raising a kid all alone oh sure that works even leonard was somewhat helpful back in the backthen maybe if shed had help that baby wouldnt have squalled so much another hoarse laugh this one bereft of glee he offered to babysit for her leonard i mean doing a good deed said moe oh sure i married a saint not that hed ever follow through no memory he was just in one of his moods why didnt you offer my services honeybunch in exchange for her services i punched his arm he loves that where is your husband hillside memorial she said without blinking he passed two months ago sorry he was ninetythree i was his young chick so who killed her thats what were trying to figure out mrs newfield do you have any idea who did babysit for her different people you saw them coming in and out how many different people at least twono three there couldve been more i saw three like i said its not as if i was spying if i just happened to notice something i noticed such as such as people going in and staying there while she went out all tarted up can you describe these people i didnt get a close look a couple of times it was a man and two women one looked like shed been around the blockprobably helping out a fellow tart for all i know the younger one was too the man was just a bumive seen him around the neighborhood near the bars moe showed her raymond wohrs photo she said you bet is he the one killed her even voice but her hands were quivering theres no evidence of that maam youre just carrying his picture around for fun im carrying pictures of various people ms villareal knew such as this woman alicia eigers mug shot elicited another yup thats the older one thats a police photo right moe nodded ida newfield said maybe i can be a detective too i read that on the back of a matchbook show me the younger one and well go three for three thats all ive got can you describe the younger woman typical how so california said newfield the whole blondeyblond thing not overtly tartish but who knows maybe she fulfills stupid mens fantasiesdeflowering the innocent how young was she young like a college student not that she went to college why not if she did why would she be associating with lowlifes could i show you a picture at the station maam youre kidding said ida newfield like im going to leave the comfort of my home and go traipsing all the way to wilcox street hollywood station was a few blocks away what he needed to show her was at west la he thought of something do you have a computer maam why i could have the picture sent right now just like that just like that im impressed said ida newfield then she cracked up you mean the police department has finally replaced horse and buggies with motor cars of course i have a computer clicking her remote she brought the flatscreen back up pressed more buttons a windows login filled the screen the hardwares down below the tvs the monitor ive got a cordless wifi keyboard and mouse if i need it but this little thing usually does the trick and youll notice i dont need to open the cabinet which i designed thirtyfive years ago knoll was going to manufacture it but the timing wasnt right all the stuff stays out of sight because the system responds to an infrared signal have you met my brother im impressed said moe negative space young man the less we have the richer we are she mixed herself a gibson dropped in two extra pearl onions while moe cellphoned the west la droom he talked to delano hardy and explained what he needed hardy said love to help you but im too old for that technobabble how about burns gary burns a thirtyfiveyearold d and devoted gamer listened and said sure if the scanners working wheres the file several moments passed during which ida newfield sipped her drink and talked about houses shed decorated back in the back then suddenly the tv went from blue to polychrome as caitlin frostigs clean wholesome now grotesquely enlarged visage filled the screen wrought monstrously happy the horror of her death hit moe maybe for the first real time since hed caught the case ida newfield said thats her leonard thought she was cute i thought she was bland so shes a hooker too no maam said moe just a girl who got involved with too much stuff chapter the woman was typical another leggy tan bleachblond soldier in the army of those who lunched but didnt eat much by aarons estimate welltodo xray types made up a third of the crowd at the cross creek shopping center in the heart of malibu this one wore her texturized ashandgold just over the shoulders with feather bangs a youthful look she could still pull off at least from a distance if shed been tucked her surgeon deserved a medal for subtle aaron approved of her stylelongsleeved sagegreen polo shirt probably from ron herman or fred segal lowslung velvet pants the color of good bourbon chocolatebrown designer sneakersgucci he was pretty sure diamond studs sparked her ears not showy but big enough to get the message across someone cares about me the black bmw x suv that she drove poorly while yakking on her cell phone filled out the picture only her walk differentiated her from the looselimbed confident battalion of the privileged she held her head kind of low moved on the slowish side stopped several times midstride looking blank before resuming the inevitable trudge to the starbucks typical to the casual observer but aaron was watching on a whole different level hed been following gemma dement for over two hours by the time she entered the coffee chapel found a spot for himself at an outdoor table of an ohsocute vegan café just across the narrow lane that ran through the ohsocute boutiques lunch would be noodles with fake shrimp good chopstick skills helped him blend in the starbucks was jammed fifteen minutes later she was still in there no sweat he was fully awake into the hunt finally hed been in malibu all morning after alarming himself up at five thirty feeling like someone had dumped a bucket of turd in his mouth forcing himself to work out extrahard then assaulting his body with a cool shower shocking himself alert so he could be back at leo carrillo early trying not to think about last nights traffic ticket the damned chippie idiot wanted to stick him with three separate violations added to the speeder hed gotten a few months ago that could put his license in jeopardy unmoved by aarons pi credentials or the xerox of the nice letter his captain had written him when he left the department the stubborn bastards only concession was knocking it down to two sign here sir have a good evening sir drive carefully sir driving like a braindead geezer he still reached the state park by seven am on the beach side the tide was moderate and gentle no surfers the only vehicle in sight a winnebago pulled to the side so its tourist inhabitants could snap cell phone pix of water and sky the yellow gates were open over in the landside parking lot the rangers booth was empty aaron began scouring the area from where the truck had parked to the beginning of the entry trail for a roach a plastic bag anything interesting hed covered the asphalt and was moving toward the neighboring brush when an opensided parks department jeep cruised in and parked next to his porsche the driver was a young woman with short brown hair wearing the ranger uniform small girl athletic body pixie face she appraised aaron with sharp little cop eyes and got out hed made sure to dress beachy without sinking into tacky white silk aloha shirt printed with discreet tealblue palm trees from a boutique bologna designer cream linen pants italian gloveleather sandals no socks todays watch was a chrome tag heuer that said i dont need to flaunt hed splashed on givenchy mens cologne and that was still working the ladyranger said morning sir looking for something l martin i am but i doubt ill find it rolling his wrist lost my other watch on sunday i was here with my kids took a walk wasnt until i was all the way back to beverly hills before i noticed it was gone he grimaced band mustve broke mention of the highpriced city arched the rangers eyebrows is this guy for real some sort of celebrity too small for a basketball player an actor she eyed the tag at least youve got another one the one that fell off was just a cheapie digital but my kids gave it to me for fathers day the whole sentimentalvalue thing bummer she said you think it fell off here im starting here we only made maybe half a mile before the kids ran out of steamdo you have a lost and found we do but there are no watches in there tshirts towels hats you tell me you attended the better than ezra concert tour i can help you aaron grinned you wouldnt happen to have a smokey robinson tee the ranger grinned back no such luckyou know him smokey no i just love his music oh clear disappointment she pointed toward the path leading into the park best thing is retrace your steps good luck maybe the force will be with you today from your mouth to gods ears perhaps the deity liked cute females in snug uniforms because it only took a few minutes for aaron to find the spot two clear sets of shoe prints veered off the road into a thicket of eucalyptus and lower shrubs well before the campgrounds a section of broken branches had cued him in once he got past the trees the ground grew smooth and the roaches were obvious two little nubby brown paper things easy to miss if you werent looking aaron stooped didnt touch a thing as he took in the area small clearing backed by stubbier denser trees tangles of spiky plants smoothsoled footwear had left deep impressions a heavyweight from the shape of the heel maybe some kind of boot longer shallower impressions bore a tiretread pattern your basic tijuana huarache sandal maybe mason book wasnt into fashion footwear or the guy was rich enough not to care no sign of disturbance of the soil indicating a burial but fifteen months had passed since caitlins disappearance so that meant nothing close to the path for a burial site though he supposed a couple of arrogant entitled killers might be that reckless he gloved up collected the doobiebutts dropped them in a plastic ziplock something near a rock caught his eye five burned paper matches a foot from those a oneinch square plastic bag empty but he was able to make out a couple of tiny granules trapped in a corner brownish maybe mexican tar he sniffed sometimes h gave off weird smellsa vinegarandcatpiss cocktail this stuff was odorless maybe good h bagging the baggie he looked around for anything else interesting off to his left maybe ten yards away the trees ruffled and a dark shape protested his presence with a highpitched squawk shooting upward a missileshaped creature cleared the tree canopy aaron made out the wide fringed wings of the hawk as it soared out of view he thought of mr dmitri little birdie indeed stopping at the hows market at pch and trancas he bought a bagel and a quart of milk ate and drank in the parking lot while watching construction workers drive in and out in trucks a couple of maids in uniforms entered on foot probably from the big houses that lined broad beach a few of the hardhats checked out the cs aaron concealed by tinted windows chewed on his breakfast and wondered why ax dement and mason book had driven all the way to western malibu in order to smoke up had to be something about that particular spot lacking authority he couldnt very well return with a shovel even for moe to return thered have to be probable cause state park coastal commission he could just picture the scene probably end up like that tv show a few years back some talkshow dude opening al capones vault building the suspense up for weeks then the damned thing turns out empty a paunchy guy with a tool belt came close to the porsche and attempted to look through the passenger window aaron slid the window down guy nearly fell over morning yeah heycool wheels do the x upgrade on it nah said aaron paid fifteen grand less and got it up to awesome have a nice day man you too aaron had chosen his own wheels for today because a black man at the beach needed to look as rich as possible plus he missed the cars fantastic handling not to mention the general aura of cool that engulfed him when he got behind the wheel keeping the top up though because this day at the beach was a job like any other as he nourished himself he made calls to people who owed him favors remembering the diminishing pattern of phone calls between mason book and caa he started with a talent agent at a competing outfit whose divorce had gone smoother because of what aaron had learned about the guys much younger notsoloving wife the guy said ive got a meeting in five whyre you asking about mason dropping the stars name in that casual way that said i play in that league even though the guys client list topped out at soap opera fillins aaron said nothing juicy and this needs to be confidential because we all know what happens when things arent confidential confident the guy would remember his exs proclivity for being shat on by japanese businessmen reduced alimony and full custody of the lhasa apso was one thing being suckered so everyone knew it was another of course pompous as if thered never been any question about being discreet so what do you want to know is mason still hot hot in demand maybe not as much as he used to be but a helluva lot of people would still be happy to work with him once they know hes okay okay as in youre the private eye youre telling me you dont know i need specifics ken word has it there isnt a drug masons met that he didnt date that serious huh his last shoot took way longer than usual because of looong naps coke and weed dont do that catch my drift heroin they say it has that effect does he shoot or smoke how would i knowsmoke id bet cant afford any needle marks aaron said but the picture did get finished loose change for danny hell yeah made a nice profit maybe maybe the agent laughed depends on who the accountants are i did a project with pam demoynefrom shadows of our days she was amazing im talking on a level with streep and mirren but the suits sent it straight to video anywayill send you a dvd its really great historical story about shakespeares secret gay life pam was anne hathaway she was the accountants aaron prompted right said ken the accountants i got pam a twentyfive percentage of net which is amazing even if it is net at that level you should see some payout never saw a dime of royalties we do an audit theres a threehundredthousand distribution fee i say whats that they hem and haw finally they tell me its the price of driving the film from the production office in westwood to the editor in burbank highpriced taxi ill take the gig oh yeah so did books last picture make money probably because hes got clout they might be afraid to pull bullshit like that but maybe diminishing clout he hasnt worked in what a year and a half two three are you snooping around because something nastys gonna pop aaron like hes over the edge and the studios gonna be suing him for breach nothing like that ken now tell me about ax dement who lems oldest son i hear he hangs out with book news to me said ken ive got no time for hangerson would you work with lem you mean because hes a fascist and a racist and a fundamentalist hypocrite not my idea of integrity aaron aaron said what if the accounting was good ken laughed in that case sure but dont tell my mother aarons second call was to liana parlat how about another trip to riptide same fee structure she said sure maybe ill run into dr rau again but could it be in a couple of nights busy cartoon audition i need to sound like an obnoxious twelveyearold not much of a stretch said aaron liana laughed and whined nasally thanks dad you never called rau huh not because im scared aaron because ive been working another brat voice one of those classy animations under consideration at one of the socalled edgy networks disgusting family even more disgusting flatulent dog gas noise is part of your repertoire actually im under consideration for sinead the twelveyearold daughter putting on a high reedy voice oh man daddyperson when you said this was a field trip i didnt know wed actually be out in the field listening to the growls and howls of gyros bowels here i come mr oscar beats honest labor mr fox as does lancing for you whats the drill for my second visit just sit around soak up more atmosphere if the topic ever comes up naturally work ax dement into the conversation the son but not lem she said youve got something concrete not even close lee the case is arctic but im sifting dirt wherever i can smiling at his choice of words the clearing at carrillo was still on his mind she said it would sure be nice to dig up some downright filth related to that abusive asshole resuming the kiddie voice gee sure mr foxperson that would be a real field trip by ten am aaron had completed his fourth sally up and down the poorly paved treelined highway that snaked past len dements solar canyon spread ten miles above pch each cycle raised the risk of being spotted he tried to buffer the threat by stretching the time between passes driving a good fifteen miles past the watchzone before coming back down if nothing happened soon it was back to the city with plastic bags and question marks barely half a mile past the property the real estate switched to public domain undeveloped state conservancy land along an increasingly rutted road sloping granite on one side shallow canyons on the other aaron eased the porsche around curves enjoying the way the fourwheel drive embraced the asphalt small birds flittered above the brush unaware or uncaring about hawksman there were a lot of winged creatures out heregliding scoping out the buffet swooping google earth had defined dements sixtyplus acres with an aerial shot only one access a singlelane entry road from the roadside gate connecting to a few acres of flat pad the big rectangle right of center had to be the main house farther back to the left several smaller outbuildings sprouted like buds no sign of any church under construction but maybe the picture was old twenty solar canyon a cinch to find the gate was mesh manually operated nearly flush with the road barbedwire fencing stretched from the posts a good five hundred feet in either direction no mailbox no address numerals no fakeo cowboy brand over the gate like some of the other places hed spotted driving up on the other hand no snarling dogs or no trespassing warnings any other goaway on his third pass he hazarded a stop looked for a wellconcealed security camera failed to find one so either hightech developments had gotten past him or dement didnt bother to keep watch figuring a camera would be too conspicuous the guy had tons of dough but chose to live away from the industry hubbub of beverly hills brentwood the colony broad beach a place meant to be ignored beginning his fifth pass aaron was ready to call it quits when a black x crested the road above the gate and rolled down erratically he zoomed past parked precariously on the narrow highway just out of view of the suv ran down to where he could see and not be seen the x was idling its drivers door open a slim fairhaired woman was unlocking the gate with a key once shed pushed the heavy metal frame wide she returned to the suv drove out a few yards got out again relocked the gate aarons longrange lens captured the whole tedious routine maybe lem dement didnt want people coming and going that easily by the time the x was gone aaron was inspecting digital images include a nice closeup of the womans face but no need to guess hed memorized every face in the malibu papers family portrait of the dement clan gemma dement hadnt changed a bit chapter sevenhundreddollar fendi shades hid mrs lem dements eyes the rest of her face was blank coming straight at himhad he gotten that rusty bracing himself for a confrontation aaron chopsticked a phony shrimp pretended to savor as she got closer he opened the book hed brought for cover paperback biography of george washington carver looking intellectual never hurt especially intellectually black gemma dement kept coming even with sunglasses on he sensed she was staring at him big mess where had he screwed up the designer jeans boutique the organic market the bikini shop two hours of stalking while the woman looked but never bought shed seemed preoccupied but obviously shed figured it out okay plan b if she hassled him hed fake surprise work the charm hoping shed feel foolish and walk away if she persistedgot nasty or downright paranoidhed find a way to let her know hed found her attractive but was no weirdo what was the worst she could do call for one of those braindead security types in charge of policing the shopping center by the time they arrived hed be gone what did he look like maam they all look the same now she was ten feet away she stopped did that absenteyed thing stood right in the middle of the narrow street no cars gliding past but still a woman could get pulverized that way goodlooking woman finding her attractive wasnt a lie back at the bikini shop hed pretended to be interested in the surfwear place next door had gotten close enough to her to eye some details shed tried on several swimsuits frowned a lot always dissatisfied but not because she couldnt pull off skimpy under her clothes was a tight body lines on her face but so what fifties but secure despite what liana claimed about her being pounded regularly by lem aaron hadnt spotted any bruises or other telltale marks but cotton and velvet were hiding most of her flesh she resumed walking beelined for his table shit he put his nose in the book faking concentration gemma dement got close enough for him to smell her perfume something light grassy aaron braced himself she glided by entered the vegan joint he wiped sweat from his hairline returned to his food hazarded an overtheshoulder peek inside the restaurant no other customers at the ordercounter skinny woman but nice ass that bit of extra cheek that gilded the lily looked natural maybe no lipo five minutes later she was outside carrying a plate of something green and beige two other tables were positioned to the north of aarons both empty she chose the nearer one chose the seat closest to his fluffing her hair and straightening her back she sat like a charm school grad shoulders square platinum butt barely touching the cushion inspecting her mushroomsprouttofu whatever she unwrapped her own chopsticks stared in aarons direction until he was forced to look up smiled said yum he finished a couple of pages on peanut technology went inside and ordered iced tea all the place served was hot and green but he cajoled the counter kid for a cup of ice tossed in some sugar because the brew tasted like liquefied lawn trimmings when he got back to his table gemma dement was still there maybe even a little closer eating daintily and reading her own book something by anna quindlen didnt quindlen write about abused women and the like this time it was aaron who tried to get eye contact going she didnt bite began humming closed her book dropped it into her bag picked up her plate and placed it on aarons table toed the purse over to a chair directly across from aaron and sat down good afternoon throaty voice maybe a smoker but no smell of smoke just that fresh clean fragrance aaron didnt have to fake surprise afternoon she nodded as if hed said something predictable her eyes were aquablue same color as the sea this morning gemma dement said of course it couldve been good morning pardon proper fit is such a hassle but you know that by now aaron stared her smile was crooked oddly girlish we didnt exchange greetings an hour ago when i was agonizing over bikinis and you were watching me struggle aaron didnt answer gemma dement clasped her hands prayerfully and leaned closer please dont tell me i imagined you watching you brightened my day i did said aaron amazed at how hed morphed into an awshucks geek gee mrs robinson you certainly did mr reader reaching across the table she touched his book short nails no polish clean hands had aaron imagined the tremor that passed through them quickly he said light reading felt a welcome rise of internal warmth as her fingers quivered again her weakness fed his strength time to work the woman she said doesnt look light to me it is compared with what i usually have to deal with another skewed smile this one hard to characterize aaron thought he spotted a dark splotch of skin peeking above the hem of her tshirt frosted by a granular patch of coverup texture was the giveaway the color was perfect blended expertly with her golden skin long years of practice hiding bruises she said now im supposed to ask what you usually have to deal with not unless you care she laughed has to be something boringare you a professor aaron said attorney legal briefs ah she said sitting back one of those aaron spread his arms here come the lawyer jokes dont know any lawyer jokes im not much for jokes period she turned serious as if illustrating so tell me mr lawyer whos also a recreational reader why have you been watching me for the last hour at least hed gotten away with half the surveillance because youre gorgeous he said her face went blank that same glazed expression as when she stopped midstride and spaced out aaron said you stood out did her eyes just get wet shed swiped them too quickly for aaron to be sure please forgive me if i freaked you out i thought of approaching you then i saw your ring eyeing her fourcarat diamond she said oh that twisted the gem out of sight her other hand rose she smoothed down hair pulling out his little alligator card case aaron slid out the topmost rectangle prepositioned like a magicians trick deck highquality paper pale blue embossed navy lettering proclaiming the credentials of arthur a volpe attorney at law the kansas city address terminated at a maildrop the phone fed to the sad bachelor pad of arthur a wimmer a distant cousin of moms arthur was a problem drinker who claimed to be a chemist but couldnt hold down a steady job aarons yearly retainer went toward answering the line in a businesslike voice and saying the right things decent dough for maybe an hour all year gemma dement scanned the card quickly gave it back lawyer on vacation longoverdue vacation she pouted all by your lonesome aptly put he said las a tough place when you dont know anyone volpe she said youre italian aaron searched her face for irony saw deadserious curiosity moms side is from milan picking the city the way he usually did when questioned because it was the hub of fashion like that character on that showhomicide lieutenant giardello said aaron he was half sicilian thats the south milan is up north well she said sorry for not knowing italian geography i like that show lots of guilt and atonement dont you think that makes for a good story absolutely said aaron nothing like guilt as a motivator spinning the line off lightly gemma dements blue eyes clouded she forked her food didnt eat volpe what does that mean its italian for fox do you go there regularly the old country i mean never been there my italian cousins keep telling me i need to go eventually ill get around to it too much lawyer work way too much i do real estate litigation and theres never a shortage meanwhile you come to malibu and watch much older women agonize over bikinis slightly older women liar she said cheerfully may i ask your name eyeblink gloria like in the song well mr volpe the lonely busy attorney you did make my day by noticing gloria said aaron you are extremely easy to notice pulling the line off with utter sincerity because he meant it up close the tight and lean was even more impressive the total package enhanced by generous breasts too soft and bouncy not to be real those lovely little bumps of unfettered nipple he imagined her dressing quickly but expertly in a mansion ranch house green acres vivid through a crystalline window nothing to do today but try on bikinis eyes the color of the ocean as the sun kissed it the dark patch right beneath the hem of her shirt oddly appealing aaron wanted to help her knew he couldnt she was nothing more than a potential data bank rich goodlooking woman who paid for her humongous diamond and the rest of her lifestyle with pain guilt and atonement shed given him something to work with he said going back to the whole guilt thing i guess the difference between good people and bad is the level of atonement she said speaking of which pardon you could atone for your sin what sin is that standing there watching while i went through those bikinis what if i was the type to get freaked out i really am sorry it was just just what what i said before youre an extremely she silenced him with a finger over his lips her skin was warm slightly dank maybe even a little greasy as if shed used lotion recently or was secreting something aaron could feel little bubbles of his own sweat popping in his hair gemma dement shifted closer her hand lowered to his she rubbed the space between his thumb and forefinger pretty blatant out in public like this people walked by no one seemed to notice no one recognizing her a woman ignored aarons lips were dry he restrained himself from licking gemma dements eyelids lowered big curling lashes another flash of pacific twelve cylinders of perfume your sin she said was watching me but not following through he followed in the porsche as her x drove out of the cross creek lot turned right at the light continued north on pch she drove faster and better than she had on the ride from home no absentminded sways no cell phone distraction aaron kept to the speed limit he couldnt afford to do otherwise as if sensing it gemma dement slowed down so he could stay with her like a dance like a woman fixing herself to your rhythm putting you back inside when you popped out where was she taking him back to the ranch lem out of town on some shoot the kids in school whatever staff was around that discreet a woman that blatant he could see why she got beat up no scratch that there was never an excuse still what was he getting himself into just south of point dumewell before solar canyonshe stuck an arm out of the drivers window jabbed three times to the left aaron pulled into the center island behind her hoping no chippie would happen by the x waited for traffic to pass then swooped up a steep blacktop driveway at the top was a series of white clapboard bungalows a sign on a post read surf n sea beach hotel daily and weekly rates premium cable the aaa seal of approval hotel my ass this was your basic fiftiesera motel not the first time the job had taken him to a drivein tryst only this time hed be more than a guy with a camera rigors of the job little moe had no idea when the coast was clear he turned shed waited fifteen feet in half hidden by a cloud of bougainvillea her arm shot out again aaron was supposed to hook a right he complied found several parking spaces shaded by a gigantic coral tree messy thing the porsche was sure to get dirty but he could see why shed picked the spot out of visual range of the northernmost bungalow that served as the motels front office as he pulled in gemma dement cruised past five minutes later she was walking toward him looking grave fendi lenses flashing coppery light on the surface all business but her body language disputed that swinging a key on a dolphinshaped holder in wide playful arcs like a kid ready for an adventure once they were inside the small dim mildewed room she drew the drapes tugged several times to make sure no sliver of daylight intruded one step short of total darkness aarons pupils dilated as he strained to follow her movements she moved easily familiar with the layout what the hell have i gotten into as he stood there she got into that humming thing again powered up the twelveinch flatscreen sitting atop a tilting bureau punched a code without consulting the guide home away from home the station she selected was all music socalled smooth jazz heavy on repetition and low on imagination lots of brushpercussion lots of lazy saxophone oh lord a porno soundtrack he still hadnt budged from just inside the door when she marched to the bed folded back a corner of the comforter ordered get naked and comfy ill be back in a jif she took her purse into the bathroom aaron listened for telltale sounds anything weird heard nothing okay this was the choice point make his escape and possibly miss the chance for a serious lead or go with it seconds later he was under the covers clothes folded neatly over a chair wallet watch cell phone safe at the bottom he watched numbers shift on the cheap digital clock next to the tv a jif stretched another four minutes during which he fantasized about terrible things shes got a gun a razor im an idiot the bathroom door opened and she was at the side of the bed standing lean and unclad brownpelted crotch inches from his nose ready for inspection not a young womans body but beautiful that longwaisted configuration he liked but still plenty of leg that nice belly curve women developed when they didnt get crazy about starvation those childbearing hips defined by angular bones generous breasts no false advertising by the tshirt a little droopy but for some reason that appealed to him shed pulled her hair into a ponytail the diamond ring was nowhere to be seen that last factand her assgot him instantly hard as she bent at the waist and leaned over him he smelled her breath astringent with alcohol gin the junipers were in bloom shed fortified herself with a bathroom belt he touched her mixed business with pleasure and looked for bruises none but the single camouflaged patch how many internal wounds he had no idea gemma dement got in bed and his nose filled with booze and perfume clapping one hand on his head she fed him her left nipple suck it hard but dont bite it keep your eyes closed i really am much older aaron wondered how hed itemize this on his next bill to mr dmitri he went into it expecting crazinessmanic sex followed by tears guilt some sort of histrionics sobbing discussion of guilt and atonement she worked him like a pro athletic silent not even breathing hard positioned herself serially as if playing for an unseen camera while she was in the bathroom hed gone over every damned inch of the room to make sure there wasnt any camera they stayed in a lock until she eased away yet again did something with her legs that looked unlikely managed to guide him in comfortable oh yeah obliging considerate businesslike going along with anything he wanted then rewriting the script without warning as she assumed a new pose this was choreography and she was in charge that shouldve bothered aaron he enjoyed himself anyway had to work at holding out wanting to keep this level of pleasure for as long as he could she knew he was ready before he did said come in my pussy its safe or anywhere else its your choice the detachment in her voice caused him momentary selfdoubt an instant of diminished blood supply she did something with her hand and her mouth and he was back in the saddle anytime artie she said youve already rocked my world afterward she said please stay in bed and went to dress in the bathroom when she emerged her hair was loose and she looked as if shed just taken a pleasant nature walk as she moved to the door aaron said youre leaving youre the one on vacation regards to kansas city they got some crazier little women in malibu aaron sprang out of bed hurried to her side stay youre beautiful looking down she laughed took hold of him gave a playful tug youre a healthy boy my lawyer sorry bye youre leaving me here to atone all by myself anger tightened her face she stepped away from him disgusted aaron said what did i say her face churned turned ugly got pretty again spit flew with each word atonement is for assholes who actually sin let me out of here chapter moe sat at lizs computer searching for web images of adella villareal with either ax dement or mason book book was everywhere lanky and blond and handsome and heavylidded dement junior showed up a handful of times always as a secondrow leech almost always unidentified adella was nowhere being strangled with whoknowswhat done to your baby didnt merit attention unless someone wrote a movie about it he thought about caitlin babysitting for adella set up by rory or had adella come into riptide chatted with the friendly college girl why would caitlin going to school already with a job have taken on an additional gig all the way in hollywood maybe adella had charmed her or caitlin had been introduced to adella by someone more highstatus than rory like mason book he had two points of entry rory or raymond wohr the kid could refuse to talk to himwith that mother of his a likely response the last thing moe needed was rory going the lawyer route maybe a highpowered lawyer hired by mason book wohr was definitely a better bet hed find some way to brace the lowlife liz awoke and called him into the bedroom later they showered together she left for the lab and moe dressed for the job glad she wasnt there to see todays work clothes driving to hollywood he phoned petra connor to inform her hed be working her turf she said have fun weve been to vice seeing if we missed anything no one has information about adella selling her body wohr and eiger are lowlevel hustlers with no showbiz connections anyones aware of moe said wohrs twisted and recounted his talk with the reverend arnold petra said his own niece what a dirtbag what i keep thinking about is he showed no feelings for the baby basically ignored it and who doesnt like babies exactly in my mind hes shaping up as all kinds of bad makes sense she said youre on him today soon as i get to his crib im at la brea and santa monica welcome to hollyweird he parked six blocks from the apartment on taft psyched himself up to shuffle slow look glassyeyed dressing for the job meant forgoing shaving a gray watchcap pulled low on his head a tshirt rescued from the bottom of his laundry hamper his grungiest jeans and crappiest sneakers under a stalesmelling previously worn green hoodie hed just bought from a street vendor at hollywood and highland for nine bucks hed checked the garment carefully couldnt shake the feeling some sort of microscopic vermin had set up house in polyester street cred came with a price if he was even pulling it off no one paid him attention as he rounded hollywood boulevard so maybe he was slouching sucking in his cheeks and jamming one hand deep into a jeans pocket as if he had a stash buried down there he half stumbled up raymond wohr and alicia eigers block one apartment building after another a few half decent theirs wasnt with cracked stucco sagging gutters a brown lawn up above franklin the housing got a little nicer better to avoid that and not chance alarming some nervous citizen he turned west on franklin covered a couple of blocks reversed himself lit up a cigarette that never touched his lips repeated the whole damn drill several times the aimless routine of a lonely addled loser lots of cars few people las motto on his fourth circuit he encountered a toughlooking crewcut multipierced girl walking an offleash white pit bull that looked to be ninety pounds of muscle huge bigtoothed critter the dog spotted him padded forward moes gun was tucked in the small of his back he hoped to god it wouldnt come to that the dog reached him sniffed his shoes licked his hand inhaling moe petted an ironingot neck the girl said iggy likes you man youre cool street cred indeed on his seventh trip down taft he spotted ramone w and alicia eiger arguing on the sidewalk too far to hear what they were saying but the body language was clear both of them in sweatshirts and jeans no makeup for her her hair was as ragged as ramones side fringe she wore unfashionable hornrimmed eyeglasses the two of them couldve been any pair of shopworn street people she was doing most of the talking ramone just stood there looking miserable letting eiger yap staring over her head not even faking paying attention she finally figured out she was being shined on poked his chest until she got eye contact more monologue again ramone zoned out eiger poked him again started waving her hands trying to stir up a response he nodded stupidly eiger wasnt satisfied stepped up closer embarked on another tirade a mohawked kid walking by turned to stare and she switched her ire to him the kid held out his hands peacefully hurried off eiger resumed her rant this time ramone tried to shush her with a finger over his lips she hauled off and hit him hard across the face ramone staggered back rubbed the offended spot moes hand snaked around to his gun expecting the return blow a fullout brawl stepping into the middle of it would be a disaster for the case but letting a psychopath maul a woman in public was out of the question alicia eiger didnt seem worried she clapped her hands on her hips dared ramone to retort stupid woman cemeteries were full of them moe inched forward so hed have enough time to be effective as far as he could tell neither of them noticed him raymonds shoulders tightened up eiger taunted him flipped him off ramone shrugged sagged turned his back on her and walked south toward hollywood boulevard she mouthed a word moe read her lips stupid maybe he should talk to this charmer but while he was considering his options eiger stomped back inside her building scuse me maam lapd homicide why is ramone stupid moe shuffled past the shabby building ramone was out of sight probably drowning his sorrow at bobs or some similar dive moe considered checking out the bar was he good enough to nurse a beer on a neighboring stool get the guy talking what chance was there ramone would admit to being a total pussy speaking of which witnessing the encounter had shaken up moes preconceptions hed been thinking of ramone as a murderous thug but the mope had just come across scary as milk he walked back to his car encountered a few other dogwalkers including an old bent woman with a tiny fluffy white mutt who snarled viciously as moe passed she said good boy champ hes a bum when he returned to his desk at west la aaron was sitting in his chair playing a blackberry at the sight of moe his brother sprang up i may have something for you may said moe where can we talk that assumed a lot moes instinct was to say so but something in aarons demeanor stopped him no wiseass glint in his eyes that intense purpose on his facethe same look aaron had worn back when he was throwing long passes or adjusting his batting stance completing the pass more often than not great rbi moe said lets go once they were in a windowless room and aaron had checked for hidden mikes he said i may have found caitlins burial spot still totally unaware of adella villareal raymond wohr alicia eiger moe indulged himself in brief selfsatisfaction saying tell me about it as he sat back aaron described mason book and ax dements drive to leo carrillo the clearing where theyd smoked up and sniffed heroin you know for sure it was heroin getting picky about a probably irrelevant detail because between this and eiger chewing ramone a second asshole his head was swimming with uncertainty did a presumptive test now aarons knowitall grin was back home chemistry set moses i cant promise you the place is the tombthe ground wasnt disturbed but its been a long time stuff grows and before you ask sure its possible the two of them just love getting high at the beach but its a helluva ride from the hollywood hills just for that why not enjoy their dope behind gates up on swallowsong i think the spot has psychological significance and they were engaging in some sort of ritual returning to the scene of the crime aaron crossed his legs smoothed a lapel stared at moe trying to figure out if he was being put on for some reason moe felt like a pain in the ass it happens with psych crimes right reliving the thrill aaron relaxed it does look i know this isnt hard evidence moses but it was all i could do not to go back with a shovel myself i meant what i said about not getting in your way a cadaver dog could answer the question pretty easily im not hearing enough justification to call in the ks especially in a public parkin malibu coastal commission would probably get involved listen to me like every other regulationspouting suit okay said aaron i just want you to know whatever i learn his brothers glum expression threw moe selfdoubt had never seemed part of aarons repertoire im not saying its not interesting aaron it is especially with malibu coming up over and over everything about caitlin seems to hover around the coastline except her babysitting gig in hollywood aaron brightened my thought exactly caitlin and rory go to school at pepperdine work in santa monica lem dements ranch is in solar canyon and now ive seen mason book take two nighttime trips to pch restless sleeper said moe guilt can do that to you though it doesnt look like mr books remorse extends to selfmutilation what do you mean just before you arrived i was clearing a text message tapping the blackberry one of my sources heard a rumor there were no cut marks on books arms or anywhere else on his body during his supposed suicide stay at cedars no sign period that hed placed his life in danger whos the source sorry said aaron and given all the hubbub over at the u about patient confidentiality you dont want to know good point moe said reliable source very someone who works at cedars aaron smiled someone whos connected to someone who knows someone who works at cedars but before you dismiss it i will tell you were talking an embittered industry person being edged out of a job on the way to career oblivion quoting merry ginzburg word for word strong motivation to help clear the case why i promised a scoop once the dust settles once not if said moe nothing like optimism only way to live brosorry aaron adjusted his jacket todays was smooth silk the color of dark chocolate a hue black men pulled off better than anyone moe was thankful hed stopped at his locker and changed out of his bum clothes tossing the green hoodie into the trash because he couldnt shake the feeling it was alive he said if book didnt try to off himself why was he hospitalized and why announce hes a suicide good questions moses exhaustion said moe isnt that how celebs spin when they check in for detox no detox here said aaron no drugs of any sortthats what tipped off my sources source it was like the guy was using the place for a hotel moe said maybe no prescription drugs but he had friends bring in recreational chemicalsmaybe suicide was a cover for something worse careerwise like a total mental meltdown if book fell apart totally his handlers wouldnt want it publicized better to cover with a halftruth aarons eyes widened i like that going off the deep end total blithering lunatic people shy away from crazy but depression suicideclimbing back up from adversitythats the cover of people thats oprah being your new best friendyeah that makes sense moses moe said and the fact book never made it to oprah or people could mean hes still nutsthe problem didnt go away it also syncs with his not making a movie in three years hearing voices seeing little green men would make it hard to follow the script but one thing bothers me they treat psychotics with drugs right is your sources source certain there were no meds at all thats what im told said aaron careful to avoid any hint of merrys gender then maybe were wrong or maybe book found himself a shrink who doesnt use drugs i like the totalwhack angle because it makes him capable of some real bad behavior as in picking up a starstruck girl like caitlin at riptide bringing her over to his place to party once he gets her under control he goes all lecter has his way with her in the hollywood hills said moe and buries the body forty miles away to be safe with ax dements help because ax is books primary walkingaround guy could very well have been part of the kill i say that because choosing malibu points to axs involvement moses hes been brought up there hell maybe he was the one chose the burial spot because he knows the area nice and close to daddys ranch moe said and book weird as ever returns to the scene to get high relive the experience chauffeured by axwho could also be getting off on the whole thing aaron said rory stoltz chauffeured book to malibu the first time even though book chickened out and they turned back at the colony rory couldve been in on the kill as well the three of them meeting up in that damned bar moe said books nuts but he can still feel guilt thats why he checked into cedars a week after caitlin went missing freaked out over what hed done aaron leaned over clapped him on the back this is good moses i know its all theory but it feels right moe went silent thinking about his options show his hand to his brother or keep working aaron as an outside guy aaron was smart would eventually figure it out aaron would be smarter if he was informed what moses theres more chapter for the first time in his life moe realized something about aaron his brother could be an excellent listener aaron didnt move a muscle as he took in the facts adella villareal baby gabriel ax dements eagle motel tryst with raymond wohr and alicia eiger wohrs peep of his own niece caitlin frostig babysitting for adella the only thing he didnt tell aaron was wohrs passivity in the face of eigers verbal abuse which had shaken up moes notion of him as a dominant psycho killer because he was still trying to figure out what that meant when he finished aaron said whoa genuinely knocked over by everything moe had uncovered not a trace of now you choose to tell me so now weve got a link between two dead women oh man okay my ops over to riptide how do you feel about getting me a jpg of adella could be too risky my person knows how to be subtle moe knew his brother could get pictures of adella with or without his help he said lets go back to my desk ill get you a scan thanks now its my turn for something additional nothing i was holding back i just didnt get to it after we started brainstorming about book this morning i spent some time with gemma dement axs mommy keeping his voice even but he shifted uncomfortably it was unlike his brother to fidget moe smiled goodlooking woman for her age the two of you discuss politics we discussed peanutsforget all that the point is the womans seriously weird obsessed with guilt and atonement quote unquote normally i might attribute that to some sort of religious conviction her and lem finding god together though she doesnt put much stock in the seventh commandment but if baby boy ax was involved in murder she might be tormented by the knowledge moe said living with a big dark secretdid she come across guilty herself or just talk about it philosophically aaron shook his head there was emotion there but hard to pinpoint what it was what does that mean what it means is she wasnt bent over with guilt or grief or anything like that but she brought up the phrase out of context guilt and atonement the last time she got into it it made her really angry unpredictably angry but nothing about any murder aaron hesitated it wasnt that kind of conversation still sounds like you got to know her pretty well well enough to know shes a seriously messedup lady moses who lem is still beating on i saw a bruise bet you did moe said getting pounded could mess you up i think this was more im no shrink its just an aura she gave off something dark and deep and troubling thats the second time you mentioned that mentioned what not being a shrink said moe seeing the direction this is taking maybe we should talk to someone who is aaron went off to a corner of the droom and called whoever he was sending over to riptide a woman moe figured from the way his brother loosened up and put on the charming smile for an unseen audience seconds later aaron gave the thumbsup they scanned adella villareals photo and sent it to lpvox at a hotmail account moe called dr alex delaware connected to the psychologists answering service is this an emergency sir said the operator not a medical emergency maam im an lapd detective a new one moe stiffened pardon the doctor always gets called by detective sturgis is it that kind of thingmurder yes maam hold on seconds later delaware came on the line without getting into details moe asked if he and aaron could come by to discuss a case not sure what delawares financial arrangement was with the department not knowing what hed say if delaware brought that up im out the door moe court appearance in beverly hills but even if im called to testify i should be free by four so lets aim for a quarter to five my place would be best i need to check in with my dog driving above the converted bridle path that wound above beverly glen finally sighting the crisp white contours of delawares house high up nestled among pines and redwoods and sycamores aaron thought this is the endpoint of the dream beyond cool look at this deadsilent when you needed to meditate on something talk aboutgreenand that sky youd never know its la and only a short drive to westwood village downtown beverly hills the strip anywhere you want to go really guy probably sees hawks all the time wonder if his drive is a ragtop have to be how could you fully enjoy this with metal over your head and this place whoa bigger than it seemed at first glancefull two stories interesting angles obviously custom architecture nice the way they positioned it on the lot not intrusive fits great into the landscape talk about contemporarycool the interiors probably just as fresh and clean maybe bamboo floors vaulted ceilings all that nice natural lighting maybe even a home theater nope its an old seville nice shape though maybe theres a convertible in the garage great landscaping one day moe thought nice house dr alex delaware thought both of them sitting on my couch looking uncomfortable like patients like a married couple barely clinging to civility hed worked with the brothers on the marsh murders had sensed a complicated relationship you didnt need to be a psychologist to figure that out alex had been on the stand for nearly an hour in beverly hills avoiding unsubtle pressure from a predatory divorce lawyer to say something stupid for the record arriving back home twenty minutes before reed and fox showed up hed taken blanche outside for a garden bathroom break refreshed her water gave her the attention she craved robin was out on a woodbuying trip in ojai due back around eight no time to get out of his court clothescharcoal pinstriped suit yellow shirt maroon tiebut hed peeled off his jacket rolled his sleeves to the elbows fortified himself with black coffee by the time the doorbell rang now the little blond french bulldog sat in his lap and smiled at the detectives turning on all that feminine charisma aaron fox smiled back moe reed all business said thanks for meeting with us doc no prob whats up its kind of involved by the time i hear about it it usually is reed did most of the talking and fox seemed okay with that though alex did catch him fighting the urge to interrupt each time the older brother sat back with a resigned look and drummed his fingers on his knees birth order was a potent factor when the summation ended alex said i see what you mean what do you think i can do for you moe reed said first off what can you tell us about mason books mental status delaware shook his head loosened his tie rubbed behind the dogs batears diagnosis at a distance is a losers game guys if youre asking could book be psychotic and not be treated with drugs while hospitalized its theoretically possible but not likely firstline treatment for schizophrenia is medication it works well for many patients but not all if book hasnt responded in the pastor if he still has an addiction problemi can see a careful psychiatrist stepping back and observing any idea who his primary doc was head shakes if you find out let me know aaron fox clicked his blackberry reed said what does that mean stepping back they put him in a hospital bed and just watched him admitted for observation said alex when in doubt do no harm on the vip ward better yet fox said hes definitely still doping doc like i said i found weed and mexican brown at carrillo hes doping said alex or his pal is book and ax dement drove out there together doc you think a dope fiend could just sit by and watch his compadre get high granted its unlikely so lets stick with the drug thing for a moment maybe book was hospitalized for detox for just a week a week would be inadequate but what if he changed his mind before he cleaned up and walked out there was no involuntary hold he wasnt even in the psych ward which tells us something reed said hes crazy hed have to go in the psych ward alex thought generally but celebrity bends rules reed said everywhere those people sleep becomes a fivestar hotel book wants to leave cedars whos going to argue with him alex said are you certain he received no medication the entire stay reed looked at fox fox said were not sure of anything the information comes from a secondary source more like tertiary said his brother fox didnt argue alex said someone told someone who told someone he sat back in his battered leather desk chair the surface of the desk was clear the whole office was pinneat aaron approved he said the source is generally reliable but sure wed prefer photos and a youtube video we making it sound like they were a team but from their body language alex wasnt convinced he ran his hand through dark curls and looked off to the right focusing on a george bellows boxing lithograph good at stimulating his thoughts his eyes were grayaqua clear piercing active almost alarming in their intensity the little bulldog yawned flews fluttering closed her eyes went to sleep sorry i cant be specific guys book could be psychotic phobic drugimpaired clinically depressed choose your diagnosis or he was hospitalized for something nonpsychiatric something physical said reed then why couch it as a suicide attempt fox said exactly or said alex it could be a mixture of the two if the pictures ive seen are accurate hes a really skinny guy the brothers stared at him reed said some kind of eating disorder in books profession its an occupational hazard and not limited to women but still identified with women being tagged anorexic or bulimic could be more damaging to a male actors career than a suicide attempt ignorant folk might consider selfstarvation too feminine for a leading man fox said suicide on the other hand can be thought of as chic unfortunately in some circles there is a certain romanticism attached to it people love the whole notion of a tortured soul especially when it comes to the arts the final act of romeo and juliet doesnt feature two kids wasting away or jamming their fingers down their throats reed said guy gets into some kind of medical situation checks in for nutrition and fluids leaves when hes no longer in danger that would explain no meds it would but im just guessing said alex and im not sure books mental status is all that relevant to your case the whole guilt thing isnt relevant said moe reed checking in one week after caitlin disappears but also several months after adella villareals murder if youre tying the two cases together its hard to see a pattern you dont think theyre connected they might be if both women encountered the same bad guy what i dont see is caitlin being murdered because she babysat for adella too much time lapse between the disappearances fox said weve got a disappeared baby too and no one knows who the father is reed said if mason books the daddy thered be all sorts of motive to get rid of adella as well as the kid it could also explain the time lapse doc what if adella leaned too hard on book and book got ax dement to take care of the problem maybe with the help of his favorite lowlife ramone wwhod probably introduced adella to book in the first place because he was pimping her later when rory stoltz started gofering for book he learned something and blabbed to caitlin she was a straightarrow had known adella babysat for her freaked out threatened to go to the cops so they offed her too whether or not rory was directly involved in it he figured out what happened to his girlfriend but cant say a thing too damn scared the same thing will happen to him that would explain his mother being so protective or said fox rorys also a sociopath and thats why book hired him and he just doesnt care in either case no baby means no paternity test the brothers had edged closer together on the couch seemed more of a unit they both studied alex he concentrated on the lines and empty space that spelled out bellowss ringside exuberance its possible and if you ever do gain access to book and he is impaired he might fold easily but right now hes an unlikely point of entry and guessing about why he was hospitalized isnt useful youve got nothing to tie him to any of your victims and he lives a cosseted life with lem dements son in a house owned by lem dement who you know is connected to ramone w fox said youre saying we should concentrate on ax what you described aaronholding up traffic then peeling out and flipping off the crowdpaints an interesting picture blithe reckless hostile stone sociopath said reed if you can nail him for acts of cruelty ill take that bet and growing up with a father who abuses his mother could sure feed sexual violence believing thats how a real man treats women precisely fox said mom gets pounded but sticks around and likes to talk about guilt and atonement maybe because she raised a really bad boy alex said what was the emotional temperature of that talk what do you mean did she seem remorseful angry or was she mouthing words as if they were scripted fox thought maybe all of the above the sense i got was a really screwedup head reed observed his brother as if expecting more fox shrugged thats it reed said how does the religious aspect fit in doc axs daddy gets bigrich off whats basically a splatter flick camouflaged as a hymn now hes building a church on the family compound before alex could answer he turned to his brother for all we know theyve got a damn cult blossoming there and mason book got sucked into it actors are ripe for that right always into the next big thing fox nodded reed said guys an anorexic addicted zombie with no willhell maybe they were programming him in the hospital and thats why he got admitted or someone else was deprogramming him whatever any way you can find out who his doc was fox smiled going through alternative channels im sure gonna tryforget you heard that to delaware is this session confidential like therapy delaware laughed ill have to study that reed said what about the religious aspect doc moe a wise man once said religions a good thing for good people and a bad thing for bad people meaning anythings possible with this bunch okay so we concentrate on ax not necessarily said alex same as with book theres not enough evidence and daddys dough makes him a big fish rory stoltz is a minnow but that protective mother and theoretical access to book and dements legal resources cools him as an entry point also he may be totally innocent why theoretical big fish eat little fish theyd sacrifice him if it suited their purposes on the other hand you do have someone you could leverage because hes likely to get into trouble and has really poor judgment ramone w said reed a loser with impulsecontrol problems said fox alex said and no gates to hide behind i started watching him said moe reed and petra connor got a rookie in plainclothes to take over when im not there problem is doc what i saw today surprised me bigtime he described the sidewalk encounter with alicia eiger she smacked him upside the head and he just stood there and took it and here i was thinking hes capable of mindless brutality fox said maybe he was too stoned to react still said reed what kind of tough guy lets himself get smacked down in public by a woman that doesnt smell of contract killer alex said ramone got caught peeping his niece but its likely that wasnt the only time hed tried it how old is he thirtyseven interesting voyeurs generally start young and some progress to sexual violence the fact that hes still watching implies a certain passivity reed said what does that say about his ability to get bloody and homicidal maybe nothing said alex wars are planned by generals but carried out by foot soldiers following orders said fox sure why not think manson familythink any whackgrouphell that fits with a bizarro cult thing we need dogs out in carrillo moses reed didnt appear to have heard fine ill keep on wohr anything else doc delaware said sounds like youre doing all the right things fox said and that sounds like therapy chapter liana parlat adjusted the washcloth draped over steve raus right nipple terry cloth was a lot easier on her cheek than steves steelwool chest hair he said you okay mmm she laced her arm over his barrel torso if youre not i could shave it and subject me to stubble liana traced his jawline with a fingertip felt stirring under the bedcovers saw visual proof oh my stephen its been a long time laura i probably forgot stuff i never knew the use of her fake name bothered her for the first time she said fishing for a compliment fine youre a stud that lowered the flag to halfmast oh no she giggled sorry a sensitive one but so sweet hed entered riptide half an hour after shed been sitting at the bar accomplishing nothing because the place was nearly empty and the few rummies in sight were well on their way to stupor the barkeep wasnt the guy shed seen the first time gus the taut woman with some sort of southern accent projected the couldntcareless attitude of a temp had trouble locating lime juice when liana asked how long shed been working there she squinted as if faced with a calculus problem um four days tonights my last dont like it dead no tips she turned her back on liana checked her cell phone let a filmy used beer mug sit on the bar a diet coke and two sips of a gimlet later liana was feeling low she hated serving aaron an empty plate receiving adella villareals photo had put it on a personal level happy beautiful girl baby in a blue blanket that flashed liana back to the october of her senior year in high school backseat oops that led to the bump more family turmoil than if liana had died mom closing up like a scared anemone dad even worse shutting her out completely the entire pregnancy their relationship had never been the same her feeling shed failed him his never saying the opposite made her hate him her brother and sister treated her like a freak especially when she was forced to drop out of school because the rules said girls like her were a serious bad influence morning sickness and depression ravaged her body and her selfesteem at four months and two days into the ordeal cramps seized her and made her feel like a rotary razor was churning up her insides five hours after the pain started she was spewing a bloody mass into a toilet at a truck stop relieved crushed by guilt even though shed done nothing to bring on the miscarriage or had she all those prayers wishes bad thoughts maybe she hadnt eaten right dehydrated herself or the stress her family had put her through had killed what had grown inside of her she got her ged left home found a waitress job three years later at the age of twentyone not really sure why she had her tubes tied adella villareal had produced life only to have it taken from her someone had to pay she was constructing revenge scenarios knuckles white around her gimlet glass when steve entered the bar she pretended not to notice when he looked at her continued the act as he ordered a beer and headed over dressed casually this time dark green polo and khakis nice match for his fair coloring but still wearing clunky brown wingtips that went with a suit the boy needed help big smile he waved like a tourist she looked his way laura he took the adjacent stool spilling significant beer in the process oops smooth oddly she found that endearing hi steve so howve you been fine you just greatworkingis it okay is what okay my sitting here fine with me that sounded cold and he winced impulsively liana served up a nice warm smile sat up straighter and made sure the pink satin blouse stretched over all the right places softbutstrong pink worked great with her black pencil skirt her hair was brushed out and gleaming michal negrin jewelry glinted in all the right places she knew she smelled great steve smelled a little muskylike interested guy probably hadnt renewed his antiperspirant after getting home from work oddly that didnt offend her whatve you been up to dr rau nothing interesting he said but her open face and her wide eyes and the fact that he was a guy led him to embark on a fiveminute discourse on south american economics trajectories as they related to oil futures then another five psychoanalyzing hugo chávez liana faked interest as she thought of the folded color photo inside her purse shed taken pains to fold in a way that didnt cut into adella villareals face or baby gabriel in his blue blanket aaron hadnt volunteered the infants name had been perplexed when shed called him an hour later to ask she said humor me okay lee gabriel little angel by the time steve raus second beer arrivedinadequately filled by snooty ms dixie but he didnt complainhe and liana had been smalltalking for twenty minutes stupid stuff that neither of them cared about he was as nervous as a high school boy on a first date did boys today even get nervous oddly when he made a move at touching her hand then pulled back she made serious eye contact and smiled gave him psychic space for a second attempt instead he said laura is there any possible way youd consider going out with me liana said i would really how about now they walked north on ocean toward ivy at the shore as steve cellphoned the restaurant and asked if a table was available it can get jammed all those movie types he told her while on hold as if shed never been there shed her arm laced through his the boy was built solid sweating though the night was cool yup he said im still hereokay great thanks see you right away they got seated inside at a table next to a noisy party of rich kids a placement liana knew was d list steve hadnt a clue was thrilled to get in they both ordered sapphire martinis and as usual liana nursed the booze so did steve explaining im not a majorleague drinker she ordered the softshell crabs that were always on special he had a steak as they ate they smalltalked some more while liana figured out a way to bring up adella villareal tough because it meant a confession of her own the proper moment never came up they split key lime pie drank decaf steve left a generous tip and they stepped out to a briny night most of the lookieloos hovering around colorado boulevard were gone a few nocturnal cyclists wheeled by on ocean front several of the homeless psychotics santa monica welcomed with open arms prowled the sidewalks steve put his arm around her shoulder as they headed back toward riptide where theyd both parked instinctive protectiveness no weasely attempt to cop a feel for some reason this felt like the senior year shed never had they walked in silence steve had a bounce in his step but not the triumphant stride of a player whod closed the deal just being with her made him happy and she knew she should cut it off return to the bar try to do something for aaron she offered steve a cheek to peck changed her mind at the last minute and aimed her lips at his parted them and gave him some tongue he broke away gasping wow soft eyes you couldnt fake that liana said lets go do something working hard to erase adella villareals face from her head the baby her baby aaron foxs polished almost toohandsome face now there was a player when steve said pardon she said lets hang out a bit more unless youre tired no noum at the risk of being my place isnt that far you could follow me if youre comfortable with that i mean or sure we could find somewhere to hear live music liana said which car is yours he pointed that vw white passat she said ill follow you isnt that far turned out to be a highrise on the south side of the wilshire corridor a few blocks east of westwood las highestend condo row nice crib for a phd working on grant money true steves building was comparatively plain when appraised alongside its neighborssimple beige sparingly landscaped one of the earlier structures starting to show its age but still serious money fullservice with a uniformed doorman out front the guy said evening dr rau hey enrico this is my friend laura maam enrico tipped his hat hurried to open the door maam as they entered a small mirrored lobby liana was wondering if shed stay laura twelve floors to the building the elevator was déclassé gilded mirror and flocked wallpaper kind of an oldperson smell steves onebedroom unit was four stories below the penthouse with a nice view of city lights the furnishings also geriatric fussy quilted floral couches in unfashionable colors with all sorts of buttons pecanwood furniture brown shag carpeting a shade of green on the walls liana hadnt seen since the seventies avocado appliances in a kitchen time warpa time before steves some kind of inheritance even so why not update maybe inertiaor being stingyhad led the exwife to split but no hed tipped thirty percent he said this is it tadah want some water im a little parched myself no thanks another decaf anything im fine he filled himself a glass from the tap oh sorryplease sit make yourself comfortable liana perched on a sofa stuffed as firm as a surfer in a wet suit why am i in this guys place he just happens to show up at the bar okay hes a regular he didnt stalk me but that could be even scarier a regular at a place where two women disappeared and for all i know ive walked right into his aarons voice overtook her own stupid lee not what i pay you for run like hell steve rau rinsed his glass walked toward her stopped a couple of feet away ultrachic décor right its nice and domestic he laughed full disclosure my parents own it five years ago they moved to a retirement community outside las vegas and what started out as housesitting ended up quasipermanent i say quasi because they keep threatening to come back liana said the boomerang generation thats goodi think ill steal it for a paper be my guest anyway im not allowed to change a thing just in case except the booksthey took all their paperbacks and dads medical stuff so at least ive got that he pointed to a case full of drab textbooks econ poli sci business math computer programming humanfactors psychology exactly what youd expect for what he claimed to be and hed used his real namethe doormans greeting was proof of that doctor rau and gus the bartender had confirmed the exwife thing so far on the level unlike someone else we know liana said if my parents left me anything id be thrilled she sashayed to a large singlepane window look at that view i love it but i should still get my own place his voice was low throaty warm against her ear hed moved behind her silently she turned faced him he said oh man you are so incredibly beautiful oh man oddly enough she kissed him he was putty the first time was on one of his parents floral couches scratchy polyester itched liana like crazy but for the ninety seconds the whole thing took she was okay the second time was in his bed a whole lot better in all regards he drifted into rem sleep eyes shifting beneath the lids back and forth like windshield wipers liana extricated herself sat up waited making sure he was out his mouth dropped open he began snoring she slipped into her panties left the bedroom explored his living room frozen dinners in his freezer three bottles of heineken in the fridge along with an old pizza and a single orange growing penicillin the avocado oven looked to be rarely if ever used a microwave sitting on the counter smelled of oregano tomato paste and stale cheese she examined some of his textbooks in many hed printed neat notations does this connect to ecuador corr caus both orthogonal reganalysis worthwhile prob no hedge fund manip of unreg fuel funds relev to shortterm perbarrel saudi pf a small desk in the corner comprised his study in the drawers were bank receipts and credit card bills that confirmed his identity and said he was frugal and doing all right a hundred nine thousand bucks in a money market account he paid his credit card debt in a timely fashion the bottom drawer was filled with notebooks featuring the same academic printing also a letter from his boss a dr hauer praising steves presentation at the world affairs council meeting nothing false nothing kinky nothing remotely evil she headed back to the bedroom steve met her in the doorway wearing a blue bathrobe looking groggy big guy you okay a little restless she said id give you a tour but theres nothing to see i was enjoying the view lets enjoy it some more id better get going his face sagged youre sure she nodded okay i was hoping youd i understand its up to you but dont take that as apathy laura i this was im so glad we met up again cupping her chin he pushed hair away from her face kissed her eyelids she was naked above the waist but his hands didnt explore she rested her head on his chest this time the pelt didnt bother her his heart was racing im glad too steve but i really need to be getting home wheres home liana hesitated he laughed talk about premature interrogation i dont even know your last name now what her silence mustve stretched longer than it felt because steve sighed his shrug was heavy with defeat im sure youve got a good reason to guard your privacy is there any way we could do this again not come here i mean just go outhang out like you said lianas mind raced his face fell backing away into the bedroom he searched the floor for his clothes remembered hed left them in the living room and passed liana and retrieved them whatever youre feeling laura for me it was sorry ill walk you down to your car liana stood there he dressed quickly and awkwardly turning his back as if struck with sudden modesty laura if i said something that bothered you my ex said i was always saying things that upset her claimed i was pushing her buttons but god help me i had no idea and i guess im still clueless liana looked away from him into the bedroom jumbled sheets the smell of sex lingered the washcloth hed fetched to protect her from my steel wool had fallen to the carpet his idea not wanting to bruise her laura hearing the fake name made her feel cheap she said lets sit down chapter delawares recommendation made sense to aaron keep a close eye on raymond wohr use the pimp to leverage up but that put everything in moes lap and left him with nothing to do and when mr dmitri called to ask how things were going he had to fake the russian wasnt fooled telling him if something ever happens tell me maitland is not looking happy click aaron drove to the german retrieved the opel called merry ginzburg for the third time wanting her to press for more on mason books hospitalization still no answer next stop someone whod definitely cooperate manuel lujons father and grandfather were skilled gardeners whod kept up some of the grandest estates in san marino manuels three older brothers had continued the family tradition moving lujon landscaping to the westside where they tended egoscorecard properties in holmby hills and beverly park manuel twentyfive bright with no affection for mulch had gotten a ba in screenwriting from the u that hadnt landed him anywhere near the industry his day job was working in a usedbook store on pico near overland aaron called on him when he needed a certain type of camouflage asking manuel to just be not dothe kid was too honest to be an actor unlike liana who could deceive like a pro she also hadnt returned his call had probably learned nothing during her second trip to riptide his day for being shut out by women he could always call mom that made him laugh out loud but the sound felt contrived like im an actor the next line delivered in moes voice youre not when aaron arrived at once again books manuel was selling a stack of bruised elmore leonards to a stout bearded guy in an aloha shirt whod brought his own plastic covers and took a long time to slip them on after that manuel attended to a kid who paid with crumpled bills and rolls of coins for a robert crumb no other customers aaron drifted forward from the tumbledown plywood stacks manuel placed a bookmark in his own reading material gravitys rainbow by pynchon manuel said amigo whad chaykin ronn por de border how much to borrow one of your brothers

chayote for chump change one of the trucks was working on hillcrest drive in beverly hills and just finishing up for an additional hundred bucks eldest brother albert lujon ordered his men to transfer the keys to manuel and return home on the bus clear family hierarchy thought aaron must be nice he checked his phone the only thing hed received were prerecorded scam texts for cheap phone service and internet hookup when the case was over hed have to switch his cell number yet again when if ever by three pm manuel wearing grubby work clothes nails dirtied by scraping soil was stationed in the perfect watchspot aaron had found after cruising the neighborhood a construction zone half a block north of swallowsong no one working today the project was a sharpedged contempo house months away from landscaping lawn and parkway had turned to weedstrewn meadow when manuel began mowing a woman walking by muttered finally talking to the air not to the man pushing the machine when she was gone manuel phoned aaron i really should be getting thirtyfive why i could develop an allergy to grass to being a nonentity aaron drove around the hollywood hills passing manuels truck time after time liking the ruse hed set up but knowing it had to end by sunset manuel was raking lawn trimmings into neat little piles maybe that deserved thirtyfive at four pm aaron took a break for coffee and a sandwich at mels diner on sunset finding an empty booth flanked by retarded rockstar wannabes whose dialogue consisted of belches and grunts all keyed up for no reason he left most of his food on the table was returning to the opel when his cell beeped moe hey anything on your end aaron said dont have much of an end moses youre not improvising make a suggestion moses silence moe said you learn something tell me right away and hung up does he expect me to learn something if so first compliment his brother had ever tossed his way he headed back into the hills ready for yet another circuit maybe this time hed actually hazard a pass by the house with the fancy gates before he arrived manuel called in got something maybe interesting jaguar xj long wheelbase gunmetal gray lady at the wheel she went up swallowsong and something about her intrigued me so i followed and guess where she went im a natural you need to start thinking about forty an hour you left your post you want to bitch go ahead but it worked out i carried a rake and an airgun up the street just in time to see her drive through those crazy gates no one called la migra okay she definitely went in and she definitely came out total time in there twentyeight minutes nicelooking lady blonde brunette gray said manuel but nicelike she kept it that way on purpose when she came out she looked grim like whatever had gone on during those twentyeight minutes hadnt been fun did you get the plates ill give you a twodollar discount settle for thirtyeight if i get dibs on the dirty details for a screenplay stuff ive been working on doesnt work too much pynchon and delillo not enough story of o the plates said aaron so its a deal excellent got a pen aaron used a payasyougo cell to contact his dmv source kaching mr dmitri the tags matched a oneyearold jaguar registered to arlene frieda solomon fortyone years old brown and green five two one twenty home address on mccarty drive in beverly hills nice neighborhood just south of wilshire pretty well kept twostory houses running three million plus arlene solomon had let her hair go gray since her license renewal two years ago her dmv photo showed a thinfaced bigeyed brunette real seriousalmost mournful dmv hassles could do that to you but still this one seemed downright morose aaron blackberried onto the net arlene frieda solomon evoked over a hundred hits psychiatrist arlene solomon cited the rise in eating disorders among younger and younger children as evidence of pressure by arlene solomon md a beverly hills psychiatrist specializing in anorexiabulimia says a panel of experts at the oak center in beverly hills chaired by dr arlene solomon an expert in he logged off phoned alex delaware the psychologist said ive heard of her but dont know her personally whatve you heard smart well trained knowledgeable she used to run the eating disorders clinic at the u may still be doing that dedicated too said aaron nice office on bedford drive but she makes house calls her type of patients sometimes need that aaron and patients like mason book get all kinds of special privileges hard to say unless we know how she deals with everyone else doctors always protecting each other aaron said your guess was spoton doc now maybe youll give me another delaware said sometimes you get lucky anything else you can tell me several beats nothing comes to mind aaron said well at least we know why book was hospitalized probably what do you mean said aaron an eating disorder doesnt eliminate all sorts of other issues books nutritional status might be okay but he still couldve come in for depression anxiety even suicide rumor based on truth i guess starving yourself could be thought of as slow suicide right delaware said it could and you guys might end up where you started meaning guilt aaron called dr arlene solomons office got a frosty male answering service operator an unfriendly gatekeeper hadnt hurt business the psychiatrist was booked solid not taking new patients calling himself clarence howard one of his fake ids aaron put a couple of strategic catches in his voice and spun a tragic tale of a teenage daughter out of control and veering toward premature demise the operator said its not up to me sir my daughter is really sick and everyone says dr solomons the best ill relay your message to the doctor click aaron sat back in the opels drivers seat watched the sky darken over canyons and peaks the fanciful roofs of distant mansions nailed up in a city with no rules manuel had just driven off in the company truck no one but dr solomon had entered or left the house on swallowsong he was parked atop one of the highest streets in the neighborhood in front of another construction project half the lots up here were in various stages of demolition and rebuilding highpriced dustbowl did anyone in la ever simply enjoy wanting to soak in some quiet hed put his cell on vibrate hed just popped a can of red bull when it began bouncing on the passenger seat merry ginzburg finally long time ms g if you keep calling me darling im going to start feeling popular again busy day meetings she said then meetings about meetings an unnamed local station might want me to highlight industry dirt for their latenews broadcast not exactly carbon beach and bentleys but beggars cant be yadda yadda yadda anyway i may have found out why youknowwho went to youknowwhere its a secure line said aaron okay then my sources source talked to another source who had a source so this could end up as one of those games of telephone but like i said beggars what it comes down to is that mr book no longer eats really said aaron anorexias no longer a girl thing denzel specially in the industryall that pressure to be hollowcheeked but given someone of books status going cachectic were talking bigtime dirt cawhat morbidly malnourished darling its a medical term after i heard about poor mason i spent some time exploring the topic couldnt find any cyberlink between him and nocal dieting but i did enlarge my vocabulary cachectic nice no all sharpedged one of those onomatowhatever anyway poor mason was probably admitted to cedars for intravenous sushi and kobe beef that would explain no meds right maybe cachectic people cant handle chemicals ive started making calls still trying to find out who his doc is once i do ill find a way to worm my way dont said aaron please dont what dont take it any further mer long silence mr fox mr foxyfox why am i feeling you already know all of this and for some godknows reason have allowed me to prattle like a methaddled starlet trying to gain access to spielbergs boottips i havent said aaron lying smoothly its serious info that i appreciate more than you can imagine which is exactly why i need you to keep a lid on book not eating relates to murder i cant say more merryplease dont jump to any conclusions without info my dear merrys naturally creative mind jumps to all kinds of places i understand but at this point poking around further could jeopardize the investigation merry let loose with a throaty guffaw that rang in aarons ear and caused him to move the phone away the same almost masculine laughter hed heard when they slept together postorgasmic glee as if hed just fucked a longshoreman she was good enough technically but that laugh was wrong he said whats funny mer the way you just got all stuffy darling jeopardize the investigation right out of a twobit teleplay but its true nonetheless i need you to be discreet are we planning on solving this little mystery by the sixth commercial break denz cause if not i cant see giving up a succulent morsel of dirt that could be peddled to any number of tabloids for considerably more dough than id earn in months at a shitty little local station let it ride said aaron when the times right ill clue you in bigtime enough dirt for an entire show so you say have i ever failed you mer of course you have darling when youre a man she said you dont need to do anything to fail me you just need to exist but fine ill keep books problems under the radar but not forever thanks mer maybe after this is over we can have dinner no business just fun silence she said you my love are a total bastard aaron lacked the energyand the factsto argue chapter petra said weve got a problem instead of just watching wohr the rookie i put on him busted him last night didnt hold up the paper long enough to keep him in our lockup earlymorning bus took him to county moe said ill call over there i already did they cant find him released by accident doubtful she said im sure youve dealt with the system over there or lack of all that overcrowding guys sitting around takes days to find em im really sorry moe moe had never dealt with county petra wasnt much older than he was but she was a vet he said well work it out what did wohr get busted for soliciting a prostitute underage prostitute so it couldnt be just a citation ramone comes into lockup tagged as a pedo doesnt get segregated you know what could happen oh man i know i know if this screws up your case i couldnt feel worse unfortunately sorry dont pay the bills hey it happens keeping his true feelings inside it wouldnt have happened with west la working the case me and sturgis no logic to that chauvinism no comfort in it either petra said in the rookies defense im not sure a more experienced cop wouldve done different the prostie turned out to be seventeen but ive seen her mug and she looks twelve playing kiddie said moe whered it happen not far from ramones criballey off western near a chicken joint thats a known perv hangout rookie says ramone never went home at all yesterday eiger being such a battleax probably scared him away not so scared he didnt prowl for youngblood or being humiliated made him want to dominate someone she said they ducked into the alley by the time the rookie got there hookers head was youknowwhere meaning an overt act kind of hard to ignore the girls in custody nope she ran off but ramone gave up her id right awayhes a regular but claimed she was legal delena guzman street name delishus salvadoran but so far no link to m or any of the other monster gangs still right now i wouldnt want to be ramone moe said first his niece now this delaware was right about him being chronically twisted delawares in on this one we just consulted him all the psych overtones i figured why not hes a smart guy said petra anything profound he thinks mason book could be anorexic really said petra yeah book is kind of skeletal so what does that mean it could explain book going into the hospital and claiming suicide tragic figure as opposed to pathetic xray shed decoded the psych angle right away ill keep bugging county to locate ramone ive already called one of the sheriff jail captains asked for our boy to get put on high power or the psych ward guy said hed try but their computer systems acting up its all they can do to keep tabs on gangbangers whats the captains name rojas sure go ahead add your name to the petition moe said citizens to keep ramone w safe petra said only for as long as we can use him after that hes chum for the sharks captain rojas was smoothsounding outwardly cooperative more like a politician than a cop moe wondered if he was being shined on he hung up blocked out noise from the droom considered his options at this point not too many no way to get to any of the principals and now even ray wohr was out of reach delawares advice reverbed find a weak point and start wedging ramone w was locked up and unavailable but the woman whod bitchslapped him in public view was free and clear this time he parked close to the apartment building on taft back to his blazer and khakis white shirt and tie not pretending to be anything other than what he was as he marched up to the front door unlocked no security provisions of any sort that fit the urinebitter corridor carpeted in wrinkled gray felt the dirtcolored hallways livened by graffiti the poorly fitted black plywood doors some of them a good inch above the floor souvenirs of oncethicker flooring missing bulbs overhead creating artificial evening the tilting stairway banister looked as if it wouldnt stand up to a nudge one thing you could say for the place quiet maybe all the nightprowlers were catching up on their zs white metal mailboxes just inside the entrance hung askew as if theyd been wrenched in rage dented too definite angermanagement issues eight units on each of two floors half the boxes were unlabeled the others were identified by any number of methods pencil ballpoint plastic tape stickon letters a eiger had been scrawled in what looked like brown eye shadow over the slot labeled meaning she was the one who paid the rent not ramone w her bod gets peddled in cheap motels shes got to freebie the clerk for a discounted rate shes stuck with the bills meanwhile ramone chases youngblood maybe thats what had set her off unit seven was groundfloor rear to the right of an unlocked back door that opened to a fetid alley lined with trash cans and sporting a luxuriant crop of weeds moe stepped out scanned no one lurking around he returned to the hallway rapped alicia eigers door prepared to answer her dopeaddled yeah with police god knew what that would unleash from the denizens of this dump no response mumbled or otherwise he tried again put his ear to the door heard nothing then a low humsome kind of electrical device a sudden tickling sensation in his ear made him jerk away with the same instinctive repugnance that had led him to toss the secondhand hoodie teeming with imaginary vermin this time the bugs were real little black flies circling and swooping letting out whiny buzzing noises lots of flies streaming through the gap between door and carpet moe had seen the same kind of insect hovering at the sparkling glass doors leading to the administrative offices of the county coroner all of mission roads wetwork took place on the other side of a clean pretty miniplaza but that didnt stop blowflies from expressing their enthusiasm anywhere they saw fit one of the little shitheads zoomed up suddenly and buzzed moes chin he slapped it away edged back some more removed his gun from his holster stared at the doorknob milo sturgis always carried a pair of surgical gloves in his jacket moe had resolved to do the same but had failed to follow through no gloves in his car either no reason this was just going to be an interview assuming alicia eiger was home moe bet she was using a corner of his blazer he took hold of the doorknob turned the door swung open easily as if hed been expected some welcome no attempt to conceal just the opposite an ad for dead alicia eiger was splayed on the floor of a rancid kitchenette facedown an oversized tshirt once yellow now tiedyed crimson yanked above her waist chunky legs were parted in unmistakable display no panties no obvious splotches of semen but plenty of body fluids a torrent had issued from the womans deactivated bladder and bowels varicose veins on the backs of her calves add some blue to the red a once feisty woman reduced to this moe worked with death but he really hadnt seen that many intact corpses this corpse made his gut lurch he slowbreathed himself steady took in the scene realized hed left the door to the corridor wide open backed up covered his hand with his sleeve and shut it just me and her keeping safe distance he used his eyes like wideangle cameras no sign of forced entry no disruption at all to the shabby barely furnished apartment tiny place a lav off to the side and the dinky kitchenettefront room combo was the totality of eigersand ray wohrshomesweethome no big puzzle about cod a woodhandled knife was buried in the left side of her back moe counted at least ten more stab wounds ripping the tshirt but all that blood could be concealing others a front view would have to wait until the coroners team arrived oh yeah they couldnt arrive unless someone informed them after he finished with that he reached petra at her desk she said you found him he said my turn to deliver bad news a coroners investigator named maidie johansen said fools rush in kids unfortunately im one of those angels who fears to tread petra said aw cmon maidie make a guess johansen was around sixty a sturdy woman with indoor skin curly gray hair and wide brown eyes behind wirerimmed specs she reminded moe of a fifthgrade teacher whose name he couldnt remember a woman who hadnt liked him despite that hed ground away pulled an aminus both semesters alicia eigers hornrimmed specs had been revealed by the bodyturn frames bent and twisted under her weight but both lenses intact no entry wounds in her chest or abdomen her entire front was unmarked freakishly so when contrasted with the chopping block that had once been her back the knife long enough to pierce vital organs but too short to come out the other end fifteen wounds by maidie johansens count she said one thing i will go out on a limb about this was done with mucho force pointing to the warped blade tagged and bagged what looked to be a kitchen utensil the wood now glazed an unpleasant copper surprisingly eigers knives were a set cheap and whitehandled either the murder weapon was the lone mismatch or someone had come prepared for butchery a killer alicia eiger had been comfortable turning her back on maidie johansen said someone sure didnt like this poor girl sighing at least there are no pockets to go through petra said tod not a clue jeez maidie youve been doing this long enough to educate your guesses johansen drew herself up child you saying im a crone im saying give us a guess off the record the way the bodies are stacked over at your place who knows how long itll be before she gets a prelim let alone autopsied youre one of my favorites detective connor but no dice moe said i saw her yesterday afternoon so that narrows down the time frame then thats my guess no earlier than yesterday afternoon petra said those flies can sniff out a db within seconds said johansen this being interior space might theoretically slow them down but youve got a nearby door to an alley full of crap a gap under the door word goes out in the fly community its lets hurry over and make maggots dont see any maggots on her they take time to hatch petra could be eggs in her nostrils or her ears her anus or vagina or theyre already crawling around inside thats the point it cant be pinned down easily and dont go asking me about algor rigor livor any of that good stuff dr srinivasan just gave us a lecture and guess what all those calcs based on ninetyeight point six being normal body temp are off because the true normal is probably closer to ninetyseven all the old thermometers are basically screwed up and dont go telling me a degree and a half cooling per hours gonna be definitive dr srinivasan gave us a lecture last week saying theres all kinds of new data that can screw up that calc she ticked her fingers body fat ambient room temp humidity seasonal variation of temphumidity how deep in the liver you probe moe said shes not fat the weathers temperate theres no santa ana winds and it hasnt rained in weeks and ill bet youre pretty consistent when you jab the liver flattery is for chumps said johansen she grimaced and stretched that reminded moe of sturgis this thick surly woman could be ann to the loos andy petra said so much for talking for the victim johansen said now its guilt guilts a great motivator maidie moe wondered if petra was thinking about mason book he sure was johansen said so is covering ones butt petra she stared down at the body if you absotively need something for a kickstart id bet on within eight hours give or take try to pin that on me ill plead alzheimers squarely within the time frame raymond wohr had been under surveillance damn petra said how much give how much take johansen shook her head kids today she adjusted her glasses you want quotable quotes my pretties talk to someone who went to med school speaking of which can we take her now chapter the rookies name was jennifer kennedy petra had never mentioned gender why should she kennedy was ruddy and roundfaced not bad looking in a farmgirl way with cornflower eyes and pastacolored hair cut short and peaked on topalmost a fauxhawk three holes in one ear two in the other moe wouldnt be surprised if her uniform hid some tats sitting in a plastic chair in a hollywood interview room she worked hard at not showing anxiety failing the blue eyes gave it away despite the fact that petra and moe were proceeding gently like petra had said before they entered the room no sense adding to the kids stress the kid kennedys stats put her at four years older than moe shed worked as a secretary for a medical insurance company for eight years before entering the academy sixteen months ago those same organizational skills led to precision a carefully logged surveillance of raymond wohr down to the minute no chance wohr had been in his apartment from six pm when kennedy had started watching him until three am when shed busted him the only window of opportunity for him to stab alicia eiger the twohour lapse between the end of moes watch and the start of hers ramone wouldve had time to backtrack to his crib confront eiger about the bitchslap wreak vengeance clean up and reemerge on the street to drink and lurk and troll for an underage hooker ditch bloody clothes but lack of violence in ramones past and the passive way hed tolerated eigers abuse combined with maidie johansens educated timeofdeath guess made moe wonder he said tell us about the bust kennedy said did i screw that up wohrs a bad guy he was having sex with a minor you did the right thing as if moe had failed to comfort her kennedy looked at petra you had no choice jennifer wohr being in lockup is fine well have access to him once we find him okay said kennedy so what happened was obviously i was watching him and mostly it was a lot of nothing drinking walking around finding another bar walking some more moe said did he call anyone he couldve inside one of the bars but not out on the street finally he walked to western there were a bunch of girls working the chicken place at first i wasnt sure if they actually were girls petra said sometimes theyre not the girl he went to said kennedy it was obvious they had a prior relationship or whatever you want to call it from how fast it was there was no discussion they just ducked into the alley by the time i get a look hes with his back against a wall and shes on her knees she looked eleven who knew she was a minor jennifer kennedy frowned seventeen years eight months when i busted him he went down easy no resistance didnt react when i found that weed i logged she ran but i made the decision to concentrate on him she was so young looking i wanted it to end they let kennedy go and stayed in the room moe said solo officer in plainclothes tells him to assume the position he doesnt fight petra said female officer no less she grinned im allowed to say that yeah hes pretty darn passive but even passive guys blow fuses im not feeling it said moe that murder was brutal and someone took the time to pose her sexually maybe to throw us off my instinct too moe your question about calling someoneyou think he set eiger up with someone nasty enough to do it im sure going to find out if hes got a phone account if not well see if theres pay phones in any of those bars petra nodded one good thing about passive we get him in a room he could be workable im looking forward to it he thanked her left hollywood station and drove to west la thinking im developing instincts two hours later he was still at his desk going over caitlin frostigs file for the thousandth time raymond wohr had no account at any phone company tracking pay phones in bars would take hours but he had no choice petra had just called still wrestling with county jail bureaucracy no one in the custodial megalith had a clue as to ramone ws whereabouts for all moe knew the mope had paid for his perv tag already sliced diced stashed behind some jail boiler eiger getting murdered so brutally after her tirade made moe wonder if the motive wasnt revenge but someone shutting her up about something important as in two dead girls and a baby during her rant eiger had seemed to be exhorting ramone trying to goad him to do something giving up and calling him stupid before whomping him upside the head had she known that he was in possession of explosive information got frustrated because he wouldnt exploit the knowledge explosive as in the paternity of baby gabriel something caitlin mightve learned getting close enough to adella to sit for the infant richguy paternity as in mason book if ramone w knew or even suspected that he sure hadnt profited living in that dump pimping eiger to ax dement and the motel clerk too passive to exploit but eiger isnt she nags him he puts her off because hes too dumb or too scared to figure out an angle eiger tired of being a commodity loses patience braces ramone on the street slaps him down now shes dead if there was a link there moe figured it couldve gone two ways option a ramone finally gives in makes a blackmail call flubs and turns eiger into a victim narrowly misses getting killed himself remains in jeopardy option b furious at eiger for humiliating him but a sneak not an action guy ramone makes a call that tags her as dangerous turns eiger into a victim is still in jeopardy oh yeah the third option c none of the above moes hands clenched his jaw hurt hed been grinding his teeth without realizing it damn jail scumbag had to show up eventually moe was pretty sure he could crack the idiot open like a peanut when not if he had to believe in something sitting in the dark above swallowsong lane aaron checked his expense log he knew it by heart but nothing else to do now that his sandwich was gone and hed taken a couple of whizzbreaks in the bushes the glamorous side of private detecting people like mr dmitri didnt have a clue aaron cheered himself with mental calculations of the final bill hed present the russian maybe his last bill to the russian if he had nothing to show liana still hadnt called where the hell was she the chance that she might be in danger plagued him personally and professionally hed never had a better op than liana and a part of himsome part he couldnt really labelfelt deeply about her nothing he could do now so he shoved his worries into a filing cabinet at the back of his head the key was to keep everything compartmentalized where are you lee he assured himself yet again that she was smart hed briefed her fully on this one urged her to be careful it was just after one am during the past five hours six cars had driven up swallowsong three vehicles ferried neighbors home and one of them an old mercedes diesel sedan reemerged thirty minutes later with an elderly man behind the wheel and a woman of matching vintage prattling in the passenger seat tux gown some kind of party everyone in a good mood probably one of those perfect couples together for forty years must be nice at ten thirteen pm rory stoltz chauffeured mason book home in his hyundai stayed with the actor for a mere twelve minutes before speeding down the hill probably not an errand the kid hadnt reappeared shortly after eleven pm ax dement solo in his pickup did his customary run of the stop sign and zoomed up the hill his stay was also brieftwentyfour minutes just long enough to smoke up or sniff or drink and savor the high aaron caught a glimpse of dement juniors squat bearded face as the truck sped away ax didnt look high quite the contrary preoccupied one fifteen convinced mason book wouldnt be receiving any more visitors aaron left the opel and began the silent hike up swallowsong from his easy lope no outward sign of the tensionthe frustration that seized every cell of his body he realized his heart was pounding and he took some time to deepbreathe it slower later looking back hed marvel at his own daring or stupidity depending on how you looked at it right now standing outside the baroque gates of the house mason book rented from lemuel dement noticing how many foothold opportunities the complex ironwork provided tired of being stymied by the layout of the propertythe curving drive and italian cypresses that blocked any view of what lay beyondhe said what the hell whispering out loud feeling his lips move but inaudible above the distant buzz of traffic from the strip leaves rustling in a warm sweet hollywood hills breeze making sure his glock was buttoned down firmly in its nylon holster running a lintremover over his black nylon jacket to remove errant hairs he gloved up looked around breathed in deeply and placed two hands on the upperleft quadrant of the gate nudged a toe into a convenient circle of space afforded by an iron curlicue exhaled and hoisted himself up chapter standing on lem dements private propertya black man in dark clothes and gloves packing a guntriggered a rush of whatifs in aarons head there could be motion detectors a guard dog a herd of guard dogs maybe even a bodyguard or a rentacop or two though in all the time hed watched the house hed never spotted any muscle coming in or out unless ax dement counted for that less threatening employees could be a problem too maids butlers houseboys whatever not spotting any of those meant little if livein help rarely left the premises with a big enough propertyyour own private townthered be no reason to leave especially with a gofer like stoltz as the outside guy black man in the hills nothing aaron hadnt considered before vaulting the gate lord knew hed mulled this move in his head a million times risks hed chosen to disregard because two girls were dead and so was a baby and he was fed up with being hampered by rules and regs and whatnot bullshit by the wetblanket voiceinhishead that passed itself off as common sense he was an uncommon man not some damned civil servant groupthink hed tasted that thin soup for ten years spit it out in favor of a gourmet broth seasoned by personal initiative and free enterprise let moe and people like moe deal with wants warrants orders from downtown coveryourass freezetag hurdle after hurdle imposed by a braindead system aaron hadnt heard from his brother since the meeting with delaware someone else who wasnt returning his calls here we go intrepid masai warrior faces the the abyss he smiled at the selfinflation but there was truth to it two girls were dead a baby for gods sake and hed accomplished zero and mr dmitri demanded results rules and regs were not going to cut it hed quit the damned system because he was tired of being penned up like some pet pony fearless black stallion stands tall among the dray horses snorts and bucks as he races for freedom no guard dog yet not smart detective fox better to be a living fool than a dead cog his lifethe life hed made for himselfwas all about tough choices and living with the consequences the consequences had been sweet three hundred k a year the porsche the private haberdashery the womenhe deserved a vacation once the case was buttoned up once not if black man in the hills maybe moments away from the biggest disaster of his life he remained still for a long time standing to the right side of the curving drive concealed by columnar cypress shadows took a step forward waited some more no stampeding rottweilers no concealed sensors that he could spot those suckers were easy to hide hed installed more than his share of them twenty more steps brought no view of the house just rough winding concrete beneath his feet same for fifty a hundred tree after tree forming opaque greenblack walls the property was vast still no canine growl no alarms no warnings canned or live no padded rentacop footsteps aaron kept going hand on his glock damned drive was what half a mile long italian cypresses said it was probably one of those tuscan villas maybe an eightfigure teardownbuildup lem dement all flush from his biblical splatter flick or maybe what lay up ahead was one of the old original italianate mansions that had studded the hollywood hills during the golden age that aaron had read about he liked that notion kept most of his head focused on the job but allowed a small corner to be decorated by fantasy bigsnouted chromed monstersduesenbergs and packards and rolls phantomstooling up this very drive on a warm night like this one liveried chauffeurs laughing passengers budvases champagne buckets in the trunkthe boot gleaming chariots cruising up silently dropping off the likes of harlow and gable and cooper and hedy lamarr in the porte cochere of a fiftyroom weddingcake mansion the entire place alive with golden light and witty chatter slim stylish people in gowns and evening jackets talking in that clipped selfsatisfied almost english accent highball glasses lofted gracefully by manicured hands a life filled with one cocktail party after anotherin the mansions great hall a grand pianogershwin himself plinking the keys billiards brandy cigars for the men birdchatter giggles and frothy girldrinks for the women everyone loving their life as he trudged ever watchful for threat aaron imagined the mansions interior soaring arched windows offering heartstopping views the city spread in repose a woman of leisure from that to mason book and ax dement in hyundais and pickups buying sex at the eagle motel smoking up and sniffing h in a damned state park guilt and atonement that crazy woman aaron stopped listened just the traffic buzz a little louder now no parties tonight not the type anyone enjoyed he completed another forty yards before the drive finally straightened and the cypresses ended and he was facing a wide unadorned circular driveway of the same ugly concrete no vehicles in sight nothing remotely tuscan nothing remotely golden age the house was onestory freeform a long low knife fashioned of iron girders and glass glassonglass no apparent seams wedgelikea spaceship perched on the edge of a cliff pointy snout extending well over the precipice prepared to launch below oblique steel struts fastening the structure to the cliff miles of light free fall into oblivion staring at it made aaron feel dizzy and he looked away to clear his head not a trace of green anywhere around the house a cold deliberate structure nowhere to hide once he set out across the motor court all that glass lights on in room after transparent room white wide rooms the kind of low black leather furniture aaron liked so cold maybe it was time to reconsider his décor empty then it wasnt mason book wearing a toolarge black robe face gaunt yellow hair wild appeared around a white wall and walkedmore like hobbled toward the front of the houseright into the wedge that hovered above empty space the actor stood there staring straight ahead protected by darkness aaron jogged forward positioned himself ten feet from the house with a side view of the knifepoint he peered under the building just enough backyard for a bright blue infinity pool still no dogs no alarms and all those interior lights put mason book on full displaylike one of those performance art pieces book had no clue someone could be watching lets hear it for false confidence too many years being buffered from reality he stumbled barely caught his balance his robe fell open lousy skinny body the actor sat down with apparent pain continued staring out at what had to be black blank space like a kid ready for takeoff aaron edged closer sad kid weeping chapter moe was driving home talking to liz on his cell when call interruption beeped he said can you hold for a sec honey liz laughed something tells me you wont be dropping by after all if its a lead from your mouth to gods ears he said nah its probably something stupid it wasnt raymond ramone w wohr sat in yellow psychward pajamas in one of the therapy rooms used by the jail shrinks a little nicer than the usual county interview space but not by much moe and petra gave wohr the upholstered chair theyd jammed in a corner pulled up the pair of plastic seats and faced their quarry wohr was one of those longlegged types who shrank when seated a rash had broken out on his bald head the side fringes hung greasy and limp in less than a day jail pallor had set in moe wondered if it was some sort of fear reaction not absence of sunlight or the overhead fluorescence wasnt being kind to ramones seamed sagging blearyeyed gaptoothed addict face the huge mustache was ragged more gray than brown his hands shook a grayblue tat ran up his neck crude blue band fashioned of circles and squares and xs like a tie gone awry it was just after one am and petras tenth call of the evening had finally annoyed the sheriffs jailers sufficiently for them to really dig through their paperwork ramone had been booked nearly twentyfour hours ago shoved right into the general population news of his pedo bust had arrived before him and though wohrs cellmates were nonviolent types a flurry of lessthanveiled threats from a couple of hypermuscular gangbangers in the adjoining cell had caused wohr to whine bitch and moan finally the mope had attracted the attention of a jailer who really didnt want to have to deal with another inhouse deathstomp the problem was where to put wohr high power and the psych ward were full up and the felony charge didnt qualify him for trustee status finally he was stashed in temporary quarters a tiny reading room in a far corner of the jails inmate library where he was tossed a blanket and told to go to sleep the space was vacant because furniture could be used as weaponry jailers doing passbys woke him up every few hours with flashlight glare and foot nudges your basic solitary confinement and ramone w was an emptyeyed wraith by the time a psych bed emptied after an agitated bipolar rapist stroked out the transfer had taken place twelve hours ago but the paperwork lagged anyway weve got him petra told moe meanwhile ive got vice guys looking for delishus where are you turning right around and heading for the freeway after hours of futile traces on bar pay phones he ached for sleep i can be there in twenty ill meet you in front a beat this is your baby im just there for backup he couldnt figure out if shed said that out of good manners or relief raymond wohr said i still dont get why i got busted not even convincing himself moe said no one told you the charges yeah but you molested a minor ramone wohr didnt answer pedo is serious stuff ramone wohr scratched an eyelid you made our job easy said moe put on quite a show for officer kennedy aw man as if he was the aggrieved party moe said aw man what she said she was twenty who did deliwhatever she calls herself too bad she looks ten not to me said wohr its a case of how you see things you wear glasses ramone huh moe repeated the question no to you she looked twenty to everyone else she looks ten shes a minor and you got caught with your dick in her mouth wohrs scratching hand lowered to the crook of his arm old tracks but no fresh punctures along with the bag of weed granules of what was sure to be cocaine had been scraped from a pocket of his jeans along with a payasyougo cell petra had already submitted for analysis moe smiled at wohr wohr sat there not a trace of emotion and so far the mope hadnt even come close to asking for a lawyer that could be a problem with these idiots not enough anxiety moe put forth a lie delishus informs us the two of you have a longstanding relationship real longstanding and that you know darn well how old she is liking the sound of his treachery instinct wohr said aw mansir i didnt mean nothing crazy just tryin to get off basic human need exactly sir we understand human need ramone unfortunately the system doesnt courts are coming down real hard on child molesters i mean were talking some serious time i dint molest no one she got paid your basic business transaction exactly how many other lookliketwentys you generally do business with silence maybe you dont go that far with all of them said moe maybe sometimes youre happy just looking at em one of wohrs droopy eyelids twitched he stopped scratching placed his palms on his lap i guess that could be thought of as good manners ramone just peeping through windows handling your own business no one gets hurt silence plus its free so how come this time you paid wohr closed his eyes and hunched had a bad day ramone nah want something to drink ramone nah sure your lips are looking dry a coke as if snagging the drink was a pipe dream petra was up before moe could ask her during her absence moe scrawled useless notes in his pad ramone reacted by closing his eyes and pretending to doze beneath the guys eyelids though was a buzz of frantic activity like the blowflies celebrating what had once been alicia eiger petra returned with a tall paper cup of something brown wohr gulped all of it pressed the flat of one hand under his rib cage belched and smiled at petra scuse me maam she said hey enjoy while you can putting emphasis on the last word moe figured it was a prompt he said enjoy any little thing youre going away for a real long time aw man i dint do nothing bad moe shrugged wrote some more what can i say ramone petra took the cue and starting checking her cell phone being with two bored detectives made raymond wohr fidget so what youre saying is if i give you something it could help me right i didnt hear us say anything like that ramone youre here just clearing paper pal moe continued to write sir said wohr uhhuh what if i do give you something moes heart thumped he looked up from his notes like what names places sir big deals all around hollywood sir i got a good memory drug deals man ive seen stuff i know who i know what i could clear half your cases moe turned to petra thats pretty generous she said sure is gimme pen and paper said wohr hope you got time because ill write you a book sounds like a bestseller said moe more than we could ever hope for said petra both of them using a mocking tone wohr had instincts something wrong with that moe said whats wrong with that is were not dope cops uhuh no way i cant give you sex stuff said wohr lying effortlessly dont know about that not my thing dont want to rat out other pedos im not ai dont know that stuff sir like you said before its human need i mind my own business sticking mostly to peeping huh head shake im not saying that either i just dont know that stuff so the way you look at it said moe its all victimlessa business transaction who cares how a guy gets off he slapped his forehead oh yeah judges and juries care but guess what i dont and neither does detective connor moe leaned in close fighting to keep his nostrils open after a cloud of wohrs reek blew his way the stink of jail and fear and poor personal habits were not sex cops either ramone wohrs eyes swung wide to the left what are you were murder cops wohrs head snapped up and back as he tried to retreat as far as possible from moe the way theyd tucked his chair into the corner meant he wasnt going anywhere aw man you keep saying that ramone like its some prayer going to get you redeemed wohr lowered his head to his lap clasped both hands behind his own neck no no that i really dont do moe waited wohr looked up hear that detective connor petra slipped her cell into her purse uhuh sorry what mr wohr says he really doesnt do murder ramone said nope mansirmaam someone told you that theyre lying who would tell us that eyedance no one why would anyone tell us that ramone no reasonthey wouldnt they meaning no one wohr folded scrawny arms across his chest moe turned to petra remember what they taught us about guys who like little girls its all about power and control and we know the same thing goes for murder especially sicko murder back to wohr no bigger powertrip than being in charge when the lights go out ramones hands shot out palmsforward no way no no no moe sighed petras knowing smile was perfect you believe this guy ramone w scratched his head then his arms rocked a bit aw man gimme paper and a pen ill write you a book on dopeyou can trade it to the dope cops you give em something they give you something everyone walks away happy petra said youve got an interesting view of police work heymaam everything gets traded guess thats true said moe including human life when wohr didnt answer he went on everythings got a price everyone some lives are expensive some lives are cheap cheap lives get traded away easy so expensive lives can continue experienced individual such as yourself knows which is which aw man i dont know nothing about that you want that theres all sorts of guys right here who can tell you good stuff just walk over to general pop and say tell me about that not me sir no way no long speech it took wohrs breath away and he sat back trying to regain wind moe said expensive lives cheap lives a beat guess adella villareals life was pretty cheap wohr sat there not moving not blinking none of the eyecalisthenics moe had expected could i be that wrong that names not familiar to you ramone wohr let out a long raspy sigh now his eyes were bobbling like floats on a trout line scratching hard enough to raise welts on his arms he forced the eyes still but the resulting starescared frozenwas the biggest giveaway of all yes moe said adella and gabriel tiny little baby a tiny life means supercheap in your world wohr buried his face in his hands rocked some more cheap lives said moe we know a lot wohrs fingers spread revealing runny eyes that was not me sir that what happened what happened like were talking about a something not a someone a what not a who this is a mommy and a baby were discussing ramone human beings they got murdered and we know who did it and we know youre involved wohrs eyes rounded and for a bizarre instant terror made the old dope fiend look young almost childlikestill vulnerable to surprise a second later the old wearinesswariness returned and the guy was squintingfirst at moe then petra figuring the odds moe said you can help yourself ramone how much can i help myself what do you mean sly smile business transaction whats the deal im not going to lie to you friend cause that would be wasting everyones time and youve been around long enough to know reality anything official is up to the da but were murder cops the da listens to us misdemeanor said wohr no jail time on what delishus meaning he wasnt worried about his involvement in murder or was the mope that clever moe said detective connor petra said theoretically if two murders get cleared i cant see any problem with that moe said clearing three murders would be even better no doubt said petra three said ramone confusion clouded the mopes face uhoh moe made the plunge caitlin frostig who not a hint of evasiveness in the squinty eyes real confusion caitlin frostig said moe adellas babysitter pretty blond girl wohr said oh her you know her i seen her once maybe twice she also got killed is that a real question ramone yes sir yes yes yes siri met her once coming to pick up addie like you said addies going out that girls there with the baby one two times is allyeah it was two thats it sir she got dead i dont know about it but you do know about a dead mommy and a dead baby said moe remembering the reverend wohrs account of his brothers cold attitude toward the infant little tiny baby with a name gabriel like the angel now he is a little angel ramone wohr didnt respond dead baby dead mommy dead babysitter ramone quite a scoreboard for a guy who doesnt know about stuff like that wohrs bony butt levitated out of the chair and for a second moe thought hed need to restrain the idiot but wohr sank down heavily hugged himself shook his head tugged at his cheeks youre in it for triple murder ramone oh jesus god maybe youre not that bad of a person said moe maybe it really bothers you aw manyou shouldin here slapping his forehead bad pictures sir even though i never actually seen nothing pictures of what you know tell me ramone dead people i worked hard at turning them off the pictures trying to switch the channel yeah yeah did getting paid to forget help ramone huh one of your transactions said moe keep your mouth shut for the opportunity to keep pimping to rich folk stolid silence but no denial moe went on you mightve cleared your own head but the law doesnt see it that way ramone youre in the middle of it it wont be any big stretch making this a threestrikes deal ramone but even without that were talking to petra like forever she said id guess forever plus a hundred years or so she edged closer to wohr poor little gabriel talk about a tiny skeleton like a toy at first you dont even think its real you found him wohr blurted any reason we shouldnt no no no i just moe hardened his voice crowded wohr got closer to petra in the process her girlscent helped take the edge off wohrs stench you just what ramone i never heard he got found but you heard he got killed silence heres the deal ramone some people dont like surprises but we do helps relieve the boredom weve got all sorts of surprises about things you cant even imagine wohrs eyes passed from moe to petra back to moe the guys body was slumped and shaky and pathetic but the eyes belonged to a stronger shrewder man all the dope hed pumped all the booze hed soaked up his iq could be down to double digits and hed still retain a certain type of cunning he said you know what you know but i dont know nothing moe sensed it the danger point any minute the mope could clam ask for a lawyer time to take another plunge well then ramone well shareso everyone will know everything you got paid off to keep quiet about the murders but it was only a smalltime payment you never cashed in like you couldve wohrs eyes froze but he couldnt plug up the sweat glands slicking his face and neck petras perfume no longer masking the stink wohrs mustache trembled moe said maybe you didnt cash in because you were scared maybe youre basically a smalltime guy happy with smalltime compensationhappy to keep peddling skin to rich folk maybe making nice to rich folk lets you pretend your own life is expensive not cheap like adella and gabriel and caitlin wohr shook his head thing is ramone that flesh you kept peddling was alicias and she had enough wanted you to cash in big she was tired of partying in shitty motels like the eagle because you were too scared to make demands she got frustrated downright pissedoff frustrated to the point where she bitchslapped you on the street front of the whole neighborhood no one saw nothing wohr snapped moe smiled you think realizing his error wohr shook his head hard enough to fling sweat droplets landed on moes khakis petras black pants too neither cop moved to wipe it off wohr said what im sayin alicia wouldnt do that she never hit me then how do you think we know about it ramone i was there letting that sink in describing eigers and wohrs clothes made wohr shake like hed detoxed too fast moe said she called you stupid disrespected you then hauled off and bitchslapped you moe rattled off the address on taft i saw it ramone not a love pat a real hard smack you could hear it up the block and what do you do you just slink off like some beatdown dog go get juiced up at bobs then you buy some dope from another mope over near cherokee then you wander around hollywood all day and into the night walking and drinking and smoking like some useless abused mutt and then because you still cant get rid of the anger at being disrespected but you cant stand up to alicia you go looking for someone you can control because delishus looks ten and reminds you of all those little girls you peep when they dont know youre lurking outside their bedroom windows i dont do that your niece sarah says you do ramones mouth dropped open moe smiled its your day for surprises my friend just like you were surprised to find officer kennedy right there when delishuss head was where it shouldnt aw no moan of despair not denial placing both hands on wohrs shoulders moe exerted pressure we know everything and you still dont have the smarts to stop playing with us in order to better your situation wohr lowered his chin to his chest sniffled moe gave an eyesignal to petra she said i for one am feeling sorry for you ramone because youre not a violent person but who im really feeling sorry for is alicia poor girl was getting smart all she wanted to do was stop selling her body how long has she been on you to make some serious dough from those murdering bastards head shake how long ramone she said gently probably right from the beginning right because alicia saw an easy big payoffi mean were talking multiple murder rich folk kind of a nobrainer too scary muttered wohr to pressure the rich folk nod unfortunately alicia didnt see it that way said petra maybe because you were still selling her to the people who did those murders alicia doesnt get it said wohr present tense dictated the next move moe released wohrs shoulders from his grip drew two polaroids out of a blazer pocket alicia eigers multistabbed back and a fullfrontal closeup of her gray lifeless face ramone alicia is never going to get anything anymore wohr stared began shaking violently oh jesus god lurching forward he retched both detectives scooted back nothing but stink emerged from his gaping mouth oh jesus oh jesus god jesus feeling masterfully cruelenjoying the feelingmoe said oh yeah four murders add a dead girlfriend to the scorecard and you set her up wohrs legs shot back hit the legs of his chair no way no no no moe and petra moved back in inches away totally in the mopes face moe held the polaroids in one hand used the other to take hold of wohrs jaw and rotate wohr back toward the images expecting wohr to shut his eyes but wohr punished himself and looked some capacity for guilt moe said hitting her back wouldnt have been nice but it sure wouldve beat making that call ramone wohr murmured unintelligibly moe released the pressure on the guys jaws wohr rubbed his mandible you didnt have to hurt me you dont need me to get hurt ramone youre hurting yourself just fine maybe like detective connor said youre not a bad person but you sure are a weak person always taking the easy way out but funny thing that always seems to put you in a hard place doesnt it slow nod weve got your throwaway cell ramone we know about the call you made to set up alicia hoping hoping hoping wohr licked his lips blinked hard victory thats accessory to murder one ramone now were giving you the chance to help yourself friend but youve just got to stop lyingto yourself we already know the truth wohr groaned knuckled an eye maybe you never intended to get alicia killed maybe you just thought theyd scare her but thats not how a jurys going to think she hit me said wohr again i got tired of it there you go said petra mitigating circumstances more like motive and evidence of premeditation if we had a history of domestic violence calls to your crib that might help you without that whos going to believe a big strong man was afraid of a small woman wohr said you dont know alicia shes fierce was fierce said moe waving the polaroids even if we believe you who cares were not who youre going to have to convince wohr didnt answer moe checked his watch stood and did a milo stretch in addition to looking relaxed it felt good after all those hours sitting petra got up too moes yawn was genuine he pocketed the photos we gave you a chance to better your situation and once again you made the wrong choice hope you enjoy incarceration ramone because thats all youve got ahead of you petra opened the door called for a jailer raymond wohr said gimme a pen and paper ill write you a different book when the detectives agreed the fool started crying chapter dr steve rau said a private eye i work for a private eye steve im an actress by training obviously a good one more stunned than angry but no one liked being lied to his wife had made a fool of him liana had no way of knowing if this was turning into bad déjà vu shed positioned herself close to the door just in case after the night theyd spent together kind of a cartafterthehorses thing steve said liana as if trying on her real name for size so that first time was an assignment my boss and i are looking into caitlin frostig that girl who disappeared making

seen her at riptide several times never at the bar always in a corner table back in the vip area years ago when the celebs were stillthis is that kind of case could be said liana she had a baby i

hold of his face and kissed him hard whatd i do to deserve that delivered good news sweetie smooch the messenger maybe i will stay the night but first i need to text my boss chapter if mason book had chosen to press his face against a cold glass pane of the house he mightve caught a glimpse of aaron fox watching him the actor sat in a square black leather chair robe flapped open on an emaciated body sobbing guy looked way older than on screen not just because of no makeup and heartless lighting his cheekbones jutted in a way that couldnt be healthy vertical creases scored his face hair well overdue for a colorrinse was showing some gray among the blond thirtythree and starting to look like a withered old man career transition friend time to move on to character roles as a matter of fact ive got a screenplay for you but youre not going to dig the ending aaron tried to figure a way to gain entry without setting off something he couldnt control hed come with a host of little helpers each in a designated pocket of his black waterproof swiss cargo pants flashless pen camera his cell phone for photo backup mini infrared binoculars similarly undersized tape recorder outfitted with one of mr dmitris speakers plastic wrist ties in the event it came to that ditto the filipino fighting knife one of the pockets twitched his cell phone vibing could he chance taking it out and allowing the screen to create illumination as spaced out as book appeared too risky plus whoever was calling it couldnt be more important than what was happening right now he no longer needed to hear about things time to make things happen reminding himself to maintain a strict dual focusobserve book while looking out for the return of ax dement or any unwelcome visitorhe sidled along the glass there were seams but so tight that even this close they were tough to make out the entire house was constructed of huge glass panels some of them had to be doors but which ones he hazarded another few feet closer to the hovering nose of the house hearing one of his rubber soles let off a tiny rubbery squeak and stopping short mason book sat there now aaron was close enough to see blotches and zits marring the actors once boyish face books nose was a sharp bony protuberance matched the angle of the houses snout as if the actor was a toyan action figuremanufactured to fit the structure book sat there continued to suffer stardom indeed suddenly he was up standing shaking robe wide open turning and facing the exact spot where aaron crouched hair shooting all over the place eyes glazed all skin and ribs like a turkey carcass looking straight at aaron but not seeing him the actor belted his robe headed for the rear of the house passed through room after room the structure was a voyeurs dream ramone w would love it maybe ramone had been here who knew what kind of ugly went on here book stopped in a cold bright kitchen black cabinets limestone floors two wolf ranges two fridges both traulsens one steelfronted one a glass seethrough when remodeling aaron had priced the brand opted to supercharge his porsche and buy five antonelli suits instead book stood in front of the steel fridge did nothing for a long time finally opened the door on his second try straining both nomuscle arms breathing hard aaron could see the rapid rise and fall of his robe something wrong with his heart due to all the starvation book took something out of the fridge soda canno same size but the cover was white lots of small print larger red letters book held the can straight out in front as if it were dangerous carrying it that way he trudged back to the front of the house sank into the same square chair almost tripping over his own feet in the process nearly losing hold of the can panting openmouthed he held the can to his cheek stretched his arms out again and studied the white cylinder offering aaron a closer view of the red lettering aaron whipped out the minibinocs isocal intensive balanced protein nutritional supplement books prescription snack probably brought by that housecalling anorexia doctor the actor put the can on the floor cried some more all weepy because he couldnt bring himself to take in calories aaron was in no mood to be understanding rich mans pathology no eating disorders in the sudan book retrieved the can labored to pop the top finally succeeded bent his elbow and brought the can closer to his lips stopped stood upended the can and poured thick white liquid onto the floor standing there until the can was empty he placed it gingerly in the middle of the mess hed created slipping out of his robe he strode naked with sudden purpose toward the glass wall where aaron was stationed straight at aaron aaron hustled backward was ten feet away when book used both hands to push at the glass the wall swung open mason book stepped out into the night skeletal goosebumped bleachedout hair feathery in the breeze off in some other galaxy the actor made his way toward the structures proboscis his progress was painfully slow his body recalcitrant finally he got to the snout slipped under it aaron moved in closer book continued toward the cliffedge the actors eyes widened as they filled with the heat and light and color of the city book pressed his hands together rocked on his heels shrunken genitals dangled the guys limbs were sticks his back flecked by scatters of rosy rash book kept his hands pressed together rocked some more some sort of prayer ritual book bent his knees moved forward so his feet curled over the cliffedge spread his arms wide oh shit aaron became a bullet screaming bullet hoping his voice would freeze the idiot just the opposite book turned saw aaron smiled bent his legs again and took off in flight chapter skin and bones helped but even a flimsy hundredtwentypound sack of dehydrated sinew could wrench your arms out of their sockets when you were flat on your belly in the dirt all scuffed up and scraped from the slide fighting to hold on gripping the damned thing by its ankles as it dangled toward oblivion and gravity kept kicking your ass book wasnt resisting but he wasnt helping either idiot just hung there silent limp deadweight a weird kind of patiencelike he was just waiting for aaron to let go of his ankles so he could do his thing not so easy you sick pathetic murderous bastard having another set of hands on board wouldve fixed the situation in seconds moes powerlifter guns aaron said hang in there buddy book giggled s funny hang in there said book in that easily recognizable reedy but charming voice im hanging every syllable caused the idiots body to jerk each twitch ratcheted up the agony in aarons shoulders the searing strain in his abdomen back and hips thank god the fool was a selfstarver aaron felt his grip loosen braced his toes in the dirt pulled up again on book again book slid up toward him only to slip back as aarons muscles failed to stand up to the increased pressure this time the downward jolt nearly caused him to lose his hold the pain in his shoulders was unbearable sucking in breath concentrating focusing thinking of dead people a dead baby how this asshole wasnt going to weasel out so easily he said press your hands against the side of the mountain buddy so that youre not just hanging there loose its not a mountain said book its a hill whatever book giggled again like this was just another role asshole do itbrace yourself why i gritting his teeth said so book didnt respond do it aarons jaws clenched tighter his hands felt ready to detach from his wrists a few more seconds of this and do it okay okay whining like the spoiled brat he was both hands press hard book obeyed aarons relief was immediate sucking in oxygen he bore down inhaled again and prayed and released his left hand and shimmied it up books scrawny calf getting a grip on bone and not much more he dug his fingernails into books flesh it had to hurt book didnt even murmur aaron let go of his right hand dug that into books other calf im going to count to three on three push back hard huh like youre trying to flip yourself up wh aaron concentrated on reserving breath delivered his rapid speech do it or ill tell everyone about the baby and the world will find out you were no noble suicide silence do it no answer baby gabriel people magazine us the enquirer okay okay said book with a catch in his throat on three you push back shutting out the pain as he marshaled his strength aaron felt his own legs flutter muscle strain no the damned cell was vibing again youve reached fox investigations mr fox is currently out of the office and quite possibly about to screw up royally ready mason you know my name imbecile of course i do ready yes sir on three push hard yes sir here goes action camera one two three books push was wimpy and aarons grip on the legs slipped but he managed to pull book up high enough to claw under the idiots rib cage continued yanking mindlessly gropingtugging the guy upward books body flopped like that of a foughtout fish aaron got hold of books long wild hair yanked violently he dragged the bastard well clear of the cliff dropped him harder than necessary flat on his back fought for breath mason book wearing a beard of grit and blood looked up at aaron with what seemed like wonderment aaron stood over him gasping feeling his heart in his throat about to rip loose and fly out of his mouth like some bloody bird his clothes were torn his body felt as if it had done a fullday shift in a cement mixer blood all over his palms knees cheeks elbows maybe mixed with books he hoped the bastard wasnt infected with anything book smiled i know you that so black angel chapter when lianas third text to aaron went unanswered she was comfortable switching her cell off and retiring to bed with steve if mr fox is free to party im off shift the chesthair washcloth was back in place she was wearing one of steves tshirts he was in pj bottoms and both of them were trying to sleep the towel bounced as steve made a huhhuh sound that rumbled through torso and terry cloth are you laughing young man uhuh whats funny imagining what not important hey big guy its all about communication its kind of juvenile always happy to get in touch with my inner child she nudged his ribs okay okay now he sounded fully awake i was thinking about detective work one thing im not bad at is research give me a topic i burrow like a mole i was imagining you and melike nick and nora charles some fantasy huh my aspirations sir are more along the line of this thing we have going whatever it is lasting long enough for me to find out if youre really as sweet and kind and understanding as you seem to be if you are i can do some expert patchwork on your selfesteem which is really the only thing missing from the pictureand who knows maybe you wouldnt be as nice if you got too puffed up so id need to be careful about not

me honey i could get them to like me show them im the perfect girl for their boy look how much you smile nowadays as opposed to when that grasping bitch was on the scene my fantasy steveo involves you

live including that lots ofthat between rand and my voiceovers wed do just fine in the money department id sell my condo add to the kitty im talking a full loving partnership not some keptwoman situation and your parents would like me so much theyd kick in some dough for the steve whispered you asleep liana she said youre right thats some fantasy chapter raymond wohrs signed statement was less than moe had hoped for but still enough to justify waking up deputy da john nguyen nguyen had worked on the marsh murders had raised all sorts of cautious lawyer objections during that investigation this time he said i like it moe said we need wohr out of county and back to hollywood lockup sooner the better ill get that started moe reentered the interview room gave petra the thumbsup she smiled ramone w was drinking coffee and eating his third donut powdered sugar bearding his grizzled face he said what the detectives ignored the question and took him through the statement a second time no change in demeanor or narrative as he continued to deny any direct role in the murder of adella villareal or her baby but he did admit setting up what he continued to insist was just another sexual transaction phoning adella on short notice and telling her hed lined up a monster gig whole different class of john the guy wanted her now shed been wary how come i showed him your picture a lie but so what this could work in her favor how was he to know it wouldnt another relationship begun at riptide adella had lucked into riptide after he ramone had taken her and alicia there for drinks to celebrate adellas birthday no one noticing alicia but adella all dolled up that tiny black dress a whole different story the night of the transaction he said client likes your picture you showed him my picture she said like some ad on craigslist whats the diff monster client addie right the last monster you set me up with was that fourhundredpound slob who cried when i asked him for an extra hundred forget hundred addie this is three thousand big ones no answer you still there addie three thousand she said at least assholes good for a whole lot more trust me three

the baby addie had the baby when she went in i wasnt there and neither was alicia nope so bringing the baby was the clients idea the plan was for alicia to be in the hall but she had to go to the bathroom so she missed meeting addie sure said moe that happened long silence petra said there were two plans the one you told her and the one you carried out i wasnt even there and neither was alicia alicia never even came along silence moe said that whole bullshit about alicia was to get the baby there no answer maybe adella even said shed call a babysitter and you said dont bother well handle it uhuh said wohr that never came up maybe adella said shed call caitlin frostig nope dont know her you met her twice thats not knowing caitlin had nothing to do with this i dont know her i made a call thats it and drove to the hyatt no ramone blurted i never went thats a new twist its true moe resisted the urge to throttle the guy dont insult us ramone we see lips flapping but we dont hear the truth and the truths the only thing going to set you free i told you the truth you told us a story the truth is the baby the whole point was the baby otherwise you wouldnt have told adella to bring the baby wohr looked at the floor petra said sending a baby to a gig thats one sick deal aw man moe raised his voice tell us about the baby i dont know nothing about no baby not any baby ramone baby gabriel adellas baby gabriel the cute little baby you had adella take to the hyatt waving the signed statement by your own admission ramone wohr hugged himself slouched lower i made a call thats it moe placed a thumb on wohrs collarbone found a pressure point pushed wohr whimpered moe said the point was adella bringing the baby i guess you guess i did what i was told for a thousand bucks silence moe said you didnt wonder why someone would slip you a grand just to make a call addie worked for me we know you bragged about thatrepresenting her you were mr hollywood but its not like she was in your stable because you dont have a stable ramone i got her other gigs rock guys like at the whiskey great said petra youre a heavy pimp doesnt that come with responsibility you make a call never see her again youre not trying to find out what happened i figured she went back said wohr back where arizona said wohr to see her family she did that before didnt tell me or nothing you set her up on a highpriced date make sure she brings the baby said petra then she drops out of sight youre not the least bit curious all i did was make a call thousanddollar call said moe go to the hyatt on the strip heres the room number youre free and clear she gets her pretty self murdered and dumped in griffith park and you dont know about it silence you expect us to believe you thought she made a family visit meanwhile everyone knows she got killed and no ones seen the baby moe pushed down a bit more wohr whimpered youre good at making calls ramone youre a frickin phonecall specialist huh we got the trace an hour ago ramone no longer needing to lie ratting out alicia because she was making noise getting on your case for not cashing in on the first call wohr hung his head after how she disrespected you cant say i blame you said moe petra said me neither i did that to my man i cant even imagine wohrs face tilted up petra said my man and me no one raises a hand to anyone moe said doing it right on the street and its not like you hit her back you stayed cool i respect thatdetective connor respects that petra said thats a whole lot of patience you walked away said moe that was manly then you made one of your famous calls whats the harm in thattheres facts you state them to someone how they handle it isnt your business problem is they handled it by carving her up ramone im talking taco meat you want to see those pictures again no wohrs hands wrapped around the back of his head he bent low aw man horrible scene said moe even for detectives like us who see murder all the time but thats not your business you just made a call how they chose to handle it was their decision and thatll help you ramone thats bound to help you people understanding the difference between making a call and doing a fifteenwound knifemurder i didnt know didnt know what nothing what would happen after you made the call yeah you make calls thats what you do said petra youre the phone man king of the phone lines wohr kept his face hidden she reached into her pocket drew out her own phone and moe waited for some dramatic flourish instead she read a text message mouthed johns here moe sat back down positioned his knees an inch from wohrs tolerated the stench of the guys breath the sour despair emanating from wohrs pores notice ramone that were telling you about alicia not asking cause we dont need you wohr looked up again yeah he said yeah what she hit me i called touching his cheek she hadda know that wasnt gonna work out good man said moe being straight is whats going to help you now pick up that pencil and give us all the details you left out the first time wohr complied when he was through moe pulled him to his feet and cuffed him recited the charges read him his rights wohr said murder for using the phone moe and petra walked him to the door deputy da john nguyen was outside talking to a jailer holding papers he looked at wohr this is him as if disappointed petra said this heres the emperor of the phone laughing moe thought she looked really pretty fresh and confident and calm not a wrinkle in her pantsuit his own head was filled with bad music a little bit of melody but too many missing notes chapter aaron was the shepherd mason book the sheep the actor stood naked and skeletal in the front room of the rocketship house as aaron dressed him in the discarded robe docile as a pet spills from the protein drink book had dumped left creamy clotted stains on the black chair and the smooth stone floors aaron was careful not to step in the stuff as he steered book to a nearby sofa then realized that position offered a great citylights view suicide view no sense reminding him of what hed missed taking book by the elbow he guided the actor into an adjoining space smaller set up with red suede chairs a black desk with a gray tweed swivel seat and blacklacquered bookcases mostly empty but for a handful of dvds on one shelf recent movies all crap probably freebies from the studios or the academy none of books films on display he put the actor in the swivel seat aimed it at a red wall slipped a hand into a pocket of his cargo pants and activated the minirecorder nice and silent it always paid to have good gear tell me what happened mason when the night adella villareal got murdered book licked his lips i didnt see that so much for the power of guilt here we go with the mindgames tell me what you did see mason smiling reassuringly at the actor as he tried to forget the pain that continued to course through his body fingers of fatigue scratching through the adrenaline rush telling himself this would work out had to work out book was a whack could be opened hopefully no one would show up at the wrong moment book sat there aarons hand glided over his nylon holster mason its time to be true to yourself book said i saw everything but not that not what killing her so you know she was killed books cadaverous face tilted up pale hair swooshed as book spread his arms in a whome gesture appealing boyish despite the selfinflicted ravages with enough makeup the right camera angle the guy might be able to pull off one of his charming roles im your angel mason you need to tell me everything book sniffled let loose more eyewater selfpitying bastard aaron felt like smacking him book turned away and dryheaved the actors rib cage expanded like bellows as cloudy amber liquid dribbled out of his mouth flowed over his chin plinked the floor meltdown on its way damn where is delaware when you need him aaron said tell me what you know mason youll feel a lot better book retched again breathed loud and raspy lost control and got sucked into a coughing fit aaron slapped his back until the paroxysm stopped book took to comfort like a wounded puppy pressing his head against aarons thigh grasping aarons sleeve with a filthynailed hand was he like that aaron patted books hand book pressed closer youre here for me of course i am mason but i need to know everything he peeled books hand from his arm pulled up a red chair and faced the actor scooting forward until his knees were an inch from the actors bony bumps memories of drab departmental interview rooms this place was pretty but no less oppressive go ahead mason he said it was just a meeting with her he being a friend i didnt even know her whats this friends name mason his real names ahab but everyone calls him ax ax yeahyou know him jackpot aaron could almost feel the recorder whirring in glee we angels know all sorts of things hes not famous said book he wants to be but hes not one of those said aaron bet you know a lot of them oh yeah said book i thought hed protect me hes fatstrong eats what he wants lucky him so ax said he was meeting with adella he said a girl from that place what place this place we used to go to a club more like a bar said book a bar where you and ax went to drink and hang out books eyes fixed on aaron you look like denzel people say that denzel could play an angel said book hes a really talented guy yes he is said aaron this place where you and ax went it has a name riptide adella hung out there too i dont know her name said book i never was with her there ax was i never saw that but he told you yeah the night it happened mason what kind of meeting did ax say it was you know i dont unless you tell me mason to party all of us aaron said you and ax were going to do a threesome with adella i didnt know her name he said a real piece of ass he knew from riptide she was wild perfect for a threesome it never happened said book as if he still regretted that what did happen mason we went to a hotel which one the hyatt which hyatt said aaron certain he knew the answer book said sunset fiveminute drive from swallowsong next to the comedy store yeah the party was at the hotel when we got there ax said no lets do it different out in the open outdoor party sounded good to me said book ax went in and came out with her book shivered you know about the baby right aarons heart pinged with joy he kept his face grave like i said mason i know all kinds of things so adella came out of the hotel with ax and the baby nod where were you in the truck where was the truck parking lot of the hotel ax wasnt afraid of leaving someone famous like you in a truck in a hotel parking lot he told me to lay down in the back we do that when when we dont want me to be seen and you just obeyed because youre a braindamaged fool book said it was all wrapped up blue blanket guess it was a boy she goes to a party with a baby pretty weird book agreed she got in the back of the truck i sat up and she was real happy why because she saw it was me no brag just stating the facts you were the reason she was there yup she thought she was hooking up for a date with just you ax likes that said book i meet girls he meets girls girls ax couldnt meet on his own book smiled hes a little fat so he uses you as a lure yup he did that with adella book said because he wanted to kill her aarons airway constricted he forced himself to breathe easy he told you that i figured it out when she didnt come out i thought she did come out of the hotel she came out of there said book but not the park the park said aaron lets back up for a minute mason you picked up adella at the hyatt where you thought the date was going to be but ax wanted to party outdoors so you drove to a park yup killed where she was dumped moe had said no griffith park not that park said book one near the beach she said it was too far i paid her some money and she was okay even with the baby in front and crying a little the baby was in front of the truck in a baby seat said book ax brought a baby seat he told her dont worry we got a baby seat said he was a daddy himself he had other stuff too like what diapers bottles did you find that weird book blinked i guess i wasnt thinking about babies is ax a daddy no said book he murdered her so i guess lying was no big deal first time the idiot had expressed anything resembling insight maybe his head was clearing aaron preferred him zoned out and blabbing decided to keep the questions minimally threatening i think ive got the scene mason you and adella are in the backseat of the truck the babys in front in a baby seat everyones chilled out not her said book she was a little like nervous i gave her more money how much i dont know maybe five thousand five thousand dollars maybe two three six i dont know it was a bunch of hundreds i get them in stacks for allowance you get cash delivered by myron said book hes my business manager sometimes ax goes to the atm ax has your pin number i dont like to go places okay said aaron back to that night which park at what beach knowing the answer way out said book past where his dad lives his dads got a big place somewhere youve been to his dads place nope its on the land side i like the beach side this wayout beach leo carrillo said book he was an actor who was leo carrillo that so yup a trace of smugness had oozed into the actors voice guy was a shriveled wreck but he could still oneup an outsider he played mexicans in cowboy movies they named a beach after him aaron said i know carrillo pretty place real pretty book agreed the parks on the land side but the waters right across the highway you can hear it i like that sound maybe ill move to the colony or something so i can sleep did adella think she was going to axs dads place book gaped you really know stuff aaron smiled then when ax passed the turnoff for his dads place she said hey where we going and ax said nothing he just kept driving it wasnt that far after then what mason book licked his lips rotated his head like some yoga exercise creaked audibly ax pulls in front of some gates gets out of the truck shes saying what the fuck he opens the door pulls her out real hard books eyes closed i hate guns ax had a gun when he brings it i always say put that away what happened next the baby cried ax put the gun in her back and told her to walk into the park yup she said fuck you and started to cuss him out ax twisted her arm real hard and real quick and she started screaming the baby was really screaming i put my hands over my ears demonstrating gently aaron lowered books hands then what did ax do hit her in back of the head with the gun and when she fell he put his hands around her neck another liplick cars were driving by on pch it was weird too dark for them to see anything but you could see it i didnt look the baby was crying ax finished with her put her back in the truck next to me it smelled what did she shit herself the babys really crying mustve been scary for you seeing as you didnt expect anything but a threeway party book went silent your feelings are important mason to me i was it was like i was pretty wasted on what a little blow a little ice to get up up from what xanax restoril valium ambien stuff unwilling to admit to sniffing heroin aaron had seen that before upscale junkies fessing to everything but h book said we did some e too it wasnt making me happy because youd just seen ax murder adella my whole head was i was surprised by what happened she was so pretty said book i was surprised at how she got to smelling real bad after that after that what mason weell my head got real noisy i stopped sleeping stopped eating too because you felt bad about what happened i went to the hospital said book i wasnt sick but my doctor said go because you werent eating and sleeping they wanted to feed me in the veins said book i said no not there yet not ready to be fed books arms shot out begging to be touched aaron sat there feeling guiltys what good people do mason she came to meet me she wanted to be famous what happened after ax put adella back in the truck books arms dropped he said we got to dump her somewhere thats when you went to griffith park really long drive said book it smelled gross and the baby was screaming ax told it to shutthefuckup but that didnt help so he played pink floyd really loud what happened at griffith park we took her into where it was dark and put her on the ground you and ax he didnt want to carry her by himself get her stuff all over him so he took the feet i took the hands she kind of swung book stared at aaron he spread her legs said that makes it look like ted bundy that was bad huh helping him youre doing the right thing right now by talking mason what happened to the baby ax drove me home aaron repeated the question the baby was in the truck ax took it somewhere no answer what did ax do with the baby mason we didnt talk about it now aaron did grace the fool with an angels touch standing and resting his palms on books fragile shoulders youre doing great mason but we need to take it all the way what did ax do with the baby dont know we dont talk about it to set things straight mason guilts not enough you need atonement guilt and atonement said book sounds like a movie a good one mason you could star books laugh was nasal eerie wriggling free from aarons touch he pincergrasped the front of his own neck pulling a pale flap of skin forward not a star not there yet not where books eyes clamped shut still holding on to the neck flesh he twisted aaron pried the fingers loose books neck remained pallid guys body was so starved he couldnt even bring blood to the surface mason theres another girl caitlin who said book blond twenty worked at riptide books brow creased twenty seconds of what looked like sincere contemplation head shake caitlin frostig said aaron rorys girlfriend rory hes my pa gofers for you yeah he have your pin number too no he uses the petty cash for what buying what i need that include blow and ice and stuff book frowned he shouldnt be in trouble why not hes a good pa there when you need him yup caitlin frostig was his girlfriend no answer aaron said long blond hair twenty went to school with rory book said the hostess you know her

when he finishes school he wants to finish school aaron sat back down mason is there anything you want to tell me about caitlin frostig like what the guy was an actor but aaron was sure he wasnt performing visions of mr dmitris scowling face filled his head like anything mason weell said book she was like that david lee roth song california girls but not ripe to party why not you can just tell bet you can masonokay i need to get you out of here in case ax comes back hes at his dads i sent him there sent everyone away whos everyone rory kimora whos kimora she cleans wanting to be alone for his final swan dive aaron said i still want you out of here lets get some clothes on in the huge slovenly dressing room of a huge slovenly bedroom topped by a vaulted skylight aaron found silk jockey shorts from a savile row shop size rock republic jeans a black gucci sweatshirt thousanddollar alligator loafers book dropped his robe without embarrassment stood there again rubberlimbed as aaron dressed him the jeans were too big aaron cinched a pythonskin belt around the actors waist looking sharp mason book laughed whats the code to open the gate dont know kimora does it where can i find it in the kitchen show me a card next to the kitchen phone listed a series of gate controls and various service numbers aaron chose an option that would hold the gate open indefinitely if anyone asked hed claim he found it that way no trespassing had taken place that failed to explain why hed made his way up the drive just happened to be there when book nearly plunged to his death but this was about murder and hed saved a life and he figured he was pretty safe okay pal lets boogie book didnt budge fool was staring at the chrome traulsen from which hed taken the can of supplement then it came to aaron attempted last meal book had seen himself as a prisoner still couldnt bring himself to go out with a full stomach want anything before we go mason a snack maybe something to drink book stepped back from the fridge while shaking his head slowly your angel thinks you should eat something mason uhuh said book not there yet not where mason the actor repeated the pincergrasp of neckskin too fat chapter talk about the money shot aaron framed it mentally like the prize photo it was even as he experienced it mason book shuffling down swallowsong lane arm in arm with an unnamed companion not a paparazzo in sight how much could i sell this to the tabs for book stumbled easy mason unnamed black companion no doubt theyd assume he was a bodyguard maybe with an ominous past aaron could live with that book didnt fuss as aaron put him in the opels passenger seat muttering nice wheels they driving this in heaven and promptly falling asleep aaron poked him to make sure he wasnt faking then belted him in fishing out the plastic wrist ties he used three linking both of books hands together then tying the right loop to the lap belt no big deal freeing the belt but in the actors current mental and physical state the setup was as good as a steel cage now where to take him slipping the key into the ignition aaron remembered the three missed calls checked his cell a trio of texts from lianaone text actually repeated three times relbl source riptide adlla w dmnts never bk now he knew where he had to take his new pal moe got the call as he and petra were finishing coffee and eggs at a dennys near hollywood station raymond wohr was stashed in a solitary cell having downed a repast of donuts and hershey bars and mountain dew aaron said working late moses i figured id get your machine busy night its going to get busier ive got someone youll want to meet whos that aaron told him moe said did you do something illegal thats going to screw us over me ive been an angel moe and petra showed up at aarons office thirtyfive minutes later mason book was still totally out of it napping peacefully under a downfilled frette duvet in the guest room that rarely saw action the plastic ties remained in place the right one now circling a stout brass bedpost the actor had snoozed through everything not even stirring when aaron slung him over his shoulder and hauled him up the stairs book had stayed so inert that aaron checked his breathing a couple of times nice and steady good strong pulse the second time aaron poked him books eyes opened and he smiled like a happy kid and went under again some of that was probably postadrenaline letdown but aaron figured a blood test would reveal all sorts of interesting biochemistry no doubt some defense attorney would pounce on that and try to invalidate the tape now transferred to one of aarons computers and copied to a disk locked in aarons business safe book had to be kept under wraps until his body fluids turned pristine aaron had a medical contact he could rely onan internist hed helped through a cancerous divorce guy kept offering him free checkups but aaron didnt believe in doctors unless you were sick or needed them for extracurricular work meanwhile book had to stay here which is exactly what he told moe and petra when they started jawing about taking the actor into custody surprisingly moe said i see your point but unless we file on him and lock him up it looks a whole lot like kidnapping why hes my guest said aaron you had no idea i even had him a guest gets cuffed to the bed you never saw that neither detective spoke aaron said i saved his life guys its only logical hed be depending on me and that will turn out useful for you petra said hey bring a girl over and call it a party there you go moe scowled a party is what adella was promised you believe book about not knowing she was being set up i do what about books claim of not knowing what happened to the baby on some level he knows ax killed the babythats part of the selfloathing but right now he cantwont admit it which is exactly why he needs to be kept under wraps give him time to stew i work on him he opens up more or just the opposite said moe what if his head clears and he shuts up or worse he goes into some sort of medical crisis ill have a doctor check him moe pondered i dont know aaron said you heard that tape without me book would be strawberry jam at the bottom of a canyon i just handed you a bonanza the detectives exchanged looks what am i missing guys moe said weve got our own bonanza aaron took in the details of raymond wohrs admission to setting up adella with zenserenity same for the news of alicia eigers murder the cell phone trace verifying wohrs call to ax dement three hours prior to the stabbing when it was over he said that fits perfectly with my info guys adella knew ax from riptide but not book she was axs problem because ax was the babys daddy meaning books being straight about just being bait this is all coming togethereyewitness testimony on ax for adella and logic telling us hes the prime suspect for alicia petra said the way this bastard dispatches women im wondering what else hes done books pretty sure hes at daddys ranch right now youre wondering what else could be dug up there said aaron like baby bones the thought occurred to me moe rubbed a massive bicep aarons arms still throbbed where were you when i needed you bro he said same old story girl gets pregnant from the wrong guy tries to capitalize oversteps in terms of burial site for the baby that could be leo carrillo where ax and book drove out to get high like it was some shrine moe said why a shrine for book if hes clean dont knowso maybe book does know more about the baby either way id get a k out there another day at the beach said petra to moe whether or not ax is at daddys theres probable cause to go in moe nodded aaron said one more thing what does wohr say about caitlin seen her once or twice on the level we think so so caitlins a whole other story so what the hell have i gotten myself into good morning mr dmitri petra said not necessarily ax couldve killed caitlin just because thats what he does he didnt need book so he didnt tell book about it aaron said not wanting book to know too much because hes mentally unstable yeah i like that moe said for all we know ax is biding his time before getting rid of book a suicidal selfstarving dopehead whos going to be suspicious if he does turn into strawberry jam aaron said guys featherlight i couldve tossed him myself moe said the motive for caitlin could be a lust thing or the same as adella she knew too much because of her relationship with adella or rory stoltz flapped his gums and confided in her she got horrified threatened to go to the cops instead of shielding her rory told book or went straight to ax and warned him selling out his girlfriend said petra cold aaron said im certain rory scores dope for book so hes clearly not the allamerican kid his mama thinks he is little prick wants to parlay his pa job into a bigtime industry gig it pays to prioritize petra said utter corruption perfect tutorial for the industry aaron said meaning caitlins bones could be buried on that ranch all the more reason to go in moe said books medical condition still bugs me you want him hes yours but that means publicity lawyers stuff you wont be able to control keep him here and ill get a doctor and someone rocksolid reliable to watch him imagining lianas face when she learned her new assignment female and gorgeous should make the actor feel right at home hell liana could wear a blond wig by the time we get back here bookll be gelling his hair and eating steak get back from where said moe our little party our what can i say moses im into plural pronouns aaron thought he saw petra smile but now she was looking detached and he couldnt read her at all moses im not asking you for an explicit expression of appreciation but i did get you pure gold why would you want to cut me off now petra definitely was smiling moving to hide it behind a slim white hand moes eyebrows rose he said what do you think partner she said doesnt bother me but youre the primary moe ran a finger inside his shirt collar massaged his arm again as if soothing an ache and faced aaron thank you bro chapter the party started at four am bring your own kevlar

carl neihrold got to cut the lock that took a while because the bolt was heavyduty and neihrold had been deskjobbing for years hadnt used cutters since his rookie year doing dope raids several grunts later the steel gave way and the gate swung open forward said the chief fugitive cop a man named juan silva headlights off five miles per sounding confident but no one knew what lay ahead the entry road was over half a mile of dirt meandering through high grass the occasional oversized clump of rosemary thatches of poppies winddwarfed sycamores droughtloving california oaks no sign of guard dogs no alarm bells fifty yards from the roads upsweep to a broad plateau aaron noticed tiny blinking lights in the boughs of a large oak shortlived then gone as if stars had plunged to earth and died on contact seconds later more pinpoint strobes this time from a nondescript clump of sage see that moses what infrared camerastheyre all over the place moe radioed juan silva silva said we saw it were just gonna call you were putting on helmets tell everyone we could encounter some preparedness and lets lower it to a crawltwo mph no action whatsoever until i say okay the hummer came to a stop at the mouth of a broad plateau leaving just enough room for moe to inch his crown vic in beyond an open wooden arch was empty dirt turned silvergray according to the county assessor lem dements spread was sixtythree acres but from what moe could see only three or four of that was flat the rest a repeating pattern of overlapping hilltops that bled into darkness just left of the entry to the plateau maybe twenty yards back was a corral what used to be a corraltwo sides of collapsed fencing shouted nonfunctional so did the absence of horseshit perfume moe lowered his window another couple of inches the place smelled of nothing as the humvee sat there moes attention shifted to right of the archdeeper in than the corral the nearest structure was a substantial housethe large rectangle that had showed up on aarons google earth aerial farther back sat several smaller outbuildingsshacks or cabins peppering the base of the foothills moe counted four but darkness could be concealing others a field the size of a baseball diamond separated the house from its satellites three oaks sprouted haphazardly in the dirt twisted branches and sere foliage cookiecutting chunks out of the sky no sign of any church no construction vehicles but the dirt patch on the aerial map was obvious off to the far right thirty or so paces from the main house big stretch of dirt ringed by taut string on wooden stakes preliminary layout for some sort of project but no groundbreaking that said nothing about handdigs as the hummer continued to idle moe wondered about engine noise but no lights had gone on in the house or the outbuildings that could mean anything weird place to raise your familytalk about isolation and nothing hollywood about it lem dement had squirreled away a fortune from his alleged faith flick but youd never know it from his homestead the main house was generous enough but not fancy lowslung logsided with a swooping roof hosting a satellite dish that listed sharply and a fulllength covered porch furnished with a few folding chairs the property had once been a summer camp this had probably been the administration buildingdining hall hundred bottles of beer no shortsheeting tonight several cars were parked in front but the hummer blocked them from moes view aaron whispered not exactly hearst castle more like your basic shitkicker hunting lodge that filled moes head with pictures heads over mantels trophies no decent person would want to look at he kept silent half a minute passed before juan silva radioed were going to park up by that horse corral but you guys stay in place as he spoke the humvee rolled to one of the battered fences came to a halt switched off its engine now moe could see the entire front of the house and there parked deadcenter was a prize ahab ax dements black ram truck a likely source of forensic treasure eight other vehicles were lined up perfectly parallel to one another as if precision mattered to someone aaron identified the black x as gemma dements ride the others conformed to the reg info moe had obtained lem dements mercedes coupe with lemdem plates the directors escalade truck tagged ldtoo three baby

dement securitywhatever that meant falling down on the job was the entire family peacefully beddybye and about to have the worst nightmare of their collective lives juan silva radioed im getting out to check moe watched the tall helmeted figure glide silently around to the back of the log house silva emerged moments later and got back in the humvee theres another porch out back and weve got two back doors nothing serious crappy locks i saw kids sleeping in the back so thats a complication any idea who or whats in those cabins out back moe said no well i saw three kids in one room with bunks two more in singles that leaves two more kids plus the parents and the house is several rooms deep so they could be anywhere were going to want max manpower to ensure quick control that means us six leading and the rest of you uniforms as backup okay captain neihrold neihrold said sure silva said i know we never found any records of livein staff but its logical thered be some with a place this big maybe theyre unregistered that could be whos in those cabins at this distance well consider them mediumrisk so you detectives can keep a watch should be boring unless someones got longrange military hardware moe said dont see any missile launchers its what you dont see that can bite you detective aaron mouthed funny guy silva said use those trees for cover keep your eyes and your radios open were hoping for a smooth one but once we start popping the tab on this can it could get interesting one by one the raid vehicles rolled up to the plateau parked near the corral disgorged their occupants another brief whispered meeting among silva and neihrold and moe at four seventeen am silva gave the thumbsup and led his squad to the big house helmeted figures fanned out surrounding the structure sheriffs deputies stood just behind moe and petra and raul hustled for the trio of oaks john nguyen remained in petras car happy to be there because he hadnt gone to law school to play gi joe aaron got out of the crown vic and joined his brother behind a tree moe looked at him shook his head resignation not debate the go signal simultaneous battering of the front door and the pair at the rear of the big house splintering wood shattered glass the usual bellowed warnings light on in front no reaction from the cabins out back moes attentioneveryones attentionshifted to the action the first fruits of the raid appeared within seconds ax dement ponytailed barechested pajama bottoms fastened under a pendulous gut was hustled outside by the two biggest fugitive cops cuffed at the back head down eyes barely open shuffling as the helmets dragged him forward next brother japhet in shorts and a tshirt marked occidental college cuffed and bewildered and tripping several times as sheriffs deputies led him to one of their cruisers no longer a lookalike hed lost about thirty pounds shaved his beard trimmed his hair to a neat blond brush cut not a badlooking kidmore gemma than lem thought aaron he watched for her to appear felt bad for her beaten for years a murderous psychopath for a kid what would she say if she saw aaron tonight flattering himself that shed care sheriffs deputies brought out three more peoplethe youngest dement kids one broke down and cried and a khaki lifted the child into his arms and kept going next two teensmary giles in a pink bathrobe tall slim with long dark hair and her mothers angular good looks unrestrained but for hands on both arms suddenly she fought to break free why the fuck are you doing this why the fuck are you doing this screaming loud enough for anyone in the cabins to hear no reaction from the cabins the outbuildings were vacant or they housed illegal alien workers too terrified to show their faces either way good this would go down easy as his sister was led away two other deputies appeared with the last dement offspring seventeenyearold paul miki baggy tshirt saggy shorts surferdo zitface gawky as a heron stunned and passive but for ax dement stashed in the rear cage of the hummer to await interrogation all the dement children were hustled off the property juan silva came out of the house spotted moe jogged over we got some weed some weaponsthree revolvers two rifles also a knife collection all from axs room thats what was in plain sight feel free to search to your hearts content where do you want your suspect going keep him here for the time being said moe what about the parents master bedroom was empty bed made i asked the daughter where they were but she got obscene do they have another residence not that weve found said moe they used to live in the hollywood hills but someones renting the place silvas eyes wandered bored now that his job was done maybe they went on vacation eyeing the humvee okay to transfer porky to your vehicle raul biro said want to use mine its got a cage moe said sounds good guess wed better clear those pointing to the cabins after that im calling in the coroners guys and a couple of ks silva said sounds like a plan removing his helmet he ran a hand over short black hair all confidence and poise another mission accomplished that changed seconds later when gunshots cracked the night chapter three firecracker snaps seconds of dead air three more shots by the time juan silva the three homicide ds and four other fugitive cops assumed new positions closer to the cabins lights had gone on in two front windows of the centermost outbuilding everyone thinking the same thing weird why advertise nothing but yellow light could be seen behind lace curtains snick snick snick as pistols and rifles put the windows in their sights aaron fox hung back a few feet close enough to see and hear but well away from anyones nervous trigger finger the target was sloperoofed and logsided with a fulllength covered porch minime of the main house silva handed his rifle to one of his squad members cupped his hands police come out now walk backward with your hands on your head now you are surrounded now come out now nothing silva repeated the warning motioned two of his men to circle to the back of the cabin before they got going a womans voice said im safe thank you come in please you come out maam i cant move too scared please juan silva reconferred with his men go back there and see if you can breach safely if its righteous exit out the front gemma dement sat on a peachcolored rocking chair next to a molded plastic bed shaped like a race car she wore a heavy oversized plaid shirt and pink sweatpants the bed sported realisticlooking plastic tires headlights bumpers the automotive theme extended to a thick wildly colored comforter printed with ferraris and lamborghinis and other shovelnosed monsters matching throw pillows lots of them from the height and bulk of the comforter additional bedding below lots of cold nights in the malibu hills no sign of heating in the cabin gemmas pale hair was loose frizzed by the distant ocean the peach of the chair was good for her complexion shed pleaded with silva then used smiles and eyeflutters claiming shed wet herself was still too scared to move no obvious sign of bladder problems on her sweatpants but no one was asking her to budge petra said raul please get a camera biro left gemma dements mouth puckered i was so scared she recited woodenly he tried to hit me again to her right lay a small square chrome handgun its magazine now in the custody of moses reed to her left was lem dement flat on his back one meaty leg bent the other straight a monumental hillock of belly aimed at the ceiling a gelatinous face grizzled with white stubble dipped past the neckline of his tshirt dements mouth had flopped open a dental appliancea partial upper bridgedangled from slack lips his hands were thick hirsute outstretched the left palm was pierced by a rubyfringed hole the shirt was a saul to paul souvenir once white now pretty much scarlet the blood deepened in hue when viewed on the absorbent brown velour of dements whitepiped sweatpants the directors blueveined feet remained encased in black suede slippers with little gold wolves on the toes two feet from dements head sat a gray hat grubby battered studded with bass lures aaron thought no water in sight whos he been trying to kid for no particular reason he began counting bulletholes in addition to the defensive wound in dements hand he spotted two in the right upper thigh two in the torso one of which looked like a nice clean heartshot messy one in the groin all kinds of leakage pooling on the pineplank floor three shell casings in plain sight the others had probably rolled under furniture or were embedded in the walloh yeah there was one behind the bed five feet above the comforter six shots six hits no scorch or powder rings around any of the wounds that aaron could see but too much blood to be sure gemma dement said im starting to breathe again she demonstrated a muffled sound came from under the racecar comforter movement jostled a ferrari fabric rolled gemma snapped quiet you petra and juan silva took hold of her arms stood her up guided her away from the bed moe reed lifted the covers a childa boya toddlerbuttonnosed chubbycheeked ruddybronze with black hair huddled on a urinesoaked sheet teeth chattering he wore blue pjs with builtin feet diapers bulked the rear flap to moes eye he looked to be two or so gemma dements eyes said the child was shit on satin aaron thought shes been with him longer than his mother ever was and hates him feeling his gut tighten he stepped forward so gemma could see him she mouthed oh but didnt utter the word softened her features mechanicallyweirdlyshe smiled aaron said guilt and atonement expecting some sort of explosive reaction gemma dement winked nothing sexual sly and allknowing smug enjoying a private joke that aaron didnt want to understand he watched moe pick up the little boy the kid clung to moe like one of those orphaned monkeys at the zoo wholl love anything warm his brother looked uncomfortable with the contact and aaron suppressed a smile smiling right now all this blood and death and misery would brand him as an asshole as if something had passed from the boys body through moes moe suddenly cradled the kid tenderly tousled his hair gabriel gemma dement laughed petra said something funny maam hes not gab riel hes adrael another winkcomical and all the creepier for that adrael who maam oh please said gemma dement as if the question was beyond absurd study your scriptures study your jew scriptures because those people know the boy burrowed his face deeper not minding the roughness of the kevlar hes been with her longer than his mother but he knows gemma dements shoulders stiffened as petra and the fugitive cop tightened their grip moe said mrs dement ive got nothing to worry about but you do cocking her head at the child youre touching him and hes a messenger of trouble the kid couldnt see her but maybe hed sensed the contempt he began to whimper tiny frame bouncing against moes massive chest moe patted his back its okay little buddy get her out of here petra and the fugitive cop eased gemma toward the door gemma didnt resist but she strained to keep her eyes fixed on the tiny body no interest in the other body blood spreading slowly steadily cops having to shift their position to keep out of the expanding pool aaron thought obsessed with the kid its all about the kid the boy began crying silence you sparkling white teeth didnt prettify gemma dements snarl suddenly she fought to break free was held fast spit flew some of it landed on the fugitive cops vest he remained impassive the boy was sobbing gulping air and moe was comforting him as gemma dement was dragged through the door she said curse you adrael not screaming chantingincanting in a flat detached crazily rhythmic voice that mocked music as metallic as the gun on the floor curse be you curse be you curse be you adrael blessed damned blessed damned angel of death chapter good news bad news which way the joke went depended on your perspective good news for gemma dement and bad news for the das office was her having the money to hire maureen wolkowicz arguably the most effective ruthless amoral defense attorney west of the mississippi wolkowicz lost no time sealing her clients trap shut bringing in a score of hiredgun shrinks and holding a wellattended press conference during which she announced that the death of lem dement had resulted from the clearest case of selfdefense in the face of chronic brutal repeated domestic violence ive ever seen what that had to do with the murder of adella villareal and the abductionand the year and a half of emotional abuse of baby gabriel villarealwolkowicz didnt say john nguyen vowed to work the baby angle if he didnt get dumped from the case for four days hed been waiting to hear if his boss would take over that would mean nguyen still doing all the work the boss singing the courtroom arias and garnering the glory john was a far better prosecutor than the boss an elected blowhard who according to courtroom wags couldnt convict a fart out of a bean dinner it was all about the odds likely conviction its mine another ojrobert blakephil spector its yours bad news for gemma dement and good news for public safety was that unbeknownst to her or to maureen wolkowicz ahab ax dement despised his mother beyond her wildest imaginationhated both of his parents reallyand was ready to spill his guts even before the nodeathpenalty deal was inked surprising fellow ax despite the greasy hair the blunt face the matted beardthe image of backwoods vulgarian that hed calculated for yearsthe eldest dement spawn was an intelligent articulate young man whod earned honors in english and chemistry at harvardwestlake and spent a year at stanford as a foreign relations major before dropping out to pursue a music career that never took off in place of fame he settled for the side effects said aaron watching through the glass as moe and john nguyen and ax and axs lawyer an aptly named sharpie named charles toothy danced around fine points of law dr alex delaware nodded the psychologist was here at moes request to offer his impression of the accused double murderer delaware had also agreed to evaluate gabriel villareal and to oversee the childs psychosocial progress after he left for arizona to live with his maternal grandparents hed just arrived from a visit at western pediatric hospital where gabriel was under observation answered aarons inquiry with as well as can be expected aaron returned his attention to the interview charles toothy wearing a bad suit but a good shirt and tie said then its agreed if said john nguyen if will be when said toothy to keep things crisp and accurate rather than go over the details orally and possibly miss something my client has prepared a written statement and would like to read it for the record removing papers from his briefcase the statement was a wellrehearsed collaboration between client and mouthpiece moe said he can read what he wants but he also needs to answer any questions we have any questions said toothy that i dont object to nguyen said if you object too much no deal toothy stroked his hermès tie im sure therell be no problem remains to be seen ax dement cleared his throat may i please start id like to get this over with my name is ahab petrarch dement im known by my friends as ax im a musician specifically a rock guitarist and electric bassist my primary residence is at solar canyon malibu california approximately three years ago i became acquainted with a woman named adella villareal through a mutual acquaintance named raymond wohr mr wohr was employed as a bartender and apparently ms villareal had worked as a cocktail waitress at a poker club in gardena california i say apparently because i do not have firsthand knowledge of those facts and rely upon the report of raymond wohr i met mr wohr through my interest in illicit drugs specifically methamphetamine cocaine marijuana hashish and prescription tranquilizers all of which mr wohr sold at various times i believe i first met mr wohr outside a club called bang hole in east hollywood a now defunct place of business but i am not certain of that as much of my memory of that time period has been erased by drug abuse at some point mr wohr informed me that he also had access to professional prostitutes and would be happy to set up dates between myself and professional prostitutes i was not an habitual user of prostitutes but did occasionally indulge in their services and i agreed subsequently mr wohr did introduce me to several prostitutes including a woman he was living with named alicia eiger i cannot recall the exact number of dates with her or with any other women arranged by mr wohr but there were several well into my relationship with mr wohr he informed me that he now had higherquality goods but that such goods would cost a shitload more i expressed interest and a few days later mr wohr introduced me to adella villareal who was noticeably younger more attractive and according to mr wohr majorleague fresh over an approximate onemonth period i participated in three dates with ms villareal and found myself extremely attracted to her for that reason rather than limit my contacts with her to her apartment where one date took place or to the millennium biltmore hotel in los angeles where the other two dates took place on her birthday i met her at a bar on ocean avenue in santa monica that id frequented in the past the name of that establishment is riptide during her second visit to riptide ms villareal officially my date met and became interested in another man that individual was my father lemuel dement a film director this surprised and chagrined me greatly because of my attraction to ms villareal however since the man who supplanted me was my father i found myself confused and unsure of how to respond lemuel dement taking advantage of my confusion offered me ten thousand dollars to feel better about the situation with the contingency that id harbor no ill will to him or to adella villareal and simply go with the flow i accepted the money though my inner emotions were not at peace with this arrangement sometimes in fact i felt as if i was going crazy my drug use increased adding to my discomfort was that shortly after beginning a relationship with lem dement adella villareal became pregnant with his child neither ms villareal nor lem dement seemed unhappy with that turn of events in fact both seemed quite pleased and my father especially when he was intoxicated began dropping hints of life change which i took to mean that he planned on leaving my mother gemma dement and marrying adella villareal this caused me considerable emotional pain and plunged me deeper into a morass of violent and aggressive thoughts my use of illicit drugs increased further as did my patronage of professional prostitutes often those activities were combined and both raymond wohr and alicia eiger were participants approximately twentyfour months ago adella villareal gave birth to a baby boy that she and lem dement named gabriel i am of the opinion that it was lem dement who actually chose the name because while intoxicated he confided to me that the child was my little angellooks like an angel acts like an angel he deserves an angel name i took that to mean that lem dement was contrasting the babys sweet disposition to my personality and to my behavior neither of which could be considered angelic i was emotionally injured by the comparison and angry despite lem dements talk about a new life he did not leave my mother and marry ms villareal however he did send ms villareal money for child support in the sum of three thousand dollars a month those payments were made in cash and lem dement offered me a thousand dollars a month to deliver the cash to adella villareal at various restaurants and bars in the hollywood area in restrospect i believe this to have been motivated by cruelty on my fathers part but when someone is in the middle of something they sometimes cannot understand the full implication of what is happening to them at that point in my life i was severely depressed angry confused and otherwise rootless and i was willing to do anything to earn my fathers approval plus the money my father paid me was useful in purchasing illicit drugs which i was using regularly i made four deliveries of three thousand dollars to adella villareal all of which she accepted without comment when i brought the fifth delivery to ms villareal her demeanor was different on that occasion she expressed frustration with the inadequacy of the payment as well as with my father who apparently had stopped returning her calls i say apparently because once ms villareal supplanted me with my father my father and never talked about the details of his relationship with ms villareal only that she was hot in bed on the night that i delivered the fifth payment ms villareal threatened to go public with the fact that lem dement was the father of her child and to bust open that hypocritical biblespouting cult you call a family those may not be exact quotes but they are close did not respond to ms villareals tirade nor did i report it to my father i did however report it to my mother gemma dement a woman with a history of mental illness and alcohol abuse possibly due to domestic violence abuse heaped on her by my father throughout the course of their marriage my mother has also reported being allegedly abused by several men she knew prior to marrying my father i say allegedly because my knowledge of those events is limited to what my mother has told me while she is intoxicated my mother reacted calmly to my informing her of adella villareals threats i was surprised even shocked at how calm she was she told me that she was aware of the situation had been for months and had been figuring out what to do about it now i know the next day my mother met me for lunch at the mesa rock café in agoura hills california and laid out her plan i was to abduct adella villareal as well as her baby and bring them to our family home in solar canyon malibu the timing of the abduction was to be during a period when my father was traveling on business i was to do whatever it takes to get ms villareal and her baby under total control including violence physical restraint even damn tranquilizer darts if you need them once ms villareal was in my mothers custody she was to be bound and deprived of food water and sleep and subjected to what my mother called reeducation until she agreed to give up custody of her baby to my mother and to leave our family alone my mother would offer ms villareal ten thousand dollars for her trouble once she moved to a state other than california i expressed to my mother my opinion that ten thousand dollars would not be sufficient my mother smiled and said well then shes dug her own grave took that to mean that ms villareals death was not something that would displease my mother i was motivated to make my mother happy something i hadnt done in years additionally my mother offered me the sum of fifty thousand dollars to carry out her plan as well as my own house in the state of oregon a state where i have long expressed an interest in living because i love nature and wish to get away from urban living it was under those circumstances that i followed my mothers instructions using raymond wohr to set up a fictitious date between ms villareal and a celebrity individual whose identity would attract ms villareal the celebrity i chose was mr mason book the wellknown actor because mr book rents a house from my father a situation brought about through my association with mr book for several years mr book had no prior knowledge of my plan nor did he engage in any criminal activity nor had he any prior contact with adella villareal i met adella villareal in a rented room at the hyatt hotel on sunset boulevard in hollywood and informed her that while mason book had changed his mind my father wanted to see her tonight because hed decided to leave my mother and marry her my instructions were to bring ms villareal to be with my father at the family residence in solar canyon a place ms villareal had expressed interest in visiting but had never seen i lied and told ms villareal that my mother and my siblings were away on vacation and that shed be alone with my father i also instructed her to bring her baby because my father was going to proclaim the baby as his legitimate son and would have a lawyer present to sign papers ms villareal was initially suspicious and taken aback by my presence however since id previously played a role in bringing her monthly cash payments from my father she eventually believed me and accompanied me to my truck i drove ms villareal and her baby to malibu but instead of heading to solar canyon i continued several miles north to leo carrillo state beach a place id enjoyed going as a child and as a teenager walking alone among the trees when i was depressed or hiding out among the trees while i used illicit drugs my intention was to physically subdue ms villareal before she met my mother so that my mother would be able to assume the total control she requested because of that i came prepared with acaliber pistol and plastic handcuffs purchased over the internet from a company called submissionnet i stopped the truck just outside the gates to the leo carrillo state beach parking lot a relatively open spot that seemed safe for what i was going to do because i believed this was going to be a brief process it was not ms villareal grew extremely angry at my attempt to get her to leave the truck and walk with me to a dark secluded spot my intention at that point was to get her alone so i could cuff her hands when she resisted showed her my gun i was surprised at her lack of concern for my gun and at her attempting to attack me physically it was that surprise that led me to panic and hit her in the back of her head with the gun and then to put my hands around her neck my intention in doing so was only to subdue her but somehow i strangled her and she stopped breathing once i saw what i had done i panicked and put her back in my truck and drove her far from malibu to griffith park i chose griffith park because it too represented a pleasant memory from my childhood from when my parents and my siblings would take trips to the zoo and to the carousel and to the gene autry museum where all sorts of entertainment industry and musical memorabilia are displayed i left ms villareals body in the fern dell area of griffith park and drove the baby back to my mother who was waiting for me five miles up the road from the family residence my mother was happy to see me and told me id done well she said she was renaming the baby adrael apparently one of the names used by the angel of death i say apparently because i am not religious and have in fact grown to hate religion due to understanding my parents and their use of religion to corrupt themselves and others though my mother describes adrael as evil and a source of evil she has cared for his physical needs ever since including giving him a carshaped bed outgrown by my youngest brother however i am concerned about what she might do to him eventually and that fact has caused me great anxiety and increased my mental instability and illicit drug use for nearly a year and a half adella villareals death remained unsolved and i believed id gotten away with this crime and worked hard at forgetting what i did several months later i was contacted by raymond wohr who began by asking why he hadnt heard from me in a while replied that id been busy he then said not too busy to take care of adella and her kid huh at that point i realized i had a problem and i went to my mother after reviewing the facts my mother said mr wohr had nothing on me other than the fact that id picked up ms villareal at the hotel my mother went on to say that ms villareal was just a skankwhore and those types get killed all the time and that mr wohr was just a skankpimp try paying him off and if that doesnt work well find a solution i arranged to pay mr wohr a lump sum of five thousand dollars in exchange for his silence i also agreed to resume employing the services of professional prostitutes arranged by mr wohr most frequently alicia eiger and to pay double for those services this arrangement seemed to be working until three days ago when raymond wohr phoned me saying alicia eiger was frustrated at not getting more money from me and was threatening to go public about her suspicions regarding adella villareals murder mr wohr also said that babykilling would be seen as a terrible crime even though he personally couldnt give a shit about any rugrat i told mr wohr that he needed to keep ms eiger calm he replied that he couldnt she was nuts totally whack to the point of screaming at him and hitting him in the face in broad daylight on their street of residence taft avenue at that point i phoned alicia eiger and informed her that raymond wohr had told me of her frustration and that i wanted to make everything good as such id be coming by with another two thousand dollars in cash she said two wasnt enough she wanted ten we negotiated and agreed on seven thousand five hundred dollars i set up an appointment that day to deliver the money stopping along the way at the bed bath beyond at the beverly center and purchasing a mediumsized kitchen knife i could conceal in a jacket pocket i drove to hollywood and parked several blocks from alicia eigers apartment on taft alicia eiger welcomed me into her apartment she looked confident we made small talk for a while then she demanded the money i said sure reached into my pocket spun her around and overpowered her and stabbed her repeatedly in the back i chose the back because i did not want to see her face while i ended her life contrary to what others may think i am not a monster nor am i a sadist who enjoys seeing people suffer or die i am the victim of years of physical and emotional neglect and abuse but i know that i have taken lives and must pay for that my hope is that receive the proper care so that my personality flaws mend and i can learn to become a productive member of society sincerely ahab p dement ax cleared his throat and put the papers down charles toothy said thats pretty comprehensive cant imagine thered be too many questions moe said when your father returned home howd he react to the baby being there ax said i cant answer that from personal observation as i was living elsewhere what my mother told me is that he was shocked her exact words were something like daddy just about shit solid gold adobes she swears when shes drunk and mostly shes drunk when she calls me she called you to report on your fathers return yes sir he was shocked he demanded to know how the baby had gotten there my mother told me she didnt come right out and say but she did imply that wed never be seeing adella again and that if my father made a fuss the entire family could end up in jail or worse in hell and and nothing your father just went along with it he did he didnt try to beat her up that was before said ax before she got a gun the last time he beat her up my mother bought a gun and it stopped hed stopped beating her completely yes sir for how long hmm maybe a year but but what she squeezes her own arm sir to bring up bruises i dont know why its just something she does i see said moe i dont see said ax maybe where youll send me ill get some insight how about giving me some insight about caitlin frostig who moe repeated the name ax dement said

we damn well please speak before i throw your ass in jail okay okay said rory but you need to understand i did my best no matter what you say chapter the convent of santa barbara is a onehundredfiftyyearold masterpiece of baroque and moorish revival weathered brick walls adorned with arches and pillars central courtyards jeweled by voluptuous gardens long designated a national landmark the convent is centralcastingperfect for the role of sacred refuge the sisters of gethsemane convent is a tract home on santa barbaras east side set on an undistinguished poorly paved street in one of the citys vulnerable workingclass neighborhoods just another stucco bungalow hastily nailed up to accommodate returning world war ii veterans the seven nuns who live at gethsemane are immigrants from central america and when they are not tending to sick children or alzheimers patients or homeless people they answer to a superior general in el salvador who ignores them the oldest nun sister lourdes echevarria has lived half of her eightyfive years at the convent the tiny lot upon which the bungalow sits is one of many parcels of real estate amassed by the catholic church its value has appreciated many times over since purchase in six months ago the bishop of santa barbara ensconced in a lovely mansion in a more fashionable section of town served an eviction order to the nuns the house was to be sold to help pay a nearly billiondollar settlement to victims of sexual predator priests the order would be broken up the nuns redistributed at the archdioceses discretion among themselves the nuns discussed the injustice of having to give up their home to atone for the grievous sins of the priests publicly they clung to their vows of obedience and awaited their fate many of them cried when certain no one was listening someone listened took the initiative to call a reporter at the santa barbara newspress the resulting frontpage story fomented local then statewide outrage against the archdiocese evictions plans were halted though on a temporary basis the sisters of gethsemane continue their good works and try not to think about the future the nuns wear white blouses and dark skirts and white flat shoes or sneakers the three oldest cover their hair with blue kerchiefs the bungalow is barely fourteen hundred square feet partitioned into tiny rooms the nuns own nothing and seven of them manage to sleep comfortably in bunk beds in two bedrooms a third bedroom at the rear is maintained for guests the nuns call sojourners for sixteen months a young woman with clipped dark hair a soft voice and willing hands has been the sojourner of residence she calls herself catherine and the nuns have never questioned whether or not that is her real name catherine knocked on the door of the convent and asked if she could stay a few days she insisted on pitching in with household chores doing more than her sharedoing the work of three by sister lourdess estimate days stretched to weeks which stretched to months catherine asked if she could help outside the house as well and she began accompanying sister mariaguadalupe and sister mariaanastasia as they made the rounds of a boardandcare home for severely retarded adults catherine loves cleaning and feeding and singing to the patients she changes their diapers without complaint the nuns love catherine all of them suspect it is she who phoned the reporter the topic is never brought up because suspicion accusation and recrimination have no place in their world of late catherine has put aside her youngperson jeans and tops and has worn the white blouse and dark skirt favored by the nuns alone in her bedroom after a long day she sometimes looks out the window at the vegetable garden that takes up most of the convents backyard marvels at tomatoes eggplant artichokes grapevines cries mostly she is at peace aaron and moe watched her take out the garbage wheeling the third of two plastic bins to the curb then stopping to look up at the sky different hair same face not wanting to frighten her they approached smiling she said youre here not a blink of surprise theyd warned rory not to broadcast their arrival the kid had defied them gold stars for loyalty love doing the right thing again moe introduced himself and caitlin pretended to listen he was willing to bet rorys call had included their names and a detailed physical description despite that she hadnt rabbited pleased to meet you detective reed turning to aaron he said aaron fox caitlin pleased to meet you as well mr

ornamental shrubs cherry tomatoes caitlin frostig walked away and moe was sure hed lost her picking a handful of tomatoes she returned to the brothers hungry moe quelled reflexive denial took the four little red orbs she was offering popped one in his mouth delicious mr fox thank you really tasty caitlin she said in terms of other girls what happened between my father and myself was what psychologists call a situationspecific dynamic my mother died when i was young my father had no one and i became a substitute im not saying it was right but it wont happen to anyone else pronounced

world too much movement could crack the surface at sunset moe said i appreciate it going out of your way and dropping me off who says its out of my way its not who knows said aaron smiling another bigtime whodunit either way thanks said moe bro moments later aaron watched as a beautiful black woman came out of her condo and greeted his brother with the warmest smile hed ever seen cries of delight big hug a lingering kiss that would have embarrassed moe if aaron had stuck around to see all of it chapter the air was warm but aaron put up the top on the porsche for the climb back up
