phil rickman the chalice prologue i had received serious injury from someone who at considerable cost to myself i had disinterestedly helped and i was sorely tempted to retaliate dion fortune psychic selfdefence september there she was lying across the bed stretched out corner to corner as though this could relieve the cramp inside caused by the way shed been used trifled with and slighted yes and humiliated as if as a young woman she was natural prey just another little hopping bird in the hawks garden oh she might have felt better beating her fists into the pillow but shed never have excused herself for that not the behaviour of a trained psychoanalyst all the same she would remember telling herself that if she didnt do something about it shed quite simply implode so perhaps that was what started the process it must have been going on somewhere while she was persuading her body into the relaxation procedure not easy when her stupid mind insisted on reenacting the appalling business over and over beginning with his proposal of a small adventure for her that boyish grin through the bristly little moustache the kind which all the men she knew seemed to have brought back from the great war the bantering baritone smooth and slick as freshly buffed mahogany didnt you know violet my goodness didnt you know that we still had it here the question causes as he knew it would a veritable flutter in her breast but violet still suspecting some prank says lightly that she trusts hes speaking metaphorically as anybody with even a perfunctory knowledge of such matters is aware that the holy grail does not exist and never did at which he puts down his wine spilling some the hell it doesnt you arrogant minx except of course as a symbol doubtless a sexual one its a numbingly dull and sultry afternoon summer seeping sluggishly into autumn and shes tired of his games and what would you know about symbols his lips twisting in amusement or sex for that matter the room is gloomy tiny windows and those monstrous black beams they have not discussed sex only violence and pain as much she informs him casually although shes stung by his manner and intimated by his blatant smirk as any advanced student of the methods of dr freud freud that ghastly charlatan he laughs oh so confident now that his own demons are quiet she decides not to react a passing fad violet youll see leaning back behind his desk handsome as the devil but please im intrigued define for me this symbolism whats his game now oh she must not give in to the welling hostility or worse to that other undignified stirring which has made the leather seat feel suddenly hot where she sits most humiliating and hardly the response of a trained psychoanalyst so he trails a finger through the spilled wine lets look at this joseph of arimathea uncle of christ provider of his tomb begs from pontius pilate the cup used at the last supper and perhaps to collect the blood from the cross yes a pretty legend i accept that and then carries it with him on his missionary voyage to a place in the west of britain where a strange pointed hill can be seen from the sea yes shes seen it herself in dreams as if from the sea the mystical conical tor on the holy isle of avalon and although she would never admit this to him shes still secretly thrilled by the legend and has been many times to the place where joseph was said to have buried the grail causing a spring to bubble up the chalice well which to this day runs red chalybeate of course iron in the water obviously she says i would not dispute that joseph and his followers came to avalon as missionaries or indeed that he was responsible for building the first christian church in england this is historically feasible how very accommodating of you violet although i rather suspect the story that joseph had once brought the child jesus here is no more than a romantic west country myth illuminated by the poet blake he says nothing and surely what joseph introduced to these islands was a faith not a a trinket that came out badly sounding even to her own ears more than a little churlish he smiles at her again looking replete with superior wisdom she rallies the symbolism is clear the idea of a chalice is well known in celtic mythology the cauldron of ceridwen a crucible of wisdom a symbol of transformation upon which the legend of the holy grail seen from a twentiethcentury perspective is obviously no more than a transparent christian veneer in which case he says musingly after a pause the grail would be even more significant carrying the combined power of two great traditions christian and pagan would it not if there was such a thing no doubt it would if there was such a thing he considers this for a while hands splayed on the desk eyes upraised to the blackened beams if there was such a thing and it had been secretly held by the monks of glastonbury until the reformation he stops his eyes are suddenly alight with zealots fire oh really violet almost sniffs monks were always forging relics to improve the status of their abbeys anyway pushing back her chair and standing up im a psychologist not an historian he also stands but remains behind the desk he seems to be considering something very well what if i were to show it you what if i were to show you the grail itself hes still wearing his uniform some of the men wear theirs because they have nothing else but his wardrobe could hardly be bare or gone to moth no he continues to sport his captains uniform because he knows its power over women of course ha violet says uncertainly in spite of herself in spite of the teachings of dr freud and what he has to say about the all consuming power of sex she is beginning as she follows this man out of the study and down a dark low passage to feel quite ridiculously excited in those days violet hadnt been terrifically good at containing emotion well she was still a young woman somewhat less experienced than her confidence might suggest she knew she was not what most people would call beautiful and that some men were intimidated by her direct manner but others and quite often the betterlooking ones the ones whose arms might have been around slimmer waists would seek her out faintly puzzled about why they found her attractive there had always been two sides to her which she equated with the celtic and the saxon the airy feyness and the nononsense earthiness although shed been born in north wales she considered herself because of her yorkshire steelworking family to be chiefly saxon as suggested by her flaxen hair and her solid bigboned body but shed always needed the phantasmal fire of the celts their inbred cosmic perspective these two aspects had fallen unexpectedly into harmony over the past few years during the great war all europe might have been in roiling smoking turmoil but violet had been curiously at peace not that she was any great pacifist shed have quite liked to have been at the front to be tested but the only womens work there was nursing and she was the first to admit she didnt have the patience for it not then but staying at home had been a revelation elements of what she was had come together in an unexpected way serving in the womens land army raising the crops feeding the troops fulfilment in a healthy practical way but also wonderfully symbolic with all the young strong men away in the forces england the essential england of holy hills and fertile meadows was at last in the care of women the girls of the land army had taken on the traditional role of mother goddess it had changed her she still found freud stimulating and exciting and the logic of his methodology unassailable as far as it went but there were areas of experience which psychoanalysis could not unveil and she had lifted up the hem of the curtain and seen wonders however to become truly initiated into the mysteries one needed the guidance of human beings who had been there before and some of them could be well pretty unsavoury types in other respects the sacred quest for enlightenment it appeared would often bring out the very worst in people one had to go jolly carefully keeping ones eyes open and quite frankly ones legs together go on then hold it vapour is rising from a small candle on the block of stone between them no please this is not right youre wrong its absolutely right now for me for us violet it lies in a black cloth between his hands grasp it no clasp it to your breast he extends his arms the cloth and what lies in it please its black its evil i dont shes starting to sob but its what you want my dear its what youve always wanted this is and youre a free and enlightened woman a trained psychoanalyst primitive superstition cant touch you now standing between her and the way out he adds lazily and take off your clothes why dont you and so violet was in a fairly hellish state when she flung her soiled body on the bed making its springs howl in retrospect she might have been better off rampaging through the grounds taking it out on the last of the weeds the bed had a light green eiderdown and the wallpaper was salmon pink colours of summer a pleasant room on a sullen autumn afternoon but it didnt calm her down today the effects of such abuse did not just quietly fade there was an essential conflict here one could adopt the christian attitude turn the other cheek and walk away very well i tried to help you i counselled you taught you how to control your nightmares from the war and you took advantage of me nevertheless not my place to be judgemental as a psychologist ha hardly good enough was it violet sighed lay back and let her eyelids fall the pillows were soft and cool the back of her head felt heavy like a bag of potatoes she let her arms flop by her sides the anger still burning somewhere below her abdomen was at odds though not uncomfortably so with the supine state of her body she was surprisingly reaching a state of relaxation but then she was getting rather good at that of course violet smiled one could simply allow oneself to go absolutely and utterly berserk she began a simple visualisation letting loose her thoughts to roam the wildest of terrain those places of high cliffs and crashing waves black and writhing trees against a thundery sky as her body lay on its bed on a sallow sunless afternoon in the mellow autumnal vale of avalon her thoughts stalked the wintry wasteland of cruel northern myths in search of a suitably savage instrument of revenge oh yes she was starting to enjoy her anger and felt no guilt about this daylight dripped on to her eyelids like syrup and in the cushiony hinterland of sleep in those moments when the senses mingle and then dissolve when fragments of whispered words are sometimes heard and strange responses sought violets rage fermented pleasurably into the darkest of wines good dog its fur was harsh as a new hairbrush it brushed her left arm raising goose bumps it lay there quite still as relaxed as violet had been but with a kind of coiled and eager tension about it she could feel its back alongside her its spine against her cotton shift it was lean but it was heavy and it was beginning to breathe she didnt really question its presence at first it was simply there she raised her left hand to pat it then the hand suddenly seized up so cold and violet was aware that the room had gone dark not dark as if shed simply fallen asleep and the afternoon had slid away into evening dark as in a draining of the light of the lifeforce vibrating behind colours the most horribly negative kind of darkness she opened her eyes fully it made no difference the wallpaper was a deepening grey and the fogged light inside the window frame thick and stodgy like a rubber mat the eiderdown beneath her was as hard and ungiving as a cobbled street the fear had come upon her slowly and was all the worse for that it chilled her insides like a coldwater enema a rank odour soured the room the air seemed noxious with evil almostvisible specks of it above her like a cloud of black midges drawing a breath made her body lurch against the creature lying motionless beside her in the gloom and motionless it stayed for a moment violet knew what she had to do she lay as still as she could gathering breath and her nerve then she put out her left hand out and down until her fingers found the eiderdown hard as worn stone there was an almost liquid frigidity around her hand over the wrist almost to the elbow like frogspawn in a halffrozen pond it was very hard to turn her head as though her neck was in a vice everything she held holy crying out to her not to look but look she did she managed to turn her head just an inch enough to focus on her left shoulder and follow her arm down and down to where the wrist vanished somewhere through the greyness she could detect a dim image of her fingers on the eiderdown while the beasts gaseous body swirled around the flesh of her arm as violet began to pant with fear it turned its grey head and the only white light in the room was in its long predators teeth and the only colour in the room was the still cold yellow of its eyes i am yours part one there is such magic in the first glimpse of that strange hill that none who have the eye of vision can look upon it unmoved dion fortune avalon of the heart one booksellers high street glastonbury prop juanita carey november danny love enclosed as promised one copy of colonel pixhills glastonbury diary more about that later after this months marathon moan sorry im getting hopelessly garrulous running off at the mouth running off at the amstrad put it down to time of life put this straight in the bin if you like im just getting it all off my increasingly vertical chest whats put me all on edge is that dianes back diane ffitch funny how so many of my problems over the years have involved that kid hell grown woman now by the time i was her age id been married divorced had three good years with you and one bad moved to glastonbury started a business i know a lot more than ive done since there depressed myself now it doesnt take much these days colonel pixhill was right glastonbury buggers you up but then you knew that didnt you ive been trying to think if you ever met diane i suspect not she was in her teens by the time our paths finally crossed although id heard the stories of course and you were long gone by then although you might remember the royal visit was it late spring princess margaret anyway always kind of liked her nearest thing to a rebel that family could produce as i remember you wouldnt go to watch uncool you said but the next day the papers had this story about the small daughter of local nob lord pennard who was to have presented the princess with a bouquet diane would have been about four then and already distinctly chubby waddles up to margaret i think it was at the town hall with this sheaf of monster flowers which is more than half her size maggie stoops graciously to scoop up the blooms the photographers and tv cameramen all lined up whereupon diane unceremoniously dumps the bouquet hurls herself in floods of tears at the royal bosom and sobs this was widely used in headlines next day are you my mummy poignant stuff you see because her mother died when she was born but obviously a moment of ultimate embarrassment for the house of pennard the first public indication that the child was how can i put this prone to imaginative excursions anyway that was dianes fifteen minutes of national fame the later stuff the disappearances the police searches they managed to keep out of the papers pity some even better pictures there like diane curled up with her teddy bear under a seat in chalice well gardens at four in the morning years later she turns up at the shop looking for a holiday job why my shop because she wanted access to the sort of books her father wouldnt have in the house although obviously i didnt know that when i took her on but she was a good kid no side to her shes twentyseven now until very recently lord pennard thought hed finally unloaded her having sent her to develop her writing skills by training as a journalist in yorkshire what does that bastard care about her writing skills it was yorkshire that counted being way up in the top right hand corner of the country an old family friend of the ffitches owns a local newspaper chain up there and of course the eldest son heir to the publishing empire was not exactly discouraged from associating with the hon diane yes an oldfashioned uppercrust arranged marriage titled daughterinlaw for solid northern press baron and the penurious house of pennard safely plugged into a source of unlimited wealth but its all off apparently i dont know exactly why and im afraid to ask and dianes back when i say back i dont mean here at the shop or at bowermead hall nothing as simple as a standup row with daddy and brother archer smarming about in the background oh no diane being diane shes come down from the north in a convoy of new age travellers well ive nothing against them in principle how could i with my background except that when we were hippies we didnt make a political gesture out of clogging up the roads or steal our food from shops despoil the countryside light fires made from peoples fences or claim social security for undertaking the above hey am i becoming a latent conservative or what anyway she rang shes with these travellers oh sorry pagan pilgrims and do i know anywhere near their holy of holies the tor of course where they could all camp legally for a few days otherwise they could be arrested as an unlawful assembly under the terms of the criminal justice act well i dont basically give a shit about the rest of them being nicked but im thinking christ diane winds up behind bars along comes archer to discreetly and smugly bail her out with daddys money i couldnt bear that so i thought of don moulder who farms reasonably close to the tor hes got this field hes been trying to flog as building land in some corrupt deal with griff daniel only mendip council now that griff isnt on it thank god insists quite rightly that its a green belt site and wont allow it so now the aggrieved moulder will rent out that field to anybody likely to piss the council off i call him up we haggle for a while and then agree on three hundred quid which diane is quite happy to pay she says theyre really nice people and its been a breath of fresh air for her travelling the country sleeping in the back of the van real freedom no pressure no cruel father no smug brother and at the end of the road glastonbury the holyest erthe in all england where according to the late dion fortune the saints continue to live their quaintly beautiful lives amid the meadows of avalon and oh god the poetry of the soul writes itself the reason i mention df is that for a long time diane was convinced that the famed high priestess was her previous incarnation gets complicated doesnt it god knows what the great lady would have written had she been around today bloody hell this is the new age blackpool shops that even in your time here used to sell groceries and hardware are now full of plastic goddesses and aromatherapy starterkits everybody who ever turned over a tarot card or flipped the iching sooner or later gets beached on the isle of avalon and the endless tourists not just brits but dozens of americans japanese and germans all trooping around the abbey ruins with their camcorders in search of enlightenment followed by a good dinner and a fourposter bed at the george and pilgrims ok i should moan the shops never been more profitable ive had to take on assistance at weekends jim battle nice man but im not enjoying it any more theres the rub im feeling tense all the time mention menopause and youre dead i see the latest freaks on the streets and i can see why the local people hated us twenty years ago i too hate the new age travellers blocking up wellhouse lane with their buses marching up the tor to tune into the mystical forces camping up there and shitting on the grass and leaving it unburied and i can see why the natives still dont trust us because they think were trying to take over the town and maybe we are some of us we say were all for unity and the kindly pagans are getting into bed with the christians and everything but basically we have very different values and when some local issue arises it all erupts like the proposed new road linking central somerset into the euro motorway network most of the natives are in favour because it will relieve traffic congestion in the small towns and villages but the incomers see it as an invasion of their rural haven the destruction of miles of wonderful countryside so whichever way it goes half of us are going to be furious its not as if even the alternative community is united we pretend to be of course old hippies part of that great universal movement but were divided factionalised gay pagan groups radical feminist pagans like the cauldron everything in glastonbury inevitably becomes extreme i lie awake mulling over the old hippy thing why cant we all live in peace together on whats supposed to be the holyest erthe in all britain and then i go back and read pixhills diaries making myself doubly miserable because we re the sole outlet for a book nobody want to buy on account of his nostradamuslike warnings of impending doom souls raging in torment the rising of the dark chalice etc etc well you just dont say things like that about glastonbury because this is a holy town and must therefore be immune from evil the people who settle here want to bathe in the sacredness like some sort of spiritual radox they want to be soothed they dont want anything to dent the idyll anyway you should see a copy as carey and frayne are the publishers let me know what you think ill go now i think i can see jim battle my best male friend these days wobbling down high street on what appears to be a new secondhand bike and looking as usual in need of a drink look after yourself wish me luck with diane and be glad your posh london outfit doesnt have to publish anything like the enclosed love two a sound thinker not knowing archer ffitch all that well griff daniel decided on restraint dirty drugsodden heathen bastards griff scratched an itchy palm on his spiky grey beard filthy dolescrounging scum attached to the wooden bars of the gate at the foot of glastonbury tor was a framed colour photograph of a lamb with its throat torn out over the photo was typed killed by a dog not on a lead dogs which chase sheep can be shot by law what they wanner do look said griff daniel is extend that bloody ole law tisnt as if any of the bastardsd be missed by anybody double barrel up the arse from fifty yards bam appealing notion archer ffitch was in a dark suit and tie and a pair of green wellies even though it was pretty dry underfoot for november not natural this weather was griffs view too much that was not natural hereabouts destroying this town mr archer every time they come theres always a few stays behind squatting in abandoned flats shagging each other behind the church nicking everything thats not nailed down and you say a word to em you gets all this freedomoftheindividual baloney scum quite quite archer with that bored hearditallbefore tone but griff knew hed have all archers attention in a minute by god he would and the permanent ones alternative society greenculture whats alternative bout pretending the twentieth century never bloody happened mustnt have a new road cause it means clipping a few crummy trees down cant have decent new housing cause it leaves us with one less bloody useless field i hear what youre saying archer nodding gravely like he was being interviewed on the box im appalled we lost a man like you from the council and i agree a few changes in this town are long overdue griff sniffed what they all say with respect your gaffer hes been spouting bout that for years my father no lad the mp sir larry archer went silent hed changed a lot gone into his thirties still lanky overgrown schoolboyish suddenly hed thickened up like his lordship jaw darker eyes steadier watch out here comes another pennard powerpack griff wished his own son was like this it pained him to think of the difference what have you heard archers heavy eyebrows all but meeting in the middle like a mantelshelf with the eyes smouldering away underneath griff smiled slyly not a well man our sir larry might be stepping down sooner than we thinks make way for someone more vigorous that be a suitable word radical might be a better one archer said cautiously in the thatcher sense of course ah griff gave his beard a thoughtful massage could be what the place needs depending mind on what this radical newcomer is offering to us in the er business community i understand archer was gazing past griff up the tor to where the tower was erected by the old monks back in the middle ages that tower to claim the hill for christ dedicated to st michael the dragonslayer to keep the bloody heathens out pity it hadnt worked cant see a soul up there archer said you are sure about this griff ah griff decided it was time to dump his manure and watch the steam got it a bit wrong when i phoned you look theyre not here yet all camped down in moulders bottom field clappedout ole buses and vans no tax no insurance usual unwashed rabble green hair rings through every orifice sounds enough like masstrespass for me archer pulled his mobile phone out of his inside pocket flipping it open ok right why dont i get this dealt with immediately yah invoke the act have the whole damn lot charged aye griff nodded slowly but charged what with the phone had played what sounded like the opening beeps of three blind mice before archers finger froze quivering with irritation griff leaned back against the gate and took his time rereading the national trust sign please avoid leaving litter lighting fires damaging trees bastards are legal mr archer in moulders field with moulders permission in short moulders been paid these vagrants have money one of em does young woman it was stumped up the readies so i hear one as even moulder figured he could trust griff leaned back against the gate gave his beard a good rub quite a distinctivelooking young lady they dsay spit it out man archer was going to have to deal with the tendency to impatience with the lower orders mps should be good listeners of should we say generous proportions and she dont talk like your usual hippy rabble archer was hard against the light solid and cold as the st michael tower what are you saying mr daniel looking a bit dangerous like he could handle himself same as his old man dont push it griff decided well all right its miss diane come rolling into town with the hippies in a white van big pink spots on it archer said nothing just loomed over him best part of a foot taller moisture on his thick lips now your little sister mr archer little jesus she must be pushing thirteen stone she come in with em and she rented em a campsite so they wouldnt get arrested dont ask me why if this is a joke mr daniel because my sisters up north aye about to get herself hitched except shes in moulders bottom field in a van with big pink spots no joke no mistake mr archer archer was as still as the old tower how many other people know about this only moulder fars i know who if any like action happens to be taken requests that he be kept out of it if you understand me no change of expression no inflexion in his voice archer said im grateful for this i wont forget well griff said long as we understands each other i think we want the same things for this town like getting it cleaned up proper shops stead of this new age rubbish cranks and longhairs out folk in decent clothes decent houses on decent estates built by like decent firms and of course the new road to get us on to the euro superhighway bring in some proper industry big firms executive housing archer nodding youre a sound thinker griff we all need a stake in the twentyfirst century oh and one other thing i want archer folded his arms and smiled i want my council seat back off that stringy little hippy git woolaston said griff archer patted the leather patch at the shoulder of griffs heavy tweed jacket lets discuss this further meanwhile i have a meeting tonight with a certain selection committee after which i may be in a better position to ah effect certain changes ah best o luck then mr archer thank you er archer looked away again dianes illness has caused us considerable distress its good to know she has chaps like you on her side and on yours archer griff daniel said naturally as archer drove off in his grey bmw griff looked to the top of the unnaturally steep hill glad to see there was still nobody up there no sightseers no joggers no kids and no alternative bastards with dowsing rods and similar crank tackle he hated the bloody tor not much over five hundred feet high when you worked it out only resembled some bloody green matterhorn look on account of most of the surrounding countryside was so flat having been under the sea way back so nothing to it not really but look it the trouble it caused bloody great millstone round this towns neck thousands of tourists fascinated by all that cobblers about pagan gods and intersecting lines of power if it wasnt for all that old balls thered be no new age travellers no hippy refugees running tatty shops no midsummer festival and women dancing around naked no religious nuts no ufospotters glastonbury tor in fact was a symbol of what was wrong with britain also the national trust bastards hadnt even given him the contract for installing the new pathway and steps griff daniel went back to his truck g daniel amp co builders it would maybe have said amp son if the socalled son hadnt disgraced the family name when it came down to it the only way you were going to get rid of the riftraff was by getting rid of the damn tor he imagined a whole convoy of jcbs gobbling into the tor like it was a walnut whip the hill giving way the tower collapsing into dusty medieval rubble all the way back to his yard on the edge of the industrial estate griff daniel kept thinking about this it wasnt possible of course not under any conceivable circumstances you couldnt say put the new road through it not with a scheduled ancient monument on top and also it was far too big a national tourist attraction but it did make you think three queen of the hippies it was a rather an antiquated bicycle a ladys model with no cross bar a leatherette saddle bag and a metal cover over the chain terribly sedate an elderly spinsters sort of machine ten quid from on your bike over at street but jim could get his feet to the pedals without adjusting the seat and more to the point it was the kind of bicycle no youngster would want to be seen dead on so at least he could park it in town with an oddson chance of it not being nicked jim unloaded himself from the bike outside burns the bread in the part of glastonbury high street where the alternative sector was rapidly chasing the few remaining locally owned shops up the hill he was puffing a bit and there was sweat on his forehead it was rather close and humid and november amazingly he pushed the bike across the pavement and into a narrow alleyway next to the bookshop called carey and frayne got out his handkerchief to wipe his face the alleyway framing a at little street scene from a viewpoint hed never noticed before quite a nice one because by god above the weathered redtiled roofs and brick chimney stacks of the shops across the street reared the spiked and buttressed norman tower of the town centre church st johns and it had suddenly struck jim that the towers top tier jagged in the florid lateafternoon sun resembled a crown of thorns while in the churchyard below out of sight from here there was one of the holy thorns grafted from the original on wearyall hill it was as if the thorn had worked its way into the very fabric of the church finally thrusting itself in savage symbolism from the battlements yes yes yes jim started to paint rapidly in his head reforming sculpted stone into pronged and twisted wildwood but keeping the same colours the pink and the ochre and the grey amid the elegiac embers of the dying sun by god this buggering town just when you thought you had it worked out it would throw a new image at you like a wellaimed brick jim was so knockedsideways he almost forgot to chain his bike to the drainpipe almost twenty feet away a youth sat in a dusty doorway fumbling a guitar jim gave him a hard look but he seemed harmless enough the ones with guitars usually were couldnt get up to much trouble with an instrument that size to lug around pennywhistlers now they were the ones you had to watch they could shove the things down their belts in a second leaving two hands free for thieving over the past eighteen months jim had had three bikes stolen two gone from the town centre one with the padlocked chain snipped and left in the gutter metal cutters by god thieves with metal cutters on the streets glastonbury jim youre painting no im not reacting instinctively for half his adult life painting had been something to deny bloody pat shrieking how many bills is that going to pay new bike i see the most beautiful woman in glastonbury bent over the bike stroking the handlebars really rather suits you you calling me an old woman jim pulled off his hat ill have you know my girl ive just ridden the buggering thing all the way back from street in the slipstream of a string of transcontinental juggernauts half the size of the qe bloody europe comes to somerset just be thankful that bikes are still allowed on that road come the new motorway youll be banned forever wont happen too much opposition oh sure like the government cares about the greens and the old ladies in straw hats she straightened up hands on her hips and a bloody fine pair of hips they were tea well or something jim followed her into the sorcerers library she called a bookshop he helped out here two or three days a week trying not to look too closely at what he was selling he glared suspiciously at one of those cardboard dumpbin things displaying a new paperback edition of the silly novels of glastonburys own dion fortune awful crass covers sinister hooded figures standing over stone altars and crucibles over the top the artwork tawdry way over the top isnt everything in glastonbury these days well you arent for a start jim thought he wondered whether something specific had happened to make juanita distance herself from the sometimesoverpowering spirituality of the town and from the books she sold you didnt run a shop like this unless you were of a strongly mystical persuasion but these days she answered customers questions lightly and without commitment as if she knew it was all nonsense really jim let her steer him into the little parlour behind the shop past the antiquarian section where the books were kept behind glass most of them heavy magical manuals from the nineteenth century jim had flicked one open the other week and found disturbingly detailed instructions for the creation of elemental spirits he suspected it didnt mean distilling your own whisky which reminded him erm that laphroaig you had dont suppose theres a minuscule drop left that rather depends how many minuscule drops youve had already juanita said cautiously damn woman knew him rather too well one swear to god called at a pub called the oak tree or something nerves shot to hell after a runin with a container lorry from bordeaux one small bells i swear it she looked dubious puckering her lovely nose in the lingering warmth of this years strange postindian summer she was wearing a lemon yellow off the shoulder thing showing all her freckles well as many of them as hed ever seen just that youre looking not exactly unflushed jim hmmph said jim he let juanita sit him down in an armchair planting a chunky tumbler in his drinking and painting hand she had quite a deep tan from sunning herself reading books on the balcony at the back while most women her age were going frantic about melanoma juanita snatched all the sun she could get must be the latin ancestry watching her uncork the laphroaig bottle with a rather suggestive thopp jim thought ten years ten years younger would do it ten years maybe fifteen and shed be at least within reach he coughed hoping nothing showed erm happened to cycle past don moulders bottom field on the way back guess bloody what new age travellers nothing gets past you does it jim held out his glass arrogant devils bloody thieving layabouts not quite all of them as she leaned over to pour his drink jim breathed in a delightful blend of ambre solaire and frank feminine sweat the mixture sensuously overlaid with the smoky peat musk of the whisky aaaaah the dubious pleasure of being sixtytwo years old unattached again and with all ones senses functioning more or less im sorry shaking himself out of it and feeling the old jowls wobble what did you just say i said at least one of them isnt a thief besides oddballs have always drifted towards glastonbury look at me look at you yes but juanita the essential difference here is that we saved up our hardearned pennies until we could do it in a respectable way we didnt just get an old bus from a scrapyard and enough fuel to trundle it halfway across the country before it breaks down and falls to pieces in some previously unsullied beauty spot you see what gets me is how these characters have the barefaced check because dianes with them to call themselves friends of the buggering planet when they what did you say jim had to steady the laphroaig with his other hand juanita poured herself a glass of probably overpriced white wine from lord pennards vineyard and lowered herself into a chintzy old rocking chair by the victorian fireplace there was a small woodstove tucked into the fireplace now unlit as yet but with a few autumn logs piled up ready for the first cold day jim said im sorry i dont quite understand you say dianes back diane s with them but i thought we all did which is juanita sighed i suppose why i got them the field jim was bewildered you got them the buggering field hed thought she was over all that might have been queen of the hippies but she was fully recovered now surely to god juanita said comes down to the old question if i dont try and help her who else is going to but i thought she was working in yorkshire the idea of diane training to be a journalist had struck jim as pretty unlikely at the time considering the girls renowned inability to separate fact from fantasy i thought she was getting married peter somebody patrick its off abandoned her job everything to become a new age buggering traveller not exactly as she put it she kind of hitched a lift they were making their way here and she juanita reached for her cigarettes oh dear she said it was calling her back jim groaned not again dare i ask what specifically was calling her back the tor juanita lit a cigarette what else jim was remembering that time the girl had gone missing and theyd found her just before dawn under the thorn on wearyall hill in her nightie and bare feet what was she then fifteen he sank the last of the laphroaig he was too old for this sort of caper lady loony he said do people still call her that four a fine shiver the ancient odour had drifted in as soon as diane wound down the van window and it was just so well she could have wept how could she have forgotten the scent the van had jolted between the rotting gateposts into don moulders bottom field it had bounced over grass still ever so parched from a long dry summer and spiky from the harvest diane had turned off the engine sat back in the lumpy seat closed her eyes and let it reach her through the open window the faraway fragrance of holy avalon actually she hadnt wound down the window as such just pulled out the folded rizlas packet which held the glass in place and let it judder to its favourite halfway position it was rather an old van a ford something or other used to be white all over but shed painted big silly pink spots on it so it wouldnt stand out from the rest of the convoy the smell made her happy and sad it was heavy with memories and was actually a blend of several scents the first of them autumn a brisk mustardy tang and then woodsmoke there always seemed to be woodsmoke in rural somerset much of it applewood which was rich and mellow and sweetened the air until you could almost taste it and over that came the most elusive ingredient the musk of mystery a scent which summoned visions of the abbey in the evening when the saddened stones grew in grace and sang to the sunset of windwhipped wearyall hill with the night gathering in the startled tangle of the holy thorn of the balmy serenity of the chalice well garden and of the great enigma of the west glastonbury tor diane opened her eyes and looked up at the huge green breast with its stone nipple she wasnt the only one all around people had been dropping out of vans and buses an ambulance a stock wagon gazing up at the holy hill no more than half a mile away journeys end for the pagan pilgrims and for diane ffitch who called herself molly fortune because she was embarrassed by her background confused about her reason for returning and rather afraid actually dusk was nibbling the fringes of don moulders bottom field when the last few vehicles crawled in they travelled in smaller groups nowadays because of the law an old post office van with a white pentacle on the bonnet was followed by morts famous soupedup hearse where he liked to make love on the long coffinshelf love is the law mort said love over death headlice and rozzie arrived next in the former bolton corporation single decker bus repainted in black and yellow stripes like a giant bee listen ive definitely been here before headlice jumped down grinning eerily through teeth like a broken picket fence he was about nineteen or twenty they were so awfully young most of these people at that age diane thought you could go around saying you were a confirmed pagan never giving a thought to what it really meant i mean you know not in this life obviously headlice said in a past life yeah looking up expectantly as though he thought mystic rays might sweep him away and carry him blissfully to the top of the holy hill hey you reckon i was a monk he felt at the back of his head where a monks tonsure would be headlice had a swastika tattoo reexposed because of the affliction which had led to his extremely severe haircut and his unfortunate nickname rozzie made a scoffing noise more like one of the friggin peasants what carted the stones up the hill shed told diane that the swastika was a relic of headlices days as some sort of a teenage neofascist neoskinhead headlice however pointed out that the original swastika was an ancient pagan solar symbol which was why hed had one tattooed on the part of him nearest the sun see he turned away and kicked at the grass his face had darkened he looked as if hed rather be kicking rozzie she was a londoner he was from the north she was about twentysix although they shared a bus and a bed she seemed to despise him awfully i couldve been a fuckin monk headlice said petulantly despite the democratic tribal code of the pilgrims he was obviously very conscious of his background which made diane feel jolly uncomfortable about hers shed been trying to come over sort of west country milkmaidish but she wasnt very good at it probably just sounded frightfully patronising or a bird she said perhaps you were a little bird nesting in the tower she felt sorry for headlice cute all im sayin is i feel i can feel it here punching his chest through the rip in his dirty denim jacket this is not bullshit mol diane smiled on her own first actual visit to the tor or it might have been a dream she couldnt have been more than about three or four thered been sort of candyfloss sunbeams rolling soft and golden down the steep slopes warm on her sandals she wished she could still hold that soft undemanding image for more than a second or two but she supposed it was only for children too grownup to feel it now also she felt too well mature at twentyseven to be entirely comfortable among the pilgrims although a few were ten or even twenty years older than she was and showed every line of it but even the older women tended to be fey and childlike and stickthin even the ones carelessly suckling babies stick thin how wonderful to be stickthin what it is headlice said i feel like im home what diane looked across to the tor with the church tower without a church on its summit oh no its not your home at all you re just passing through im the one whos home the implications made her feel faint she wobbled about wanting to climb back into the van submerge like a fat hippo in a swamp several times on the journey shed thought very seriously about dropping out of the convoy turning the van around and dashing back to patrick telling him it had all been a terrible terrible mistake and then shed seen the vinegar shaker on the high chip shop counter at lunchtime and a spear of light had struck it and turned it into a glistening glastonbury tor yes shed almost shrieked yes im coming back with company there must be over thirty pilgrims here now in a collection of vehicles as cheerful as an old fashioned circus at least it had been cheerful when shed joined the convoy on the north yorkshire moors that old army truck sprayed purple with big orange flowers the former ambulance with an enormous eye painted on each side panel shut on one side wide open on the other but several of the jollier vehicles seemed to have dropped out broken down probably well they were all frightfully old and fairly drab now except for dianes van and headlices beestriped bus morts hearse had slunk in next to the bus there was a mattress in the back mort had offered to demonstrate love over death to diane once shed gone all flustered but didnt want to seem uncool and said it was her period mort climbed out he wore a black leather jacket he punched the air yo headlice ok man tonight yeah yeah said headlice right mort wandered off down the field and began to urinate casually into a gorse bush to show off the size of his willy diane turned away despite the unseasonal warmth it had been a blustery day and the darkening sky bore obvious marks of violence the red sun like a bloodbubble in an open wound and the clouds either runny like pus or fluffy in a nasty way like the white stuff that grew on mould diane said tonight up there headlice nodded reverently at the tor where a low knifeedge cloud had taken the top off st michaels tower making it look diane thought trying to be prosaic trying not to succumb like nothing so much as a wellused lipstick sampler in boots but this was the terminus theyd travelled down from yorkshire collecting pilgrims en route until they hit the st michael line which focused and concentrated energy across the widest part of england they might have carried on to st michaels mount at the tip of cornwall but for pagans the tor was the holy of holies what are you we going to do diane pulled awkwardly at her flouncy skirt from the oxfam shop washedout midnight blue with silver halfmoons on it shit mol were pagans right we do what pagans do which means he dont know rozzie cackled her face was round but prematurely lined like a monkeys ropes of black beads hung down to her waist and you do yeah headlice said rozzie shrugged diane waited she didnt really know what pagans did either apart from revering the old gods and supporting the green party they would claim that christianity was an imported religion which was irrelevant to britain but what would they actually do i wouldnt wanna frighten you rozzie smirked and swung herself on to the bus from across the field came the hollow sound of bran the drummer doing what he did at every new campsite what hed done at every st michael church and prehistoric shrine along the line awakening the earth diane looked away from the tor feeling a trickle of trepidation she supposed thered be lights up there tonight whether it was just the bijou flickerings of torches and lanterns the oily glow of bonfires and campfires or the other kind the kind some people called ufos and some said were earthlights caused by geological conditions but diane thought these particular lights were too sort of personal to be either alien spacecraft or natural phenomena allied to seismic disturbance it was all a matter of afterglow not in the sky in your head in the very top of your head at first and then it would break up into airy fragments and some would lodge for a breathtaking moment in your throat before sprinkling through your body like a fine shiver bowermead hall you see was only three and a half miles from the town and when she was little the pointed hill crowned by the st michael tower the whole thing like a winefunnel or a witchs hat seemed to be part of every horizon always there beyond the vineyards dianes very earliest sequential memory was looking out of her bedroom window from the arms of nanny one and seeing a small globular light popping out of the distant tower like a coloured ball from a roman candle ever so pretty but nanny one of course had pretended she couldnt see a thing shed felt dianes forehead and grumbled about a temperature what had happened next wasnt too clear now but it probably involved a spoonful of something tasting absolutely frightful youre a very silly little girl too much imagination is not good for you for a long time diane had thought imagination must be a sort of icecream the lights too some as white as the creamy blobs they put in cornets years later when she was in her teens one of the psychologists had said to her you were having rather a rough time at home werent you diane i mean with your father and your brother you were feeling very lonely and perhaps unwanted unloved do you think that perhaps you were turning to the tor as a form of no diane had stamped her foot i saw those lights i did and now the tor had signalled to her across britain called her back but it wasnt diane thought of her father and her brother and that house stiff and unforgiving as the worst of her schools about pretty lights and candyfloss sunbeams not any more five a simple person unwrapping a creamy new beeswax candle verity laid it down with some trepidation on a stone window ledge the size of a gravestone still not sure not at all sure that she could go through with this it was late afternoon but even with all its hanging lights on the room was as deep and shadowed as the nave of an old parish church the bestknown old buildings in glastonbury apart from the abbey which was ruined so tragic were the onetime courthouse known as the tribunal and the george and pilgrims inn both in the high street both mellow and famously beautiful and then there was meadwell which was hunched among umbrella trees about a mile out of town to the east of the tor and was terribly terribly old but not famous not mellow and not what one would call beautiful rather like me thought verity who looked after meadwell for the pixhill trust and ran it as a sort of guesthouse most of the time she was decidedly not a sad or introspective or timid person but tonight was the night of the abbots dinner and as the sourly humid november day dwindled into evening she realised that her little cat stella had still not come home of course this was not the first time nor was stella the first cat to decide that despite the veritable army of mice it simply did not wish to live at meadwell but tonight being the night of the abbots dinner verity could not bear to be entirely alone because meadwell was so venerable grade two listed and starred little could be done to relieve the dispiriting gloom resulting from tiny mullioned windows which must never be enlarged oak panelling too delicate to disturb and enormous beams so oppressively low that even little verity was obliged to stoop a touch of whitewash between the beams might have lightened the atmosphere a little but there were sixteenthcentury builders marks to be protected also in two of the upstairs rooms without panelling repainting of the walls was forbidden because of what was described as elizabethan graffiti words names perhaps carved and burned into the sallow surface of veritys own presence here there was little evidence beyond on a shelf inside the inglenook a collection of novels by the great john cowper powys whose sensually extravagant prose was her secret vice and her refuge she considered it part of her role not to disturb the houses historic ambience to flit mouselike about the place most of the holiday guests elderly educated people retired doctors retired teachers friends of the trust said how much they absolutely loved the house with its tremendous character in summer but even high summer entered meadwell with uncharacteristic caution pale sunbeams edging nervously around the oaken doors like the servants of a despot and it was getting darker it was not simply because of the time of year the house itself was gathering shadows its beams blackening its walls going grey like old sick skin its deeper corners becoming welllike and impenetrable it was as if only the colonel had been able to keep the shadows at bay and now the fabric of meadwell was darkening around her as if hung with mourning drapes and in spite of her faith she was beginning to be afraid but i do not see verity does not see it had become like a mantra and after all these years in glastonbury and attendance at hundreds of esoteric lectures at the assembly rooms there was very little one could tell verity about mantras i do not see whispering it as she opened the door of the oak cupboard in the corner to the left of the great inglenook and took down the silver candlestick it should have been cleaned and polished this morning but shed been putting it off ever since the upsetting telephone call from major shepherd awfully sorry my dear most awfully sorry his wheeze had been like an oldfashioned vacuumcleaner starting up the bag inflating verity had told him in her bright singing way not to worry in the slightest just look after himself drink plenty of water keep warm leave everything to her not expecting for one moment that the abbots dinner would be able to proceed without the chairman of the trust without in fact any guests at all only verity who would prepare the meal and and the abbot whom she did not see this day was almost invariably a dull day subdued when the late colonel pixhill was here it was the one day of the year on which he was never seen to smile he would mope about the garden gathering the first dismal crop of dead leaves pausing occasionally to sniff thoughtfully at the air like an old english setter on this day nearly twenty years ago the colonel had come into her kitchen put a sad hand on her shoulder and solemnly thanked her for all her years of service saying sincerely that he didnt know how he would have managed here without her it had occurred to verity later with a shiver of sorrow and unease that he must have sniffed his own death that morning on the bitter wind coming down from the tor dont think of it verily pursed her lips straightened up and glared defiantly into the gathering dark of the dining hall at least at least i although apparently it had been the most essential qualification for a mistress of meadwell at her initial interview some thirty years ago the colonel had broached the issue delicately but with persistence quite an old place this miss endicott damned old damned cold bit grim really lot of ladies would find that offputting i suppose they would might be how shall i put it a trifle timid about living here if they were left alone yes but not you think about it before you answer wind howling timbers creaking sort of stuff you mean they might be afraid of spiritmanifestation colonel well hmm that sort of thing i i am not privileged to see the dead i see consider it a privilege would you if you could see the damn things no i i suppose im rather a superficial person that is i believe in god and have an interest in the spiritual as as a force for healing and therefore i should dearly love to live in glastonbury but i dont think it necessary or desirable for us all to have communion if we believe then that is enough and if we do not wish to see god will respect that i am not afraid of old places i try to be a simple person i get on with what i have to do and i i do not see each year shed polished the candlestick and laid the table for the abbots dinner as if it was just another evening meal after the colonels death shed imagined and rather hoped that the dinner would be discontinued however under the direction of the pixhill trust it had become even more of an occasion now also as a memorial for colonel pixhill it was said major shepherd one of the most important of the colonels conditions for ten years or so the dinner had been well attended by members of the trust two or three of them even staying on for a few days afterwards this had pleased verity who found life in general rather dreary when the holiday season was over and mrs green the cook and tracy the maid had disappeared for the winter but as age and infirmity eroded the trust fewer and fewer chairs had been required around the dining table most of the original trustees had been after all the colonels contemporaries fellow officers and associates the new younger ones including the colonels son oliver were apparently less concerned with the more eccentric traditions and indeed were keen to modernise the administration of the trust major shepherd had been adamant that the abbots dinner must not be allowed to lapse even when last year he and verity had found themselves alone at the huge table the silver candlestick between them the major speaking the words he claimed not to understand and now it had come to this my dear none of us is getting any younger the major had admitted on the telephone this morning except perhaps for you verity she could imagine the tired twinkle in his faded grey eyes you never seem to change which she decided to take as a compliment to her vegan lifestyle and her beloved bach flower remedies i shall be seventy next year major but shed thought it a timely moment to remind him i have absolutely no notion of retirement you understand i wouldnt know where to put myself perish the thought and hed gone on somewhat hesitantly to raise the question of the abbots dinner which she was convinced would have to be abandoned i do realise my dear you must have been finding it increasingly something of a trial and perhaps a little well sinister oh no major oh yes major sadly so obviously i wouldnt dream of asking you to go through the whole ceremony on your own tonight verity had been so relieved that she had had to cover the mouthpiece to muffle her sigh she would go out tonight in the absence of a scheduled cauldron meeting she could perhaps invite herself to dame wandas charming townhouse for the evening or see if there was an interesting talk at the assembly rooms or even a potentially tedious talk there would at least be people there and tea to share but perhaps major shepherd had said at the end of a particularly painful wheeze i could prevail upon you oh that is you dont have to prevail major veritys brightness had begun to dissipate to light the abbots candle oh and perhaps verity had closed her eyes short prayer i im so sorry verity well be there with you in spirit george pixhill too im sure in spirit yes i do not now she brought out the silver polish laid an oilcloth over the long oak dining table and began to work on the candlestick her throat was parched her chest tight but she had her duty she polished and polished until the candlestick shone in the dark air like the moon the abbot was used to fine things it would be four hundred and fifty six years since he was hanged on the tor six the weirdest person here it knows were coming headlice was aglow with the excitement of being a pagan at what he said was the greatest pagan temple in britain look at it it knows man the tor was temporarily free of cloud but losing definition in the darkening sky you could no longer make out the ridges which ringed the hill and were supposed to be the remains of a prehistoric ritual maze it did look ever so mysterious now with not a house in sight and no other visible hills diane too felt herself wanting to go up but on her own she didnt care to be part of a socalled pagan ritual theyd come a long way for this things could get rather well orgiastic once shed said to headlice why did you want to be a pagan what does it mean to you headlice had mumbled something about his childhood near manchester being made to go to church and all the hypocritical bastards in their sunday suits and the women in their stupid hats how hed grown up despising christianity as a meaningless social ritual headlice said the difference with the old gods was that they had balls but what will we actually do when we get there headlice shrugged all down to gwyn everything seemed to be down to gwyn gwyn the shaman she hadnt seen him since their arrival he had his own van very dirty on the outside but newer than the rest he kept himself apart from the others even the travellers it seemed had their aristocracy and gwyn was the adept the man with the knowledge since hed joined the convoy in east anglia the mood had been somehow less frivolous some people had even left aw headlice said at last most likely well just light a fire take our clothes off you know under the shining goddess of the moon let the energy flow through us and like see what develops oh gosh dont like the sound of that er she hesitated you know youre not allowed to do that i mean light fires its national trust property not a very molly thing to say headlice stared at her and started to laugh that means it belongs to the people you daft bat a naked toddler sprang up giggling from the grass bottom smeared with her own faeces diane tried not to notice she looked away across moulders field with its new covering of beatenup vehicles painted with wild spraycolours it was supposed to have all the spontaneity of a medieval country fayre but it looked sad and dingy like a derelict urban scrapyard headlice said be fuckin great the tower poked the streaky sky a stubby cigar waiting to be lit wont be no bother about fires mol whos gonna try and stop us another kind of unease was forming around her like a thermal glow to headlice paganism with its loose talk of old gods and old ways was just a sort of alternative social ritual but glastonbury tor was not the place for play acting she saw don moulder leaning over his gate watching them he was waiting for his money and keep it to yourself mr moulder about me i mean i wont say another word miss diane don moulders currant eyes were pressed into a face like a slab of red cheddar don was a sort of bornagain christian with jesus stickers on the back window of his tractor it meant he never quite lied so hed probably told someone already three hundred and fifty pounds changed hands this left less than two hundred in the pocket sewn inside dianes oxfam moonskirt the travellers didnt know she was paying for the land it would have been against their code they thought don moulder was mollys uncle he raised an eyebrow at that and then said hippies dumping the word like a trailerload of slurry gonner be pretty bloody popular aint i lettin the hippies on my land what im sayin is im not sure three hundred covers it all the goodwill im losin look don moulder held all the cards it cost her an extra fifty when shed first encountered them the travellers had been camping up on the moor illegally but there werent enough of them to quality for instant arrest under the act the news editor an awful inverted snob who thought that overfed uppercrust diane needed exposure to the lower strata of society had sent her to do a story on them hoping no doubt that they would refuse to talk to her and shed come back with her tail between her legs and he could smirk determined that this would not happen diane had toned down her accent adding a little somerset burr which she thought at the time was rather good actually shed even passed their very obvious test accepting a mug of tea made from brown water scooped from a ditch this certainly broke the ice with headlice hed begun to tell her things despite rozzies attempts to shut him up you print what you like luv were not stoppin here anyroad where are you going next then leave it headlice shes only trying to home luv our spiritual home its a pilgrimage along the pagan way shut it shithead to the sacred isle of avalon know where that is diane had gone weak it was another sign like a magic carpet unrolling at her feet and the carpet went diagonally through the spine of england all the way back to glastonbury shed felt almost sick with a combination of longing and dread still holding the tin mug between her hands to stop the shaking shed heard herself say may i come with you she didnt even remember deciding to say it the question just popped out as strange and spontaneous as a light over the tor i could you know write about it for the paper what its really like what youre trying to do all the hassle you get and the abuse would that be possible and shed told them her name was molly fortune and she came from somerset and her accent went even fuzzier in a complete daze over the following two days she had drawn all she had out of the bank paid for the bus and spent half an hour spraying pink blobs on the side absolute madness her father would have paled into one of his thin rages in her fathers somerset new age travellers were the worst kind of vermin the kind you werent allowed shoot for wealthy handsome patrick fortuitously away at the time on an editors conference embarrassment would be the worst of it embarrassment tinged perhaps with a certain relief he was very goodlooking slim two years younger than she but he had affection for her he would have been faithful perhaps diane had sealed up her beautiful antique diamond ring in a registered envelope and posted it to patrick with a letter full of babbling incoherence sorry i just cant im so sorry patrick its out of my hands ill write properly soon please dont hate me it had been just a week before the widely publicised engagement party at the biggest hotel in harrogate the worst of it for diane was that in spite of everything in spite of patricks being virtually the chosen suitor she could have loved him probably but something so far inside that she couldnt reach it loved glastonbury more so we start going up now and we wait quietly mort had with him his new floozie a slinky little redhead with a muted germanic accent who seemed to be called viper she was wearing a loose white shift and morts hand was up one of the sleeves carelessly cupping a breast mort had dark swarthy skin high cheekbones his hair was pulled back into a tight braid he looked like he ought to be wearing a broadsword at his belt aint a piece of street theatre it was as if hed picked up on dianes thoughts about playacting this is the real thing the real place the place whats with this quietness shit headlice demanded were goin to our church we dont have to hide it mort sighed this is your first time init headlice theres people dont like us being here we dont want no stonehenge situation even to diane this seemed a little overcautious stonehenge was a restricted area and the tor was not and this was the middle of november not midsummers eve also we dont want local kids tagging along so we go up in small groups headlice was right this wasnt how it had been paganism was not against the law and the whole ethos of the new age travellers was a kind of defiant exhibitionism why else have purple hair liprings nipple rings and luminous pentacles on the sides of your bus the vehicles in don moulders bottom field were now in rough concentric circles the night beginning to join them together like walls it was strangely silent no ghettoblasters blasting no children squealing idea being that were up there by nightfall mort said and no lights you and roz first ok ill show you the path no problem headlice said mols been up loads of times mol aint coming morts voice had tightened like his hair hed taken his hand out of vipers sleeve headlice stared at him huh mort turned to diane dont take this wrong we got nothing against you molly fortune but we aint forgotten youre a reporter and gwyn dont conduct rituals for the press sorry you got to be fuckin kiddin man headlice was furious that goes against everything were up for like were a frickin secret society now i mean come on whats paganism about man if you like worship the sun and the moon and natural stuff you do it in the open diane wanted to tell him to calm down it didnt matter it wasnt right for her to be part of a pagan ceremony certainly not the kind headlice envisaged but he straightened up absurdly like a little war veteran listen im proud of what i am me he prodded mort in the chest i worship the earth yeah and that hills not private land so if nobody can stop us goin up what right got to tell mol she cant come morts face had darkened he snatched headlices prodding forefinger bent it slowly back headlice went white mort forced him to his knees towered over him this is religion headlice mort said its between us there was a slight crack from headlices finger and the gods mort said you fuckin headlice shoved his hand between his thighs youve broken it i dont think so oh look diane thought she must be as pale as headlice you go to be quite honest inspiration came she produced a hopeless sigh its a pretty stiff climb and im not built sometimes i get sort of out of breath you know rozzie twirled her black beads and dropped a tilted grin that was sort of stupid fat cow why didnt you say so in the first place ill mind the camp diane said see the kids are ok thank you mort said quietly he turned and walked down the field his woman clinging to his arm when hed gone diane felt distinctly uncomfortable a real journalist would have protested been absolutely determined to go up the tor with them whos that twat think he is headlice struggled to his feet we got a fuckin hierarchy now its you know its all right really i didnt want to cause any i mean its not the same at night anyway you cant see the view and it gets very cold what you sayin here mol diane rubbed her goosepimpled arms i dont know dont you she saw that headlice was confused almost to the point of tears im fed up wi this everybody treating me like a fuckin dickhead and you staring at her resentfully wi your fancy accent slippin through youre a bit deep mol you come on like fat and harmless i reckon youre weirder than all of us i reckon youre the weirdest person here diane was silent biting her lip seven sliver of light increasingly the dusk obsessed jim battle he supposed it was due to his time of life slipping away as everyone must into the mauve and the sepia but still it was endlessly challenging midges for instance how were you supposed to paint midges in clouds perhaps a thickening of the air or just a dry stipple dry stipple jim said aloud one of those phrases that sounded like what it meant there was a word for that buggered if he could remember what it was with a thumb he smudged the sun in the finished painting it would be merely a hazy memory a ghost on the canvas same with the tor you should be able to feel it in the picture but not necessarily see it jim stepped away from the canvas the tangled garden by now was all blues and greys and dark browns as there were no lights on in the cottage jim could barely see the canvas time to stop time to wind up the great quest for another day still for once time was playing on his side staying the dead hand of winter letting him go on painting outdoors into the early evening using the very last of the light for this was when things happened often when he looked at the picture next morning hed find that the absence of direct light had wrought some marvellous effects textures hed never have found if hed been able to see properly all a matter of surrendering to the dusk and beyond the dusk lay the grail of course everyone came to avalon in search of the grail and it was different for all of them there was always the possibility of an actual holy relic somewhere but for most people the grail was simply the golden core of whatever you dreamed you might achieve the vanishing point on lifes horizon glastonbury being one of those spots on the earths surface where the phantasmal became almost tangible where you might actually reach the vanishing point before you er vanished jims personal grail the mystical formula which would he hoped come to define a battle painting was to be round at the very end of dusk the cusp of the day the moment between evening and night when the world stopped it should happen at dawn too but it didnt for jim hed walked out in the drizzle and the dew to wait in vain the moment never came or he could not feel it time of life again at his age perhaps you were just not meant to feel the stopping of the world at dawn not that he greatly wished for youth only to have come to avalon as a younger man wasnt as if he hadnt known then what he wanted to do plenty of time for painting bloody pat had bleated when youve got your pension god why do we listen to them if hed left his wife and met juanita twenty years ago when she was a very young woman and he didnt seem so much of an older man well he hadnt it was enough of a privilege that she was his friend that he could bathe in her aura jim left the canvas wedged into the easel and manhandled the whole painting to the house he propped it against the open door and turned to accept the night the cottage was tiny but satisfyingly isolated reached by a track too narrow for a car ten years ago although his worldly goods were few the removal men had been less than euphoric but jim still was much of the time especially when the sun had gone leaving its ghost to haunt the lush sloping grass in the foothills of glastonbury tor behind the cottage was a wooded hillside which was always immediately activated by the dying sun he could almost feel it starting to tremble with the stirring and scufflings and rustlings of badgers and rabbits and foxes and owls before him the dark brown fields rolled away into the tide of mist on the slopes of the tor and the cottage snuggled into the huge ash tree which overhung it as if its only protection against the night was to become part of this great organism the way that jim himself wanted to go into the final night to be absorbed become part of the greater organism even if it was only as fertiliser he grunted startled two extra shadows were creeping along the hedgerow headlice saw the little tubby guy in his garden with his red face and his tweed hat what a waste eh people like that could go and live in nice suburban culdesacs and leave the power places for them that could still feel the electricity he dragged rozzie into the shadow of the hedge ow she screeched friggin thorns thorns round here are sacred headlice told her that joseph of whatsit when he landed and planted his stick it turned into a thorn tree right thats christian its still earth magic headlice gazed up towards the tor very big now almost scary in the flatlands one side of the tower sucking the very last red bit out of the sky the other side the one closest to them sootyblack he was glad theyd been sent first to find their own way through the tangled undergrowth to the tor this was how a pilgrimage ought to end except he wished it wasnt rozzie a fragile half moon had risen in a thin mist above the holy hills eastern flank fuckin magic int it you aint seen nuffin yet rozzie smiled secretively stop a minute willya ive done me friggin ankle headlice gritted his teeth been better off bringing molly least she knows the country yeah rozzie said and you could shag her afterwards right headlice said nothing what you had in mind aint it rozzie said youre a transparent little sod ok so maybe he did wish it was mol he was with sure she was fat fatish but she was nicelooking open when rozzie was closedup despite and hed always known this her not being what she made out plus she smelled nice when they crossed the lane only a hedge between them and where the ground started to rise headlice wanted to climb over and scramble up but rozzie said theyd better find the gate mort had told them to use when they reached it they could see a glowing path of concrete chippings and stuff had been put in with steps all the way to the top it looked like for the tourists sacrilege there was a collecting box inviting visitors to contribute towards tor maintenance oh yeah like patching up the concrete path balls to that and then there was a national trust notice board for the thicko tourists headlice started to read it anyway striking a match and holding it close to the print tor is a west country word of celtic origin meaning a hill glastonbury tor is a natural formation composed of layers of clay and blue limestone capped by a mass of hard erosionresistant sandstone how do they know that anyway it was almost too dark to make out the print how do they know its a natural formation whats it matter rozzie said because it couldve been built here you daft bat by the ancient shamans like the pyramids according to the lines of force and the position of the heavens the tor is and has been to many people a place of magic the focus of legend and superstition one local story is that there is a hollow space inside another perhaps very ancient that the hill has a secret entrance to the underworld headlice felt sick to his gut to see it spelled out like this baby talk for every icelolly sucking daytripper he wanted to rip down the board smash the collecting box hack up the concrete path then the tor would be a secret place again a place for pilgrims he turned away needing to put this tourist shit behind him come on pulling at rozzie get your mits off wanna read this last bit the tor was the scene of the hanging drawing and quartering of richard whiting the last abbot of glastonbury when henry viii dissolved the abbey in heavy rozzie said yeah shit headlice dropped the match as it burned down to his fingers i didnt know about that he looked up to where night had fused the hill and the tower into a single dark lump still he walked off along the shining path maybe the old git had it coming alone for the first time since shed joined the convoy diane sat in headlices bus a woollen shawl around her shoulders and unwrapped a peppermint flavoured carob bar she was sitting on one of the original vinylcovered bus seats still bolted to the floor the bus windows were purpled by a november night as soft and luminous as june so this was it breathing space over she was back what happens now part of her wanted to take her van and leave quietly drive to juanitas shed really missed juanita the older sister shed never had she really ought to explain but what on earth could she say juanita might run a new age bookshop but she could be rather disparaging about peoples visions i was dreaming every night about the tor vivid colours common homesickness youll get over it kept seeing things sort of metamorphose into the tor salt and vinegar shakers in cafes plastic bottles of toilet cleaner and flashing images of it when i closed my eyes hyperactive imagination next stopping at traffic lights behind lorries owned by glastonbury firms or houses called avalon oh really and sometimes id wake up in the middle of the night sensing her near me in the room oh god not the third nanny youre nuts diane she began to rock backwards and forwards holding herself tight in the shawl oh god oh god what am i doing here two weeks ago patrick had shown her pictures of his familys villa in chianti country wonderful place for a honeymoon lovely place decent man oh god a shadow passed the window then another she sat very still for a moment theyd all gone shed watched them mort and viper the last to go she heard a giggle and a hiss kids there were three or four children in a converted ambulance at the other end of the field in the care of a sullen teenager called hecate a large girl who claimed to be sixteen but was probably younger thered been quite a few babies in the convoy when it first set off but by the time they reached the beginning of the st michael line at bury st edmunds they all seemed to have gone along with their parents and the dogs none of the remaining travellers seemed to have dogs with them she was sure thered been a few before when they were on their way down from yorkshire and musicians two guitarists and a flute player now there was only bran the dour shamanic drummer and there used to be lots of ghetto blasters endless rock music old rolling stones albums and oasis and the lemonheads deep into the night and the children were used to it and slept through it all the hiss came again diane got up and went out to the platform whats going on it didnt stop she stepped off the platform and found herself looking into the shadowed face of the girl called hecate whats your problem hecate said what are you doing there were four small shadows moving about children who were surely old enough to be at school they were hovering around the bus making hissing sounds hey diane realised what was happening they all had big aerosol sprays it was almost dark but she could see that several of the yellow stripes on the buss beepanelled panels had already vanished stop that you little horrors headlicell go mad the children carried on spraying the bus black didnt even look round in the neardark there was something unearthly about them they were like silent gnomes diane turned back to the older girl cant you stop them why dont you mind your own bleeding business hecate said you nosy fat slag how dare diane calmed down remembered to put on the somerset thats jolly nice i must say look hecate said headlice told us to do it right good enough i dont believe you i dont give a fart what you believe hecate put her face very close to dianes her teeth were thick and yellow and her breath smelled putrid now get back on the bus crawl into a corner and mind your own else when theyve finished im gonna hold you down while they spray your fanny black that good enough no getting round it jim was shaken i dont think so im pretty sure i didnt see her although juanita said jim is there something wrong with this line jim coughed realising hed been almost whispering down the phone whispering in his own buggering house and with the lights out so no one could see him standing by the window thing is he drank some whisky and then put the glass on the windowsill pushing it behind the curtain as though she could see how full it was it was very nearly dark when the last ones went past but id gone down to the end of the garden by then to get as close as possible to the path standing behind a sycamore tree with plenty of leaves still on it holding his breath as they went past hiding in his own buggering garden i mean they tend to be pretty skeletal dont they these travelling types so unless shes lost a few stone bloody angry with himself for feeling threatened but it was the first time in seventeen years of living here that his sacred space had been penetrated so blatantly by so many people and such bloody purposeful people you could have asked one of them where she was juanita said i suppose i could but i its strange but i didnt like to speak to them you know what these characters are normally like either drugged up to the eyeballs or laughing and swigging cider and what have you like day trippers yes i know not these buggers couldve been the sas on night manoeuvres or something quite well unearthly i suppose in fact if it hadnt been for the way they were dressed and the glint of the rings in the ears idve i dont know they were just so quiet not a buggering word between them and youre looking at what over a hundred of them yes i suppose i could quite easily have missed diane there was a moments silence i dont like the sound of this jim thats why i called you do you think i should phone the police in street what and have the camp raided and diane herded into a black maria no lets play it by ear ill get the car pick you up at the bottom of your track in about ten minutes right ho jim said relieved just just be careful dont stop for anybody jim yes you sound scared oh no no just out of breath diane stood on the deck of the bus nervously nibbling another carob bar it was quiet again now the strange children had finished spraying the bus and gone was it supposed to be a joke she was ashamed at having let the girl menace her like that the air was cooling she drew her woollen shawl across her lower arms dragged it tight around her arms folded in the wool she sat down in one of the slimy vinyl seats shed wait about an hour and then creep quietly away to the van drive up to don moulders farm and then down wellhouse lane into the town all the buses and vans were still as wooden huts and drained of their colours it could have been a scene from centuries ago the circle of vehicles which might just as well be carts looked almost romantically tribal when their squalid aspects were submerged in shadows when shed joined the convoy it was all so noisy and jolly with a real sense of community it was a kind of fun paganism more concerned with stone circles and earth forces and leylines and spreading good vibes they were like a travelling circus and yes you really could imagine a new spirit of freedom being born and nurtured in an encampment of latterday gypsies dismissed by just about everybody as a bunch of dirty scavengers there really had been a glimmer of ancient light here the smell on the bus was of sweat grease and oil with an underlying cannabis sweetness a misty wafer of moon rose in the grimy glass this was the only ancient light now and yet as the thought passed through her mind there was another glimmer some yards away diane froze and then very quietly stood up and peered through the window into don moulders field the tor half a mile away was still visible the tower entwined in strands of moontouched cloud a tall figure was gazing over the fields towards the sacred hill gwyn the shaman he was still here he must be waiting until they were all in position on the tor before making his ceremonial entrance the shaman was the tribal witch doctor the man who interceded with the spirits bearded gwyn with his aloofness and his whispered prophecies seemed disturbingly like the real thing it was when gwyn had joined that the atmosphere had begun to change the gradual shedding of the happier noisier more casual pilgrims leaving the quieter more committed ones and diane and headlice she held her breath moved back a little from the window she could see that gwyn wore a robe or a long overcoat his arm the one nearest to her was reaching up into the mist his hand his hand was curled around one end of the spectral sickly moon diane gasped gwyn stood tall and still a god with the moon in his hand or so it seemed until with a feeling of deep dread she became aware that the wan glimmer was from the blade of a real sickle gwyn lowered the blade in a slow and ceremonial fashion she watched the curved sliver of light swinging by his side as he strode across the field towards the tor eight only in glastonbury towers everywhere in glastonbury you were overlooked by towers juanita hurried across high street as an established tradesperson she was permitted a reserved space on the central car park below the fortified norman tower of st johns like st michaels on the tor over half a mile away the towns principal church had its own colour chart of moods in the sunshine of late afternoon it could be mellow sometimes almost golden with its fourcornered gothic crown but on a dull day it faded to grey and was outshone by the rustyred tiles on the roofs of the shops and houses packed around it and at night it brooded behind its walls and railings when you looked up you could no longer make out the four crosses supporting the weather vanes on the highest pinnacles and there was not that sense of the sacred which glastonbury abbey always seemed to retain in its ruins day or night there was also a sort of concrete walled apron where groups of young pilgrims gathered to smoke or chant to bongos and tablas which seemed fairly innocent during the day but could be rather menacing after dark it was also a good place to get yourself mugged so juanita very nearly screamed when a shadow moved oh my dear im so sorry did i scare you not at all juanita put a hand to her chest and swallowed jesus verity the little woman wore a quilted body warmer and elflike velvet hat she carried a shopping bag even though almost nothing was open nothing will happen to you here juanita its a very warm and spiritual spot and so egalitarian and the young people know that and they neither threaten us nor feel threatened right juanita said uncertainly sometimes you wandered into the church itself and it would be full of young new age types of indeterminate religion hugging each other and smiling at everyone and ok nobody had actually been mugged in the area recently except of course by verity who prowled the streets like a small cat because she was lonely when the tourist season was over and there was nobody to stay with her well im just going to pick up jim battle juanita explained because verity would keep you talking here for bloody ever it was rather sad really this middleclass new age bag lady going to the pub i must go too juanita verity said surprisingly and actually hefted her shopping bag and half turned but then she dropped the bait neatly behind her i cant put it off forever oh god put what off verity juanita was trying not sound overpatient silly of me i know but its the abbots night you see ab oh whiting juanita didnt want to hear this at all some thoughts were just too damned creepy to carry around with you through darkened streets poor man verity said he comes for comfort and theres nothing we can do theyll still hang him tomorrow juanita shuddered couldnt help it when you knew the circumstances it wasnt very funny verity managed meadwell glastonburys gloomiest guest house abbot whiting was said to have spent his last night there before he was executed in the kings name and then they took the abbey apart and avalons dark age began every year the pixhill trust held a formal dinner in the abbots honour i wonder verity said wistfully if he will ever be at peace well who knows verity but theres not a lot you can do about it is there look i have to people say that when there is spiritual unity in the town again when the christians and the pagans come together in harmony verity juanita said gently old whiting was a benedictine monk with no documented pagan leanings but he was a catholic my dear therefore a follower of the goddess mary in destroying the abbeys henry viii was yeah i know it was a sexist maledomination trip propaganda from the cauldron the towns fastestgrowing goddess group it was almost a newage womens institute these days with even people like verity going to the outer circle meetings and lectures and fashionable since the arrival of the actress dame wanda carlisle who was apparently discovering the goddess in herself they kept urging juanita to join but it seemed to have an underlying political agenda anyway the idea of an outfit led by someone calling herself ceridwen after the celtic harridan goddess you want to be careful there verity that womans on a powertrip verity smiled nervously although juanita saw only the gleam of her tiny teeth she could imagine all the cracks in the walnut face of someone who seemed to have been born to be sixty and sprightly verity surely was no latent pagan she could be observed every sunday toddling along to both morning and evening services at st johns power verity said yes the power to heal and to help people find their way the church is embracing spiritual healing again the bishop is talking to the alternative worshippers glastonbury is becoming whole again so they say do they juanita was slightly incredulous jesus if we could help the abbot find eternal peace after nearly five centuries wouldnt that be wonderful terrific but if i were you i think id just go to sleep and try not to think about it oh no its my duty to receive the abbot who thank god i do not see yes well juanita eased herself away just you look after yourself verity she was glad when shed crossed the shadowed car park and was safely behind the wheel of the volvo if verity was a little unravelled she was at least in the right place for it dear god juanita thought i used to revel in all this the excitement of it a spiritual las vegas the thrill of metaphysical stakes a lot had changed or maybe it was just her her agitation threshold had lowered for a start she worried about growing old alone about the business about whether selling mystical books was a good and worthy profession any more in a town where mysticism had become a tourist commodity about jim battle who ate and drank unwisely and what would happen if he ever collapsed with a heart attack over his easel in a little cottage even hansel and gretel wouldnt have discovered about whether this fourteenyearold car would start come on the volvo did though without much enthusiasm and juanita was able to get into some serious worrying about diane dotty confused mixedup thats all thats all she edged past the rear entrance of the george and pilgrims and round into high street followed all the way by lord pennards voice down a telephone nearly ten years ago a cold voice a voice honed by gillette you mrs carey i hold you entirely responsible no she wasnt having that this town was a positive bazaar of the mystical if it hadnt been carey and frayne it would have been some other bookshop diane had looked so utterly forlorn shuffling in that first day another teenage waif appealing for a holiday job if you could have fat waifs what was she supposed to say be gone with you you overprivileged hussy you didnt know she was maladjusted dont tell me you close your ears to the local gossip mrs carey juanita drove past the venerable facade of the george and pilgrims where modern pilgrims with gucci luggage slept in rooms with fourpostered beds and sloping walls sometimes she drank at the pilgrims with jim and the others amusing themselves by embellishing the glastonbury legends for earnest german tourists telling them a clear ufo sighting over the tor was virtually guaranteed at just before four am on every second sunday especially in winter as it happened juanita had never actually seen a ufo which was a pretty shameful admission in glastonbury diane of course claimed shed always seen balls of light in the sky over the tor didnt everybody see them and the gossips said its in the genes isnt it always a danger with the upper classes interbreeding youll always get one like that every couple of generations and they watched her padding down the street lord pennards strange daughter and they called her lady loony it was admittedly at the carey and frayne bookshop that diane had discovered the works of dion fortune the greatest woman magician of all time oh juanita im so excited dion fortune diane ffitch same initials dianes nose in a book munching healthy snacks nobody should get fat for gods sake on quorn and tofu and carob covered cereal bars shed have found those books anyway sooner or later in glastonbury the nutters mecca where gateways to altered states seemed as close as the nearest bus stop where on nights like this you could almost see the subtle merging of the layers the way you could in jims paintings further up the street only one shop was fully lit holy thorn ceramics owned by thirtyish newcomers anthony and domini dorrelladams the lights were on because the dorrelladamses were reorganising their window and jesus juanita said tony and domini were together in the window in fact it was hard to imagine how they could be more together while fully clothed and standing up domini arching backwards and you could almost hear the moans only in glastonbury juanita tried to smile accelerated away to the top of the high street it could be a hell of an aphrodisiac this town well at first anyway turning into lambrook street she was ambushed by misty moments from twentyodd years ago when shed left nigel carey sad junkie dead now and she and danny frayne had opened the shop with about two hundred books mostly secondhand and a lot of posters danny was in publishing now back in london and while it still said carey and frayne over the shop and they still occasionally exchanged daringly intimate letters on business notepaper and now and then had dinner and whatnot in london danny once bitten never came back to glastonbury headlights on fullbeam juanita drove the volvo off left into secretive treehung wellhouse lane official gateway to the tor impressionable that was diane curiously innocent perhaps deluded thats all but if he found she was with the new age travellers her father would what have her committed juanita was convinced hed tried something like that once jim was right lord pennard was not a terribly nice man it was very dark juanita drove carefully up the narrowing road scene of many a nearcollision and took a narrow right scraping the hedge where the tor should be visible there was a night mist like a wall the lane swooped steeply into a tunnel of trees and at the end of it juanita swung sharp left into a mudpacked track until the car could go no farther the great ash tree leapt up indignantly as if rudely awoken by the volvos headlights she got out jim a little chillier than of late and itd be quite cold on the tor pulling on her coat juanita very nearly screamed when hand patted her shoulder my my jim grinned like a halloween pumpkin behind his lamp we are being traditional tonight say what you like about the afghan juanita pushed her hair inside the sheepskin but its damned warm help me reverse jim also was dressed for action in his hat and scarf and overcoat he looked like something from the wind in the willows mole or ratty with toads physique however and probably just as hopeless but without jim battle thered be nobody quite sane enough to turn to in this kind of crisis leave the car here juanita better off walking take us about twenty minutes the old feet can virtually find their own way after all this time you sound a good deal more cheerful than you did on the phone thats because i havent been out with you at night for a good while she felt his smile yes well unfortunately we wont have time for a candlelit dinner ive got a bar of chocolate well have it to celebrate afterwards how are we going to handle this jim bloody hell i thought you were supposed to be in charge suppose theres some sort of orgy going on up there wouldnt be the first time in which case dianell be somewhere on the edge looking terribly embarrassed and a bit lost people do change juanita erm before we go any further thats a myth people dont really change at all sorry jim i was going to say on the question of heroics juanita squeezed a bulky overcoated arm im not suggesting you barge into the middle of a bunch of naked squirming travellers and sling her over your shoulder no i i mean i know youd do it if i asked you actually i was thinking more about you what im getting at is the tors a funny place tell me about it sometimes you can get carried away you know what i mean no juanita rammed her fists into the pockets of the afghan not any more carried away is what i dont get nine no booze no dope it was like being on a strange planet like theyd climbed up the night itself and emerged on to some other sphere and the moon and the stars were so much nearer and so bright it was like they were swimming in and out of your head all this without drugs magic headlice breathed understanding at last why mort had been handing out this strict no booze no dope stuff the pilgrims all standing up now had gathered around the tower which rose out of this small space on the summit of the tor over an ocean of lights far far below the tower so close like a silent rocket ship in the centre and they were like joined to it and it was part of them literally if he stretched out his legs his bare feet would touch the stone his feet should have been dead cold up here in november but this was a very special year the summer heat clinging to avalon and the tor was where the real heat was stored all the sacred earthenergy this was like the spiritual power station of britain and tonight headlice was gonna get charged up like a battery all the pilgrims were in a circle holding hands headlices left hand had found the clammy fingers of this raggyhaired older woman called steve his right hand had been grabbed unfortunately by mort mort was holding the finger hed bent which still hurt the bastard but hey it was suddenly immaculately weird the mist had come up behind them surrounding them like this chilly fuzzy hedge forming yet another circle so they were kind of locked into the pattern of the old maze which had been around the tor in prehistoric times and there was one more inner space the tower was roofless like a chimney you could stand inside the flags underfoot dead slippery on account of all the zillions of pilgrims over the centuries and you could gaze up the stone shaft into the night and the night could come down it gwyn was in there now in the centre of everything catching the night he hadnt seen gwyn arrive the man was just suddenly among them in a long coat no telling what he was wearing underneath gwyn the shaman who walked with the spirits headlice didnt know who gwyn was or where he came from there were stories about how gwyn had been in tibet with the masters or been initiated into the wiccan coven at the age of ten then studied for the priesthood just to get both sides all this might be total bullshit but if you knew for a fact that gwyn was say an exgarage mechanic from wolverhampton or just some toerag whod found a copy of king of the witches in the prison library itd like seriously detract wouldnt it gwyn had lit a candle in a glass lantern because of the breeze and he stood behind it in the arched doorway which led into the towers bare interior and then out through an identical arch on the other side his beard was gilded by the candlelight bran had set up this slow heartbeat on his handdrum then more lanterns were lit until there was a semicircle of them around the archway sending gwyns priestly shadow racing up the stone shaman mort swore hed once seen gwyn conjure a fire out of dry grass from six feet away magic eh headlice said to steve and steve glanced at him and smiled and said nothing the throb of brans drum made the air vibrate like the night sky itself was one big stretched skin then headlice felt a tug and they were moving round and round the tower the only sounds the drumming and the slithering of their feet on the grass and he felt like a cog in an ancient sacred mechanism and was totally blissed out at first the problem is juanita said i dont know where i stand any more whose side im on watching the tor by night from less than half a mile away it looked mysteriously pretty with the lights above a band of mist making a faint frill around the base of the st michael tower theyd stopped on the edge of a small wood unsure about this now that they were so close jims lamp had found a tree stump and juanita sat on it and talked when danny and i arrived it was very exciting in an innocent way we used to come here and watch for flying saucers thered been that big flap over at warminster close encounters and books by john michell and then j m powys and this allpervading sense of optimism i suppose simple and naive as that i do believe there was a special optimism then jim said although naturally we were very pofaced about it at the building society loveins and beins and squats not many mortgages in all that nonsense i suppose i was just annoyed because i was rather too old for it all then the spontaneity seemed to dissipate juanita lit a cigarette it became institutionalised and politicised and you ended up with what we have now new age cliques and elitism like the cauldron oh that there you are youre alienated im not alienated i like women the cauldrons all right as far as im concerned but youre not as far as theyre concerned thats the problem jim everybodys got the answer jim said theyre all so certain about it nobody seems content with mystery any more except me i love mystery for its own sake i think a true appreciation of the quality of mystery is the most the majority of us can ever hope for the glow on the tor began to flicker in and out as though people were moving through it we never saw any saucers juanita said sadly i didnt anyway but we knew that when the star people landed theyd land here because this was the centre and we knew theyd be good aliens whod respond to our spiritual aspirations i used to imagine them coming into the shop you know at night id hear a noise and creep down and thered be a couple of benign beings in shiny suits leafing through the books to work out how far wed got up the spiritual ladder jim was silent for a while looking up at the gauzy lights on the tor then he said thats why youve stayed isnt it in glastonbury sorry unfinished business the hippy dream peace and love you still hope that out of all this chaos there might be the seed of harmony and this is the place to nurture it youre still hoping the good aliens will land dont be ridiculous juanita felt herself blush that would make me a very sad person wouldnt it she felt his smile and his own hopeless longing waken stone and darkness gather waken stone and darkness gather nahmu nahmu nahmu nah in the bowl of darkness gather nahmu nahmu nahmu nah the halfwhispered chant was still hissing in headlices ears when the circle stopped turning when he was sure he was still he looked up to find the whole of the sky was still revolving going round and round and round the tower moon and stars and wisps of cloud moon and stars and wispy cloud moon and stars and moon and stars and and everything turning into a chant everything with its own rhythm magic was it though was it he glanced at mort whose head was bowed into his chest dead relaxed as usual headlice felt a pulse of anger come on get real you re just dizzy man magic magics the chemicals working on the brain magics what you conjure up in yourself to get your head uncluttered of all that shit about finding a job and taking your place in like society this pilgrimage this is a celebration of freedom this is our country man ours not yours to put fuckin fences around this is where we can come and breathe the free air and light fires and tell tales about the old gods and get well pissed and stoned and shag our brains out and when we wake up in the jinglejangle arabian morning well sit around and talk about what it was like up the tor all the presences we felt around us how like holy it was but itll all be in our heads stoned memories on account of nothing happened not really yet this was the real place the place go with it it may never happen again like this like when they took you into all those st michael churches made you go in backwards you didnt question that how are you ever gonna change if you dont like submit roll with it he let himself go limp rolled with it gwyn was on the stones outside the tower the light from the candles on his feet and all the objects around him which included a metal cup like a chalice and a whip with a leather handle and kind of thongs like a cat onine tails and a curved ritual knife like a little scythe with the moonlight in its blade a woman was handing a bowl to gwyn it was rozzie in a long dark loose robe twitching in the night breeze so when exactly had his woman been picked as gwyns handmaiden then the people either side of him mort and the woman called steve tightening their grip on headlices sweating hands as the cup was filled from the bowl holy water from the chalice well someone whispered and the hands parted to receive the cup as it was passed around the circle holy water from the chalice well cold water metaltasting passed round anticlockwise and again and again and each time it got to him drink deep drink deep the cup always full so maybe there were two of them or maybe the sacred water was replenishing itself by magic the hands joining again like clasps in some kind of bracelet and the movement restarting the cog in the machine round and round and round and the drum drumming deep down in his gut and the chant nahmu nahmu and the sudden weight of the sky and when he looked up the sky was turning around the tower and and he couldnt feel his feet anymore he was starting to float aware of gwyn speaking hearing the words but like making no sense of it like it was coming from way off and some of it was in latin which figured if gwyn had trained as a priest to get both sides gwyns mellowed out voice was soaring emitte tenebrae tua et medacia tua ipsa me deduxerunt et adduxetunt headlice suddenly felt very emotional felt like crying in montem sanctum tuum hands the skin on the hands gripping his seemed to be putting up like foam rubber and then headlice felt something streak through him hand to hand to hand like an electric current and he was well off the ground the air sizzling coldly around him all lit up an ice cascade perspective somersaulting st michaels tower groaning at his feet he was up there in the darkness montem sanctum tuum gwyns voice rising and sliding and the responses from the others a drone enfolding him like soft curtains the drum so loud like it was inside his head like he was inside the drum it was brilliant he was truly alive man and the priest said oh gwyn ap nudd lord of the hollow guardian of the dark gates we call upon thee and offer to thee this jim juanita said jim look i think im changing my mind about this she crouched panting in the grass which was slick with night dew they were almost halfway up the tor she looked over her shoulder in the dark it was like being on a cliffface vertigo seized her and she grabbed at the hillside for support her hand closing around something she realised was a hard lump of sheep shit she ran her fingers convulsively through the damp grass i mean are we going to make fools of ourselves when you think about it what are we supposed to be preventing after all come on nobody ever got murdered or anything on the tor did they depends what you call murder jim said dont imagine abbot whiting saw much justice in what they did to him anyway he suddenly expelled an angry sigh im curious now its a free country national trust property weve got as much right jim why dont we just get the police i was stupid they wont arrest diane and even if they did they wont want to know whats in it for them couple of cannabis arrests they havent got the manpower anymore its just jim turned towards her too old to look after myself no i oh god what it came down to was whatever these neohippies were doing she didnt want to see it because shed been there and it was beautiful once and she didnt want to watch a sweaty parody of her youth didnt want to feel old didnt want to have to feel disgust why dont we get the car and drive down to don moulders field and wait for them to come back to their camp well see where diane goes and well try and snatch her no jims voice was pitched almost at conversational level im tired of being timid too old to be a hippy missed the boat missed too many boats jim why dont you stay here with the lamp and ill go up alone juanita looked down at the lights of glastonbury thinking god one minute im worrying about his heart and his liver and the next jim hed pushed the lamp into her hands and when she looked up hed vanished into a wall of mist bloody hell he was going up there to make a scene at some point tonight hed got this image of himself as a bumbling ineffectual little man considered too old to kick ass and now he had something to prove no way juanita went after him stumbled her afghan falling open she was aware of a fringe of lights and a mans hollow voice lifted up into the night rhythmic and ecclesiastical and that didnt sound like what they used to do in the seventies not at all it started to go wrong very quickly all in a rush and it was so strong headlice was just dragged down like hed lost the use of his feet like theyd rotted into mush because he was no longer above the tor he was inside it in this giant cave full of mist it didnt matter too much at first that he had no control got to roll with it man im a shaman now me this is where they go inside the earth inside themselves until he realised that without feet you couldnt run away at some stage he saw what seemed at first like only a darker part of the mist it writhed it became like a tree with fuzzy outstretched branches and little knotty twigs the kind of wintry tree you see through fog from a train and then it wasnt a tree because trees dont move like this the branches were dark arms and the twigs were fingers thin fingers bony wiggling like they were underwater and the currents were doing it and he saw arms inside sleeves torn sleeves hanging like sodden leaves gone black he tried to clench his own fingers on morts hand and steves only nothing happened he couldnt work the muscles clenched his fingers but nothing clenched a ring a ring on one of the wiggling fingers a big one size of a curtain ring headlice heard let me go let me go unto my lord a figure in black with stains down the chest this rough cloth around it ripped in places and stains stains everywhere and a hard powerful smell of dirty sweat fearsweat and wet rusty iron like when you pull an old pram out of a pond all black the fabric rotted and dripping and the frame poking through no im not going for this this is dope in the fuckin water you get me out of this you bastards hear me the body was coming towards him in this kind of lopsided crippled way it couldnt stand up straight couldnt lift up its head he tried to scream feeling his throat working at it pushing but nothing coming out and the reason this ragged thing couldnt lift its head was because it hadnt got one only stains around the neck of its robe help me help me to my lord its hands groping out for headlice fingers waving like seaweed in shallow water headlice shrinking away fuck off fuck off old man leave me alone dom dom dom heart banging away in his chest blood throbbing in his head drum going dom dom dom and he could see the old man was offering him something something that had formed between his hands a bowl and headlice reeled back this was all he could do throw his body back from the waist because his legs had gone now gone into soup and the old man pushed the bowl towards him but it was still joined to his hands this bowl this chalice his fingers throbbing like veins in the curved metal the old man was giving off long sobs ragged as his rotting clothes because he was as helpless as headlice this old man didnt know what he was at holding out the bowl the old man said alan which was headlines real name the entity said alan real sick and sorrowful and headlice looked down and saw briefly a wavering shadow of himself in the mist and he knew that hed become part of it another wiggling thing part of the darkness he started to cry too because thered soon be nothing left of him but tears and snot evaporating in the dark alan however alan started to feel dispassionate about this about his body floating away from his consciousness or maybe the other way round who gives a shit roll with it and this was when the air thinned into a paler darkness and he became aware that he was out of it up in the night sky again over the tor and looking down and he could see everything very clearly he was up here in the sky thank you thank you thank you gods and looking down on some miserable little sod scrabbling on its knees in blind circles right under the church tower surrounded by candle lanterns its stupid fingers dipping into the flames but showing no pain just twitching and scuffling like a lost thing helpless and pathetic they were lifting it up from behind two people an arm each and the drum was going dom dom dom like one of them execution drums dom dom dom and he was looking straight down now like looking down a chute on to the very top of its head where a swastika oh shit oh shit man it s me thats me being propped up like a scarecrow rozzie was there too watching whitefaced but the bitch was avoiding touching him and there was it was gwyn but it wasnt his face was long and black and pointed his coat was off his skin shone he was naked and so did his sickle raised with the moon in it it was a hell of a shock at first mort and steve holding the pathetic things head back exposing its throat to the blade but the next instant hed realised this was only headlice a naive little tosser so it didnt matter he was going to die anyway it had begun ages ago the death thing the cut was like a formality alan was above it all directly above exalted directly above the swastika the sun symbol on headlices head the head chakra the opening hed like projected out of he could see the cord now a thin strand of silver like a wire all he could see of headlice was a pair of hands waiting to receive the chalice the holy grail and then alan dissolved into laughter because the holy grail was black and slimy and smelt of piss ten with you this night verity lit a candle for the abbot its light might have created the illusion of a warm area at the heart of ancient meadwell it didnt the light was as wan and waxy as a lone snowdrop in cold earth the silver candlestick and a dusty wine bottle two crystal wine glasses and two pewter plates rested at the top of the oak dining table which was as crude as an upturned barge on one was a salmon steak they ate mainly fish the monks colonel pixhill had told her from the other plate at the bottom of the table verity who had never before sat alone here who habitually ate in the kitchen listening to the archers was picking at a green salad which in this sparse light looked grey she was perched like a sparrow on the oak settle under the window recess at the top end of the table behind the candlestick was a highbacked oak chair with arms the chair sat before the platter of salmon there was a knife but no fork the colonel had said they did not use forks oh let this soon be over verity chewed on a lettuce leaf which felt like crepe paper in the desert of her mouth among beams and pillars of oak huge shadows shifted sluggishly like black icebergs the lump of fish islanded by juices on the abbots plate looked although she squashed the thought at once like some grisly organic remains on a surgeons tray the curious thing was that verity had searched through all the records the church histories the local histories and there had been many of them as writer after writer sought to explain the holy glamour of glastonbury without ever finding documentary evidence that abbot richard whiting had eaten such a meal or indeed that his last sombre night upon this earth had been spent at meadwell colonel pixhill you see had always said it was so after the dinner relaxing a little with a small panatella the colonel would ruminate on the abbots fate of course quite apart from his differences with the church over er marital matters henry viii was an extravagant blighter never had enough money and there was glastonbury wealthiest religious house in britain outside westminster had to get his hands on that wealth somehow greed thats the orthodox version that devil thomas cromwell henrys hatchet man as it were only a matter of time before he was ordered to focus his scheming brain on avalon the colonel would pour red wine brought up that evening from the cellar tonight verity also had a bottle ready such a terrible waste she drank hardly at all and hated the cellar shed taken the biggest flashlight in the house but its beam down there had been but a flimsy ribbon a cobweb was still laced around the bottle of vintage claret shed snatched from the nearest rack ramming it under her arm to grope for the iron handrail to the cellar steps but of course it was more than money henry was capturing jerusalem do ysee jerusalem builded here as blake was to put it on englands green and pleasant land how could the king break from rome establish himself as the head of the church if he didnt smash the power of the place where where those feet walked in ancient times and old whiting wouldve realised this of course he would and suspected his own days were numbered poor chap but he stayed and he waited for a miracle how could god possibly permit the very cradle of christianity to fall for verity the colonel had illuminated the history of glastonbury as no book ever had she pictured the great abbey soaring in all its golden splendour into a flawless blue heaven who indeed could have imagined it then as broken and derelict certainly not the abbot at last laying down her knife and fork she could not eat with only a knife like the abbot verity composed herself and said in a tiny tremulous voice like the tink of china the words enunciated for so many years by colonel pixhill have courage have fortitude my lord abbot we are she paused to correct herself nervously fiddling with the lace handkerchief in the sleeve of the woollen pinafore dress she wore against the cold in here for november it was quite a warm night outside i mean i am no she had to believe that major shepherd was here at the table and so was colonel pixhill himself had to believe she was not alone we are with you this night the candle flame swayed to the left as if a fresh draught had spurted into the room verity sat very still and did not see no possible escape of course royal commissioners searching the old boys chamber and coming up with writings critical of the kings divorce as if anyone would commit such things to parchment plus a book about ha that other famous cleric with the temerity to criticise his kind thomas becket and then they find a gold chalice hidden away and accuse whiting of robbing his own abbey the first time she heard this verity had asked hesitantly might this not have been i mean a precious chalice that he was so anxious to hide the grail verity i hardly think so if the cup from the last supper was indeed preserved it was surely not precious in that sense certainly not made of gold wood or earthenware more likely the colonel had raised his glass peered into the clouded wine repeating we are with you lord abbot with you this night drawing an obvious parallel with the abbots own last supper in october verity remembered all the dates as clearly as if she had been there thomas cromwell the kings agent had ordered that richard whiting a kind old man who was always mindful of the poor and the sick and known for his generosity should be tried and executed the trial took place at wells where the abbot and two monks said to be his accomplices were swiftly sentenced to death and brought immediately back to glastonbury this was november the following day the abbot was brutally stretched and bound to a wooden hurdle dragged through the streets by horses past helpless horrified townsfolk past the forlorn abbey and so to the tor verity now rose among the shadows poured wine into the abbots crystal glass and a little drop to moisten her own parched lips it tasted bitter and salty like blood there was a hazy necklace of light around the st michael tower just where it sprang free of the watery mist that rose from the levels and gathered on the sides of the tor clutching her shawl around her diane stepped off the bus platform somewhere a sheep bleated a rare sound at night outside the lambing season it was ok this was ordinary light perhaps a circle of candles it wouldnt be visible at all from the edges of the town so they were all up there doing whatever theyd come to do gwyn the shaman presiding with his ceremonial sickle that had been a pretty scary moment all alone and raising his sickle to the moon another reason to get out of here this was not the convoy shed joined she moved silently across the grass careful not to bump into any vehicles always a risk when there was so much of you shed moved her van closer to the field gate knowing shed probably be leaving before the others knowing juanita would let her stay at the flat for a couple of weeks while she sorted herself out morts hearse loomed in from of her love is the law love over death shed seen another unpleasant side of mort tonight another side of all of them she stopped there was the glow of a cigarette the thin moonlight showed her the hateful hecate sitting on the bonnet of the hearse her van was on the other side of the hearse she couldnt possibly reach it unseen well gosh what did that matter she could leave if she wanted to dont be pathetic but she was pathetic she imagined getting into the van trying to start the engine which always took absolutely ages to fire and hecate standing there watching her this large strong and horribly precocious child smoking a joint opening the van door which she could do because its lock was broken and dragging her out the younger children hearing the noise and coming to join in black gnomes swarming over her shivering diane crept back to the bus shed wait until hecate had gone for a pee or something and then creep past the vehicles to the gate and go on foot to wellhouse lane and the town knock on juanitas door beg for sanctuary she sat in the front of the bus in the drivers seat a night breeze awoke and made the bus rattle more sheep began to bleat diane felt like a solitary spectator on the perimeter of an enormous stadium the landscape primed as if for some great seasonal festival samhain beltane or whatever they called midsummer night november a day surely of no particular import in the celtic calendar not even a full moon november and then in the sky over the tor she saw a light not a torch not a lamp not a fire it hung there for a moment and then went out diane caught her breath when she was very young she used to go all trembly and run downstairs and father snorted impatiently and the nannies said nonsense child and felt for a temperature nannies there was a certain sort of nanny later known as a governess which father expressly sought out nannies one and two both the same the sort which was supposed to have yellowed and faded from the scene along with crinolines and parasols the sort which in the s still addressed their charges as child the sort which as you grew older you realised should never be consulted about occurrences such as lights around the tor and then there was the third nanny her memories of the third nanny remained vague and elusive she remembered laughter the third nanny was the only one of them that ever smiled and one other thing she would sit on the edge of the bed but never left a dent in the mattress when she arose she knew now what the third nanny was diane tensed behind the tor the whole of the sky was now growing lighter like a dawn but it couldnt be dawn it was quite early in the night the light spread behind the tor like a pale sheet it was grey and quietly lustrous had a sheen like motherofpearl she wondered if hecate could see it and suspected not diane had certainly never seen a light like this before the lightballs shed watched as a child had fascinated her they were benign they filled your head with a fizzy glow like champagne this light was ominous like a storm cloud and it stroked her with dread she wanted to turn away she couldnt she couldnt even blink two dark columns had appeared either side of the silhouetted tower of st michael rising above the tower into the lightened sky like arms of smoke culminating in shadowhands cupped and in the cup a core of intense and hideous darkness we are with you this night but who was with him verity wondered when they dragged him on his hurdle up the side of the tor the mud besmirching him the bleak november wind in his face bringing water from his eyes so that it would appear he was weeping all the accounts said that abbot whiting went to his death with dignity and stoicism but the very act of hauling him up the steep cone of the hill the violence of it and at the summit under the tower the waiting nooses three of them an obscene parody of the execution on another hill of christ the other two convicted monks were roger lames and john thorne treasurer of the abbey and a skilled carpenter and furnituremaker all three went quietly to their god but the humiliation of abbot whiting did not end with his hanging took off his head soon as they cut his dead body down they look off the abbots head to be displayed upon the abbey gate a trophy a warning final evidence that roman catholicism was terminated in glastonbury that the church belonged to the crown imagine the impact of that on a little town in the sixteenth century it must have felt like armageddon colonel pixhill could never go on beyond this point but verity knew the abbots body had been drawn and quartered sections of his poor corpse sent for exhibition at bath wells ilchester and bridgwater where did they carry out this butchery where did they take the axes or cleavers to the body not surely on the tor more likely indoors somewhere here this was the inference wasnt it that the abbot was drawn and jointed in this house and if not at this very table which was insufficiently ancient then perhaps on another table standing where this one now stood there had been a body here it was here that the colonel had lain in his coffin for three days as stipulated in his will people had said how brave she was to stay in the house alone with the corpse but it had been a comfort to her a period of adjustment of coming to terms with it verity stared down into the well of shadows around her feet why was she doing this to herself as if she was obliged to unravel every last strand of sadness and horror from the unhappy tapestry she was unable to suppress the sickening image of the abbots body chopped into crude joints of meat and her eyes rose inevitably to the lump of red salmon on the plate and saw that it had gone the abbots pewter plate was clean verity felt her mouth tighten into a rictus both hands grabbed at her face like claws eyes closing as her nails pierced her forehead and cheeks in a sudden raging fever of fear she stayed that way for over a minute rocking backwards and forwards on the settle feeling her chest swelling but she must not scream must not moaning feebly through her fingers not daring to open her eyes because the membrane of darkness shut in by her eyelids that at least was her darkness not meadwells she should not have to go through this her fear was spiked with an anger now at major shepherd for being so ill too ill to realise what it took out of her its my duty to receive the abbot shed told juanita carey almost gaily in truth it would be upsetting enough for anyone woman or man to prepare a meal for a person long dead and then sit down to dine alone with that persons spirit oh but she was getting old shed be with them all soon the abbot and the colonel and captain hope her almostlover who had died of peritonitis in telling herself again that the abbot was such a kind man known for his generosity towards the old and the sick verity rocked more slowly and became calmer pulling her hands away from her face making them relax on her knees under the table retracting her claws like a cat of course the plate was not empty with the worry and tension of the abbots dinner anyone could be subject to minor hallucinations why the ancient stone and timbered dining hall was quite normal silent and cold and still quite normal until the very moment that verity opened her eyes when as abruptly as if someone had plucked out the snowdrop or flattened it between two clapping hands the candle went out and when the room was fully in darkness not even the ghost of the flame still discernible the abbots chair creaked the way that a chair creaks when someone rises from it and verity alone in the reaching darkness where it no longer mattered that she did not see gave in at last to the pressure of that longwithheld scream eleven the wrong god what the buggering hells going on here it might have been the erratic candlelight making jim battle appear to quiver or it might juanita couldnt be sure have been real jim trembling not of course with fear but with barely suppressed anger at these bloody pagan scroungers taking over his beloved tor what the buggering hells going on here juanita couldnt believe hed said that it was just so jim but so completely out of context standing there defiantly shoulders back on the concrete apron at the foot of the st michael tower candles all around him jim battle building society manager turned mystical artist being a dumpy little hero juanita just hoped the pagan pilgrims had a sense of humour actually there werent as many of them as shed imagined maybe a dozen people always exaggerated where travellers were concerned juanita stayed behind jim on the fringe of the assembly a foot on the last step of the path her nostrils detecting a soiled sweetness in the air not marijuana no music either not even the rattle of the wind which normally haunted the summit of the tor jims outburst had erupted into a yawning vacuum as if hed stormed into church in that moment at the end of a prayer before the scuffling begins juanita lightly squeezed his arm a squeeze supposed to convey the message back off jim make an excuse walk away pretend you didnt see anything you don t have anything to prove say youre sorry for interrupting just back off well jim glared belligerently at the shadowy travellers what have you buggers got to say for yourselves oh jim nobody replied the only sound was a choking gasp from up against the tower juanita felt jims hand groping for the lamp and before she could think about it shed let it go and hed flicked it on stabbing the beam at the tower the gasping person wasnt much more than a boy his eyes speared by the lamplight were glazed a man and a woman were holding his arms juanita realised with distaste that the smell on the air was vomit and it lingered the air up here was dense like wadding whats the matter with this lad eh jim tried to spread the beam over the other travellers but they moved away well too bloody stoned to explain ourselves are we i really dont know what to think about you buggering people i dont indeed juanita peered over his shoulder as he sprayed the light about looking for diane and not finding her or any recognisable face actually it was all a touch unnatural only the candle flames were in motion burning in a semi circle of lanterns around the tower the glowing buds magnified by glass at jims feet there was a chalked semicircle around one of the entrance arches inside it metal bowl and cups and implements of some kind probably some sort of altar juanita recalled fragrant summer nights here with danny frayne and bottles of mateus rose and laughter lots of laughter why was nobody laughing why werent they making fun of jim old guy in a silly hat have a drink dad danny frayne would have said have a joint be cool jesus god juanita shivered under her afghan something wrong here she remembered jim saying what purposeful people they were not the usual semistoned rabble and became aware of shapes on the edge of the candlelit semicircle closing in around him she wanted to show a warning but suddenly her mouth didnt seem to work anymore sensing movement behind him jim turned slowly and with dignity he snorted i dont know you call yourselves bloody green pagans but youve really no idea what this place is all about have you for gods sake how long was he going to keep up this colonel fogey routine how utterly stupid men could be when forced into a confrontation well ill tell you tell you what its not about shall i its not about drugs and madeup bloody rituals invoking lots of shagging its not about littering the place with belching wrecks of buses its not about worrying sheep and ripping out fences for fires and having a shit on the buggering grass and not even burying it its not about contaminating a sacred site and ruining all the a fissure developed in jims voice as it became personal all the mystery juanita flinched as something slid past her and moved with a fleeting feral smell through the circle of candles and into the lamp beam she flinched again when she saw what it was saw jims mouth fall momentarily open saw a man with long tangled hair secured by a metal circlet saw with a feeling like a kick under the heart that the hair enclosed a face from old old nightmares from those books she never really liked to sell from magical pornography an animals face and a devils face sculpted and textured harshhaired around black eyes and its body gleamed wellmuscled arms and legs glistening with grease she saw this because apart from the animal mask the man man oh lord yes was naked when he spoke it was not much above a whisper but it carried like a fast train in the night youve said too much juanita was shocked to see the lips move then realised that the mask of hair and skin ended above the mouth but the beard below it was real over the top of the lower there was a curiously unhealthy glow in the sky juanita began to feel seriously scared this was not your routine new age extravaganza and some part of jim had known it from the start you know what these characters are like drugged up to the eyeballs or swigging cider day trippers not these buggers jim looked up bravely into the bearded face please god juanita thought dont let him say anything inflammatory below the lights of glastonbury had been doused by mist the tor was an island again it was no longer part of the world juanita knew and who the hell are you jim demanded conan the buggering barbarian she shut her eyes in anguish her head seemed to fill up with cold mist she felt the ominous nearness of other bodies smelled the feral smell again like tomcats this was all so futile diane wasnt here shed have recognised jims voice by now come dashing out to explain when juanita opened her eyes it was to see the goatface close to jims as though it was going to kiss him jim didnt move his head away but she saw his hands grip the flaps of his overcoat to stop them shaking that did it diane wasnt here and juanita couldnt watch this any longer she pulled her afghan coat together and marched through the crowd the goat man turned to her nothing moved behind the blackness of the eyeholes she felt horribly exposed as if she were naked not him she pushed her hands hard into her coat pockets ok look it came out as a croak we made a mistake come on jim shes not here bloody hell juanita jim stood there like a bulldog why couldnt you just leave this to me he pushed irascibly past the goatmanpriest and advanced on the boy held against the tower you all right sonny look bloody well let him go will you snatching at the wrist of one of the men holding the boy hes been sick whats wrong with him drugs jim was pretty strong the mans grip broke the boy stumbled away and then straightened up swaying into the darkness they heard him slipping and rolling down the side of the tor into the mist jim were going juanita took his lamp let them get on with their religion the goatman moved under the archway as if he needed to think well juanita didnt whatever they were doing they could get the hell on with it she grabbed the end of jims scarf and tugged him towards the path still nobody said a word but the atmosphere was stiff now with menace these were the new hippies christ listen were sorry sorry to mess up your ritual whatever ok we were just looking for a friend she heard jim grunt and his scarf came away in her hand jim her shoulder was gripped she dropped the lamp in alarm when she turned she fell into someones arms was swung round and looked up into a stubbly grinning male face as she squirmed she saw two men seize hold of jim slamming him against the wall of the tower where the boy had been his arms stretched above his head the naked man stooped to pick something up when he stood before jim it was glittering in his left hand he whispered i did not say you could go he was bent over the bonnet of morts hearse his face was streaked with mud and blood from scratches on his cheek and jaw his eyes were big in the lamplight and sort of glazed diane raised the tilley lamp head headlice mol he stared up at her in the white light the swastika on his head looked crude like a knife wound he smelled of sick why was he alone where were the others he let her help him up and walk him over to the bus he stood on the little platform framed in the doorway somewhere behind him was the tor but there were no lights there now well get those cuts bathed she found a plastic bottle of water the little woodstove in the bus was still going just about no time headlice shook himself as if remembering something then swung round urgently scanning the dark gotta get the hell out mol the plastic bottle went slippery in her fingers what happened they were alone hecate had disappeared probably not wanting to be around when headlice found out what theyd done to his bus diane had lit the tilley lamp when the tor went dark again shed been afraid to leave the bus she didnt know what shed seen but it had left an atmosphere tainted with a brooding evil shed never felt before not here not anywhere the blackness at its heart had seeped into the unnatural spread of light until it was a night sky again but it was a different kind of night as black and opaque as soot with no moon any more shit headlice glared down at his hands look at that shakin like a fuckin leaf bad shit mol listen diane said all i know is that sometimes you cant trust your what your minds telling you it does awfully odd things to you up there i mean on the tor tell me what happened youre talkin dead posh i am posh frightfully posh actually for what its worth i wanted you to be there i wanted he shrugged nobody got laid anyroad there was a like holy water and chanting and stuff in latin i dont remember dont fuckin remember the kettle began to whistle on the iron stove headlice pushed it angrily away i told you we got no time gotta get this thing going piss off headlice you have to tell me what did they do headlice picked up the kettle and emptied the hot water into the stoves firebox causing an explosion of hissing steam water holy water acid mushrooms some shit did me head in im not down yet not there was he stopped as if he wasnt sure what he remembered this old man and like a black chalice diane went very cold inside arms huge smoky arms in the sky hands cupped like a communicants to receive headlice sprang to his feet get the bus goin before the bastards come back you an me mol im trusting you dont shaft me the tilley lamp spread its gassy wobbly light over his face mud and blood on it like warpaint tuum montem summat like that that were part of it hed lift his arms like that lift his arms monum sanctum monum sanctum tuum diane said your holy hill its from the mass they have conducted me and brought me unto thy holy hill she sighed they sent me to a convent once gonna write about this mol gonna write it up for the papers he sneered and poured cold water from the plastic bottle into the stove headlice oh my god listen gwyn had you ever met gwyn before he shook his head slammed the metal stove door what about mort oh gosh these people she knew there was something wrong with them yeah mort was the guy got me into this he was in a pub back home salford i told you before headlice was moving around the bus throwing things on the luggage racks she remembered him saying hed been unemployed living with his parents devouring earth mysteries books dreaming of ley lines and mort had introduced him to a man with an old bus for sale and headlice had sold his motorbike to pay for it how hed met rozzie was a mystery look she said when gwyn joined us at bury st edmunds you remember when gwyn joined the whole mood of the convoy seemed to change some people left con and daisy what at bury con and daisy irish travellers con says to me he says you wanna fuck off man this guys heavy shit i mean come on man heavy shits what ive come for and he just shakes his head thats it mol were off he took out his ignition keys for the bus threw them up in the air caught them me an you then mol back on the st michael line and no more stopping at churches goin in backwards no more shit what did you say but headlice had leapt down from the platform to get into the cab he was probably right they had to get out of here shed go with him as far as the town and then she heard headlice yell who the f and then he screeched in pain and there was a bump headlice diane snatched up the tilley lamp and stumbled down the deck to the platform she leaned out from the top step holding out the lamp by its wire handle headlice she couldnt see anything at first but she heard retching and moaning a dark figure moved unhurriedly aside headlice was writhing on the grass clutching his stomach his head flung back she saw a heavybooted foot crunch into his face under his nose bright blood fountained up headlice started to snuffle the lamp was wrenched from her hand juanita kicked backwards with the heel of her boot and someone went aaah then she was punched hard in mouth tasted saltblood the naked man raised his hand and the blade of the sickle was white gold in the candlelight juanita screamed through swelling lips oh come on jim still trying to bluster through this dont be so damned stupid only about half a dozen socalled pilgrims remained two of them gaunt unsmiling women do you know me the voice still a whisper but raised high like the blade had a horrid triumphant ring thankfully no jim snapped now tell your lackey to get his bloody hands off that woman i am gwyn ap nudd do you know me now juanita spat blood bring him here jim spluttering was pulled from the wall by the warriorlooking man with the tight plait and the priest pointed with his sickle to a patch of grass beside the concrete path one of the other male pilgrims he had a black cap and two large earrings like a pirate went down theatrically on one knee and when they flung jim down his head was bent back across the shelf of the mans other thigh his hat fell off they pulled his hair to hold his head back most of the candles had been extinguished jim had to stare up at the moon they had removed his scarf exposing his neck hell catch cold juanita thought ludicrously the date said gwyn ap nudd the goat priest is november the fourteenth not a goatpriest a dogpriest hound gwyn ap nudd lord of the celtic hades which could be entered through the tor gwyn s hall gwyn was the leader of the wild hunt it was a dogmask as if this mattered jim retched someone balanced one of the remaining candle lanterns on his heaving overcoated chest on this day in the year the last abbot of glastonbury richard whiting was convicted of petty theft and treason then brought up here to the church above the hall of gwyn ap nudd fairy lord of death and then side by side with two of his monastic underlings he was hanged let him go juanita pleaded cant you see hes choking hes an old man for christs sake whiting was also an old man the priest whispered a rich and powerful old man his public execution on the spot where we stand signified the fall of one of the wealthiest monastic establishments in the land his god couldnt save him the lips smiled he was worshipping the wrong god the sickle was raised until the moon once more was in the blade and so his death was a sacrifice to me juanita expelled all her breath in a long scream kicked out and kicked nothing and then her head was wrenched back by the hair and some disgusting rag was shoved between her teeth and halfway down her throat until she gagged out of the darkness quite close a drum started up behind the man who presumptuously called himself gwyn ap nudd the mist had cleared and juanita could see the lights of glastonbury so bloody bloody close where were the police where were the courting couples where were the nightjoggers imagine it bump bump bumping down the tor gwyn said whitings head bump bump bump in time to the measured drumbeat juanitas eyes streamed this couldnt be happening it couldnt not here where she and danny had lain and shared a joint drunk cool wine made love watched for the good aliens she felt her stomach heave and began to choke on her own rising vomit she tried to close her eyes and she filled her head with prayers to god and all the other stupid gods that lived up here they hung his head on the town gate gwyn said where should this one hang in the end juanita had to open her eyes if only because she knew she couldnt close her ears to the whistle of air against blade jims mouth was slightly open she couldnt see his eyes theyd put his hat back on and tipped it raffishly over his brow there was no sound from him but there was movement it might have been the candlelight or it might have been that his cheeks were quivering gwyn the goat dogpriest raised his sickle to the slender moon and juanita saw his long thin cock begin to rise to the thrill of hacking off the poor mans head twelve a little canary the number you have dialled has not been recognised said the heartless computervoice and verity cut the line again her finger dithered over the buttons on the receiver it was easy to misdial because not only was her finger shaking but many of the numbers were obscured by blood she tried again telephones quite often malfunctioned in glastonbury especially cordless phones and mobiles because of the valley formation according to the engineers because of the shifting of the veil according to the mystics shed brewed some camomile tea sipping it with lips that still felt rigid with shock there was no comfort tonight in the kitchen even though it was in the more modem part of the house no matter how many jolly mugs and copper pans and tomatored casseroles one placed around the room the drabness would filter through nothing would glint the electric lights hanging limply between the beams would glow as though on rationed power this time thank god the telephone rang at the other end but major shepherds wife was outraged at the disturbance the major was unwell she did not wish him agitated im so sorry mrs shepherd i just didnt know who else to is it the blasted guttering again miss endicott mrs shepherd evidently thought verity was a querulous old ditherer who should have been pensioned off years ago no verity almost sobbed it isnt the guttering tim she heard what are you doing out of bed oh very well but dont blame me when you verity major shepherd was wheezing badly are you all right no verity said after a pause i really dont think i am funny how quickly you forgot how it was the hardpile officetype carpet all those white or transparent lampshades designed for illumination never for mood the dominant colour dark brown pervasive smell wet leather the arrogant rigid maleness of the place as if to emphasise it her father took her into the gunroom where she saw the old oak panelled cabinets had been replaced by revolting metal ones floor to ceiling it was truly horrible sort of semimilitary basic security he said noticing her dismay cant be too careful with guns anymore you could always just get rid of them of course diane said then you wouldnt need security he didnt even bother to react gerald rankin hung around in the doorway as if she might try to escape she could still smell his glove over her mouth and nose the whole house seemed to be impregnated with the oily essence of rankins glove and the sense of being closed in thanks rankin her father said good man close the door behind you when his farmmanager had gone lord pennard pointed to the worn leather sofa scuffed as an old wallet sit down please diane her legs felt weak but she stayed stubbornly on her feet her back to the bay window with its steely industrial venetian blinds she folded her arms beneath the shawl tightened her mouth as you please drink she shook her head minimally picked up and brought home like a little girl again so whod informed on her this time don moulder doubling his three hundred and fifty times is hard my chicken got to earn your crust where you can look diane glared at her father at the marbled coldness of him she knew how bitterly angry he must be at the way she had as he would see it let him down but if she didnt go on the offensive shed be nowhere it had taken her many years to learn this did did you phone an ambulance her father raised an eyebrow didi incredulity he didnt waste words any more than cartridges in his twelvebore rather like a doublebarrelled shotgun himself heavy steelygrey polished and greased and functional he went across to the dresser the last remaining piece of old oak in the room coming through the house shed noticed how many pieces of fine furniture and pictures had gone he poured himself a small whisky from a decanter his movements so elegant for a big man he was perfectly balanced his stomach still tauntingly flat hed always made her feel like some sort of awful throwback the fat one diane thought of headlice lying where rankin and his son wayne had left him snuffling on his own blood he could be really badly hurt you know im sorry lord pennard sipped his whisky who are we talking about damn it you calm down his names alan hes actually a sort of human being who hasnt done you any harm the foxes and the pheasants hadnt done him any harm either unlikely to lose sleep over a hippy diane i he raised his voice grey eyes wide and unblinking i rang patrick to tell him you were safe he offered to come and collect you told him there was no need pointed out there was a train tomorrow said youd be on it frightfully precise absolute concrete certainty in every syllable it should be her cue to run out of the room hands over her face mumbling i hate you i hate you in a pathetic drowning voice she felt familiar small prickly movements in whatever part of the brain was responsible for manufacturing tears she thought i cant im nearly twentyeight years old look knowing her voice was all over the place are you going to call an ambulance or let me call one he looked at her his severely handsome face almost sorrowful he looked her up and down from the messedup hair to the fraying shawl to the moonpatterned skirt of washed out blue from the oxfam shop yes i know she said i know you wont have it done from here i know that so far theres absolutely nothing to connect you or even rankin with a a hippy in a field but why please why cant you let me at least go to a telephone box his face darkened because his body flexed then straightened like a broken twelve bore clacking into place i wont have you wandering around the town like a streetwalker because rankin tells me the injuries were superficial nothing such an individual wouldnt get in a pub brawl and because he came close enough to her to smell the scotch on his breath and see the small veins in his checks like the veins in marble or the palest roquefort because my dear hippies and gypsies are like dogs give one a good kicking and itll simply limp off into the undergrowth until its recovered diane shook her head in disbelief so lets be realistic shall we he turned away never had liked to look at her for long something shed always remembered the cursory inspection as if she was livestock off to market well naturally hed had more time for his son that was the way of things that was the system good making for the door good diane was sure hed been about to say good man he turned at the door lord reasonable look diane youve been a damn trial to us all your life but youre not stupid no money to speak of no job and i should imagine youve seen enough of life with these scavengers havent you she gripped the edge of her shawl he simply couldnt absorb the idea of people wanting more from life than money and property and power and influence especially when in his case one of these money was less plentiful than it might be a corner of his mouth made a brief excursion towards a cheek the closest he ever came to smiling he got rid of it quickly as if it was a nervous twitch jennifers prepared your old room if you want to see me in the morning ill be here until eleven train you want leaves im not going realising to her horror that shed stamped her foot how can you my god its unbelievable im a grown woman you send your man to to kidnap me and you expect me to meekly get out of town get out of your hair it wheres archer this has nothing to do with archer he snapped she knew that rankin or wayne would be loitering in the passage to make sure she went up the right stairs she knew the hidden alarms would be activated to make sure she didnt leave in the night she felt outraged humiliated but as usual defeated and said in a despicably small voice you havent even asked me why i left patrick lord pennard paused hand on the doorknob he looked pained diane had i wished to know that i should have asked patrick goodnight to you you see verity i major shepherds voice was swamped in a torrent of coughing from which it seemed he would not recover finally he said this must sound awful but for some years you have been our little canary cuddling her cup of camomile tea verity recoiled when she saw it was streaked with blood miners the major said miners used to take a canary in a cage into the shafts as a test for poisonous gases if the canary i know verity said tightly of course i dont mean it quite like that we knew nothing would happen to you that little woman george used to say is the strongest human being ive ever met you know what he meant dont you he meant i was not sensitive not in that way verity wanted to protest just because she did not see that didnt mean she was without insight or intuition the spiritual had become her life and healing all those years studying the bach flower remedies and dispensing them here in the ancient sanctity of glastonbury even if being here meant living at meadwell its always been dark in this house major and its growing darker i mean quite literally i dont know why that is the major sighed but until tonight i have never felt the nearness of she could hardly bring herself to utter the word it was not a glastonbury word in the towns mystical circles people spoke of positives negatives and mediators never of evil if this was the abbot then the abbot was evil is evil im so sorry major shepherd there was a long pause his wheeze was like the bellows one used to use on a dying fire verity listen to me i know youre on your own and that no mere wage is recompense that george warned us to expect problems as the millennium approaches now listen if youre going to mention retirement major verity said at once i couldnt think of deserting she held on bleakly while major shepherd went into another agony of coughing am trying to get you some help stronger than me younger if you could just bear bear to hold on if you cant ill understand i shall not desert my post verity said and felt so cold even though even though the house hated her it did it threw darkness at her it turned everyone against her and everything shed heard the creak of the abbots chair and dared not move everywhere had been utterly utterly dark verity had scrabbled about in the darkness found her way to the wall where she knew the light switches were moved her flattened palms from side to side and in circles and still could not find them the wall had felt as rough and cold as it must have been in the sixteenth century the electric switches simply were not there shed panicked naturally pulling herself up just short of hysteria when her hand alighted on a box of matches the ones shed used to light the candle but when she struck a match it was dead all of them were little sticks which would not light only snapped this thing major shepherd said soberly it must remain at meadwell do you know what im saying i think so did she when the lights had conic on slowly and blearily revealing an empty chair a sad salmon steak a scattering of spent matches and all the switches on the walls verity had accused herself of being a weak stupid old woman shed cleared the table placed the abbots chair neatly against the wall in the kitchen shed scraped the salmon steak into the wastebin giving it to the cat if the cat had still been here would have seemed disrespectful not that the creature would have deserved it when verity had opened the door of the cupboard by the yawning fireplace to return the candlestick to its place for another year shed had a terrible shock out had come a whizzing spinning slashing stella leaving smears of blood over veritys arms and hands before hurling herself out of the room and streaking out of the house with a violent snap of the kitchen catflap the greasy tobaccocoloured oak pillars supporting the doorway had looked on like the sour sardonic menacing old men who haunted the street corners of her youth putting down the telephone verity wept for many minutes tears mingling with the blood on her bony arms everyone against her everything a little old canary and gases filling the house who could really say how noxious they were thirteen none of it happened hed finished off all the whisky in the flask what could she say to that after all that had happened he gave the flask a final glance sorrowful or contemptuous too dark for her to tell before stowing it away in an inside pocket of his overcoat erm before we over react are you quite sure about this this was the first time hed spoken since they got into the car juanita spun the wheel letting out the clutch as gently as her mood allowed feeling the ageing volvo lurch and slide back the rear wheels whirring uselessly in the mud overreact jesus christ he was accusing her of overreaction look it was diane and it was a creamcoloured range rover who else do we know who has cream range rovers there was a gloved hand over her mouth did i tell you that to stop her screaming when she said that juanita tasted oil someone trying to stop her screaming her throat was swollen and her bottom lip felt like a slashed tyre look would you mind giving me a push she hauled on the handbrake still not looking at him please he got out without a word by the time they were free of the rut he was creaking like an old bulldozer rankin hed have sent rankin jesus he sent the staff to snatch his daughter can you believe that this is not the night jim battle said to ask me what i can or cant believe it was still hard to categorise her emotions when theyd come down from the tor anger shame embarrassment appalled relief was close the others came later were still coming in waves like a neveragain hangover neither of them had spoken on the way down from the tor not until theyd emerged from the gate into wellhouse lane and the range rover had surged through their lamp beam and thered been a muffled scream and a glimpse of struggling figures in the rear wild eyes over a glove back at jims juanita had opened up the volvo and hed gone quietly into the house and emerged with the hip flask offering it to her first shed shaken her head felt unbearably tired the walk to the cottage had almost finished her but shed said im going to get her jim had climbed silently into the volvo like a buggering black comedy eh youre not laughing juanita said in a way she was grateful for this something to set her mind racing in another direction to put speed and distance between them and the humiliation she hurled the car out of wellhouse lane please he put a tentative hand on her arm slow down you know where theyre going his voice was sounding dry and old and frail a voice that couldnt laugh not a voice shed heard before yes you dont even know what youll do when you get there ill get out youll stay in the car and this time ill overreact juanita im sorry im so sorry she released the accelerator with a thud threw both arms round the wheel and hugged the car into the kerb he didnt look at her stared straight forward through the windscreen at distant lights i really thought i was going to die you know i thought you were going to die she was not going to burst into tears she was bloody not id accepted it i mean it does happen in the states and places crazy sects mass suicides inexplicable abominations i can still hardly believe im alive thats the worst of it i still think it could have happened yes he really might have done it im not just saying this i think he i think he simply changed his mind i think what i think juanita said without emotion and this is the last im going to say about it i think he actually thought the hat would be a better joke the buggering hat jim crumpled up then in the passenger seat she could sense his shoulders heaving the shock finally coming down on him like a landslide the white moon in the sickle as it descended the moment of singing silence before the gleeful chuckle i can chop it off or you can give it to me as a sacrifice as an offering to gwyn ap nudd and then ultimate surrealism and humiliating degradation the picture of jim kneeling getting his coughing over wiping his face and then solemnly presenting the man who called himself gwyn ap nudd with his soft tweed hat the last appalling image juanita saw before they pulled the oily rag out of her mouth put the lamp into her hand and prodded her on to the stony path halfway down she was violently sick then moments before the blind rage came that disgusting craven sense of relief which almost amounted to being grateful to the bastards for sparing them their lives the only sound was the volvos engine ticking over juanita was always scared to switch off at such moments in case it wouldnt start again now she slipped into second gear as jim said precisely what shed been expecting him to say sooner or later swear to me juanita swear to me youll never tell anybody about this they shouldnt get away with it jim she touched the lump in her cracked lower lip they could be charged with assault robbery with menaces one tweed hat would he ever recover his selfrespect get over his humiliation he hadnt backed down on the tor but god knows how it would look in the local papers if it ever came to court ok juanita said if you dont mention it i wont either he didnt reply she guessed he was thinking about what theyd done to her convicting himself of cowardice about to say bugger it lets nail the bastards she got in first it never happened jim thats the finish she drove steadily out of town along cinnamon lane to bowermead confrontation it was all confrontation tonight and menace gerry rankin was an ex marines officer hard shrewd and clothed for action in a barbour and a leather cap then get him juanita snapped you really are wasting your time mrs carey the hall hulked behind rankin a fortress very few lights on but then the place was better in the dark the appeal of bowermead hall sixteenth century but brutally victorianised began and ended with its misleadingly lovely name juanita said oh come on do you really want the police here rankin was smiling with closed lips leaning casually against a stone gatepost under a security light a hard light on jim who was slumped inside his overcoat like a refugee keeping his promise to say nothing the police rankin shook his head in pained disbelief to investigate an allegation that lord pennard kidnapped his own daughter diane mrs carey the police know about diane whats that supposed to mean as if she couldnt guess we all know what it means rankin said affably if that girl was a commoner like you and me shed be in a foam rubber boudoir in whats politely called a residential home she had a real chance to make something of herself and reinforce this family you mean bring in some wealth and a couple of grandchildren to consolidate the future im not going to discuss family business with you mrs carey youre not family gerry anyway youve confirmed shes here now go and get daddy tell him im offering his mentally ill daughter some care in the community rankin said you really dont understand do you lord pennard doesnt want her in the community not this community for her own good mrs carey hmmph jim shuffled inside his overcoat soul of compassion juanita glared at him rankin stiffened i dont know who you are friend but if you want to be abusive about lord p this is not the place jim grunted and moved back into the shadows of the gatepost juanita was quite glad rankin didnt know him he knew her of course because hed once been into the shop assuming it to be a general bookstore and requesting the lurid memoir of some sas hero there was silence then jim whispered perhaps we should come back in the morning rankin had good ears yeah id strongly advise that course of action im sure you would god knows what youd have done with her by then juanita strode over to the gatepost where he lounged in his wellworn barbour his leather cap shadowing his eyes but ill tell you one thing if we do come back tomorrow itll be with a bunch of reporters and a couple of tv crews he wasnt intimidated let me spell something out for you mrs carey you are not taking on the softbellied aristocracy here this is a business fighting for survival in a hard world two hundred acres and shrinking fast lots of overheads a real business mrs carey not spooky books and incense burners and fucking tarot cards we dont piss about am i making sense to you perfectly holding her afghan coat together at the neck juanita stepped back into the full glare of the security light but i do sound rather authoritative on the phone when you cant see my beads and my crystals theyll come mr rankin theyll all come the papers the radio the television they cant afford to take the chance if there is a story they wont want to have missed it i just have to wave my wand and utter the magic word pennard he went very very quiet quiet enough to hear a barn owl in the distant woods rankin gave juanita a look harder than a punch in the mouth and she almost recoiled then he turned tightly and walked away along the drive after about twenty yards he turned back to keep them in view removing something from a pocket juanita wondered not altogether fancifully if they should take cover mobile phone jim said i think youve hit the right nerve lets hope so but you havent made a friend who wants friends like that equally jim battle said who wants an enemy like that it was almost midnight when the volvo turned into chilkwell street im sorry diane was wiping her eyes im really really sorry theyre probably right i mean you never know it yourself do you nobody thinks theyre insane shut up juanita said jim battle sat behind them hunched inside his muddied overcoat juanita thought she should take him home without delay to his cottage and his canvases turps and linseed oil acted on jim like smelling salts she probably wouldnt see him for several days he had a lot to paint out of his system with diane it had been surprisingly easy rankin had come off the phone and theyd waited in silence until a familiar plump figure had appeared on the drive juanita and rankin had not looked at each other as diane had come slowly towards the gate with the security light and everything it was rather like one of those cold war movies soviet and western spies being exchanged at checkpoint charlie and then the recognition and the tears and a final glance between juanita and rankin confirming that none of this had happened juanita thought the longest night of my entire life and none of it happened diane was saying its just that im sorry ive just got to know that headlice is ok if we could just perhaps go past the camp she obviously meant the boy theyd had up against the tower who jim had sort of rescued forget it diane theyll all be back by now im not going into that field tonight not after she heard the breath go into jim whod insisted that even diane shouldnt be told theyd been on the tor tonight i mean after what happened to this guy theyre probably blaming you anyway if hes been badly hurt what can you do about it she was in no mood anyway to trust dianes assessment of the situation this was the diane whod told her on the phone yesterday that the bloody travellers were frightfully nice people once you not to know them jesus were taking jim home ok then were going back to my place diane said its just that im sort of scared for him anyway there was some sort of frightful ritual on the tor i mean with hallucinatory drugs and things i think they were using him in some way to i dont know hed been sick what i mean is he was already in a bit of a state before the rankins attacked him shit juanita said juanita warning rumble from jim he might look like a hard case diane said with the swastika on his head and everything but hes really quite you know naive and vulnerable the lights of glastonbury ahead also the turning to wellhouse lane and to don moulders bottom field fuck it juanita said and spun the wheel at first she thought she really must be hallucinating when at the entrance to the bottom field the volvos headlights found don moulder himself with a big stick and a heavyduty handlamp moulder was wearing a bulky sheepskin jacket pyjamas showed in the gap between the jacket and his wellingtons he was shining the lamp across the field juanita pulled into the side of the lane just short of the ditch stay she said sternly to diane when she got out feeling quite unsteady moulder had his back to the hedge and his stick clutched under his arm pointing down dont you be coming near me i got a twelve bore whats it fire acorns calm down don its juanita carey don moulder relaxed dont waste no bloody time do you mrs carey well im telling you now lady twas their own decision cant says im sorry mind but a deal was struck and thats that sfar as im concerned that dont entitle you nor miss diane to no money back is all im sayin they coulder had the full rime man of my word always have been he marched over to the fivebar gate and shone his lamp triumphantly into the bottom field i dont understand juanita said diane no diane had rumbled from the car and pushed past them through the gate whats to understand don moulder said as far as the beam would go the field was conspicuously empty no buses no ambulances not even debris just a single white van with pink spots diane stood in front of the van looking helplessly from side to side theyre off my land and good bloody riddance don moulder said just like they was never ere at all look thought at least id ave some shit to clean up headlice diane cried out its me its molly her voice faded into the empty night i dont understand this juanita said where have they gone thin air mrs carey don moulder cackled just like one o them bloody ufos look fourteen booksellers high street glastonbury prop juanita carey november i had to write about this danny put it all down tell someone even though im never going to send this one i cant promised jim couldnt even tell diane what happened on the tor or even that we were there last night although theres a lot shes told me in the house between one am and dawn most of it stuff i really didnt want to hear its seventhirty a m i havent been to bed you dont even want to imagine what i look like dianes taken a cup of chocolate couldnt supply hot carob to the spare room with instructions not to emerge until lunchtime andoh yes the morning paper just came western daily press with at the bottom of page one the item of news that explained everything apparently the conservative party last night chose the man it wants to replace our mp sir laurence bowkett who has announced he wont be fighting another general election due to his advancing arthritis the new prospective parliamentary candidate for mendip south is one archer ffitch son and heir of prominent glastonbury landowner the viscount pennard get it theres archer smarming his way through a selection meeting while his wayward sister is camped on the outskirts of with a bunch of travelling vagrants living off the state and worshipping heathen gods well imagine if the press gets of this so lord p sends rankin and son off to don moulders field moulder having presumably tipped him off to remove the troublesome child by night as discreetly as possible ok so one of the vagrants gets beaten up in the process big deal hardly going to report the assault to the police are they and even if they did its one of the accepted hazards of the travelling life getting punched around by local vigilantes etc of course i could report it myself respectable high street businessperson well no officer i didnt personally witness the assault on the poor traveller by lord pennards man but i have it on the very highest authority the hon diane ffitch actually you know the one they call lady loony added to which i could hardly reveal how i found out about diane without telling the whole story and obviously after what happened i may have nightmares about it for years to come im not what you might call terribly welldisposed towards these particular new age gypsies anyway keep shtumm then say nothing to nobody try and forget it thats the answer always benefit from talking things over with you danny actually thats the easiest problem to sort out the big one is tucked up in the spare bedroom dreaming of past lives when we got in i lit the woodstove i didnt need one especially at that time of night but you cant talk meaningfully in front of an empty grate and i really wanted to know why what was the silly little cow doing with people like that im no wiser what i got was diane at her most infuriatingly fey i heard about dreams and visions and portents including a vinegar shaker in a fish and chip shop which magically resolved itself into a little glastonbury tor i heard again the story of the third nanny who diane believes to be the spirit of the high priestess of avalon dion fortune half a century dead the truth is i cant take this stuff anymore even rather read colonel pixhills diary at least the old boy was a confirmed pessimist i used to think that at the very worst new age was fun i got a buzz out of being the mysterious woman who sold books full of arcane secrets and therefore i must know most of them i dont really know precisely when i stopped getting a buzz out of it or precisely why but i suspect that seeing what it had done to diane was at least a factor when your birth coincides with the death of your mother and your father blames you for that and you grow up in an allmale household of the worst kind you become susceptible to the most absorbent kind of fantasy and you start to live in your head most of the time and when whats outside of your head happens to be glastonbury on the legendary isle of avalon and every time you look out of your bedroom window there s the magical tor on the horizon what hope is there for you because she could always escape into her secret world diane let her family bounce her around from relative to relative boarding school to boarding school never known any other life thought it was quite normal suddenly at the age of twentyseven she wakes up m yorkshire in an arranged job with an arranged marriage on the horizon and she thinks this is ridiculous im a grown up now a person in my own right for the first time a rebel she finds a suitably outrageous way out sends back her ring joins the raggletaggle gypsies been a long time coming most of her contemporaries made their absurd gestures of independence at the age of about sixteen and because she really knows this is a fairly adolescent kind of stunt diane has to make it significant by throwing the esoteric cloak over everything oh it was meant part of the great cosmic design i was summoned back i had magic signals from the tor its my destiny well bullshit obviously but if she goes around telling people about it at this end of town theyll just all screech wow too much man far out and set her up as avalons seer of the week meanwhile indigenous locals will shake their heads and mutter about what an awful cross old pennard has to bear with that lady loony and heres me in the middle again pennard already hates me for exposing an unstable child to an unlimited supply of occult literature i hate me for that as well but it couldve been worse she might have gone to ceridwen and now ive blackmailed the noble lord into letting the family madwoman loose in glastonbury again and he and archer are going to be in a constant state of tension about what she might do to discredit the house of pennard before the next election and when the ffitches get tense as amply demonstrated last night they can do damage the british aristocracys full of genetic anomalies and archer well hes sort of diane in negative i suppose hard and dark where shes nice and squashy and sort of pastelcoloured but just as loopy i reckon in his way everything in glastonbury inevitably becomes extreme who said that me i suppose new age mystic turned bornagain agnostic id decided that healthy scepticism was the key to survival in this town but if you re a sceptic whats the point of being here anyway should i get out now do you think before something erupts i dont know maybe i need a man again maybe i need a guru or god talking of whom im told the bishop of bath and wells has been making overtures to the new age community theres to be some sort of conference at which liberal christians are to interface with well intentioned green pagans to try and build a framework for possible spiritual bonding in the run up to the third millennium only in glastonbury are we all going mad or what and can anybody out there help us dont answer that cant anyway if im not sending it goodnight whats left of it part two the pseudooccultism of the present day with its dubious psychism wild theorising and evidence that cannot stand up to the most cursory examination is but the detritus which accumulates around the base of the mount of vision dion fortune sane occultism one harmless the welsh border it was a moody frontier town squashed between dark english hills and even darker mid wales hills the stone cottage was at the end of a deepsunk dirt track two three miles beyond the huddled town of kington locating the place by car had been a problem for publisher ben corby who hadnt travelled much outside london for a couple of yean now except on planes and who had always despite his enthusiasm for the old golden land found the countryside basically hostile so this place immediately gave him the creeps it was a low cottage barrackblock long the last of the light making its windows opaque and sinister like mafia sunglasses no sooner had he switched off the ignition than something came rushing out at his car a black and white dog or maybe a big cat something disturbing about it the way it moved ben nervously wound his window down as a shadow edged around a door at one end of the long cottage ok arnold was the voice familiar was it him bens headlights showed that the animal was in fact a dog and that it had only three legs uncanny the disabled dog was just sitting there in the headlights not barking not even blinking ben didnt get out a threelegged dog was probably a dog with a grudge its a friend the dog was told by the shadow possibly possibly hed come to the right place then and the author of the old golden land was evidently prepared for the worst half an hour later relieved to be out of the wild country and by a warmish woodfire with a can of lager on the arm of his chair ben came in his blunt yorkshire fashion to the point be suicide mate for all of us the dog lay on his intact side eyes open and a furry stump pointing at ben as if it was his fault the dog having only three legs if we go with this we might as well pulp our entire backcatalogue britains premier new age publisher does not put out a book advising people to hang up their dowsing rods and trade in their tarot cards for a pack of happy families the dog lay on a sheepskin rug under a table with a converted paraffin lamp on it next to this ben had dumped joes manuscript mythscapes the old golden land revalued joe powys stared into the fire ben thought wheres his woman why just him and a threelegged dog hed been on at joe to write a book about what really happened at crybbe and joe had said nobody would believe it hed agreed finally to produce a followup to his new age classic the old golden land and here it was and the bloody thing was antinew age not to say anti meditation antifortune telling antighosthunting but only as much as hitler had been antisemitic so joe how do you propose to live powys raised his eyebrows hair fully grey now prematurely just about but the face on the back of the book could still help unload a few thousand copies on wispy wistful ladies youre still a young youngish guy and almost you cant deny it a cult figure once an icon so ok youve had a change of heart unfortunately a seriously uncommercial one you want to talk about it this was a phrase ben corby had learned never to use to an author whose book hed turned down the bastards always wanted to talk about it at length but this one he did want to know about what turns a wispy mystic into a hardened sceptic dont make me feel bad powys said you drive all this way to bring me a customised rejection slip because were old mates right well im sorry old mate but how can you write a book you wouldnt have the nerve to go out and promote and say you believe in it you have got to be kidding ben said i can name you at least powys held up both hands to stop him he was sitting on the arm of the overstuffed sofa his white tshirt merging with the white wall so it looked as if he was only semimaterialised only half there the woodfire was tucked away in an inglenook books to the ceiling either side of it above the fireplace there was a framed photograph of an old man with a clerical collar and a big white beard and another one full length of a slender woman with pale hair something told ben both of these people were dead he stared hard at powys so what is it you dont believe in apart from ghosts leylines mysterious forces in the landscape on another wall was a framed print of an intoxicating samuel palmer moonlit cornfield the kind of scene you associated with the old golden land ben remembered when they were students and joe powys had discovered the enchanted world of standing stones and mysterious mounds and beacon hills lighting up boring old britain for a whole bunch of them even ben for a while the guy just had that gift poet of the unexplained fairies witchcraft ufos powys didnt reply he went into his cupboardsize kitchen and returned with a sixpack of heineken export he detached a can from the pack and passed it across to ben his face blank ben remembered how this cottage had been left to joe powys by henry kettle the old water diviner whose own motto had been nothing psychic nothing psychic this is not something you can talk about sober said ben am i right now im not trying to advise you dont think that i dont want you to do anything goes against your religion joe powys saw that ben was fairly pissed arnold watching him with some disapproval his late master henry kettle had drunk only sparingly on the basis that you couldnt dowse under the influence as far as arnold was concerned this was still henrys house powys leaned down and patted him its ok this man is a publisher powys remembered sitting in a pub with ben corby just after the max goff organisation epidemic had bought dolmen rooks and ben had said its time for the new age to grab the world by the balls business talk ben corby had made a lot of money selling books about healing rays and ancient wisdom had actually made a lot of money out of joe powys its just youre a hero to these people ben said the tens of thousands of decent well meaning if totally humourless punters who buy dolmen books by the handful to stick on the shelf under sprigs of aromatic herbs and if their longtime guru starts telling them about seers who need glasses and not to trust their little bodies to spiritual healers theyre hang on gotta have a slash the stairs rose from the living room when ben had gone up powys kneeled down and took arnolds black and white head between his hands and stared into the dogs eyes what do we do arnold hes going to dump me no more choice cuts back to the tex chunks economy size but you kind of knew he would powys didnt you you knew he was never going to publish a book which proves crystals rarely work and the st michael line is a con yes i did arnold he wished fay was here fay had this direct broadcasters way of putting things fay would convey to ben corby precisely why this book was not as expected another dollop of new age blancmange because fay had been at crybbe she was programme controller at offas dyke radio now she hated local radio but she needed people ordinary people who were concerned about town planning cartheft more hospital beds and railcutbacks fay had a flat in hereford she came back most weekends but she didnt like it out here anymore he could tell shed gone right off the countryside ben had said why the hell do you stay here its so bloody primitive if henry left it to you why dont you just sell it i cant sell it powys said its arnolds house too hes a dowsers dog he has a feel for this place now that said ben delightedly is a wonderfully new age thing to say im embarrassed but you dont believe any of it anymore powys sighed this was it with publishers they never read anything properly not after theyd made the entirely arbitrary decision that it was going in the wrong direction henrys old pendulum clock struck eight the night was young he was going to have to go into this look he didnt not believe he accepted totally that there were things out there but who was really equipped to mess with them the trancemediums whod call up your grandad so he could tell you about the missing socks the kirlian photographers whod do your etheric body for the family album or what about the dowsers not henry kettle henry had been overcautious if anything for years hed dowse only for water wouldnt get into anything he was unsure of but now youve got all these bastards been at it for about six months and theyre claiming to feel the earths pulse energy dowsing everybodys a bloody energy dowser suddenly everybodycan tune into the earth force sunday ramblers new age travellers yeah yeah ben snapped his way into another can of lager but its all harmless i mean it cant hurt anybody he stopped sensing the change in powyss mood arnold got to his three feet and began a low growl its ok arnold powys said i cant kill a man when hes pissed ben corby looked warily at arnold and then back at powys what did i say you said harmless powys tossed a log on to the fire crushing the embers of the last one and sending up a splash of red sparks they go to totnes and they go to glastonbury and theyre like kids in toys r us its like theyve been given a new age credit card think ill have a go at that hypnoregressive therapy next week damn really must have the old aura resprayed and its all natural no drugs no artificial sweeteners totally harmless he held up the poker its tip glowing with heatenergy theyll stand in a stone circle on midsummer night and call down the supreme atavistic power of the horned god right but you offer them a bag of crisps containing monosodium glutamate and its like you pulled a gun on them whats that tell us jesus said ben its a pitiful sight an old new ager whos lost his lifeforce yeah pass me another lager none left old son got another pack in the fridge how many packs did we drink three and half a bottle of some filthy liqueur in that case no listen ben said if you insist on doing this ill show it to the guy upstairs god no you pillock we belong to harveycalder now as you know since goffs untimely demise and being the smallest leastcredible part of this big faceless mindless publishing conglomerate were naturally in the basement and the literary guys treat us like shit powys smiled some joker hung windchimes outside our door ben said gloomily bastards but theres this not bad guy upstairs in charge of harveys general nonfiction called dan frayne if he publishes it its no skin off dolmens nose ill show it to him oh joe powys stood up feeling confused and a little cool air through the peeling patch in the left knee of his jeans well thanks thanks ben dont thank me said ben corby who didnt believe in anything you couldnt get into a wallet just because i dont want you to starve doesnt mean i dont think youre a complete arsehole ben slept or tried to in a spare room about the size of a double coffin no soothing traffic noise that was the problem no police and ambulance sirens en route to somebody elses crisis it was very still and very dark the panes in the little square window were opaque like slates there was no noise at all from outside nothing no owls no wind through trees no branches tapping on the glass only the creak from the bed when he turned over it would have made no difference it would have made no difference if thered been a forceten gale blowing or a fox had got into somebodys chicken shed it would have made no difference if a plane had crashed in the woods hed still have heard it hed still have awoken around three in the morning with a chill running up his back from his arse to his fuzzedup brain no question there was no sound quite like this for putting the shits up you ben didnt move again until he heard another door open across the passage and joe powyss loud whisper arnold no leave it ben rolled then from under his duvet snatched up his bathrobe staggered to the door crouching because of the thought of beams the way you did in the car going under a low bridge even though you knew there was plenty of room as he felt his way out to the landing the ceiling light blinked on in its little pot shade lowpowered but dazzling at first the vibrating dots resolved into joe powys in his tshirt and briefs standing very still a hand on the switch on the wall at the top of the stairs ben his voice thick said whats up with him but before joe powys could reply another long rolling howl began welling from the foot of the stairs went on and on spooky as hell i didnt think dogs did that in real life ben said stupidly powys started to go downstairs into the living room halflit from the landing and ben followed him because shit what if powys went out of the house and left him here on his own they were halfway down when the crash came a classic splintering crash of exploding glass ben was clutching at powyss arm hissing fucking burglars swivelling his head looking for a weapon like he was going to find a poker in a stand at the top of the stairs or a baseball bat hanging from the wall the crash seemed to go on and on with a coda of rolling splinters the dog was silent its over powys said ben stared at him couldnt move powys padded barefoot down the rest of the stairs mind the glass ben said weakly halflight from the landing was the best they could hope for the paraffin lamp converted to electricity had been converted to glass shards and dented tin it was in the middle of the floor still rolling ben looked fearfully around the room nothing seemed amiss apart from the lamp in the grate the fire was almost burned out one ashy log glinting like a red foil sweet paper on the chimney breast over the inglenook the two pictures of the old vicarguy and the woman with ash blonde hair were perfectly in place so quiet now ben could hear his own nervy staccato breaths trying to convince himself this was another of powyss scams that hed crept down in the night maybe balanced the lamp on the very edge of the table joe powys hadnt said a word he was standing by the fireplace looking at the two photos ben looked too and oh fucking hell his leg muscles turned to porridge you just did that didnt you powys just looked sad ben went up close peered horrified at the pictures and then backed off with his hands out like hed opened a door and a blast of winter had hit him full in the chest he fell back on the sofa hands on his knees as if glued there tell me they arent he said joe went over to the pictures and carefully turned each one the right way up its ok its happened before ben said you have to get out of here joe no powys smiled i know where i am with this who are they those people the old bloke with the beard is fays dad canon peters dead and the woman was called rachel girlfriend shes dead too i didnt know her long enough to put a label on it we keep the pictures up there to remind us in case we get blase about certain things ben put his hands over his face rubbed his eyes wheres the dog under the table on his rug maybe he upset the table knocked the lamp off could be said powys no it fucking couldnt ben found himself breathing hard again closest he could remember ever being to hysteria and anyway why was he howling he often howl like that sometimes why dyou say its over just now on the stairs he still felt too weak to get up from the sofa hang on powys said whats arnold got he got down on all fours scrabbled about under the table and came up with something a book a big fat heavy book now this is new he said nervously was that a quiver of nerves under the voice this never happened before he looked up and ben followed his gaze to the very top bookshelf under a big black beamend to the left of the fireplace there was just enough light to show up a gap in the middle of the shelf the other books apparently stiff and firm to either side it fell off ben said it fell on to the lamp yeh looks like it powyss voice was dry and flaky like the ash in the grate he held out the book for ben it was a real doorstop about three inches thick probably over a thousand pages ben couldnt prise his hands from his knees to take it but he could see the title in faded gold down the spine the authors name across it the surname in big capitals powys and because he knew joe had never written anything half that long he figured this must be john cowper powys novelist mystic nutter the title in smaller lettering confirmed it a glastonbury romance ben was bewildered spooked almost out of his head a book just one big heavy book flies off the top shelf a good nine feet across the fucking room smashes a lamp smashes the only source of light whats it mean i dont know joe powys said he put a hand on the mantelpiece to stop the hand shaking but its all harmless isnt it he said two strange place but good fun as ben ate his breakfast in joes living room he kept glancing up at the bookshelves searching out the middle of the top row you could read the lettering on the spine easily at least the part that said powys he buttered his toast edging his chair a few inches to the left lets talk about john cowper powys oh said powys uncle jack uncle jack uncle fucking jack youre telling me after all these years that jcp well i dont know thats the truth he had a complicated personal life you can say that again ben had lain wide awake and cold for what seemed like hours thinking on and off about john cowper powys hed never actually read a glastonbury romance but hed read one of the shorter ones not much credibility for a new age publisher whod never read much jcp and found it actually not that bad for something published half a century ago joe being a descendant of the great man was just a possibility theyd hinted at in publicity for golden land and never taken that seriously he died in what sixtyfive sixtythree powys said lived in north wales his later years with this woman whod been his secretary or something right and you were born wrexham in theory he could have been my father but i dont think he was up to it by then my mother used to talk about an uncle jack who was a famous author but in those days close friends of your parents were always aunties and uncles and jack was a common name then you remember ever seeing the old guy when you were a kid powys shook his head you never ask about him when you grew up once not long before my mother died i asked her about this uncle lack the famous author i said because id heard of cowper powys by then was he by any chance possessed of a middle name beginning with c ben put down the marmalade and she said she said uncle jack what uncle jack shit but you could find out maybe who would it help listen ben glanced at the bookshelf lowered his voice suppose he wants you to what establish the link get lost said powys youre leaping to conclusions a book falls off the shelf halfway across the room and the dog howling these things happen best thing is not to react stone me ben hissed at his toast in frustration it was only a book nobody got hurt not just a book powys not just a book ok what else we got glastonbury when were you last in glastonbury never been ben put down his knife in astonishment youve never been to glastonbury the world centre for earth mysteries glastonbury tor and all the ufos healing rays the abbey ruins the st michael line the st michael lines spurious youve never been to glastonbury well you know powys stood up and started gathering plates together he seemed uncomfortable about this i read the romance the first time when i was quite young much of it i didnt understand isnt it all about sex yeh it is really mysticism and sex and how they can both screw you up it didnt make me want to go to glastonbury made me want to avoid it its a powerful book though tells you a lot about jcp things you might not want to know if theres a possibility you were related he had some runny ideas but where did he get them powys said did he force his ideas on glastonbury or did it force them on him strange place but good fun we sell a lot of books there as you would dont knock it its all har ben stopped himself and looked up at the shelf had it moved just a fraction of a centimetre keep on saying it powys said maybe thats best no more than an hour after ben had gone back to london the phone rang and it was fay shed said she was coming over this weekend from hereford she was supposed to have come last weekend but the bloke who owned offas dyke radio had apparently arrived in town and she had to stick around for meetings powys had thought this was an excuse and that there was something else in the air she wasnt telling him about fay said now joe and when she said joe he knew it was going to be heavy most of the time she called him powys people did it was a better name than joe had more resonance whisper it and it sounded as if you were calling the cat joe fay said its ive been offered a job at the bbc world service london wanted fay back there was what they called a six month attachment for a features producer sixmonth attachments at the bbc were hard to come by these days now it was run like ici she said what did he think he said what was he supposed to say that he thought she ought to take it he was about to say he was likely to be down in london himself soon seeing this publisher and maybe they could or maybe they shouldnt joe powys was feeling very alone fay was the only person who understood their relationship had involved a lot of comforting each other of saying listen youre not out of your mind and in the end the reassurances had themselves served as reminders of how bad it had been and reminders were useful except for those invoking books thrown from shelves fay said theyd see each other properly and arnold and everything before she went well good god youre only going to london ah said fay it wasnt just london the world service was planning some kind of trans global christmas linkup under the working title peace on earth fay would be involved in producing the european end from brussels and places ah powys said and then theres a few other things paris amsterdam back in march fay said probably sounds brilliant he said hoping shed think the hoarseness was on the line do it dont look back but she said what about him fine he said really and he told her about the book the book that ben corby was passing on to this guy frayne at harveycalder not the book which came off the shelf sailed halfway across the room and smashed the lamp thats wonderful powys fay said so you could be back in business then and there was a silence and then the conversation became rather weepy later that morning powys went for a walk with arnold they climbed to the top of the hill behind the longhouse arnold indignant at being carried part of the way from here you could see along offas dyke the earthwork which used to mark the boundary between england and wales but was only an approximation these days the dyke itself was not exactly the great wall of china and probably never had been it was just a symbol of an old division in the old golden land powys had argued that borders were very sensitive places where the veil yes that veil was especially thin it was a place where you might expect to have extraordinary experiences so what was he still doing here hiding he said aloud hiding out but had something found him he had arnolds ball in his jacket pocket and arnold knew it usually arnold would race about after it proving hed never really needed four legs anyway today he stuck close to powys it was fay whod rescued arnold from the dog pound after henry kettle the dowser died in the car crash fay was small like a terrier shed held on as long as she could now in taking the london job she had in theory cut powys loose as well hed told ben he was still here because it was arnolds home and ben had said that was a wonderfully new age thing to say but it wasnt really true he looked back down at the cottage mrs whitney next door was hanging out towels on her washing line mrs whitney had known fay wasnt coming back he could tell by her expression lets go arnie home home when they got back to the cottage arnold stood in the doorway and growled powys made his senses go dead and uncaring or at least that was the message he sent to himself its nothing it doesnt matter its irrelevant the big black book lay in the centre of the hearth this time its spine split part three on wearyall hill the long low spur jutting out into the marshes the first firm ground between avalon and the sea in those days joseph set foot on english land and he drove his staff into the warm red westland soil as he took possession of our islands for the spiritual kingdom of his lord a realm not made with hands eternal in the heavens dion fortune avalon of the heart one mystery avalon out says candidate a bitter attack on the new age subculture of glastonbury has been made by the man chosen by south mendip tories as their next parliamentary candidate the hon archer ffitch son of local landowner viscount pennard says the town will become a national joke unless it stops encouraging cranks mr ffitch won a standing ovation from constituency party members when he told them we must seize the future and stop mooning about our mythical past he said the town had become saturated with pseudo mystics many of whom were blatantly pagan and had become a mecca for new age travellers as a result local house prices had dropped and businesses were reluctant to invest in the town even the boundary signs identified glastonbury as the ancient isle of avalon in acknowledgement of a probably bogus legend mr ffitch said if the local authority wants a new slogan ill give them one glastonbury first avalon out mr ffitchs remarks followed his formal acceptance of you bastard jim battle muttered as dusk settled like mud around the red roofs his first thought was to screw the evening post into a ball and ram it into the nearest litter bin instead he folded it into his saddle bag he would show it to juanita if he could face her hed waited until the end of the day before cycling into town nothing to do with not wanting to show his face in daylight for fear of people pointing at him thats him thats the bloke who was executed last night ho ho wheres your hat jim nobody would of course nobody knew and nobody would find out even the buggering travellers had spirited themselves away he wouldnt have to face anyone except for juanita and his own hatless head reflected in shop windows perhaps his humiliation on the tor had been a small payback for his selfindulgence in fleeing the city to reside amid ancient mystery how bloody pat would have enjoyed it the invasion of jims little idyll a barbarians blade over his throat as it turned out nobody commented even on the premature departure of the travellers the report of archer ffitchs speech had greater implications this is the kind of chap we need said colin border in the offlicence pointing to the posts picture of archer looking severe but dynamic what ive been saying for years how can you hope to attract new industry to a town where half the potential workforce appear to be potsmoking sun worshippers fourteen pounds p please jim wrapping jims bottle of scotch in brown paper wont be terribly popular down the street though jim put his money on the counter lot of new age types running quite profitable businesses now what vegetarian sandwich bars and poky shops specialising in bloody overpriced gimcrack jewellery thats supposed to have healing powers give me a marks and spencer any day not that archerll be losing any support in that direction most of these halfwits throw away their votes on the green party and the rest are bound to be labour the odd one or two libdems whats he got to lose nailing his colours to the mast from the outset i like that hmm jim said because of the way he dressed and his disapproval of thieving travellers people like colin assumed he must be as reactionary as they were i like this bit jim listen to this glastonbury enshrines the idea of a strong english and christian tradition within an established solidly prosperous country town it stands for the old values whereas avalon said mr ffitch is a place which exists only in legends and folklore it has been adopted by those who choose to turn their backs on the real world to inhabit a drugsodden cloudcuckoo land where no one has to work for a living and traditional family values are laughed at yes said jim quite he picked up his bottle and got out of there before he exploded outside he looked down the street to where the lights of the new age shops began he saw a twinkling display of assorted crystals he saw tarot cards and dreamy relaxation tapes and a lone twilight candle burning in the window of the wicked wax co well all right one or two of the windows were rather lurid some of the owners a little erm eccentric but that candle for instance symbolised something important something close to the essence of it all something archer ffitch wouldnt understand and many of his supporters wouldnt realise until it was too late jim folded the evening paper jammed it under his arm and mooched off towards the george and pilgrims he needed a couple of drinks you bastard ffitch he murmured why must you murder the mystery the woman with hair the colour of old gold was drifting around the shop with her hands out palms down like a priest vaguely searching for children to bless i dont quite know she said i dont quite know what im looking for diane thought that went for an awful lot of people in this town the woman was frightfully beautiful in an ethereal sort of way must be wonderful to be ethereal being slim and elegant would of course be a start juanita would know the woman had a long slender nose she looked down it at diane juanita would know at once well shell be back in a short while diane said juanita had tramped wearily off to see her reflexologist leaving diane in charge of the shop just like old times really except that juanitas weariness used to be feigned and after a glass of wine shed be fine again full of ideas and energy last night she and jim had seemed bowed and burdened and today jim hadnt been round juanita had glossed over how they just happened to be walking up wellhouse lane when the range rover went past she said that awful split lip had been caused by a flying log chip when she was chopping wood for the stove whatever really happened diane thought its all my fault she gestured hopelessly at the shelves of books the arrangements had changed a lot since she was last here perhaps if you gave me an idea the woman whirled on her she was about thirty with a lean peremptory home counties accent that didnt go with her appearance at all celtic manuscripts what sort of book of kells the woman looked horrified thats christian isnt it no no no no no what i need urgently are the very earliest images i can find of the goddess you havent been here long have you what a nerve diane thought you live here all your life and someone who moved in maybe six months ago im helping out she said tightly which goddess she wanted to ask a decision seemed to have been taken that all the goddesses from artemis to kali to isis should be combined into a single symbol of woman power for this woman perhaps it wasnt so much about spirituality as a kind of politics just like the pilgrims really wherever they were now the woman pirouetted again hands exploring the air as if she could somehow divine the book she wanted her rich golden hair was a tangle of abandoned styles rippling waves and ringlets did she always behave like this diane wondered or was she on something as though shed picked up dianes thoughts from the ether the golden woman leaned across the counter and smiled widely her eyes were somewhere else im the artist she declared and then stepped back as though this was some sort of epiphany a moment of wondrous selfdiscovery and you are im diane do you acknowledge the goddess you should you know she can help you with what with her weight problem as though spiritual development was just another aspect of health and beauty what are you doing tonight the woman demanded homing in on promising raw material come with me im in holy thorn ceramics across the street domini dorrell adams come with me and meet the goddess gosh was this an order the woman leaned sinuously across the counter again ill call for you shall i at seven oh well diane said ive a sort of you know commitment tonight you should make a commitment to the goddess the very landscape of avalon is shaped in her image did you know that theres just no place better in the world to learn how to be a woman she drifted to the door remember the cauldron she sang carelessly as though she was dropping a pamphlet behind her right diane whispered as the door got into the mood and glided shut she actually did remember the cauldron formed not long before shed been dispatched to yorkshire by a rather dominant woman calling herself ceridwen who used to be a witch and had a divination consultancy fortunetelling booth somewhere at the rear of the glastonbury experience arcade juanita never the sisterly type didnt like her at all diane wished juanita would come back she felt exposed and nervous when anyone came into the shop and yet she didnt want to leave it imagining gwyn and his sickle among the freaks outside st johns imagining a cream range rover screeching into the high street kerb a gloved hand over her face shed slept last night in juanitas spare bedroom it had been rather blissy actually being in a soft bed again after that sleeping bag in the van juanita had said she could stay as long as she liked awfully kind but there were questions to be asked and pretty urgent ones like what was she going to do with no money no job and the kind of family that was probably worse than having no family why had she been called back what were they trying to tell her the lights and symbols in the sky the pungent scent of old avalon and most disturbing of all last nights dark and horrific exhibition in the night sky while the pilgrims performed what sounded horribly like a satanic ritual where had the pilgrims gone and most worrying of all what had happened to headlice shed half thought of going to the police which would immediately implicate rankin and her father and cause the most awful fuss possibly for nothing hippies and gypsies are like dogs give one a good kicking and itll simply limp off into the undergrowth until its recovered worse than having no family at all back home and a stranger the goldenhaired woman had thought she was a stranger the town seemed different juanitas weariness appeared to be general there was that atmosphere of torpor you found during the blight the period towards the end of summer when stagnant heat seemed to stick like toffee to the somerset levels except this was november and it wasnt heat so much as a lack of cold no breeze no vigour the people she recognised as they walked past the window seemed conspicuously older the shop door pinged open then and diane looked up in alarm half expecting to see gerry rankin with a chloroform pad diane the customer yelled sheesh wow its true you are back he was wearing this awful homeknitted baggy scarlet sweater that stopped just above his knees which you could see through the splits in his jeans his beard was a little more grey a little more wispy his hair had all but vanished from the front making his ponytail look pretty silly but his smile was still as wide as his face oh gosh woolly its so good please woolly drew himself up to his full fivefootfive assumed a dignified expression councillor woolaston if you dont mind diane gasped a hand went to her mouth oh no gosh really you didnt hear last may my love old hippy shakes the establishment electoral shock rocks glastonbury as longestserving councillor bites dust pretty wild huh im on three committees planning environmental health and er i forget the other but its really heavy and influential diane hugged him she could quite easily get her arms all the way round i cant believe it yeah well said woolly neither can griff daniel if one of his lorries is tipping out a load of bricks these days i stand well clear diane was thrilled over the years three candidates from the alternative sector had stood against their old enemy and been heavily beaten by the local votes whoever had thought of putting woolly up it had been truly inspired he might be an old hippy but he was a local hippy the natives sometimes despaired of him but they couldnt help liking him and they knew he was ever so honest its just incredible said diane its not that incredible woolly tried to look hurt but yeah if griff hadnt had this bit of hassle over jerrybuilding over somerton way and if it hadnt like found its way into the gazette whoops aw shit man alls fair in love and politics how long you been back since yesterday didnt you hear about it yeah woolly admitted with a crooked smile course i heard about it just us politicians got to be a bit guarded nothing wrong with the travellers most of em that your van with the pink spots nice one pity theyve all gone mind id like tove seen archers face and your old man what diane said had it got out about her being snatched from the camp aw come on youre saying you really dont know dont know what sheesh woolly dragged a stool across to the counter what a fucking family he didnt tell you about archer being put up as tory candidate for mendip south oh gosh i didnt know woolly i really didnt i didnt know he was even in the running clever the way theyre timing it woolly said idea being presumably that he stands in for old bowkett at this dinner and that garden fete and soon hes so well integrated that come electiontime half the votersll think hes already the serving mp geddit ah it was all falling into place this was a crucial time for archer her father would have been picturing the headlines candidates sister is newage traveller a picture of archer shaking hands with the prime minister and another one of diane in her moon skirt standing in front of a white van with big pink spots no wonder theyd acted so ruthlessly no wonder rankin hadnt cared who got hurt it was also no wonder theyd handed her over when juanita started threatening them with the press and tv handed over good god what sort of hostage had she become im not gonner ask what went wrong up in yorkshire look woolly said not any of our business but im glad youre back diane man gonner need all the support we can get over this road business if the public inquiry goes against us is that likely a sham that inquiry they wont admit it but this is the first stage in linking somerset into the euro superhighway biggest environmental threat in britain today nightmare some of the finest countryside in the world sacrificed to the juggernaut once theyve started therell be no end to it be nowhere to walk except from your house to your car and no garden in between woolly laughed embarrassed sorry when you get on the council you stop talking to people normally you just make speeches what you got here he started turning over the pages of shadow of angels a glossy new book about the st michael line mainly pictures handsome but superficial hey i heard this thing was out lets see if im in the index woolly was glastonburys biggest expert on leys and earthforces which said quite a lot as there was no town in britain with more leylines or indeed ley line experts per square yard yeah woolaston e t pages three pages sheesh i shoulda charged this lady specially as shes rubbished it apparently they dress it up in a lovely jacket with romantic photos and a little bit of text that ends up saying the line probably dont exist anyway we followed it diane said the convoy we went from church to church all the way from the abbey at bury st edmunds stopping at the avebury circle and all those places and she stopped suddenly remembering something headlice had said last night in his manic mudsplashed letsgetoutofhere state who the pilgrims woolly spread his hands well thats good innit travelling the line near as you can it helps keep the energy flowing here listen to this a resident of glastonbury edward woolly woolaston walks the full length of the line from st michaels mount to bury every five years in what has become a personal ritual when im too old to walk ill find somebody to push me says woolaston who has been studying linear configurations in the west country landscape for over twentyfive years woolly closed the book and sighed picture of me too she made me wear the woolly hat and the long scarf the full sixties throwback bit i dont mind i just wish these clever gits would try and understand that while the line might not work out exactly on the map it does in here woolly patted his chest and diane thought at once of headlice looking up the tor from don moulders meadow and announcing i can feel it here punching his chest through his pitifully torn clothing and later minutes before he was attacked in moulders field hed said and no more stopping at churches goin in backwards theyd made a point on gwyns direction of stopping at every church on the st michael route as well as many of the old stones and burial mounds theyd made headlice go in backwards hey dont worry woolly was wearing one of his huge grins patting her arm were not gonner let em deport you this time you got councillor woolaston behind you now kid not going back with the pilgrims are you i dont even know where they are it was just a way of getting here i suppose woolly didnt question it to woolly everything in life was about getting here so youre ok then i mean in the shop oh yes but diane wasnt too certain she couldnt help imagining another unsuitable headline candidates sister works in occult bookshop not quite so detrimental to archers prospects but archer didnt like anything at all in his way not if it could be removed you know i think im gonner buy this book after all woolly said how much he turned the book over sheesh thats a bit steep im sure juanita would want me to knock a pound or so off said diane but woolly looked stem councillor woolaston never trades on friendship ill pay full whack woolly pulled out a pink and blue canvas wallet searched through it looked up did his grin er slight cash flow problem i can give you a tenner bring the rest tomorrow diane smiled and put the book in a paper bag for him tis good to have you back my love said woolly sincerely verity loved dame wanda carlisles house it was everything meadwell was not spacious and airy with sumptuous sofas and deep georgian windows letting in lots of glorious light it was also surprisingly close to the heart of the town tucked into a discreet mews behind st johns church quiet but convenient for attending talks at the town hall and the assembly rooms im totally convinced this will help you wanda large and strong and scented placed a reassuringly regal hand on veritys wrist my dear the man is said to be wonderfully charismatic verity raised a hesitant eyebrow most of wandas pronouncements were couched in similarly extravagant superlatives all great actresses verity supposed were long conditioned to project project and project i suppose all the same that i shall have to consult major shepherd nonsense darling wanda reached for the gin bottle this major shepherd its all very well for him he doesnt have to live in the blessed house so he has no right to pontificate now ill tell you what we shall do dr grainger is appearing at the assembly rooms on when wednesday oh thats tonight what a coincidence verity observed covering her wineglass with a hand no more for me thank you i shall be quite tiddly in avalon wanda mixed herself a large gin and tonic i have found that coincidence does tend to be the norm she had come to glastonbury last spring for my souls sake retaining the hampstead villa naturally because while london might be unbearable it did remind one of the need for the sanctity of avalon verity raised her eyes to the sculpted ceiling and the cutglass chandelier which threw hundreds of beautiful lightsplinters into the farthest corners she thought of the soiled bulbs of meadwell struggling against the shadows and supposed a similar comparison could be made between her and the incandescent wanda i dont know she said i dont know at all she was still flattered that such a distinguished person wellknown from the theatre and the television should have so much time for her although she suspected wanda did prefer to be with people who were rather in awe in the presence of someone manifestly powerful like ceridwen the feted actress tended to wilt into a sort of compliant vagueness verily fingered the glossy pamphlet on the occasional table the man in the photograph was shavenheaded bearded and unsmiling dr pel grainger fear of the dark a misconception an introduction to tenebral therapy dr grainger was an american author and academic who had recently moved into a barn conversion at compton dundon just a few miles away apparently his argument was that we only fear the dark because we do not fully understand its role a natural balance of darkness and light being essential for our health eyesight and spiritual development they say wanda confided that hes had all the sources of artificial light removed from his barn he has no television writes and reads only by daylight while the nights are reserved for thinking meditation sex and sleep sleep of a sublime quality attainable only by those who are truly at peace with the dark wanda raised a theatrical eyebrow about the quality of the sex one can only speculate it sounds quite interesting said verity dubiously in avalon and this is part of the magic there is always someone whatever your spiritual problem always someone near at hand all too near in wandas case her house had become the headquarters of the cauldron some of whose outer circle gatherings had been attended a trifle timidly by verity the outer circle concerned itself mainly with lectures about the role of the goddess in the modern world actually verity was becoming rather sceptical about the cauldron shed first gone along having been told the group was researching the marian tradition in glastonbury while not herself a catholic she had felt an urge to understand the power of the faith which had driven abbot whiting now she rather suspected that references to the goddess mary were something of a sop and while respecting pagan viewpoints verity had always avoided any practical involvement in that particular beliefsystem is dr grainger a pagan she asked she was very much regretting having raised the darkness problem with wanda this had been several weeks ago when the nights were drawing in and she had hoped to be invited to a social evening the actress was hosting the prime purpose of which was to introduce the recently inducted bishop of bath and wells to leaders of the new age community the new bishop was said to be keen to talk on the basis apparently that a pagan spirituality was better than no spirituality at all verify thought this was probably a positive move darling said wanda i have absolutely no idea of dr graingers spiritual orientation but if he can help you to survive in that hellhole does it really matter oh verity wanda who had taken to wearing white priestess robes about the house suddenly surged towards verity amid a billow of sleeves i do feel dont you that we are at the beginning of something quite quite momentous in wandas world it seemed to verity nothing which was less than absolutely momentous was worth getting involved in at all she smiled halfheartedly and gathered her bulky tapestry bag into her arms eight oclock then wanda decreed theres an inner circle meeting of the cauldron downstairs tonight and i would prefer to leave before they arrive otherwise i shall just be striding about as usual longing to know what theyre doing down there it must be frustrating i know verity said ceridwen had insisted that it be at least three years before an initiate was exposed to a high degree of what she called live energy very well she said eight pm darling i truly believe it will change your life said wanda two like a puma the avalonian what is that exactly god diane you make me feel so old juanita came to sit in the rocking chair a glass of white wine in hand a battered boxfile on her knees the avalonian is the magazine danny frayne and i started in about i suppose your reading wouldnt have been much beyond noddy and big ears in i think thomas the tank engine juanita raised her eyes to the parlours cracked ceiling newly bathed without makeup diane looked all of sixteen she was perched on a stool still wearing the faded skirt with the moons on it washed again and even more faded she was sipping hot chocolate from a mug both hands around it the shop was closed the shadows had consumed high street juanita was limp from the reflexologist sarah who had detected from her feet that her diaphragm was tight and her lifeforce in general needed topping up juanita wasnt sure her lifeforce had been replenished but she did feel more relaxed and she had come up with a diverting idea for the hon diane ffitch who couldnt after all be a humble shop assistant for the rest of her life paid a pittance and living out of the shop owners spare bedroom oh this sort of floaty blonde woman came in hmmm juanita had opened the boxfile and was rummaging through its contents i should have the very last issue in here very selfpossessed but quite batty domini something oh right dorrelladams she and her husband run that pot shop across the street keep mauling each other in the shop window juanita made a face i tend to find that sort of thing quite embarrassing now she scowled at herself miserable old hag that it should come to this she took out a magazine asize printed on thick paper browning with age when she held it up the paper felt dry and brittle the cover dated august featured a penand ink drawing of a mane haired woman in see through robes and a headdress of bound twigs both arms were uplifted along with her nipples towards a sunrise behind the tor it made juanita whod posed for the drawing instantly depressed in retrospect the list of contents didnt inspire her much either wells cathedral its ancient secrets unveiled crystal magic getting started on a budget wicca which witchway is your way diane put her mug on the hearth and looked at the magazine not a lots really changed in two decades has it youre kidding juanita thought sadly of her own body everything now autumn leaves secondhand books with loose pages seemed to make her think sadly of her body and her lower lip still hurt consider she said there was no animal rights movement words like shamanism werent in general usage and if there were any gay and lesbian pagan groups locally they didnt do a lot of advertising not in the avalonian anyway juanita diane said tell me about the cauldron not gay not even mildly happy avoid them juanita wiped the air ceridwen awful woman oppressive i talked to her once must be ten years ago about dion fortune i wanted to know you see if you were the reincarnation having the same initials and everything juanita sighed and what did she tell you she was very pleasant actually i bet she was but she said there were an awful lot of people whod like to think they were the reincarnation of the most powerful magician of this century i remember her standard charge was twenty pounds which id saved up from my saturday wages you gave the money i paid you to that actually she gave me ten back she said i wasnt ready for what to know one way or the other really diane you were an awfully naive kid werent you diane said it must have been frightfully exciting in dions time in the twenties i mean they felt they were on the brink of something miraculous finding the holy grail or something a bit like you and all your friends in the sixties and seventies seems to go in cycles doesnt it diane juanita said heavily i doubt theres ever been a time when some people in glastonbury didnt think they were on the brink of something miraculous thats the trick of it trick this town it plugs itself into your adrenal glands over the rainbow stuff isnt that good not said juanita if theres nothing at the end of the rainbow but a crock of shit listen the fact that yon didnt remember the avalonian is actually quite encouraging means that lots of other people wont either so if it was relaunched as a different sort of magazine not just aimed at the new age community see what im getting at juanita got up and opened the door to the darkened shop whose blind not yet down so that they could see the street through the shop window its not exactly a healthy rounded community out there a twenty something couple drifted past the shop hand in hand both partners were male one had dreadlocks the other wore short hair and a sports jacket gay pagans said diane well theyre not locals are they how many real locals do you see this end of town at night theres me i meant ordinary locals sorry but youre not not in any respect juanita closed the door i bet this towns never been as divided as it is now the locals dont want the new agers and the new agers think theyre the people whore going to inherit the holyest erthe and it doesnt matter a damn what the locals think theyve stopped even trying to understand each other admittedly there arent many locals who wouldnt swap all these little shops for a branch of marks and spencer diane put down her cup to unwrap a peppermint carob bar shed drink hot chocolate but eat only carob contrary was not the word lets face it diane theyd swap us for a mcdonalds not me i wouldnt but then they all think im bonkers its ok she bit into the carob bar one gets used to it juanita wanted to snatch the carob out of her podgy hand and bang her head on the wall how dare she get used to it listen there has to be a glimmer of light in all this think about woolly hes an old hippy but hes local and people trust him enough to put him on the council thats got to be a small step towards integration its probably just an indication diane said morosely of how many people are living in leaky houses built by griff daniel dont go cynical on me diane its not your style im sorry whats your plan juanita went down on her knees by dianes wooden stool a revamped avalonian a totally glastonbury paper that contains different viewpoints input from different sides professional unbiased diane shook her head the local people will think its just another hippy rag and theyll ignore it not if it tells them important things they didnt know like what youre the editor juanita said you tell me oh diane looked apprehensive i was wondering where all this was leading it was dark by the time jim wheeled his bike down to the bottom end of high street where the george and pilgrims stood in all its late medieval splendour to convince himself he wasnt vet a total slave to the booze hed pedalled around the town a while down benedict street round the northload roundabout weighing up whether or not he should buy a new hat on the one hand a new hat would remind him distressingly every time he put it on of what had happened to the old one on the other hand not having a hat reminded him all the time the george and pilgrims looked more like an oxford college than a boozer over the doorway were set the heraldic arms of edward iv on the hanging pub sign a fully armoured knight with a redcross shield brandished a broadsword while a bunch of standard medieval punters monks and nuns and a kid hung around in case he needed anybody to defend in the top right hand comer of the sign was the ubiquitous tor jim signalled to st george to keep an eye on his bike and went in slotting himself into a corner of the bar with a double chivas regal and looking around he listened to two elderly ladies taking tea at a table in the passage outside oh hes quite miraculous charlotte two weeks ago i could only bend it this far now see isnt that wonderful there was only one other customer in the dark woody bar young chap he thought he recognised at a particularly shadowed table on the table were a pint of bitter and a whisky chaser but before jim had had more than a couple of sips or chivas both glasses were dumped empty on the bar same again the young chap told the barman grimly he had thick black hair and a pair of small square goldrimmed glasses baggy cord trousers and a practical guernsey sweater jim recognised him now tony isnt it tony something doublebarrelled with the pottery a few doors up the street and the gorgeous if rather brittle wife im sorry blinking voice a trifle slurred oh dear and not yet seven in the evening jim knew this road all too well jim battle came into your shop when you first opened to enquire whether you were interested in displaying examples of local er fine art oh yes sure the painter tony peered at him without much interest another one civil of you thanks jim drained his glass and tony jerked a thumb at it for the barman married are you jim not at the moment jim smiled not the most original way to open a conversation in a pub hope youre not going to tell me what a lucky devil i am tony not with a wife like yours dorrelladams that was the name holy thorn ceramics tony sank a staggering quantity of his new pint still looking like a man who wasnt used to it bloody bitch he said eventually oh gosh juanita its ridiculous i only did a year and its not as if i was any good diane was pacing the tiny parlour nervously nibbling another carob bar how are you on layout subediting hopeless i was just a slightly mature trainee reporter sort of i know how to write stories sort of i know how not to commit libel probably and thats it sounds ok juanita said sam knows about layouts sam daniel griff daniels son estranged fortunately set himself up as a sort of printer with an enterprise grant desktop stuff computers but theres also a local offset plant which could turn the thing out i remember sam daniel mostly by reputation we didnt mix in the same circles hes in business in a bolshy sort of way we discussed the avalonian about a year ago i was thinking of doing it all by myself why diane sat down looking flustered because it seemed like a really nice thing to do diane juanita rolled her eyes for the town ok it wound up on the backburner as these things do but then you coming back like this it just seemed jesus god dont tell her it was a sign it would be quite a costly venture diane said you mean have i suddenly got money to throw away well the old bank balance stands at about twelve grand but i could write to danny i bought him out of the shop when he when he needed to leave which put me in the red for quite a while and fortunately he still feels bad about that also i may approach the pixhill trust diane looked blank colonel pixhill you knew him i sort of remember him my father claims he conned my grandmother over the sale of meadwell after the war father was abroad with the army at the time he was furious they kept trying to buy meadwell back but the colonel wouldnt play poor old pixhill said juanita they say he lived his last few years on fresh air to keep that place together and then when he died his family couldnt even sell it because of the pixhill trust this rickety charity seemingly run by the colonels old army pals most of them miles away diane said archer was very friendly with oliver pixhill the colonels son same school inseparable for a while oliver was apparently seriously pissed off at not being able to flog meadwell his inheritance was zilch but now they say hes a member of the trust whats it do this trust juanita perched lightly on the arm of dianes chair good works my child worthy things connected with and i quote the spreading of the light for the furtherance of peace and harmony in a troubled world does that sound like the avalonian or doesnt it theyd give you money for services rendered hang on stay right there juanita went through to the shop and unlocked the cabinet where the antiquarian tomes were kept she returned with a slim pocketsized softbacked book it had a rather drab green cloth cover i may live to regret this but youre bound to see it sometime you had to hold the book up to the light to make out the wording in black on the cover george pixhill the glastonbury diaries take it juanita said wont take you long to read gets seriously depressing towards the end but you might find you and the old guy have a certain amount er in common meaning an unhealthy obsession with certain aspects of glastonbury but at least it would show her where this sort of thing could lead diane held the little book gingerly in both hands like a child with a first prayer book whyve i never heard of this probably because its only been published a couple of months and because its never exactly been advertised you have to ask for it oh and because this is the only shop that sells it what juanita lit a cigarette bout a year ago an old buffer called shepherd major shepherd good day to you maam swans in with this dogeared manuscript wants some advice on publishing it an absolute innocent left the manuscript the only copy mind you left it with me to read im expecting some tedious old war memoirs rommel and me sort of thing diane put her knees together her elbows on her knees and her chin between cupped hands juanita stiffened her memory superimposing a plump schoolgirl with spots from too much comfort chocolate diane a dozen years ago when juanita had given her dion fortunes the sea priestess to read oh god not rommel and me juanita said although he did serve in the western desert with montgomery diane nodded eagerly as if she knew what was coming jesus juanita thought shell see it as another of those portents you probably think im pitiful tony dorrelladams said not for the first time tonight not at all my boy jim thought it was best to sound fatherly this was what he seemed to need women go through phases particularly erm particularly here for some reason actually he was bloody embarrassed chaps flung together in pubs there were after all long established ground rules about what might safely be discussed sport work the government women as a species certainly not not even after lour chivas regals your erm intimate personal problems shes a completely different person tony dorrelladams said miserably weve been here nearly four months its getting worse its as if well as if it isnt me she wants not me as an individual just the male element like like a plug for her socket quite said jim gruffly except shes the one that lights up last night tonys eyes had a deceptive brightness suggesting a man who hadnt slept in a long time last night after dark she made me do it in in the window i mean the shop window pause for effect jim just nodded strewth and i i nearly couldnt you know i mean its against the law isnt it in public not that anybody was about least i dont think so oh youd have heard suppose so you see the very reason we came here ill tell you shall i if you think itll help jim groaned silently it wasnt all that good between us you see id had a bit of a thing going with another teacher to be frank nothing important but it left a gulf as you can imagine well coming here that was supposed to be a new beginning in a place that was you know blessed i thought if we were working together in a compatible way things would straighten themselves out especially somewhere like this somewhere steeped in magic and earth energy somewhere that would feed our hearts they say you know that glastonbury is actually the heart chakra in the great spiritual body of the world you came here to put your marriage together jim shook his head in real sorrow no wonder they were staring at each other across a gap the width of the severn estuary tony this is the very last place yes it is uniquely spiritual but that doesnt make it an easy place to live quite the reverse and as for marriages same again is it he handed tony a tenner and tony went for more drinks jim leaned back eyes half closed im not like that am i i didnt come here expecting anything surely im just a painter came for the mystery he was aware of the bar filling up one or two locals but mainly incomers healers and psychics artists and musicians the ones who thought it was ok spiritually to drink alcohol he saw archer ffitch come in moving discreetly through the bar to sit at a table occupied by griff daniel have you seen our new range jim tony dorrelladams distinctly unsteady now placed another scotch in front of jim spilling some i came to see you old son jim said patiently you remember i saw all your pottery shes actually the potter domini glazes are my thing and design onglaze colours you know i thought we were becoming compatible at last you saw my arthurian range didnt you oh yes very er hed seen the plaques decorated with knights and ladies and heraldry morte darthur manuscript stuff nothing exciting but that seemed to be tony nothing too exciting going bloody well quite well people liked it and the leyline stuff i did with woolly woolaston now were doing this set of six plates on joseph of arimathea joseph and the boy jesus on the isle of avalon joseph collecting the blood in the grail planting his staff on wearyall hill damned collectible expensive but its a limited edition thats the way ahead i think limited editions indeed jim was bored he saw archer ffitch stand up to leave archer turned and smiled at someone whod probably been congratulating him on his candidacy its this bloody goddess group tony said the bloody cauldron thats what changed everything all female you know she goes twice a week now its supposed to be a consciousnessraising thing discussion and meditation but who knows what goes on behind closed doors do you know jim shook his head never had liked singlesex outfits back at the building society hed resisted all attempts to get him into the masons even the buggering rotary club and so now shes been poring over pictures of fat ugly celtic fertility goddesses and producing these ghastly crude female figurines sort of earthmothers with huge you know boobs tony glanced furtively around and then whispered it vaginas he swallowed who the hells going to buy those things i said finally i said it tonight that was all i said whos going to buy them reasonable enough question jim said lord not another range of pot goddesses with giant fannies thats what i thought tony slid close to the wall we have a living to make i thought it was a reasonable reasonable question so i asked it whos going to buy them i said that was it all i said tony lifted the bottom of his guernsey sweater pulled it up over his stomach look at this good god man what are you doing jim inched away in discomfort was this a preliminary to what they called male bonding she tears forming in the poor chaps eyes lord oh lord look steady on tony old chap she smiled jim and came close snuggling up you know hands inside the jersey and then oh my god jim recoiled like a puma look hadnt you better have those seen to savaged me like a puma tony said displaying livid scratches six or eight inches long still halfbleeding he began to cry came here to find love and harmony and she savages me like a puma three pixhill most people would have flicked through the pages reading an entry here an entry there get the idea of what kind of book it was not diane diane had to start on page one juanita watched brown wavy hair flop over the girls face as her head bowed over the unappealing book actually it was quite gripping the introduction in its recounting of how pixhill had first been turned towards glastonbury a place hed hardly heard of and even in the introduction diane would discover one or two parallels as a young army officer lay in a wrecked tank in the western desert in may a full moon or very near i expect i was staring up at the damn thing when it happened head and shoulders out of the hatch like a ginger cat i once saw peering out of a dustbin dont actually remember any of what happened immediately before and certainly nothing of the actual impact which being a direct hit into the body of the grant must have been like having your legs shot from under you my driver and codriver down below there wouldnt have heard the bang either they must have died at once similarly corporal elliman the gunner took some chunk of metal never knew precisely where it came from into his brain via the left eye i think it was it was little charles anthony little wireless operator who caused me the most pain he was the veteran among us at thirtyone almost a father figure to me his commander capt pixhill twentytwo and an immature twentytwo to boot thinking back libya this was may twenty seventh when rommel pulled a fast one the old werewolf rising to the moon and having us cleverly outflanked by dawn the desert around bir hacheim was a veritable ocean of metal but i saw nothing of that the battle for me was a battle with myself to block out the pain of my smashed legs and the sounds of war and of charlie little dying while out of the morning sky the arrogant moon still shone down through the open hatch like some freshly polished medal on a nazi chest what happened i quickly worked out having nothing better to do was that a mounting pin from ellimans machine gun had flown off when the whole damn thing sprang back with him and someone had speculated about the chances of this only a week or so earlier but major collier said it couldnt happen took poor little in the throat not much conversation between us as you can imagine i remember the poor chap blubbing and gurgling i remember the smell of cordite and blood and the smoke from a thousand capstans the last of them having fallen from ellimans lips to his chest and burnt a hole through his shirt before expiring i remember the extraordinary agony in my legs when i tried to reach little thinking that if i could pull the damn pin from his neck hed be able to talk to me conversation all i craved i could hardly move at all so i lay there shivering and entertaining poor charlie with what must have been a devastatingly tedious monologue about my life thus far and how i had hoped to become a clergyman but war more or less resigned to an obscure career as a history teacher at some minor public school my uncle william it was archdeacon of liverpool who had talked me out of the clergy the church he said dryly tended to frown on young chaps who claimed to have had encounters with angels well only the one angel i assured little the figure of a kindly chap in cricket whites who first bent over my bed when i was seven and quieted my whooping cough and thereafter was sometimes vaguely discernible at the edges of my vision when someone close to me had died or the situation looked generally black each time the cricketer came out to bat for me i would have new energy to pull myself through whatever crisis after little died with a dispiriting bubbling sound like a wet inner tube with a puncture i looked around for that reliable old sportsman wondering if there was room for him in the turret with me but all i could see out of the comers of my eyes was death and dawn and moonlight and i thought this is it george not going to come out of this now are we remember thinking what is the bloody point and that even the whooping cough would have been a better death i wondered quite distantly how long it would take for the door to close knew i had a head injury but had kept my hands away from the cranial region not wishing to know how serious i thought that someone would tell my family i had died a hero was this what i had been preserved for to die a heros death to qualify for membership of the valhalla club endless booze and loose women for all eternity mine would be in fact an inglorious death the inexperienced not to say incompetent junior commander who managed to get all his crew killed first after all if i hadnt been halfway through the hatch sniffing the desert air i too would have been gone by now i thought of the cricketer and i saw him not so much in the image of an angel as some serene pipesmoking fool in a brylcreem advert and i thought its a joke its all a damned joke there is no purpose to life we can have no control over our individual destinies there is no divine guidance to be had and i was for a sick instant almost in awe of hitler who believed he had been chosen to alter the destiny of the entire human race i think it was at that moment that i lost all desire to survive the allies certainly would be a sight better off without me equally though i had no wish to go out gasping and weeping bitter tears on the bloodsticky floor of a grant tank and so i wondered how i might pull myself up to the hatch to show my head so that some sharp eyed panzer could shoot it off quick and clean i lay for a long time staring up the circle of smoky blue at the fading moon tike a chipped shilling and feeling the numbness a sort of permanent shiver creeping up my lower body and well i suppose you will say i fell asleep you will say i hallucinated or that it was due to the reaction of chemicals in my brain for that is how we prefer to explain such phenomena in the nineteenseventies embarrassed as we are by the term vision there was a strange sort of glow in dianes eyes which juanita had seen before and found disturbing not to say ominous the cricketer diane said thought youd spot that bit like your revered nanny huh sits on the edge of the bed with a cool hand on the fevered young brow jung wouldve loved him diane looked disappointed youre saying this is an archetypal thing sort of projected imagination a childs comfort figure my ghost angel whatever was a good nanny because all my real nannies were nasty and colonel pixhills was a cricketer because he was a boy something like that beats lying awake sucking your thumb i suppose diane frowned youve changed youre ever so cynical now arent you maybe ive come to my senses i used to be a mystical snob like the rest an elitist in a town full of them what you mean is you used to be a seeker after some sort of truth diane said primly and now youve stopped searching if you want to put it like that all the sects and societies and covens they all think their particular path is the true way and everything else is crap ive concluded its safer to start off on the basis that its all crap thats just as bigoted juanita saves a lot of time though doesnt it juanita pulled her old blue mac from the back of the parlour door look im off to the pub see if i can find jim you coming i think id rather like to finish reading this thought you would just remember he died a sad rather isolated old man deserted by his wife stuck in a gloomy farmhouse he couldnt afford to heat and oh remember not to open the door for anyone cream range rover or otherwise i wont juanita mmm diane held up the book pointed to the tiny writing at the bottom of the spine where it said carey and frayne and yet you published this juanita shrugged well at the pixhill trusts expense a thousand copies only a few of which have sold since word got round about what was in it left to me theres no way it would have come out looking like that but the trust were calling the shots and they wanted dark green no picture no blurb no publicity no other outlets it wasnt important if only a few people bought it it just had to be available did they say why i mean hes been dead nearly twenty years an obligation was all major shepherd said i imagine the trust thought there ought to be some sort of memorial to pixhill why they sat on the manuscript for so long ive no idea i only agreed to get it printed because i felt so sorry for old shepherd who wasnt in the best of health obviously wanted to get the thing off his hands before he passed on diane held the little green book between her hands and looked thoughtfully at it almost as if she was looking into a mirror juanita thought she hoped diane would continue to find parallels between pixhills alleged visionary experiences and her own and she hoped as she let herself out of the shop that by the end of the book the central message would be clear glastonbury buggers you up it was a bright night the crown of st johns tower icysharp on a night like this this time of year there ought to be frost why wasnt there frost all was quiet save for the clicking of juanitas heels not even the usual semi stoned assembly with guitars and handdrums around the warmemorial you could sense tonight the nearness of the abbey ruins hidden behind the high street shops but surely juanita thought the whole point of pixhills book was that he was saying dont get taken in by this dont surrender to the vibes hed come here on the back of a vision delirious in his tank on may hed imagined himself to be lying out on the sand under that same moon but when he looked up he saw no battlesmoke indeed it was awesomely silent what he saw was a small bump in the sand a swelling something that was buried rising again there was an eruption quite silent and then there it was huge before him in all its mysterious majesty a green hill in the desert a conical green hill with a church on top next thing captain pixhill awakes on a stretcher and within days is on his way back to england for months of operations on his legs when he can walk again hes given some sort of admin job at the ministry and ends the war as a full colonel by then hes discovered glastonbury convinced it was the tor he saw in his libyan vision after coming so very close to losing his life and his faith convinced this is where his future must lie and inspired to learn that this is where the holy grail itself is said to have been brought and so after the war he comes to glastonbury marries a local girl buys an ugly old house and and what as far as juanita could tell there was no record of colonel thomas george hendry pixhill having done anything significant with his life from the moment he arrived to the moment he collapsed with a coronary he seemed to have moped around the place for thirty years ingesting the vibes contemplating the views tipping his hat politely to every passing female and keeping an occasional diary of in later years unremitting pessimism for pixhill the holy grail of his youth had been replaced by the dark chalice presumably a metaphor for an increasingly gloomy worldview in his last few months he was seeing images of the dark chalice everywhere over the tor among the abbey ruins above the tower of st johns well he wasnt the only amateur visionary to have gone a bit paranoid towards the end juanita as soon as she entered the pub jim was up and beckoning broad face like an overripe coxs apple it was jims kind of bar all wood and stainedglass he looked like a jolly squire from some eighteenthcentury painting glass of something cold and white barman for my friend juanita i was coming to see you least i think i was time is it time you thought about some black coffee and a sandwich juanita said if youre planning to make it home without falling in the ditch he was more than slightly pissed but at least he was more like the old battle and if he waved goodbye to a few more brain cells it would wear away the memory of last nights ordeal all the sooner had something to tell you didnt i the paper whatd i do with the buggering paper i think you were sitting on it she saw he was not alone tony dorrelladams shared his table looking just as flushed but less convivial was too bit creased never mind jim retrieved the evening post from his chair placed it on the table spread it out its archer ffitch in the paper archers been selected as tory candidate for mendip south i know jim it explains a lot hello tony tony nodded couldnt manage a smile went back to his beer yes blustered jim but have you seen what the bastards saying wants this town to be efficient streamlined hitech have its own branch of debenhams no veggiebars no crystals no mystical bookshops this is an exaggeration right jim no avalon no mystery wants us in fact to be another bland buggering layby on the euro superhighway here let me read it she saw that people were glancing at him amused he was one of those official characters who like woolly woolaston were allowed not to say expected to go over the top she tried to tug the paper from him never believe a word i say jim grumbled as the evening post tore in two juanita collected the segments together and sat down now which page just look for a picture of a well known smug bastard hey thats another thing he was in here tonight was archer and guess who he left with juanita are you listening yes just a minute jim juanita had found another story or at least a headline or more precisely the first word of a headline it made the hubbub around her recede into mush the word was swastika i think jim was saying from it sounded like a long way away that this must be the time for you to think seriously about that scheme of yours for relaunching the avalonian i can sense dirty work afoot and somebody ought to be saying it we have to preserve the buggering mystery i dont know juanita who had glanced through the swastika story was sure shed gone pale just hoped it wouldnt show under the muted pub lights i dont know about that anymore four the huntress essentially dr pel grainger said we are talking readjustment reprogramming the organism to selfregulate photosensory input were talking dr grainger moved to the very front of the platform a portly figure all in black he breathed in through his nose abdomen swelling then he exhaled languidly and noisily from his mouth flung his arms wide and all the lights died at once as if hed blown them out penumbratisation he said although it was obviously staged there was an intake of breath from the audience verity jumped in her seat before realising after a fraught second that this was not meadwell but the assembly rooms the alternative town hall centre for esoteric lectures meeting place for all who sought in glastonbury a new level of being at the assembly rooms one expected even hoped for the unexpected marvellous said dame wanda carlisle bravo but her voice normally warm and perfectly pitched sounded strident and intrusive nobody else had spoken the now invisible dr grainger waited for total silence before continuing if you think that was a shock my friends its nothing compared to the sense of dislocation i guarantee you will feel when we put on the lights again at the end of the session for those who havent figured it out yet penumbratisation means permitting our consciousness to merge with the shadows it is the preliminary to bonding with the dark lesson one learn to penumbratise so far verity had not been terribly impressed with dr pel grainger the pel apparently short for pelham not least because of his somewhat theatrical appearance in his long black jacket he resembled the magicians she remembered from childrens parties before the war he had a trim black beard which contrasted so dramatically with his puny pale face that it must surely be dyed with the lights extinguished however dr grainger was in his clement his voice as rich as black coffee the voice of a hypnotist or one of those evangelical american clergymen it soothed it was verity thought a rather dangerous voice you may think that you cannot see me but the tenebral law says you can see me clearer than ever now without the interference of light light itself is random haphazard volatile artificial light is an interference he paused the little hall was packed but nobody shuffled or coughed the way they had when the lights were on only darkness intoned the voice of dr pel grainger can connect with our inner being in tenebral therapy we learn to locate what i will call the inner dark the darkness inside ourselves about which there are a number of ancient misconceptions verity tensed people say to me but darkness surely we fear the dark because darkness is the oldest metaphor for evil verity flinched this softly now brings us to the oldest misconception of them all one so endemic in our society that the modern world seeks to cancel the dark throughout history societies have run towards the light because the light is easy it makes no demands upon us see what you have nowadays people go for southfacing houses right they go for plateglass walls frenchdoors conservatories they got to open everything to as much light as they can get because light makes no demands verity felt people around her nodding agreement ok lets deal with evil the word evil is a terse blanket condemnation of anything it does not suit us to understand we know that it is essential for the development of the soul to undergo periods of hardship and socalled negativity we talk of the soul travelling out of the darkness and into the light therefore the darkness must be evil to that i say bullshit verity thought of what shed said to major shepherd about the presence of abbot whiting exuding evil because the lights had gone out was that really all it was let us consider darkness said dr grainger as a sentient being as something sensitive and vulnerable in the states our cities are so damn bright at night now you can no longer see the stars plus we have highpowered security lamps on our houses we blast through the night with our headlamps instead of melding with the dark we brutalise it as he said this he snapped his fingers and the house lights came on for a blazing instant before going out again and grainger shouted what do you see tell me what you see now come on tell me what you see big yellow spots a man called out alarming purple circular things described dame wanda with a sort of spongy core ok ok pel grainger said youve all seen them before just you didnt know what you were seeing well now im gonna tell you what happened was we blasted the dark with brutal artificial light and what you saw maybe are still seeing are the bruises now you want me to do that again you want me to hit the darkness one more time no way man someone behind verity said nervously as if dr grainger had threatened to hit a child any of you anybody want the light back anybody feel happier with a little illumination around here silence good said dr pel grainger i congratulate you all you have reached what i term first stage tenebral symbiosis now we can begin verity sat with her fingers linked on her knees and felt some trepidation when i awoke in my room at the george and pilgrims sunlight had turned the stained glass in my window into a nest of gems and i felt at once a different person it was the first time since before the war that i had slept the night through and awoken after sunrise or if it was not the first time then it certainly felt like it this was my rebirth that morning i walked through the abbey ruins at first appalled at what little remained and then overcome with a sudden humility and a desire to worship this was something i had never before experienced indeed i realised then that i had never really understood the meaning of worship before i knew it i had fallen to my knees something i had not been able to do since leaving hospital without the most excruciating pain this time i felt no pain at all only a growing sense of wonder i do not know how long i knelt there in the wet winter grass gazing up through the noble arch of the western doorway even today it is still possible in glastonbury to kneel alone and undisturbed in a wide open public place although i should not care to predict how long this state of affairs will remain before the worshipper is derided or even attacked and robbed but it seemed to me then and sometimesstill does that these serene ruins enclose a level of holiness unexperienced in most of our great surviving cathedrals and something else a sadness which i perceived then as sweet melancholy but now it pains me to record seems closer to a bitter despair but i was full of an extraordinary optimism as later that morning i made my way to the chalice well where the blood spring flows and the arimathean was said to have laid down the grail there to meet my teacher and another person the highly controversial writer and mystic mr john cowper powys mr powys it must be said was not the most popular man in this town at this time due to the publication before the war of his extremely lengthy novel a glastonbury romance it is a powerfully volatile tome which had left me with very much mixed feelings although its central inspiration is the holy grail the glastonbury it portrays is far from a sacred haven indeed it emerges as a divided community full of misfits one leading character is an extremely aggressive entrepreneur and there is a young man whose spiritual leanings are challenged by a pretty extreme case of sexual frustration there is also an unpleasant welsh pervert of the masochistic type whose peccadilloes are said to have been derived from aspects of mr powyss own psychology and so the thought of an encounter with this depraved and opinionated windbag would normally have completely taken the shine off the day however diane looked up from pixhills diary in alarm someone was banging on the shop door dont open the door for anyone juanita had warned cream range rover or otherwise did she really mean that juanita had been a little strange not only more cynical but seemingly less secure rather disturbing shed always been such well such a lovely free spirit really diane rose hesitantly it was true that glastonbury was not as safe as it used to be apparently thered been a couple of muggings in the past year while she was away and a sexual assault and as for burglaries she opened the door to the shop just a crack through the shop window she could see oh gosh a sort of floating thing in white oh diana she heard dont be tedious i know youre there oh no it was that woman the artist domini somethingthing come on do open the door i need your help diane sighing went through into the darkened shop hadnt she told the woman she was busy tonight cautiously she unlocked the door oh diana really domini said as though they were old friends its only me she stepped lightly over the threshold she was wearing a long white dress rather flimsy a dress for a summer night but she didnt seem at all cold too animated there was a gold coloured girdle loosely around her waist a tore of brass around her neck she looked like a goddess its diane diane said not diana look im terribly sorry oh said domini you should call yourself diana its more resonant diana the huntress ive never been much of a huntress said diane no i suppose you havent domini looked at her with a tilted smile you must be quite strong though hold these would you she reached down behind her to the pavement and came up with a cardboard wine box be careful its rather heavy wine diane was bemused her head still full of the pixhill diaries lord no follow me domini glided diagonally across high street paying no heed to a motorcyclist who roared through her path behaving as though she was made of air and light and the bike would have passed straight through her diane lumbered behind clutching the cardboard box to her chest people had always treated her like a servant even servants her fathers staff were always making her fetch mops and garden tools and things stay precisely there domini had stopped outside her shop holy thorn ceramics the window was in darkness domini went into the shop and returned with another cardboard wine box diane stared around blinking this was like a silly dream the buildings the familiar mixture of old and older glistened and glittered in a christmas card sort of way although the night was far too mild for frost the street was curiously deserted ok you can put it down now domini dumped her own box on the flagstones and danced back from it as though it was dirty or radioactive or something a wobbling clatter of crockery echoed in the silence domini dipped delicately into the box and extracted a white disc holding it up towards a street light like a conjuror demonstrating to the audience it was a plate goldrimmed with a stainedglassstyle painting in the middle of a bearded man below a towerless tor with a barefoot boy thats rather charming diane said think so do you a white sleeve dropped to the shoulder as dominis arm came back and she tossed the plate into the night like a frisbee my god what are you the plate spun in the air for about twenty yards flashing in the streetlight before smashing into coloured shards in the road domini let out a shrill whoop and shook her golden hair can you feel it diana can you feel the vibrations the energy around us she took out a second plate the picture in the middle showed a table bearing a golden cup with a shimmering aureole around it dominis arm came back again no diane yelled please domini lowered her arm and looked at her youre right ill wait for a car or better still a heavy lorry why are you doing this didnt they turn out well or something domini laughed a drunks laugh but there was no aura of alcohol about her old stock diana as of tonight obsolete the shops changing holy thorn ceramics that was his idea too i know why now i know the truth about the thorn holy mother cant you feel it yet yes and she could the night was as sharp as one of the shards of pottery everything was hard and clear there was no wind the air seemed to fizz domini spread out her arms like a bird feeling the currents diane didnt like it she didnt like the feel of glastonbury since shed returned the unseasonal mildness summer blight in november it was as if the weather had been tampered with the conditions altered for some purpose look dont do this domini youll regret it tomorrow i know you will tomorrow darling i spit on tomorrow ok look if you dont want me to smash them help me display them will you do that diana domini began to take plates out of the box like a child unpacking toys she laid each one face up on the pavement in a line edging down the hill dragging the cardboard box behind her well what are you waiting for take the other box come on diana theyll get trodden on maybe but if you dont help me ill tread on them all now this is mad sanest thing ive ever done go on the bending will do you good youre too fat whats the matter with you dont you walk anywhere dont you ever have sex shes out of control oh gosh humour her then get away diane carefully took a plate out of the box it showed the bearded man looking up at christ on the cross can you believe it domini said i actually painted this shit i dont understand christianitys a brash male religion which insults women if we accept as i assume we all do that the socalled holy grail is simply an unsubtle christianisation of the celtic chalice the sacred cauldron of our ancient wisdom we do assume that dont we diana well in which case tell me this domini faced her hands on hips where does the bible mention the grail even the christian propagandists cant seem to agree whether it was some cup from the mythical last supper or whether it was the vessel which caught the blood dripping from the cross or both or neither its a myth its smoke the socalled grail quest is a clear cut maledomination trip an attempt by armed men to steal womans cauldron of wisdom and rape her in the process just like the raising of the abbey with its great phallic towers no listen by a maleoriented roman religion on a spot which just happened to be the holy vagina of the supine goddess oh really diane had heard all this before no come on think about this the holy thorn story ok central character one joseph of arimathea wealthy merchant international wheelerdealer i think its a rather lovely story actually diane said staunchly the old tin trader who brought jesus to avalon as a boy making that last journey back with the holy cup its really resonant when im on wearyall hill sometimes i can imagine it all as an island again and old joseph being helped ashore a bit unsteady staggering up the hill with the help of his staff and then when he can go no further you really are a big schoolgirl arent you domini pulled out her cheeks as if she was going to throw up with contempt isnt it obvious sticking his staff into the ground pulling out his staff and he pushes it into a sacred landscape formed into the contours of the body of the goddess this man joseph symbolically fucks the goddess no diane was appalled how can you and his seed diana his foul seed germinates into a misshapen stunted tree full of vicious thorns a tree which flowers in the dead of winter against oh now look against all the laws of nature thats the sick truth behind your pretty little legend and thats why i could no longer bear to be fronting a business called holy thorn ceramics alongside an idiot who thinks its all sooooo romantic domini snatched the plate from dianes hands laid it carefully on a flagstone if thats your idea of art you must be stupider than you look domini jumped on the plate with both feet a middleaged man and a woman holding hands the first sign of normal life since this episode began crossed the street to avoid them excuse me diane shouted but they ignored her and only walked faster dont be such a wimp domini took two plates and clapped them together in the air like cymbals her brittle laughter exploded with the pottery five goddess swastika clue the evening paper was on the table next to juanitas wineglass folded through the headline juanita had drunk three glasses of house white and hardly noticed them go down jim was chuntering on about preserving the mystery the paper had revealed another mystery the police were investigating it juanita wished to god tony dorrelladams would drink up and go so she could discuss this development with jim decide what they were going to do but tony just slumped in his chair whatever hed been telling jim earlier he wasnt going to talk about it with juanita around its like the holy grail jim said if somebody dug up an ancient cup under the chalice well and it was proved to be the actual grail the whole thing would be diminished reduced to another sterile antique in a glass case thered be no buggering mystery bullshit sir roared a voice from behind the discovery of that holy grail would be the best thing as could happen to this town oh hell griff daniel juanita looked up throwing a defensive arm over the paper just what they could do without and a reborn griff daniel it seemed the last time shed seen him hed been grimfaced his grey and white beard bedraggled his eyes full of sour suspicion looking in fact exactly like a bent builder whod lost his seat on the council to a hippy now grinning savagely through a freshly trimmed beard hed virtually erupted at their table now you just imagine mr battle if we had that bloody grail banged up in a glass case no more weirdos with dowsing sticks claimin they knew where it was buried no more lunatics having visions of the thing and sayin theyd been singled out by the lord no more bloody speculation no more room for dreamers and nutcases think what that would do for this town make it exceedingly bloody boring said jim ah griff accepted a pint of guinness from the barman and paid now thats where we differ mr battle you look like a regular sort with a decent haircut but behind it all youre still an immigrant one o them listen buster jim said mildly ill have you know im not one of them or one of you either there are a few buggering individuals left in this town mr battle theres only two sides locals and hippies even if some of em does wear jackets and tweed hats and is old enough to know better juanita saw jim tense at the mention of his hat what gets me look griff burrowed into his pint and emerged with froth spiked in his beard like cotton buds is they d think they got somethin to show us bout how to live our lives by god i wouldnt live like that if it they think jim said that if theyre living here something will help them to become better people that its easier to be a better person here because of a spiritual atmosphere to which you appear to be oblivious spiritual griffs tankard connected derisively with a beermat bullshit mister you tellin me we didnt have our abbey and our bit of tourism fore they come flooding the town with their cranky fads thats not what im saying at all and you and didnt we used to have a proper town centre back then with real shops sellin stuff ordinary fold wanted to buy and wasnt our property prices on a par with somerton and castle carey if not better and did people laugh at us in them days no mister they did not what days said jim irritably theres always been an alternative community in glastonbury if you go back to the twenties and thirties dion fortune at chalice orchard and then cowper powys wrote that enormous novel gah said griff filthy bastard bloody ole pervert never showed his face here after that come out cordin to my old dad he finished his guinness with a flourish but ill tell you whats behind all this mister that bloody hill brings out the hippies with their weird ceremonies and such pull em in like a kiddies playground take that thing away and what you got is an ordinary decent country town with a ruined abbey but you cant take it away jim said patiently youre stuck with it no you cant thats true a gleam arrived in griffs foxy eyes and a little smile crawled out of his beard but you can keep them away you can make that nasty little hill into as near as dammit a nogo area if you goes about it right got a plan have we mr daniel ah well you could say that you could indeed griff daniel stood up looking smugly secretive glastonbury first mr battle glastonbury first im sorry tony dorrelladams rose unsteadily to his feet i didnt come here to listen to an argument he pushed past griff towards the door not what this town should be about who the hells he to know what the bloody town should be about griff dropped into tonys seat just a dreamer jim said sadly just a nutcase aye well said griff i got to say id hoped for better from you mr battle i knows youre a bit of an artist an that but youre very quiet tonight mrs carey and you she said are looking unusually buoyant mr daniel hed once made a pass at her when she and danny had ventured down to the riflemans arms and had a row and danny had walked out griff evidently assuming prior to getting his face slapped that exhippies had few morals and no taste ill say this lady griff wagged a bloated forefinger ill say this an no more theres a change on its way an when it comes were gonner have em out every phoney healer every fortune telling charlatan every last dinky cultfollower run out of town with their bloody jazz sticks up their arses so them thats old enough to know better maybe oughter be thinkin which side youre really on cause from now on my friends its gonner be glastonbury first he beamed at them smugly its erm joss sticks jim said what you said jazz sticks gah griff daniel pushed back his chair and slouched off in search of more malleable company after a few moments he turned on his heel raised a hand to the barman and went out oh my gods its him hes coming quick mustnt let him see us where can we go into the bookshop diane pulled out her keys seizing the opportunity to get the crazy woman off the street inside she steered domini into the back parlour and flung a log into the stove energy domini pulled at her hair i had to use the energy the spores in the air now or never diana shed left a trail of coloured plates perhaps a hundred yards long from the george and pilgrims to the door of holy thorn ceramics except it wasnt holy thorn ceramics any more domini had gone into the shop and switched on the lights in the window the lights were purple now they spotlit a crudely repellent squatting earthenware woman with a hole between her legs the size of a chimney pot around her lumpen head with its jagged grin was a wreath of brambles no more holy thorn domini had screeched the goddess lives here now the goddess lives tea i think diane said no wine the last thing you need is wine shed half expected domini would suddenly collapse into tears shattered by the realisation of what shed done while carried away on this dangerous overflow of energy but the golden woman had slipped gracefully into the rocking chair crossing her legs the diaphanous white dress gliding back along her thighs diane put the kettle on this is really ever so silly you know its not incompatible at all thats what i thought at first domini said i became aware of the need for a religion and this was the only really english one i mean all that stuff about israel the holy land well it never seemed very holy to me all these jews and arabs killing each other this was my holy land england i mean why not she stretched her neck leaned her golden head into the spindly back of the rocking chair at least some of the hyperurgency had gone out of her she was like a racehorse steaming in the winners enclosure that hymn i suppose turned me on to it when i was at school and did those feet in ancient times all those lovely lines the bow of burning gold wonderful until you get to the last bit till we have built jerusalem exactly if youve got a green and pleasant land why deface it with a filthy warren full of arab muggers anyway our religions so much older than theirs theyd heard about this legendary holy island in the west with the power to transform peoples lives a place where you could walk with the spirits and they wanted a piece of the action simple as that a ragged voice came from the street where are you you heartless evil bitch ah domini didnt move tony seems to have found one of his plates there was a ringing silence then a long wail of pure cold anguish from the street as if the man out there had suddenly taken a knife deep into his stomach and then a window shattered something afoot jim said something involving daniel and archer ffitch you hear what he said glastonbury first you see thats archers new slogan its all in here he fumbled at the paper totally ignoring the swastika story juanita noticed can archer ffitch afford to lose that much credibility she wondered dont underrate that man which of them do you mean juanita got up same again either both stay there sit down ill get them i owe you more than a few drinks you dont owe me a thing but hed already gathered up their glasses while he was at the bar juanita took the opportunity to open out the evening paper the headline was no less shaking swastika clue in bus body mystery newage travellers all over the west were being questioned by detectives today following the discovery of a mans body in an abandoned hippy bus the dead man believed to have head injuries was found inside the vehicle early this morning by a woman walking her dog in woodland at stoke st michael near shepton mallett police say the battered black bus had false number plates and no road fund licence and describe the death as suspicious their only clue to the identity of the man said to be aged or is a distinctive swastika symbol tattooed on the top of his head avon and somerset police are appealing for anyone who might have seen the man or the bus juanita could still hear diane in the back of the volvo crying to persuade them to go back to moulders field he might look like a hard case with the swastika on his head and everything she and jim hadnt been close enough to the boy to see that kind of detail and presumably jim hadnt heard or had forgotten what diane had said in the car either way he didnt know and sooner or later she was going to have to tell him jim put down juanitas fourth glass of wine she thanked him and swallowed half of it jim looked at her with concern sorry juanita said absently she was still trying to get her head around the possibility that rankin was a murderer and lord pennard an accessory sometimes delayed shock is even worse you know jim said you were very strong last night me i couldnt sleep with or without the booze but ive learned my lesson im feeling better now i think anger helps dont you archer and his evil plans griff daniel juanita looked at him and thought quite calmly we could stop him if you swallowed your pride and we went to the police and implicated rankin and pennard in this boys death even if they got away with it the scandal would touch archer archer would have to resign the candidacy when she was younger the idea would have excited her the adrenalin would have drowned all jims objections carried the pair of them all the way to the police station at street or to the press when she was younger juanita gripped the base of her glass to prevent her throwing back the rest of the wine and to prevent her hand from shaking the noise of the pub swelled and deflated around her a dozen conversations boiled together the way it was when you were very drunk was she drunk just jittery ok frightened frightened of jumping to the wrong conclusions frightened at the way everything was going out of control she was aware that jim was looking steadily at her his honest eyes unmoving in his honest englishapple face it was a look shed seen before but never quite so obviously in the face of jim battle sixtythree a friend a good friend in the best the oldfashioned sense juanita his voice coming towards her along a very circuitous route im very fond of you you must know that very fond jim he was drunk he didnt know what he was saying she had to stop him not here not now not not ever how could she say that to him her best friend her best friend i meanthere was sweat on his forehead that is i dont have any illusions of course that please god it was ironically griff daniel who saved her and saved jim probably griff back already halfgrinning halfscowling making an explosive arrival at the bar bloody hippies bloody mad bastards everybody heard him everybody turned griff ordered another pint of guinness bloody drugs it is sends em out their minds one minute theyre almost rational the next what they done then griff somebody called out sprayed your ole truck luminous pink there was laughter griff daniel took delivery of his pint of guinness took his time about swallowing some knowing he had an audience he composed himself you wanner know what they done you go out and see for yourselves six flickering it was like a street party like new years eve the atmosphere weirdly electric lights shining out of shop windows and from the windows of the flats over the shops more people than thered been in the bar maybe a hundred among the wreckage on high street many of them wandering into the road because of the scarcity of traffic so late at night the colourful otherworldly folk of glastonburys thriving new age quarter mystics psychics healers and dealers in crystals and tarot cards under the utility streetlamps didnt they all look so depressingly ordinary juanita shook her head to dear it where the hell were the police always the same in a glastonbury crisis half a dozen traumacounsellors but nobody to redirect the traffic tony dorrelladams sat on the bench outside the darkened veggiebar he was sobbing quietly one of his arms was being held up as though hed won a boxing bout by a man with a white medical bag blood was oozing from a limp hand a small circle of watchers kept a halffascinated aloofness like mourners around a distant relatives grave about five shop windows had been smashed the veggiebar had come off worst with a crack three feet long in its main window a spiderwebbed hole at the end nearest the frame what happened juanita councillor woolly came to stand next to her in the doorway of an antiques shop woollys own shop archaic string instruments was safely tucked away in benedict street all i know juanita said is that when tony left the pub he was not in an awfully good mood and not entirely sober what i gather is that he found a few dozen of his newly glazed pictureplates scattered in some sort of weird formation all over the pavement his plates yep the fair domini disposing of them apparently in a fairly imaginative if cruel fashion i wouldnt claim to understand i think shes one trump short of a major arcana as we mystics say making light of it but she was shocked her voice was hoarse as if there wasnt enough oxygen there was something wrong with tonight what sort of plates woolly looked worried juanita pulled a segment from her mac pocket heres one i rescued earlier sort of woolly stared at the picture of half a church on half a hill tis burrowbridge mump when he looked up he was almost in tears thesere our plates i been working with this guy working out earthmysteries themes we done this series on the st michael line all the churches and abbeys and stones and stuff set often boxed jesus i mean why why the fuck she have to do that possibly a statement about the aesthetic and spiritual validity of tonys art juanita said dryly her mouth was so parched she could hardly finish the sentence she coughed and she seems to have other ideas for the window nodding across the street to the crudely fashioned unspeakably ugly female form unsubtly spotlit in purple with what looked like the entrance to a railway tunnel between its spread thighs the window was cracked but intact sheesh thats really gross said woolly no wonder the poor bastard lost his cool he didnt need to start hurling his works of art at everybody elses windows though must be fifteen or twenty panes gone who would pay the alternative community was already withdrawing into itself juanita supposed repair bills would be settled quietly she supposed shed have her corner pane quietly replaced without seeking recompense from either the dorrelladamses or the insurance company as would most of the other new age shopkeepers covering up because this sort of incident just did not happen in sacred glastonbury no wonder griff daniel had looked so happy woolly shook his head in sorrow we had this whole range planned my knowledge tonys artwork good team eh i work out the concept he makes em she dumps em in the street he smashes em gotter be a philosophical message there somewhere the message said juanita is glastonbury buggers you up pixhill woolly said dont you go quoting pixhill at me juanita youll have me all paranoid again how do you mean juanita asked but woolly had spotted tony whats he done to himself cut his hand on a shard of pot that whats hisname matthew the herbalist guy is sedating him the natural way and anointing his wound with cowslip syrup or something this is a real downer said woolly the only living local councillor to specialise in understatement a downer christ it showed how basically rickety the whole communitystructure was if tony dorrelladams a steady middleclass terribly boring exteacher from the home counties could behave like this what did it say about some of the others she wondered where jim was turned to look for him it was strange just turning around just moving made her want to go on moving there was something a tingle in the air an underlying vibration that was horribly exhilarating the shockwaves had broken the blight peoples bodies were flexing as they moved about the way they might emerging into a bright spring morning something not at all right about this a single undamaged plate with a glowing cup glazed upon it rolled as if from nowhere on end down the pavement and fell flat at juanitas feet it seemed awesomely symbolic like the most innocuous things did when you were on acid there was a moment of chargedup silence the plate wobbling on the flagstones juanita had time to think this is glastonbury buggering us up before it all began again she heard someone shout hold him as tony dorrelladams struggled to his feet scattering the herbalists bottled preparations and screaming biiiiiiitch the scream seemed to splatter the white walls above the shops opposite like a gob of spit and georgian windows rattled with its agony the air was alive fizzing like soda the streetlamps were flickering one crackling as though tonys scream had hit an electrical current and caused a short circuit or something tony sank to his knees sobs coming out of him like ghastly amplified hiccups i want to die just want to kill that bitch and die poor old tony one night hes humping his wife in the shop window like this was hamburg or amsterdam and the next well this was how domestic murders happened one of the classic scenarios you mock a mans prowess his skills its like trampling his balls juanitas tongue found the swelling on her lower lip where the pilgrim had punched her and it all muscled in on her everything that had happened in the past twenty four hours small events in the great scheme of things petty violence and humiliation and the unexplained death of a social reject diane called headlice diane where the hell was diane who should have been padding around this bizarre streetscape wide eyed and worried and exuding that doelike innocence oh my god on a night like this shed forgotten about diane snatching out her key juanita ran for the door of carey and frayne do it wanda carlisle urged you wont get another opportunity like this i cant said verity i really cant he can help you it isnt my place to seek help you really are a martyr wanda swept her black and white chequered cape stiffly across her shoulder and you know what happens to them the hall had nearly emptied only half the usual lights were on but it seemed to verity that most people would have been happy to grope their way out in complete darkness they had discovered an exciting new environment within it they had meditated they had touched each others features the way blind people did reinventing themselves and their partners by discovering what dr pel grainger had identified as their shadow selves there had been some very effective visualisation exercises and it seemed that everyones worldview had for tonight at least been subtly altered verity had been aware at one stage of someone coming in and muttering about some problem on the street and one person she thought it was councillor woolaston had left quietly but the interruption had been soon forgotten as dr graingers audience moved towards firststage tenebral symbiosis now dr grainger was sitting on the edge of the platform talking to a couple whod stayed behind why sure he was saying nonchalantly just take out the bulbs first then you wont be tempted to rush for the switches lets go said verity who precisely because it had all been so seductive was wishing she hadnt come dr grainger was a very persuasive person especially in the dark but there was darkness and darkness and she couldnt help feeling that meadwells dark was not the kind one might bond with fine said dr grainger good luck he raised a hand to the departing couple slipped down from the platform and then to veritys horror dame wanda was upon him she didnt bother to introduce herself assuming as she assumed with everyone that he would recognise her and be flattered by her attention dr grainger i should like you to meet a friend of mine who is desperately desperately in need of your help the man in black smiled patiently verity backed away oh no really verity do not dare move wanda turned again to dr pel grainger and said apologetically i am afraid my friend needs saving from herself from where jim stood leaning on his bike the lights of glastonbury were too bright tonight harsh with instability at the treehung entrance to wellhouse lane he paused feeling cold without his overcoat without his hat go on itll be all right after the first few hundred yards theres nothing to be afraid of theyve gone the travellers have all gone never thought this would happen to him never thought he could feel fear in this place of ancient spirit but there was nothing to be brave for now not anymore he kept thinking back to yesterday only yesterday it seemed like another life another incarnation when he was sitting in juanitas parlour looking through his laphroaig the colour of dusk at the woman whose skin was like the warmest softest dusk you could imagine there was so much hope then well not really but you could kid yourself you could believe in miracles and now there was no hope and he had only himself to blame doing what hed always sworn to himself he would never do stick to the banter keep it light never never let her know for sure his hands felt clammy on the rubber of the handlebars hed seen what had happened in high street briefly assessed the situation wouldnt have raised an eyebrow in bristol and edged quietly out of the picture hated rubberneckers and voyeurs and all this counselling nonsense you should never interfere in peoples private tragedies private tragedy his own had come in the very second that griff daniel had burst back into the bar to spread the good news about the man smashing the windows of the hippy shops he hadnt meant this to happen hadnt come out tonight with the least intention of making a suicide flight but something had got to him something whatever had made griff daniel so manic set jim off hed been watching juanitas eyes so closely he knew precisely what he was doing feeling strangely detached in reality probably as unstable as young tony and he knew that she knew where it was leading jim battle burning all his boats with a ninetynine to one chance of total annihilation but that one per cent the intoxication of running a wild deathorglory bet the odds almost too high for she was so beautiful and he was nearly twenty years older twenty buggering years and never bad been what youd call much of a catch as bloody pat would point out every other week juanita juanita if hed been a knight hed have swum the moat for her scaled the buggering tower if hed been a young man hed have simply swung her on to the back of his bike and pedalled for the border if hed been a dog hed have lain down at her feet rolled over and wagged his tail better to be a dog than poor buggering jim battle better a dog and get the occasional tickle have his fur brushed he pushed his bike past the last house in wellhouse lane the tor was on his right somewhere he couldnt see the bastard thing maybe god forgive him for even considering this maybe griff daniel was right about the weird little hill the hill of dreams the hill of obsession maybe theyd all be better off without it and he would rather jim swallowed this thought and went on pushing feeling cold sweat in the small of his back as though he was leaking like an old and rusting sump listening to the tick tick of his bike chain following the bleary beam of his batterypowered bike lamp only the mystery only the mystery could save him now and yet mystery could betray you he remembered the heat of bodies around him the strength of the hands holding him down exposing his throat and he would rather jim squeezed his eyes shut trying so hard to summon the dusk bring the old mellow warmth into his chilled sagging body no good it wouldnt come he would rather rather have had that moonbright sickle slice slowly through the skin and the sinew and the bones in his neck than to have seen the quick flickering of relief in juanitas eyes when griff daniel burst into the bar seven synchronicity don moulder had been up late doing his vat return last minute as usual and it was while he was locking up for the night that he heard it wouldve figured it was no more than his imagination doing his vat always made him a bit paranoid about people coming after him if both sheepdogs hadnt heard it as well and started to whimper lord preserve us muttered don moulder it came again the echoey groaning and grinding of a clapped out old gearbox some distance off one of the dogs crept between dons legs oh aye thats right don growled you gon hide yourself bloody ole coward when shep joined prince under the table don scowled at then and went to the boot cupboard where he kept the twelvebore got to protect me own stock then he glanced up at the plaster between the beams forgive me lord but i knows not of a better way to deal with these devils don decided to say nothing to the missus whod been in bed an hour and was most likely well asleep by now shotsd wake her mind if it came to that warning shots only mores the pity you blasted away at the beggars these days professional rustlers or not and theyd be straight down the police station figuring to nobble a god fearing farmer for damages due to the trauma theyd suffered bloody ridiculous got sos a man couldnt defend his own property no more well don moulder played by the old rules thou shalt not pinch thy neighbours ox nor his ass nor his best suffolk ram and if thou triest it thou gets whats coming to thee mister and no mistake shrugging on his old barbour don let himself out he was halfway across the yard gun under an arm lamp in hand but switched off when he had another thought knackered ole gearbox noise lord suppose itsthem theyd paid him for three four nights via the hon diane bless her then cleared off halfway through the first all right their decision no pressure from don moulder but what if theyd come back to claim the rest of their time how did he stand there hadnt given em no money back not a penny still he hadnt been asked and there was nothing on paper so what you did was you brazened it out only godless hippies they got no rights and miss diane nice enough girl but a few bales short of a full barn so no problems there don moulder shouldered his gun like davy crockett and followed the hedge towards the bottom field the lights were still out in the shop when the door opened before juanita could even get her key in the lock and diane hissed quick and pulled her inside she was so glad to find diane still on the premises that she didnt say a word until she arrived in the parlour and discovered the source of all the nights excitement sitting coolly in her rocking chair looking like arthur rackhams idea of a pagethree girl oh domini said hello sister bloody hell juanita stood in the doorway youve got a nerve i was in need of sanctuary and diana took me in diane said diane juanita said to diane is she pissed or what i certainly am not if you must try to explain everything i think im probably in a state of heightened consciousness while your husband said juanita sweetly is in a state of heightened stress heightened bewilderment and heightened likelihood of being nicked for criminal damage plus hes cut his hand rather badly breaking somebodys window domini sniffed not a terribly inventive response all told but not bad for a boring little turd of primary school teacher she uncrossed her legs and sat up hey come on this is what its all about juanita change no dont look at me like that this is what avalon does for us challenges all our preconceptions forces us to change get her out of here juanita said wearily oh said domini it was different for you then was it what when you threw your man out when carey and frayne lost its frayne diane said thats not awfully fair and then the phone rang excuse me juanita said perhaps it was jim perhaps hed gone straight home she hoped it was jim ill take it upstairs juanitas sitting room was directly above the shop and overlooked high street it appeared much quieter down there now nobody seemed to have called the police she could see a light on over the restyled holy thorn ceramics tony must have gone home well there was no room for bloody domini to sleep here she picked up the phone from the windowsill hello carey and frayne all she could hear was some awful wheezing oh please not a breather through the window she saw a large group of people drifting up the street from the assembly rooms where this utter dickhead pel grainger had been promoting his tenebral therapy hed been in the shop a couple of weeks back suggesting she should place a major order for his forthcoming book embracing the dark maybe she should if hed pulled a crowd that size mrs carey a man not jim she was sorry if jim had been about to say tonight what shed thought he was about to say then they really needed to talk not in a pub poor jim with his bikes and his brushes and all those paintings he was going to sell one day when hed found his grail poor buggering jim who shed thought was just a really good friend perhaps no man ever wanted to be just her friend was that a compliment at her age sorry she said into the phone yes its me mrs carey im so sorry im afraid im not awfully well little short of breath its timothy shepherd from the pixhill trust terribly sorry to telephone so late i did try earlier but there was no reply ive been out sorry no problem major you sound as if there is do i you sound a little stressed sorry its nothing nothing really look major if youre ringing to see how the books selling im afraid not very well at all major shepherd went into a prolonged coughing fit god what was the matter who him not just flu that was for sure dont worry about the book he said eventually mrs carey i should like to see you but im afraid im in no condition to travel to glastonbury would it be possible for you to come up here to cirencester i wouldnt presume upon your valuable time if i didnt think it was of some considerable importance could you come tomorrow she thought about tomorrows alreadyunnerving agenda jim to sort out with extreme tact and delicacy and the problem of the swastika boy should she urge diane to tell the police what she knew major quite honestly tomorrow could be a problem will you try i really dont think friday then i beg you to try mrs carey is there a particular problem about the book forget the damn book she could hear his voice going into a wheeze and a woman in the background exasperated gods sake tim major do you think i could call you back tomorrow evening look mrs carey all right rosemary im sorry mrs carey how can i approach this with you there are things you dont know parts of the diary we couldnt print for legal reasons elements of george pixhills past which have a bearing on what i what i understand is beginning to happen in glastonbury bloody pixhill juanita thought i wish id never heard of bloody pixhill all right she said ill come on friday thank you said major shepherd slowly bless you mrs carey he said it in a peculiar way as though it was an actual benediction a pleasure juanita said strained through the window she saw two women walking up the street one was dame wanda carlisle and please the major said please dont let me down verity endicott can no longer deal with this alone she watched the two women pass under the window dame wanda carlisle flamboyant in a cape and talk of the devil verity endicott a pace behind like a little chihuahua synchronicity juanita hated synchronicity she stood there holding the phone pushing back the metal aerial the button at its tip was missing and she kept pushing the point into her palm to experience the reality of pain more mystery i dont need any more flaming mystery major how does verity endicott come into this she saw a man in a cap and a belted raincoat crossing the road towards the bookshop goodnight mrs carey as though he hadnt heard major shepherd the man in the raincoat reached the kerb and pulled off his cap coils of thick grey hair tumbled out it wasnt a man at all oh shit juanita said ceridwen don moulder could never approach that bottom field now without a feeling of resentment it was well out of sight of the farmhouse bloody perfect it was gently sloping easy access from the road magnificent views to the tor ideal for housing also the only field hed hardly notice if it had gone when the snooty beggars at the council had turned the plan down don reckoned this was because griff daniel was involved and now hed lost his seat the planners were putting the boot in seemed like the only way to get the scheme through now was to get griff back on the council don slowed up gun pointing downwards now no lights down there nothing crafty devils griff daniel had been round earlier with a roll of posters for don to stick on his fences on telegraph and electric poles trees the posters said glastonbury first all would be clear very soon griff had said what was in the field was not clear at all even though there was a bit of a moon so he didnt need his handlamp yet there was something he could sense that the way you could sense whether there was livestock in a meadow in the dark although when don put out a hand to the five barred gate he found the old length of electric wire still looped around the posts and they never closed gates behind them didnt hippies rustlers hed ruled out soon as he figured the noise had to be coming from the bottom field sneaky well two could play that ole game don undid the wire gave the gate a prod moved silently through and pushed it shut behind him he crept out into the field to the edge of where it sloped down towards the road laid the unlit lamp at his feet and hefted his twelvebore stand by don stood there a moment in the soggy grass then he took a deep breath and stamped down with his right boot on the button of his lamp right then he roared whats all this who give you per his voice cut out like a wireless in a power failure the bloody ole lamp hadnt come on he snatched it up and shook it and still it didnt light up he dropped the useless bloody thing in the grass and thought about firing a shot into the air maybe not he looked up into the sky a haze of light was wreathed around the moon and you could make out a bit of nightmist below the tor you testin me lord it wasnt cold but it was damp and don shivered wanting to be in his bed with his old woman whoever they were theyd probably been scared off he picked up his lamp shoved his gun under his arm and turned away tramping grumpily back towards the gate at least he thought he was going back to the gate but when he put out his hand to unloop the wire he shouted in pain uuurgh bloody hedge fistful of damn thorns angry with himself now he must be in a wonky state if hed got lost in his own bloody field he kicked out with his left boot at where he figured the gate must be and it got snagged in the hedge and he was left limping about in a right old mess trying to drag his foot out and still keep the boot on while behind him in the silence of the bottom field came the hollow gaspandgrowl of an old engine starting up don moulder dropped his gun and lamp with the shock of it he wrenched his foot out of the hedge leaving the boot still ensnared there all right come outer there show yourselves i i can see you and he could under the moon in front of an old oak tree the green beggars had got officially protected so he wasnt allowed to chop it down it sat there under the tree a big black hippy bus engine throbbing come on then im awaitin for you don standing on one leg his bootless foot feeling cold the blight was over now all right it was winter in that field he could see the steam from his own breath rising and he realised he was afeared lights were coming on in front of the bus feeble greasy headlights that didnt light up anything not the grass nor the hedge nor the gate the lights hung either side of a radiator grille that was peeling off like a scab on a childs knee the bus lurched with a cackle of rustysounding gears and he thought oh christ theyre gonner run me over crouching and feeling for his twelve bore but finding only the lamp this time when he pressed the switch it lit up at once he shone it directly at the bus and it lit up the grass and the hedge and the old oak tree he wasnt allowed to chop down his mind spun he blinked lost his balance and fell to his hands the bus was still making its rattling cough but all he could see when frantically he shone his light at it were the hedge and the oak tree the noise of the bus cranked up like catarrhal laughter and filled the night and his head and all he could see in the lamplight was the grass and the hedge and the old oak tree he wasnt allowed to chop down oh no oh lord oh no his thumb found the limps switch he had to do this he had to oh lord please let breath coming raster now don snapped off the light the grass and the hedge and the oak tree vanished and there was a moment of calm before the vibration began the earth shaking under him an acrid smell beginning to filter through diesel and hot rubber gears meshed in the air and there in the roaring darkness was the bus right in front of him a halo of dirty smoke around it and wisps of grey steam dribbling out of its loose grinning radiator and only smog and shadow where its wheels should have been eight crone ceridwen wasnt her real name it was the name of the formidable celtic goddess of rebirth and transformation and thus was often brazenly assumed by seers and psychics with professional ambitions her real name was ruth dunn and she used to be a nurse she also claimed to have been a witch since childhood trained in the robed gardnerian tradition now she worked parttime at a newage nursing home on the pilton road and had an apartment near the glastonbury experience arcade where she forecast the future by scrying with a mirror and a bowl of rusty spring water from the chalice well ceridwen the goddesss representative in glastonbury usually seen on the street dressed in a mans greatcoat or as tonight in a district nurses gabardine mac her dense grey hair clamped under a cloth cap thank you she said to juanita thank you for looking after her ive come to take her home yessss domini breathed she looked radiant im to be apprenticed to the inner circle a neophyte wow juanita said somebody open a bottle of champagne she was furious bloody ceridwen shed come back to glastonbury after her divorce after losing custody of the children when her husband played the witchcraft card in front of a methodist judge raging with malice and greedily gathering the wretched wives of avalon to her embittered bosom now to juanitas horror diane was presenting ceridwen with a cup of tea thank you my dear ceridwen turned her large face on juanita you must be glad to have her back yes juanita said noncommittally shes grown up yes big girl now ruth ceridwen oh sorry juanita smiled there was a silence ceridwen lowered herself into the armchair sipped her tea diane do you remember coming to see me some years ago yes diane glanced apologetically at juanita used to like to call yourself diane fortune do you remember when she was a little girl juanita said people tend to grow out of giving themselves silly names ceridwen didnt look at her only at diane when she was in adolescence when the psychic portals were opening to her when she was having problems at home juanita said when she was scrabbling for an identity in a family where women dont count for much especially if they arent slim and beautiful ceridwen smiled still looking at diane i had heard you were going through a denial phase cant be good for business juanita if you no longer believe in the books youre selling indeed hard to see she turned to face juanita at last her industrialstrength alice band had slipped and thick grey hair obscured one glittering ebony eye how can you go on living in avalon while contriving to block it all out maybe im growing old and faded and bitter and cynical youre beautiful woman a sharp rebuke but you lack wisdom thank you ruth and yet ceridwen shrugged you may still have untapped potential domini said ceridwen could help you to find it if you showed some humility right juanita nodded seriously you mean i could learn how to scatter my books down the street and turn over my shop window to a plaster goddess with big tits and a cunt like a culvert diane gasped domini scowled ceridwen sipped her tea and smiled to herself go on juanita thought turn me into a hamster ceridwens eyes didnt move she said thats not what we do any more something cold and needle thin penetrated juanitas spine from within ceridwen sat in the stoveside chair like a big whistlers mother face still and hard and varnished she began to speak slowly the day will soon come woman when the only sanctuary to be found will be at the bosom of the goddess you know that we have to take full control of the spiritual life and welfare of this community and soon as for you ceridwen appraised juanita head to toe like a fashionshop manageress sizing up a customer or an undertaker estimating the amount of wood it would take for the coffin your time is close woman you have to come to terms with it itll happen sooner than you dread are you threatening me oh juanita ceridwen laughed i mean the hot flushes have you had the hot flushes yet there are as we say three aspects of the goddess the virgin the mother and piss off said juanita and the crone ceridwen placed her cup and saucer on the arm of the chair the hag she stood up stately and mature and wise the last transition for a woman she said gently can be a wonderful and fulfilling time full of enlightenment if you are on the path a time of wisdom and reflection and latent power she paused her large bosom swelled under the tight gabardine but it can also be a time of disillusion and decay constantly chilled by the draught of death it you reject the goddess inside you juanita found shed backed into the doorway the bitch the fucking bitch thats what they said about hrt she said lightly and was gratified to see ceridwens face darken come domini ceridwen said juanita stayed in the doorway where are you taking her tonys in the shop packing i trust said domini were going to a place of sanctuary ceridwen said let us through please wandas house ceridwen didnt reply the actresss elegant town house had been virtually taken over by the bloody cauldron it had endless bedrooms they would put domini in one surrounded by candles and ministering angels and the brainwash would be complete bollocks to that why dont you stay here domini juanita closed the parlour door her back to it both hands around its handle behind her take some time think about it youve a lot to lose tonys a decent guy ive been trying to tell her diane said as ceridwen came forward very much the nursing sister advancing down the ward briskly she closed in on juanita rapidly detaching her hands from the door handle taking juanitas hands in each of hers and bringing them tightly together grey coils of hair settled around the broad coarse face looking down on juanitas it had all happened very quickly juanita flinched halfexpecting the woman to hit her but when she spoke it was the voice of ruth dunn again the firm but kindly nurse you silly silly woman i think youre really quite unstable i think you need counselling ceridwen putting on a show of strength and sanity for diane and domini she was a much larger woman than juanita built for holding down distressed patients in the night the grip was stronger than it looked oh its understandable ceridwen said the voice of experience youre frustrated and depressed by your loss of belief and by dianes youth because yours has gone youre afraid that before you know it another twenty five years will have passed and youll look into the glass and your face will be the face of she raised her heavy eyebrows verity endicott positioning both of juanitas hands away from her body moulded together palm to palm like an oldfashioned teacher showing a child how to pray what lovely slender hands you still have she said almost tenderly and juanita was suddenly and irrationally scared that her palms might be fused together forever but youre afraid i think that beneath the silky brown skin which sadly now caresses only books juanita saw a splinter of spite in ceridwens eyes are an old womans curling claws let me go juanita felt a coldness under her heart how dare you how fucking dare you after a long moment ceridwen smiled relaxed and let both juanitas hands fall away like a discarded pair of silk gloves as the two women left domini smirking juanita felt sick and humiliated like jim battle after his execution at first she couldnt feel her hands at all selfconsciously she rubbed her palms together to restore the circulation experiencing a moment of relief followed by a palpitating insecurity and a creeping bitter shame diane went to shut the shop door no juanita walked out on to the pavement i need some air it was gone midnight the street was deserted not even one of those stoned guitarandbongo duos under the church wall the very air felt thin and exhausted used up by lungs involved in excess panting and screaming and sighing the town was full of madness tonight she walked across the street to the warmemorial a good twenty feet high and carved like a celtic cross iron railings separated it from st johns churchyard juanita leaned against the railings pulled out her cigarettes weve got problems here she said as diane joined her look diane stared down at her trainers on the first step of the memorial what she said that was awful cruel but but true juanita said it wouldnt have been cruel otherwise ive looked at verity endicott more than once and thought yeah thatll be me one day toddling round the town with my shopping bag when all the shops have closed thats not what i meant youre not remotely like miss endicott i hope i look like you when im fortysomething i wish i looked like you now oh shut up diane juanita lit a cigarette listen we really have a problem nothing to do with that woman i wish you hadnt offended her oh for gods sake diane that boy headlice diane went still hes dead juanita said im sorry to tell you like this it was in tonights paper they found his body in an abandoned bus in a wood at stoke st michael diane stared across the street as if it were a distance of several miles he had head injuries juanita said it has to be him because ofyou mentioned a swastika on top of his head the police are suspicious you know what that means dont you diane put her arms around the stem of the celtic cross her shoulders shook theyre appealing to anyone with pertinent information to come forward which probably includes anyone who might have seen the boy having his head kicked in by their fathers farm manager diane laid her cheek against the stone diane was it his own bus that he was found in it was a black bus diane nodded i really think you need to go to the police juanita said tomorrow ill come with you they wouldnt believe me dianes voice was tiny my father would say id made it all up hed tell them i was unbalanced just like he always does theyd still have to check it out but she was right juanita sighed lord pennard and rankin had had a whole day to make provisions for this incident getting out theyd have something ready some watertight story especially now the boy was dead also pennard would undoubtedly have connections at chief constable level and beyond and with archers political career on the line and all it represented in terms of the future wealth and influence of the house of pennard there was nothing they wouldnt do listen ill get jim to look after the shop while we go to the police station of course shed have to promise jim first that nothing would come out about the execution what a can of worms theyll ask why i didnt report it before diane said because you didnt know the boy was dead she put a hand on dianes shoulder come on diane fortune ill make us some hot chocolate an amber streetlamp reddened and juanita looked up warily diane dabbed her eyes with a tissue i was wrong about the pilgrims they werent terribly nice people at all they made headlice go into church backwards and they gave him drugs quite juanita tried not to think about sickles and animal masks if only she could tell diane precisely what the nice pilgrims had done to jim and her but a promise unfortunately was a promise he had a horrible life diane said he just wanted something he could believe in dont we all as they walked back to the shop juanita found herself thinking of colonel pixhill and fancied she could feel wings of foreboding overhead like some shadow hangglider nine like say ghost yesterday joe powys had been to hereford library and got out everything they had on uncle jack powys hed brought back as many books as hed been allowed to they were all spread out now on his desk back at the cottage eight of them it was six fifteen am hed awoken in the dark thinking about it a little scared uncle jack uncle bloody jack where did this come from you grow up assuming a certain kinship with one of the greatest literary figures of the twentieth century there has to be a reasonable basis for it but the more joe powys investigated the more he found that there wasnt last night hed called up relatives he hadnt spoken to since he was a kid joe joe powys pow your cousin thats right marys son feeling embarrassed as hell now arnold the dog sitting by his chair laughing at him the way he did with his orblike brown eyes none of the relatives had heard of any kind of link with john cowper powys none of them remembered it being a family name so he was the only one of them with the surname powys what did that say i know what youre thinking arnold powys said i suggest you forget it arnold kind of shrugged lay down and lowered his head to his paws one of the relatives had said all i remember joe is for a long time we thought you must be lens boy auntie mary never discussed it what his mum used to tell him was that his father had messed around with bad women and theyd got divorced when he was a baby and uncle jack had looked after them until len came along later powys had figured that his mother and father had never been married at all but he didnt push it never searched out his birth certificate pretty sure hed find out he was registered under his mums maiden name not powys she used to talk about uncle jack until he was maybe ten he had memories of books by jcp on the shelves when he was small but not when he was old enough to read them with any understanding his mum in later years read only magazines and when he visited her two years before she died even the shelves had gone now len was dead too that last time when hed asked his mother who was uncle jack and shed looked blank hed smiled and not pushed it what did it matter anyway true john cowper powys had lived not that far from wrexham in the last part of his life true his mother had been a district nurse whod moved around merseyside and north wales and might well have encountered the old bloke maybe even nursed him old being the key word here jcp born in the s had been very old when joe was born it really didnt seem at all likely that john cowper powys was his father over the years powys had tossed around a few more likely explanations say mum arrives back in wrexham with an illegitimate baby and she needs a name for him and there on the shelf is some book by john cowper powys which is a nice name and doesnt sound phoney and so maybe she becomes mrs powys until she marries len so the baby who should have been joe morris becomes joe powys by the time she marries len hes nearly five years old and is used to the name maybe cant get his mouth so easily around devereaux which is lens name and because it was jcp who saved her reputation when the chips were down mum retains a soft spot for the old guy and the legend of uncle jack the benefactor is born its a persistent kind of myth joe likes it and when he comes to write a book about mystical aspects of the british countryside which turns out to be a minor bestseller and people ask him if by any chance hes descended from one or other of the famous literary siblings theodore llewellyn and john cowper powys he well he doesnt deny it and ben corby never asked in case the answer was the wrong one none of which explained the incidents of the book in the night powys was afraid of ghosts he didnt used to think he was he believed in them believed they were just beyond the boundaries of human understanding and only just he used to believe in the taperecording theory of ghosts that they were emotional imprints on the atmosphere events replaying themselves over and over therefore ghosts were harmless harmless harmless harmless around nine am joe looked up from jcps autobiography in which uncle jack confesses early on to being some kind of sadomasochist hence the tortured figure of the self crucifying welshman owen evans in a glastonbury romance powys thought masochism and went to the phone scrabbling in the desk drawer for his contacts book he had misgivings about this what he might be opening up and having to endure the scorn of course but he made the call anyway and was lucky as it happened brendan donovan had just arrived at the university nine am too early surely for really withering rhetoric ok powys brendan donovan said i may possibly be able to accommodate a fiveminute argument the full half hour would require an appointment some years ago professor brendan donovan of the edinburgh university department of parapsychology had reviewed the revised massmarket paperback of the old golden land for the scotsman perhaps the most complimentary phrase in this review had been whimsical drivel powys unschooled in the etiquette traditionally observed between reviewer and reviewed had telephoned dr donovan for a meaningful discussion others had followed over the years brendan donovan had mellowed slightly if you wish to discuss the spiritpath theory of leylines with particular reference to linear anomalies in the peruvian desert he said now youll find me a touch more amenable than i may have been regarding socalled earthenergies only a touch more you understand because leylines of course do not exist poltergeists powys said bluntly heavens donovan said my weak spot i know that is powys so long as you do not attempt to try my patience by allowing any contentious words to intrude like say ghost how about psychokinetic energy generated by a disturbed adolescent welltrodden ground much safer in that case how about psychokinetic energy generated by someone for whom adolescence is no more than a slightly feverish memory like who said donovan like me hmm donovan said give me two minutes to summon a cup of fortifying coffee i shall call you back well lets be reasonable here it wasnt arnold was it nobody really knows what goes on down there in the subconscious nobody knows what seeds planted in the psyche of a small child will start to germinate in the adult and with what effects ok the trigger joe powys is alone his woman has resumed her career left him behind in a cottage in the sticks subconsciously he knows she isnt coming back his book has been rejected and his home is not really his home its still henry kettles even though henry is dead because henry had identity which joe doesnt have any more maybe never did have the subconscious grows into midlife crisis who is joe powys even the guys name isnt real the subconscious gets extremely resentful it reverts to the persona of a disturbed adolescent it finds a focus for all that resentful energy uncle jack bloody uncle jack well its interesting powys brendan donovan said it possesses a certain flawed logic however i still have a problem with it well of course you do what im doing here is groping for the psychological solution i havent said anything about the elements you dont like power of place earthforce the thinness of the veil on the welsh border but its there by implication isnt it because the house was the home of this waterdiviner kettle it is more receptive its atmosphere remains charged i didnt say that and therefore is capable of transforming the frustration of its unhappy occupant into psychokinetic energy yes well could be discounting all that which i am of course predisposed to do out of hand the problem i have with all this is that the adolescent energy we suspect may cause poltergeist phenomena is essentially a sexual energy i assume powys you have not begun to find satisfaction in scourging yourself with barbed wire or something occasionally i beat myself with henrys old dowsing rods apart from that of course he may have done who john cowper powys always liked to think of himself as some kind of sadomasochist ah so youre obsessed with this man donovan said curiously i hardly ever thought of him id forgotten that book was even on the shelf consciously id forgotten which book are we talking about a glastonbury romance his masterpiece about twelve hundred pages havent read it lifes too short for fiction whats it about its basically a west country soapopera set in the s far as i can remember its about people in pursuit of their ideas of the holy grail and the tensions between spiritual and commercial demands and people getting their rocks off spiritually and sexually i may be wrong its a long time since i breezed through it and this same book every time asked donovan every time too neat said donovan too neat to be true ah you think im lying indeed im a scientist what proof can you show me ive got a witness your publisher how very convenient isnt it powys admitted gloomily be a marvellous story for your own next publication no chance before i could give a useful opinion you would have to precipitate this book from its shelf under laboratory conditions but then you knew that brendan if you bumped into your late granny at the tea machine youd make her take out her teeth under laboratory conditions and in the present circumstances of course my findings would have to include the probability of an author in decline attempting to kickstart his flagging career i knew youd say that too so why did you telephone me im a masochist runs in the family brendan donovan laughed do you know what i might do in your place resign powys said i might go to glastonbury and open myself to all the wonderful earthforces in the hope that my grail awaited me there no you wouldnt i wouldnt im explaining what i might do if perish the thought i were you forget it i probably had glastonbury on my mind in a negative context having received this very morning a review copy of a book even more foolish than your own revered opus by an american of course one w pelham grainger phd who wants us all to enrich our lives by bonding with the living darkness absolute tosh he lives near glastonbury as it happens my my i must remember to record this coincidence in my arthur koestler appreciation society diary powys shook his head away with you donovan said away to your avalon thanks very much powys said ill expect your bill in the mail my meter records let me see twenty five minutes prove it powys said laboratory conditions ten his stain bastards woolly threw the daily press on to juanitas counter bastards bastards bastards his roughened elbow poked through a hole in his shapeless orange sweater the rubber band securing his stringy ponytail had snapped he looked like an ageing dickensian street urchin there were tears in his eyes im so sorry woolly juanita said but its hardly a surprise is it she could see in his face that no it hadnt been a surprise but thered still been that final strand to be snipped before the rope broke and dropped him into the black pit she turned the paper around on the counter the story was frontpage lead green light for mway the controversial bathtaunton expressway is to go ahead despite furious protests from environmentalists the report of the twomonth public inquiry published today rejects claims that the proposed route would be a savage rape of central somerset but a leading opponent of the plan said last night well fight them to the last tree the government claims the road is the only way to end crippling congestion in several small towns and villages especially during the holiday season it will also link the county firmly into the transeuropean road network opening up major industrial and commercial possibilities according to local authority chiefs who have welcomed the decision got a call from the paper late last night asking for a quote woolly said too choked to give a reasoned response just wanted to get it over that wed be reforming the action committee only it come out a bit stronger like sheesh mendip councillor edward woolaston one of the original protesters said no way are they going to get away with this this is going to be a nationwide issue even a world issue and well fight them to the last tree juanita didnt know what to say the thought of an enormous public protest with the police and armies of security men guarding the site and people getting hurt made her feel faintly sick the thing is woolly it just never works thereve been so many fullscale road protests and it just leaves everyone beaten and bitter look at newbury batheaston twyford down if the government decides a roads going through it goes through she stared despondently through the window all the shards of pottery had disappeared from the gutters which streamed now with dark rain apart from holy thorn ceramics being closed youd think nothing exceptional had occurred in high street last nights spark in the air had fizzled out there was no sign of either tony or domini and the thing is woolly if you organise a militant protest to stop the road all it does is split the community even more because most of the locals think its a good thing they dont like the idea of the countryside being ripped up but if it prevents traffic snarlups and children being run over and heavy lorries shaking their foundations oh hell you know all this better than i do a lot of those people voted for you and wont vote for me again if im behind this protest said woolly soberly but i got to go with my conscience were fighting for the west countrys right to breathe were fighting for green hills places to walk places to be were fighting to stop them selling britain for scrap sorry there i go again councillor bloody woolaston its all a sham being a councillor there is no democracy juanita pushed the newspaper away so you want me to tell people what tell em theres an emergency meeting tonight put it round seventhirty assembly rooms now theyve made a decision they wont hang around itll be bulldozers and chainsawgangs on every horizon before we know it still you know how you could help mmm well dont sound so excited my love im sorry lot on my mind the idea of putting rankin in the frame for murder seemed less straightforward than it had last night you could never be sure what diane was going to say how much of her statement would include what she might consider normal but the police would see as the ravings of a certifiable psychiatric case the avalonian i mean woolly was saying you get the avalonian on the streets wed at least have a reliable mouthpiece to counter all the propaganda i have to tell you councillor juanita said severely that the avalonian isnt going to be anybodys mouthpiece well yeah i accept that but but it will be fair and maybe consider certain viewpoints that the regular press would be a touch queasy about fair enough fair enough whats your schedule i dont know february maybe things are moving as it happens ive just sent diane to the printshop to get acquainted with sam daniel shes a little nervous having heard that sam thinks all upper class people should be placed against a wall and shot hes a good boy is sam you only got to listen to his old man to know that i thought griff daniel hated the ground sam walks on exactly said woolly a good boy in the square entrance hall he stood on the flagstones under one of the high deepsunk windows either side of the front door and nodded approval see verity the old tudor guys built this place they had it right they understood the importance of luminarycontrol hence the restrictive fenestration everybody says this was down to defence but that was only part of the calculation dr pel grainger wore a formal black jacket over black jeans and black trainers in daylight he looked shorter and rather less imposing as she supposed he would given that the night was his chosen environment seeing him at the door so early had been quite a shock rather like seeing an owl perching on ones bird table verity you are just so lucky to have this place to yourself dr grainger smiled showing small rather stumpy teeth their whiteness enhanced by the blackness of his closemown beard which is how you got to look at the situation from now on in lucky cornered by wanda last night dr grainger had expressed to veritys dismay immediate interest in meadwell it sounded the kind of place he said where just being there could virtually put you into secondstage tenebral symbiosis when verity had tried to explain to dr grainger that even in her time here meadwell had not always been as dark as this the american had nodded indulgently he could explain this or maybe he told her when his therapy programme began to take effect she wouldnt need to have it explained well perhaps it would work perhaps after tenebral therapy there would be more than the usual few precious moments of clarity when she first awoke before her thoughts began to contract under the pressure of the house dr grainger moulded his body to one of the oak pillars ran his hands up and down it verity had heard at the assembly rooms of people who liked to hug trees to share their lifeforce but hugging centuriesold longdead oak and heres another thing he stepped away giving the oak a fraternal sort of pat as if they had already established a rapport i have been horrified since i came here to see how many owners of old houses kind of bleach their beams to make them lighter can you believe that see oak is wonderful wood because it absorbs darkness so well so three four centuries of storing the dark and these people want to take it all away can you believe that perhaps they verity swallowed perhaps they just want to make it more cheerful dr grainger almost choked on his own laughter thats a joke right right said verity weakly you know verity i could really use this house its hard to find one of these late medieval homes that hasnt been tampered with windows enlarged all this maybe i could hire it maybe a weekend seminar here in the summer or around christmas he stood on tiptoe and slipped a hand into a dim space between the jacobean corner cupboard and the ceiling yeah he said with satisfaction but no explanation tell me whys it called meadwell verity explained about the well in the grounds is old as the chalice well and similarly credited with great curative powers but unfortunately sealed up now because of a possible pollution problem uh huh a knowing smile uh huh now i begin to understand your problem here how could he this was utterly ludicrous seems to me that what may have happened is the house has become repressed because people have been afraid of it yeah so what we got to do verity i we got to alter the houses selfimage and yours remember when you learn to embrace the dark the darkness will embrace you back yes said verity thank you youve made me feel better about it but he hadnt hed made her feel worse and when they went upstairs and dr grainger began to peer into the bedrooms in search of deeper and denser shadows verity could almost hear the voice of major shepherd oh verity verity why didnt you tell me about this dr grainger was crouching in a comer of the landing both hands moving in empty air trying to locate what he called the crepuscular core of the house this is commonly the place where most shadows meet the repository of the oldest the least disturbed darkness you following me i dont want to know verity almost panicked i dont want to know where this place is and she was so grateful when there was a rapping from below the front door excuse me please dr grainger she almost ran downstairs to the hall where a little light pooled on the flagstones probably the postman it was his time she unbolted the door oh it was not the postman well well miss endicott a deep educated voice and there was something strikingly familiar about it that made her feel both afraid and strangely joyful she stared at him a tall and slender man in his late thirties or early forties his face lean his jawline deep his eyes penetratingly familiar when he smiled she noticed that he did not have a moustache does not have a moustache she caught herself thinking this and wondered why you dont remember me do you miss endicott im so sorry verity blushed something about him something so painfully known but i was only a boy when we last met he put out a hand oliver he said oliver pixhill one of the huntsmen what appeared to be a savage snarl on his face was beating a hound away from a dead stag too late its head was awfully messed up and one of its antlers looked broken it was very important to huntsmen that the head should be unspoiled diane winced across the bottom of the scene was pasted a pageheading from a holiday guide it read the quantocks a real haven for wildlife the photo had been blown up all grainy the caption had a serrated edge what diane had learned on the paper in yorkshire to call a ragout it made a pretty devastating poster and it hung uncompromisingly just inside the door sometimes we go out at night a bunch of us sam daniel said paste em on a few tourist offices show the visitors what its really like in the pretty countryside plus it shows blood sports arent what youd call compatible with a touristbased economy he gave diane a candid sort of look as though defying her to report him to the police another test people were always testing her as though you couldnt expect automatically to trust anyone whose name was prefixed by the honourable your old man done any of that stags foxes diane said we havent got many stags in our part of the county sam pulled on his earring ah well you know i figured maybe hed done a bit as a guest of one of the hunts over exmoor way they like to involve as many nobs as they can get those bastards social cred i dont think so or maybe you didnt like to ask him you dont diane said you dont ask my father anything like that or if you do you dont expect to get a reply anyway what about your father doesnt he shoot like griff sam daniel was stocky but not so heavy he grinned through quarterinch stubble i dont ask him anything either mainly on account of we dont talk the printshop the sign just said samprint was on the corner of grope lane quite a central location diane didnt know much about computers and laserprinters but it all looked jolly impressive there was also a young boy called paul sixteen his first job computerwhizz sam said sam was about thirty and not so notorious nowadays not since hed been dismissed from the county planning department after his conviction for assault while sabotaging a hunt the beaufort hunt as it happened the one prince charles sometimes rode with diane seemed to remember sam had got off with a conditional discharge but it still made all the papers in the very week griff daniel had been installed as chairman of the district council diane looked around the room at the equipment which must have cost well thousands i thought you must have sort of made it up with your father what him invest in me sam swept his buccaneers hair back off his shoulders and rolled his head juanita had said it was no secret in glastonbury that griff blamed his subsequent electoral defeat on the publicity over sams court case despite his celebrated no son of mine statement to the gazette business loan this was sam said achieved after a lot of grovelling and blatant lying so if theres a chunk of the ffitch fortune going spare i can give you an immediate directorship hows that sound super diane said but as my father likes to remind me every so often my personal position is sort of you know whats the word destitute sam grinned and shook his head he clearly didnt believe that nobody ever could quite ive got a van diane said if thats any use for deliveries and things with pink spots and holes in the side just what he needed to boost his image within the business community can you write is the main thing sam said can you make this thing read like a proper paper instead of the usual old hippy shit she imagined huge stacks of the avalonian piling up by the door under the antiblood sports posters the image was quite exciting and sam did seem like the sort of person who could help make it happen she knew juanita had sent her along here in the hope that she would become inspired and also to take her mind off that trip to the police station and headlice i could have saved him actually im really not very good she said a little breathlessly in yorkshire i was always forgetting to ask peoples ages and all that my spelling isnt terrific either sam slowly shook his head ah tis the usual problem with you aristocrats always so arrogant and full of yourselves a shadow fell across the window of the printshop accompanied by a thump on the glass and sam looked up sharply and then made a dive for the door hey piss off pal something had been stuck to the outside of the window bloody darryl davey that was sam came back into the shop holding a yellow printed sheet hed torn from the glass about all hes fit for flyposting thick bastard he unrolled the yellow paper glastonbury first a public meeting to bunch a new initiative for the promotion of priorities in the town and its environs will be held tonight nov i at the town hall pm sam daniel sniffed the paper suspiciously the old man he said i can smell the old man all over this verity was at once horribly anxious oliver pixhill it must be thirty years since shed seen him and on that occasion shed chased him angrily away i hope it isnt inconvenient no she felt an awful blush coming on not at all besides it had been not long after shed taken over as housekeeper oliver and his mother having moved into the town the boy had returned with his schoolfriend archer ffitch and an air pistol both of them far too young to have such a thing in their possession old place doesnt change does it oliver pixhill stooped to enter doesnt it frighten you being here alone in the winter verity had found the dead bullfinch on the path near the back door the boys sitting on the wall grinning at her their legs swinging i im used to it she stammered thinking of the american poking around upstairs looking for the heart of the darkness wondering how he might alter the houses selfimage oh lord what was she going to do how was she going to explain this oliver pixhill was a member of the trust it would get back to major shepherd i expect youre wondering why im here oliver was soberly attired in a business suit he was verity understood some sort of corporate lawyer in the city silly to judge him on that one incident from his childhood you have every right to be here that is im very glad to see you mr pixhill there was the sound of footsteps overhead oliver glanced up briefly but didnt question it verity was struggling to put together an explanation in her head about a man who was very interested in old dark houses and my father would never allow me to visit him here you know oliver walked languidly over to the stairs but didnt look up he looked unnervingly like the colonel as verity first remembered him perhaps a little taller sharper in the jaw hed come to my mothers flat two or three times a week and sometimes take me for walks but he would never let me come here wasnt that odd i used to think he was trying to protect me from something i suppose he simply thought it was a rather gloomy old place for a boy to grow up in verity said lamely certainly your mother did thats what you were told was it an eyebrow rose i see i what could she say how could she even start to explain but she didnt have to black trainers appeared on the stairs verity i found it moving quickly and lightly for a man of his bulk dr pel grainger padded down the last few steps and arrived next to her looking fulfilled like a cat with a bird the crepuscular core a slight misnomer but i like the phrase oh good morning dr grainger this verity held the oak pillar to steady herself this is mr oliver pixhill the son of my late employer her voice was small and dead like the bullfinch mr pixhill this is hi dr grainger was already shaking hands with oliver dr pel grainger oliver pixhill shook hands said nothing he tilted his head enquiringly and did not have to wait long within a minute to veritys mounting distress dr grainger had identified himself as a therapist specialising in tenebral psychosis which he explained was not entirely dissimilar to seasonal affective disorder only allyearround more intense and usually connected to a particular dwelling he identified verity as his patient verity burst into tears oh have i been indiscreet dr grainger turned to oliver pixhill i guess you knew nothing of this right i certainly did not olivers deep voice was full of surprise and concern he guided verity through to the dining hall hands on her quaking shoulders i did not indeed oliver pulled out a chair for her at the long table at which she hadnt sat since the abbots dinner he took the chair next to hers miss endicott this is utterly dreadful none of us knew about this i feel absolutely devastated and guilty please its my fault im so ive been back in this house miss endicott for less than ten minutes and already im finding the atmosphere decidedly oppressive we shall have to get you out no you dont und mr pixhill grainger said from the head of the table where the abbot sat i can help this lady i have got this im sure your therapeutic techniques are entirely creditable what im saying is she should never have been left here alone and that is the responsibility of the pixhill trust im going to make it my business to find miss endicott fully furnished accommodation in the shortterm and then you dont understand verity gripped the edge of the table this is my responsibility i made a promise to your father he looked astonished good god you really think my father was in a fit mental state to extract a promise from anyone your father was a great man verity whispered my father gently oliver took her hands in his he hesitated he took a breath miss endicott my father was a deeply unhappy man with a paranoid and obsessive nature who ruined his own and other peoples lives through no verity snatched her hands back thats a thats untrue oliver said with compassion i do know how you felt about him you know she stared at him through a blur of angry tears saw an unexpected pain in olivers eyes his fathers eyes he was my father and im frankly tired of having him venerated its time the truth was acknowledged what can you know of the truth hard to get the words out her throat was so tight verity ive made it my business to find out the truth you never wanted to you loved him too much verity gasped oliver held up a placatory hand oh not in any physical sense i dont suppose i doubt he was interested in that side of things anymore stop it verity drew a handkerchief from her sleeve wiped her eyes i dont want to hear any more of this oliver shrugged all i know is the oppressive darkness i felt when i entered here was nothing to do with the age of the building nothing to do with the legend of abbot whiting you know that verity rose and backed away from him its him miss endicott you know that too youve always known it him and his obsessions his delusions his selfimportance his invented visionary experiences his crazy rambling diaries the darkness in here is him how can you say these things verity wouldnt look at him he destroyed my mother he neglected his parental responsibilities and hes left his stain on this place jesus you can feel him the selfinflicted misery of him verity covered her ears but his voice was low and insistent i asked you if you were afraid and you said you were used to it well of course you are part of you wants to feel hes still here thats what he left you his stain no verity began to beat her knuckles on the table no oliver stood up this is the source of your darkness dr grainger george pixhill last and most pathetic of a long line of pseudomystics whove thrown away their lives in glastonbury you dont need to teach her how to wallow in it shes been doing it for half her life verity said quietly i think you should leave oliver i havent told you why i came i do not wish to know i think you do oliver said softly i came to tell you that major shepherd was rushed to hospital late last night verity went very still and died early this morning im afraid oliver said im so sorry eleven the bell mrs whitney said its not my place to say it joe but you are looking just terrible shed come round from next door with some of her homemade soup leek and lentil shed done this once or twice a week since hed been on his own sorry joe powys said shakily didnt get to bed until late bad habit to get into hed fallen asleep in the chair sat down to mull over his conversation with brendan donovan and just dropped off woken to arnold whining softly beneath his chair and thud it couldnt not in broad daylight i dont know at all mrs whitney punched his arm in exasperation look at the size of them great black circles round your eyes you look like one of them pandas didnt ought to be all alone out here with just that dog isnt normal young chap like you she stood in the doorway rising up in her bobbled slippers trying to peer over his shoulder perhaps thinking she might be able to spot a syringe and bag of white powder unfair joyce was ok henry kettle had thought so too im fine powys said honest to god ho mrs whitney said scornfully and bustled past him she didnt get far he heard her gasp all it is powys said i was looking for something a book got carried away joyce you know how it is when you start moving things you cant stop well yes on the whole about as convincing as a mad axeman in a pool of blood claiming to have had a small mishap clipping his toenails mrs whitney left very quickly her face as white as the tops of the hills after this weeks short lived snow it wasnt just the lamp this time no indeed jesus inside the house the phone rang he let it it had rung several times starting just as hed opened his eyes to the sight of a glastonbury romance in the centre of the hearthrug hed picked up the phone and the line had been dead not the dialling tone not the breathy echo of somebody with the wrong number or making a hoax call just dead the sound youd get if you were holding a banana to your ear about a minute later it happened again hed put it down and picked it up and there was a perfect clear dialling tone and this was when the whole shelf had collapsed and the books had come out horizontally not falling actually spraying into the room taking the lamp and the radio with them and powys had thrown himself behind the sofa and screamed at the wall at least hed intended to scream but it came out like a whimper and arnold flew out from under the chair and began to snarl which was when mrs whitney knocked on the front door mrs whitney and the leek and lentil soup better come and have this in my kitchen joe be warmed up in ten minutes less than five minutes later he came out followed by arnold the air was chilly the mist was a flimsy tent over the forestry blotting out the hill farms so that there was just the two cottages one of them occupied by a bloke who only had to close his eyes now for something to happen maybe when he went to sleep some kind of energy escaped from him and oh come on you know better than to start theorising these things happen leave it alone dont be afraid dont respond and itll stop sooner or later it will stop next door mrs whitney sat him down by the rayburn warmed up the soup and stood over him while he spooned it up arnold lying across his trainers mr kettle now he had this trouble more than once she said conversationally i remember when he was dowsing for a new well at the old burton place by kinsham what trouble exactly oh dont you go taking me for a fool joe i lived next door to mr kettle for too many years magnet for it that man so what do you think i should do well its not just the house is it never is just a house thats what mr kettle used to say just that house reacts quicker than most houses on account of mr kettle if anything comes in i dont know where you couldve picked something up though joe you never goes anywhere much maybe it was looking for me god i said i wouldnt do this again if you respond to something you just encourage it this is deep waters joe mrs whitney put the teapot on the rayburn i dont know what to say mr kettle now he knew how to deal with this sorter business but you if you dont mind me saying so you probly dont it could be deeply comforting having a neighbour like mrs whitney who had lived next door to henry kettle for many years and accepted dowsing and everything it brought with it as just another aspect of traditional country life like blacksmithing and septic tanks get somebody in you think i should do that mr kettle never liked to get nobody in he was against all that nothing psychic he used to say nothing psychic go away then get myself sorted out i dont know what to say said mrs whitney your fay shes not coming back is she through the wall they could hear the phone ringing in powyss living room sooner or later youre going to have to answer that mrs whitney said i think theres a fault on the line no i dont think shell come back fay will probably go through life without anything happening to her again if he accepted a cup of strong tea if she keeps away from you mrs whitney said that what you mean that probably was what he meant thats no life joe shell find somebody mrs whitney sat down opposite him i meant for you no life at all just you and that dog writing your books and walking the hills and trying to ignore stuff and your hair going greyer and them circles under your eyes getting bigger no life joe that isnt it took him nearly an hour to put all the books back and assess the damage for instance the radio wouldnt work it had fallen facedown and now it was dead possibly something had drained the batteries this had been known to happen he stood looking at the shelves an unstable cliffface he put his hands flat to the books leaned in like you stop an avalanche the phone wobbled as if it was about to ring but it didnt i cant stand this but if i leave itll go with me at least if i stay here theres mrs whitney and the leek and lentil soup the phone rang he stared at it he could see his own fingermarks sweatprinted on the white plastic he contemplated picking it up hurling it at the wall wanted to do some violence back didnt want it to think he was spooked when he picked up the phone it wasnt dead any more hello joe powys he hadnt got the breath to reply im sorry is that jm powys no detectable threat here nothing untoward the voice sounded quite agreeable yes he coughed sorry joe my names dan frayne at harveycalder ive been looking at your manuscript what this was bloody quick unbelievably quick even if ben corby had dashed straight into the office with the manuscript as soon as hed got back told this bloke frayne it was wonderful unmissable and frayne had read it immediately it still didnt figure this was not how publishers worked do you ever get up to london dan frayne asked hang on powys changed hands put the phone to his other ear i dont understand i mean you cant have had time to read it mr frayne well thats true dan frayne said but ive read the old golden land which i thought was wonderful at the time and uh ben corby told me all about the new book about the way your attitude had changed he tell you anything else dan frayne laughed i have to say that when ben got back he er he kind of wanted to talk to somebody old ben was a little bit shaken not himself amazing powys looked up at the big fat novel on the top shelf hed put it back on the shelf rather than keep it on a table or locked in a cupboard you mustnt respond theres an idea ive been tossing around for some time dan frayne said book i thought an old friend of mine should write though ive never mentioned it to her then i thought she was too close to it maybe someone should do it with her but it would have to be someone of a like mind because this friend of mine anyway id like to talk to you powys was confused let me get this right we are not now talking about mythscapes we are talking about another book entirely were talking about adapting and expanding the ideas in mythscapes in a way that would make it rather more publishable i dont like the sound of it come down and discuss it huh well meet all expenses had ben corby told this bloke joe powys was financially challenged so broke in fact that he would write stuff to order say this weekend dan frayne suggested or hey can you get a train tonight powys was about to say no way piss off when he looked up at the book again he thought he saw it move he had an alarming vision of it emerging from the shelf as if someone had slotted a forefinger into the top of its damaged spine and hurled it with hurricane force at his head the voice in his ear said look ok ill tell you when it clicked it was when ben told me and he hated telling me he made me swear not to mention it to anyone upstairs it was when he told me about the book a glastonbury romance that was when the little bell did this ping the little bell the little bell that only pings for publishers maybe once or twice a year that bell huh powys looked up at the book again it sat comfortably in its space between john cowper powyss weymouth sands and owen glendower neither of which powys had read he got the feeling the book like frayne was waiting for his answer twelve rescue remedy jims living room was all studio now it had started as a gesture against bloody pat who he fervently hoped would never see it the sofa pushed back to make space for the easels the coffee table acting at first as a rest for the palette then becoming a palette colours mixed directly on to the varnish bloody pat would have thrown a fit gradually the painting had crowded the rest of jims needs into corners the cooker where he made his meals the table where he ate the tv he hardly ever watched the armchair where he sometimes fell asleep pondering a composition problem knowing that as soon as he awoke he could go for it everything to hand interior walls had been taken out wherever possible exposing the whole of the ground floor where two pillars of ancient oak helped keep the ceiling up at the western end of the room opposite the dingy little fireplace half the wall had been taken out and replaced with glass almost floor to ceiling most artists were supposed to prefer northern light not jim he called it his sunset window and on good nights it had become a sheet of burning gold as in bring me my bow of burning gold bring me my arrows of desire a bad joke now hed fired off his pathetic arrows of desire shot his buggering bolt this time and no mistake awakening to filthy grey light hed closed his eyes again in weariness remembering he was supposed to be in the bookshop today and at once had seen juanitas lovely face with its gorgeously expansive smile the tumble of heavy hair the brown arms those exquisitely exposed shoulders who might paint her nude degas renoir modigliani certainly not battle no more spell broken done it himself like crunching a delicate glass bauble in his fist no going back to that shop today nor ever couldnt face her again would never be the same no laughter no banter surely shed realise that jim had rolled sluggishly out of bed peered out at the mist couldnt see farther than the buggering ash tree thinking at first that he would paint in the very centre of the studio the three oldfashioned black metal easels were set up in a pyramid formation his works in progress the glorious dusk over the past few weeks hed digested so much dusk he should be able to summon its colours and textures at any time of day even on a lousy damp morning the lousiest dampest morning of his buggering lousy life but when hed stood in front of the canvases thered been a congestion in his head it felt soggy spongy and hed found himself wondering absurdly if it had been his hat which had held his creativity together helped to contain the glowing dusk keep it burning in his head hed inspected the paintings on the easels skies of clay fields of carpet and lino no mystery no mystery there at all they were rubbish he couldnt paint what the hell had ever made him think he could paint poor bloody pat right all along eh the sense of loss had settled around jim like a grey gas like the first morning after the unexpected death of someone loved which was one way of putting it hed gone back to bed taking with him a bottle of johnnie walker intermittently hed awoken feeling cold clouds obscuring the day whisky obscuring his thoughts what was left of life with his muse gone forever what could even glastonbury ever mean to him again sometimes hed hear a distant ringing as the rain rolled like tears down the windows he isnt answering perhaps hes out painting diane said in the rain well perhaps hes painting inside then you know how he hates to be disturbed while hes painting he shouldnt be painting at all he knows he always comes in on a friday he juanita broke off looked hard at diane you dont want to do this do you you dont want to go to the police confusion was corrugating dianes forehead shed been looking almost cheerful on her return from sam daniels printshop did juanita know about this glastonbury first meeting no juanita didnt well well griff and archer obviously werent letting the grass grow a coincidence too that it should be held the same time as woollys road protest meeting or was it they ought to keep tabs on this perhaps she could go to one meeting and diane to the other assuming they were back from the police station in time and then juanita looking at her watch had said perhaps they really ought to be going soon if only jim would turn up diane hadnt answered and that was when juanita not wanting to give her any more time to change her mind had rung jim and now diane said ive been thinking juanita perhaps i should talk to my father first i cant just you know shop him youre shopping rankin its the same thing listen if you talk to your father hell stop you somehow hell stop you hell convince you you didnt see what you know you did see juanita stopped tried to hold dianes eyes but diane turned away you really did see it didnt you diane you saw gerry rankin or his son or both of them kicking this boys head you saw the blood come on i need to hear you say it yes diane stared hard at the counter yes but oh god i knew it why was he found miles away the rankins didnt take him to stoke st michael they took me back to bowermead they left headlice in don moulders field juanita shrugged so the pilgrims found him got scared scared those bastards andandlisten to me dianeand they loaded him into his bus and somebody drove it off and dumped it in that wood then they got the hell out of somerset it makes perfect sense to me these people will avoid the police even if theyve done nothing wrong she had to change the subject then because a couple of customers came in elderly teacherish types the kind who browsed forever actually lowering her voice i cant help thinking i may have upset jim he was obviously leading up to saying what i didnt want him to say when griff daniel came into the bar and we all ran out into the street i didnt see jim after that hes a nice man diane said yes juanita carelessly dusted the counter and only a few years older than harrison ford this morning shed contemplated what looked like a very sad and drooping face in the bedroom mirror and hadnt fallen into the usual routine of giving herself a what thehell consolatory grin before turning away several of jims paintings hung in the flat one showed a flank of the tor below which the sun had set the afterglow concentrated into a thin vibrating red line like a bright string pulled taut it was clear that within a few seconds the line would have gone and the earth was straining to hold and feel the moment feel the moment jim had risen to feel the moment and shed been horribly relieved when a force of nature called griff daniel had knocked him down but that wouldnt have been obvious from her face would it verity put down her tea cloth and stepped into the middle of the kitchen putting her hands together and closing her eyes as if about to pray then very slowly she opened them like the arms of tower bridge keeping her wrists joined together and raising her arms bringing the cupped hands to facelevel like a priest presenting the chalice for high mass was how dr grainger had put it she opened her eyes and stared into the space between her hands the light from the high window unfurled around her like a flag she felt like a any joan of arc the quilted bodywarmer serving as a breastplate do this every hour dr grainger had instructed and then when night falls and the window turns black and this is the important part you continue to do it there was another exercise which had to be done upstairs it involved hugging an upright perhaps the newel post at the top of the stairs and at the same time feeling the walls closing around her feeling the house hugging her she would assiduously practise both these exercises for a week as instructed she would embrace the dark she remembered the dramatic effects of the communal exercises led by dr grainger at the assembly rooms it was not wrong she would feel colonel pixhill beside her and poor major shepherd abbot whiting she was less sure about now since the dinner that guy has a problem dr grainger had said when oliver pixhill had gone he has a problem with his father i dont buy what he was saying about the darkness in this house being down to the colonels essence house this old it shrugs people off his problem is personal i doubt it need concern you oh but it must dr grainger you see hes a trustee now he has influence the old guard the people who knew the colonel theyve all gone all gone now major shepherd was the last he can fire you this pixhill its not quite as simple as that if i refuse to leave which i shall most certainly but oh i dont know what im going to do i dont know what im supposed to do except stay here and wait theres no one to advise me poor major shepherd shed put a drop of dr bachs rescue remedy on her tongue dr grainger nodding approval this major he was the colonels righthand man they served together in the war dr grainger its not true what oliver said about the colonel he was a good kind man he wouldnt have harmed anyone he loved people he loved glastonbury sure im sure youre right im probably speaking out of turn but perhaps oliver expected the house to be left to him until the trust was set up oh dear i dont even know how or when he became a trustee his name was just there these trusts sometimes they like to have a relative usually to see that the wishes of the founder are adhered to he was just a boy verity said what could he know of the colonels wishes dr grainger had nodded sagely as verity put the kettle on the aga for camomile tea you see only two days ago major shepherd said that someone would help me he said things were coming to a head but if i could hold on thats what he said if you could hold on someone would come along who could help you verity bit her lip dr grainger smiled brushing a cobweb from the sleeve of his black jacket it was the kind of jacket that vicars used to wear maybe someone did verity did come along to help you you mean i told you i can make it easier for you here you just have to trust me thinking of colonel pixhill and his desire to experience the holy grail verity opened her hands keeping them joined at the wrist as if to receive a chalice thirteen a spiritual hothouse harveycalder uk had a new building near canary wharf with its empire state obelisk some london new age group claimed this was the crossing point of major metropolitan leys a significant power centre ben corby was probably in the process of publishing a book on it powys stared at the tower hed only seen it in pictures before he couldnt believe hed done this leaving arnold with mrs whitney hed driven into hereford and jumped on the intercity before he could change his mind he didnt even know if there was a train but he walked into the station five minutes before it got in he was getting this feeling of being on a conveyor belt everything going as smoothly as if it was preprogrammed as if it was fate hed thought of ringing fay at the bbc in the sure knowledge that if she had an engagement tonight shed cancel it she would be there whenever he knew that hed be the same so he didnt call it wouldnt be fair and if he looked to fay as bad as hed looked to mrs whitney she probably wouldnt let him go back home which would help neither of them dan fraynes office was on the third floor it was all openplan like the stock exchange computer terminals everywhere this maybe told you something you needed to know about publishing in the nineties joe powys dan frayne said hey amazing jesus man you look allin heavy journey bobby coffee coffee ok for you he was probably in his late forties he had cropped grey hair and an earring with a small green stone in it his shapeless clothes emphasised how thin he was and made joe powys in clean jeans and a new sweater feel overdressed he stared at powys for a long time over his glasstopped no you dont look like him not at all of course im only going off the pictures pictures oh him ah well powys said i never claimed to be related dan frayne leaned forward put on a mysterious whisper why then doesnt he like you cashing in on his name or what whys he doing this to you they switched to a nearby wine bar where everybody seemed to know dan frayne im not trying to impress you he said i need this i need to be surrounded by dozens of people who know me superficially superficially thats important joe powys liked people who were full of nervous energy they couldnt hide what was on their minds came out with it rarely lied i used to have this shop in glastonbury brrr frayne shuddered bad news joe i mean for me too much closedin heavy stuff he spread his arms i like to be surrounded by lightweights i am not a heavy person powys looked around everybody else in the glass and leather bar looked to him to be pretty intense no no said frayne this is really superficial money is superficial i love saying that people think im crazy like get outa here you old hippy what do you know about the real world powys smiled well its true im an old hippy but this is the point id rather be an old hippy among the suits id rather publish straight books than be down in the basement with ben corby peddling esoterica ben he copes with it because hes not a hippy and he really does value money and possessions this make sense to you possibly now youre being cautious youre like i was when i came out of glastonbury you make it sound powys said like coming out of pentonville dan frayne became quite sober i never go back to glastonbury i cant function there i cant stand to be an old hippy among old hippies in glastonbury you dont know anybody superficially you know them intensely deeply intimately you know their star signs and the colour of their auras amazing they dont have superficial in glastonbury they either put their arms around you and hug you till you squeak or they ignore you listen this book of yours ive been reading it i see bens point idve binned it too golden land was ok this one idve binned well thanks powys said except dan held up both hands i noticed something i noticed that in neither of those books do you ever refer to the celestial city not the merest mention in the index the only earthmysteries tomes in the history of the cosmos that dont go banging on about the legends of glastonbury no mystery about that ive just never been dan frayne pretended to pass out with shock put it this way if your name was constable and you were a bit of a painter would you buy a bungalow near flatford mill ben corby would said dan frayne ben corby would buy the mill this is true dan said but anyway itd been done to death everybody discussing earthmysteries has to do glastonbury id got nothing new to contribute when did that ever put a writer off anyway powys said now you know you can bin the book with a clear conscience gloom descended you spend a long time isolated in the country its not easy psyching yourself up to come to london with what looks like a begging bowl ill tell you something dan frayne said mythscapes i wouldve dumped the book but i still like the idea because its an antidote to the new age that isnt written by either a sceptic or a bornagain christian its that bit different i just think it would be a better book a more interesting book a book with wider commercial appeal if it was also about uh dont say it powys felt a certain big book winging through the air over fields and hills through towns and industrial estates on the great leyline leading to glastonbury dan said as it really is today the pressures it imposes on people living in jerusalem builded here the tensions between the christians and the new age pagans reflecting a friction thats been there in glastonbury for centuries millenniaaeons i dont know silence or the nearest you could get to silence in a wine bar in wapping well powys stood up its been nice meeting you aw come on powys siddown hear me out man dan signalled to a waitress dressed like powyss idea of a top drawer callgirl same again estelle the thing is he put his briefcase on the table between them can i talk to you do you mind personal stuff what happened to superficial i just want to tell you why explain the background to this hey you look pretty rough did i tell you that i drop a lot of valium powys said go on ok dan said i didnt know much about glastonbury except everybody said it was camelot and jerusalem rolled into one and you could get high there without drugs so twentyodd years ago i went out west with my lady if im honest glastonbury wasnt the major pull it was her gorgeous is not the word but im only a publisher never been good with words he took a large brown envelope from the briefcase slid out a photograph and handed it to powys it was from the days when coloured photos tended to come out all blue and mauve it showed a girl in a long white dress standing in a shop doorway over the door was a sign hand painted in vaguely psychedelic celtic lettering carey and frayne it said powys said what about lustrous he peered at the picture again mesmerising iridescent halfspanish dan said well mexican i suppose her father was a british doctor working out in middle america after the war met this latin beauty and brought her back to blighty result an english rose with a hint of something more exotic she was a few years younger than me i was as you can imagine a manoftheworld figure with a set of grateful dead albums and a regular supply of youknowwhat golden days joe i was too young thats what they all say thank you estelle thats super keep the change buy yourself some woolly socks dan frayne watched estelles bottom all the way to the bar and explained how his lady had had a small legacy from granny and hed sold his triumph vitesse and theyd run away to the isle of avalon where theyd rented a little shop to specialise in secondhand books and underground magazines and privately published hippy stuff about ufos and leylines you think youve arrived in the elysian fields you think youll be there forever then it starts to get to you its like a spiritual hothouse what you think of as your spirit grows like rhubarb in shit amazing dan swallowed some golden beer suddenly youve got more bloody spirit than you can cope with and you cant breathe for it im on paradise island with the most beautiful girl in the world and we wed fight all the time over nothing over anything youre pulled to extremes no half measures no compromises everythings a big issue in avalon everybody you know is a healer and a seeker after wisdom there are days in august when the airs like incense i couldnt stand it to cut a long long long story short i pissed off his mood had changed broke me up leaving her but i wouldnt go back i didnt trust myself you know because you might have stayed powys said tried again dan frayne nodded rigorously idve stayed and after a few months it wouldve been exactly the same ive never been back she stayed shes stubborn and all credit to her the shops grown and its a good business now weve kept in touch not so much now im married three kids you see the problem powys glanced at the photograph of the girl in the doorway dan said the only way id have gone back to avalon was with the family as insulation and how would she have felt then dont get me wrong she wasnt always alone you know this and that over the years dan began to unpack the brown envelope it was full of letters some handwritten some printed when you look like her theres no shortage of suitors but it was clear you can read this stuff that shed built a wall around herself maybe thats how you do it survive you know mentally and this is the woman you wanted to do the book the definitive glastonbury expose dan frayne finished his beer im worried about her he said i get a feeling i nothing like that im about as psychic as a microwave oven im just worried maybe a little latent guilt im sorry this isnt what you expected to hear you want to commission a book because youre worried about a woman you left in glastonbury urn dan frayne considered yeah he put his glass down yeah i suppose thats the size of it amazing fourteen something hanging from it it was a gothicshaped doorway six steps up at the end of an alley framed by high street shops over the door a sign said assembly rooms the alternative town hall in fact on occasion juanita could be induced to admit a certain affection for the place diane said ill let you know what happens then with her usual fashion flair she was wearing an old and patched red woollen coat over a baggy turquoise sweatshirt and jeans er slight misunderstanding juanita smiled innocently diane had got away with enough today because of jim not showing up they hadnt made it to the police station i kind of thought you might go to the other one would you mind glastonbury first but i thought diane was looking at juanitas outfit which comprised a plain charcoalgrey formal jacket with a skirt a creamy silk top and a pink chiffon scarf not very assembly rooms would that be a terrible imposition diane i thought you might recognise a few of the people i wouldnt diane looked resigned do you want me to take notes i dont think so lets not make your avalonian role too obvious at this stage try and blend into the background some chance of that juanita thought watching diane drift down the street as inconspicuous as a pheasant in a chicken run but at least she wouldnt be in the same meeting as the predatory ceridwen the church type wooden doors of the assembly rooms had been thrown back to reveal yellow walls more steps inside and a standup poster reading resist roadrape woolly wandered up to stand with juanita at the entrance to the alleyway watching the punters going in shaking his head in disappointment two real locals maybe three and the rest we know juanita said it was a shame woolly had also tried to give the meeting an element of conventional respectability he was wearing a suit had his hair pulled tightly back and bound with a fresh rubber band looked almost like a regular person that bastard griff daniel you reckon he had advance warning about the road well the word is some posters went out yesterday but they only went up this morning archer bastard woolly shook his head still he couldnt have been exacting a vast crowd apart from the easing of traffic congestion and rushhour holdups most people would be thinking about all the extra jobs the road would bring how it would open up central somerset to euromoney trouble is the governments got the bloody moral high ground woolly said take the juggernauts off the village roads make the towns safer for the kids you got the mums and dads on your side before you start but its all bullshit you put this bloody road in and traffic expands to fill it as traffic invariably does and the lorries start hitting the village lanes again and kiddies still get mown down and then you need another new road and so it goes until the whole of the west is a sea of metal thats what i love about you old hippies juanita said you never lose that dewyeyed optimism unless we stop it now woolly pulled juanita into the shadowy doorway of a pictureframing shop i got this leaflet through the post the other day offering the support of the ecoguerrillas god said juanita im not sure i like the sound of that they got a point public inquiries and stuff tis no more than a charade but if contractors find their diggers getting vandalised the bosses fancy cars getting scratched oh woolly thats not you yeah i know i hate that stuff man of peace but what dyou do juanita well you dont do anything undemocratic youre a councillor sure said woolly but when you get on the council you find out pretty soon how helpless local authorities are thing is with this bunch in there and no local locals youre gonner get demands for the extreme option anyway not counting the ones wholl recommend curses and laying out the runes and stuff ceridwens there then juanita said woolly grinned least you done me proud juanita you look sheesh well thank you woolly i decided to pass up on the pearls anyway woolly straightened his tie it was actually a kipper tie circa featuring andy warhols marilyn monroe i better get in there strut my stuff just dont go over the top therell almost certainly be press there yeah said woolly dismally theyre the ones not smoking joints sheesh i cant even see jim battle hell be coming surely yes juanita said tightly im sure he will she glanced over her shoulder and went into the meeting he poured another scotch pulled three bristle brushes from the sink putting aside the linseed oil time for neat turps got to work fast get this down while the energys there the three paintings on their easels were all part of the same picture he could see it now the afterglow usually close to the centre of the canvas should in fact be on the perimeter a before glow the paint burning through from the edges to the heart of the experience the core of the pyramid where lay the grail why had he never seen this before to reach the inner light you had to pass through darkness every experience no matter how negative was a force for progress even the worst humiliation the sickle over your head rejection by the woman youd yearned for all part of a rite of passage through the deepest darkness to the core of it all he was feeling so much better now he was painting hed been hoping for a good dusk to fire him but the rain had kept on only when a bough of the ash tree tapped on his window awakening him and he saw something hanging from that bough yes yes did he realise he could ignite his own inside hed poured more whisky finishing off the johnnie walker starring on the chivas regal hed been saving for christmas arousing a glow in his gut and feeling it spread and outside hed pulled out the dog grate and lit a fire on the stone hearth building a pyramid of oak logs watching the sparks shoot out until the logs began to turn red and then hed wedged more logs around them making a hard hot tunnel by the time it got dark the whole room was glowing with a roaring red energy never lifting his gaze from the canvas jim battle rummaged like a blind man among the tumble of tubes on his worktable to find a fat full one he rarely used it would be labelled lamp black the association calling itself glastonbury first was clearly not a sham after all for a start you had to be seriously confident to hold your inaugural public meeting at the town hall the building was next to the abbey gatehouse and a little taller nineteenthcentury officialdom overseeing ancient sanctity the town hall was lit up the gatehouse an archaic silhouette the worrying part was that the main hall was nearly full must be close to four hundred people diane sat at the back near the doors as a soberlooking band filed onto the stage among them griff daniel discreetly followed by her brother archer and a wave of spirited applause from the floor she hadnt seen archer in months hed put on a little weight the chestexpanding shoulderwidening kind she supposed heavyweight boxers like to acquire before a fight archers hair was coiled and springy he looked well would archer chair the meeting couldnt surely be griff daniel he didnt have a terrific reputation for integrity it was neither or them a bulky figure in a pinstriped doublebreasted suit stood up at the table perusing his notes through halfglasses oh gosh mr cotton quentin cotton mbe noted charitable fundraiser and the ffitch family solicitor credibility mega credibility mr cotton coughed for silence after thanking everyone for coming he said it saddens me that such a gathering as this should even be necessary one might reasonably have thought that everyone in this town would put glastonbury first but this regrettably is not the case oh well obvious what was coming an increasing number of persons in our midst although i doubt that any at all is here tonight appear to give higher priority to bizarre beliefs of a quasireligious nature which for various tarfetched reasons they appear to consider appropriate to our pleasant old country town a town which let me say at the outset has no use for this nonsense an awful cheer arose mr cotton smiled grimly and nodded where once we attracted the more discerning visitor we now draw on one level the lunatic fringe and on another what i can only describe as the dregs of the innercities those who exist on state benefits and prefer to steal from our shops rather than expend any of their hard claimed money which they prefer to go on drink and drugs clapping general noises of affirmation and a dusting of bitter laughter but youre not here to listen to my opinions you want facts and behind me is a distinguished panel of experts ready and waiting to supply them first may i introduce a local businessman well known to most of you mr stanlow pike of pike and comer estate agents and valuers who will outline for you precisely how the value of the very fabric of this town has declined by the fabric i mean your homes by decline well i think i am talking and mr pike will confirm this in the region of twenty per cent calamitous mr pike an anxiously overweight man in his fifties mr pike began by saying that his business had been established in this town for three generations i can see among you many of my clients past and and present among the er present clients are stanlow pike was pressing the tips of his fingers into the table his body leaning back then forward like a large bird on a perch are several who have had properties for sale for more than a year and been unable to find a satisfactory purchaser this is to an extent a national problem as you all must be aware and a problem shared by every other agent in this town however it is worse here worse than somerton worse than street worse than castle cary because this most beautiful and historic town is no longer no longer considered such a desirable place to live and and we all know why one after another they arose the chemist who had suffered two drugrelated burglaries the local official of the national farmers union whose members had been obliged to blockade their land against the thieving trespassing travellers griff daniels own speech was brief and at first restrained he was a local man he remembered a time when these mystical types were just a handful of harmless cranks when they wore suits and ties like everyone else when they did nothing more threatening than picnic on the tor which brought him to the point of this gathering its a pretty place the tor on a summers morn griff said lyrically but after dark he thumped the table once with his fist after dark tis a threat and a menace to us all griffs face broke into a grim smile but they also know the law these scum they know theyre legal now dont that make you sick disgraceful someone shouted indeed but thats a public place and if there arent moren six vehicles they can do pretty much what they like there and i know that most decent people in this town do not want these layabouts and are deeply deeply frustrated that we cannot keep em out altogether now im not a lawyer and not a politician except in the most amateur way look diane was pretty glad at this moment that juanita was not here so i took my problem to a man whose roots in this area go back farther than mine and probably farther than anybody elses in this room tonight now hes a new boy in the political game oh really diane exclaimed crossly a woman in a hat turned and gave her a hard look but hes got his head screwed on and he knows how people in this town think and feel ladies and gentlemen we are pleased and honoured to have with us tonight the hon archer ffitch mpelect for mendip south in the midst of the applause a lone voice was raised just a bloody minute five rows in front of diane a man had shot to his feet i object if youre gonner do your arselicking in public dad at least get it right oh gosh sam daniel griffs eyes bulged like a frogs he strode angrily towards the edge of the platform as though ready to jump down and attack his son archer arose easily and put a large firm hand on griffs shoulder thank you mr daniel and thank you also to the gentleman who pointed out that understandable error i am of course not quite mpelect the term at this stage is prospective parliamentary candidate although perhaps i who can tell strange things happen in glastonbury perhaps exposure to the atmosphere at the bottom end of high street has bestowed upon mr daniel the gift of prophecy this caused an immediate eruption of mirth diane raised her eyes to the plaster mouldings sam daniel sat down the young woman next to him looked furious diane recognised her at once charlotte lovidge darkhaired undeniably chic a trifle haughty diane saw sam try to take charlottes hand whereupon she turned pointedly away from him they were an item gosh charlotte who couldnt be more than twentyfour worked for stanlow pike possibly training to become a valuer and auctioneer it seemed an unlikely liaison for sam diane supposed it came down very much to basics charlotte was extremely attractive diane huddled into her coat feeling fat and frumpish as her brother archer began to speak against the greystone walls of the assembly rooms they looked a fairly joyless bunch tonight juanita thought theyd shelved the quest for the grail for the present they were here to plan a crusade to protect their holy land from the infidels my information woolly was saying from the makeshift black box stage is that theyll be making a start pretty soon after christmas there was a rumble from the more committedly alternative types sitting crosslegged on the carpet below the stage theyve learned a few lessons from other roadprotests use the badweather months dont make it easy dont let the protest turn into a holiday camp with openair music stuff like that dont attract tourists anyway theyll start by clearing woodland chainsaw gangs savages a woman yelled roadconstruction seemed to have taken over from nuclear power as the number one ecomenace do we know where another woman asked a strong voice juanita noted a voice with a sort of cello effect dame wanda just what the campaign needed ha woolly shrugged you tell me thats what we got to organise intelligence people on the ground wholl report anything suspicious but this is a preliminary meeting and theres things we cant very well discuss in a public place so i suggest we form a roadrape action committee for which we need an office got to get it together under one roof somewhere we could have manned round the clock staffed it was jenna the wirethin cauldron member staffed around the clock staffed said woolly wearily jenna sat down amid a cluster of women in the centre of the room to her left juanita saw the freefloating blonde hair of domini dorrelladams to her right the grey coils of ceridwen ceridwen whispered something lo jenna who was back on her feet at once i propose wanda carlisle as a kind of president or something because because shes a famous person and will attract publicity to the cause and because you can control her juanita thought all right woolly said without enthusiasm doubtless realising he wasnt going to be running the campaign much longer you all wanner take a vote on that one and when the hands rose juanita rose too and left it was all so predictable anyway she wanted to ring jim again maybe go up there and drag him out to the pub she wasnt prepared to lose a friend funny all those evenings outside on the hill the stage all set the sun primed like the canvas all those evenings summer and winter vest and overcoat never realising that on the other side of the dusk was an intensity of energy hed never dared dream of and when he was at last closing in on the mystical vanishing point when hed finally found so to speak the burial plot of the grail it was happening inside his cottage on a grey and sodden evening in nohope november jim had come through he lurched from canvas to canvas pushing the paint before him as the bronze heat gasped from the fireplace turning his studio into an alchemists laboratory a cave a cave within the tor itself he felt like a god the god of the cave the old god gwyn ap nudd celtic lord of the dead in his chamber at the heart of the tor the thought of the other gwyn ap nudd the pagan goatpriest no longer made jim shrivel inside what the priest had taken from him he had summoned back hed seen it in the ash tree it was a sign he was in control again well into the bottle of chivas regal now he thought about juanita with her heavy dark hair her big spanish mouth her breasts like brown freckled eggs he lunged with his brush and was only half aware of it tearing the canvas he thought he saw faces in the sunset window but he didnt care he was close to breaking through to the grail the ash tree stroked the wall something hanging from it fifteen a beautiful dusk the rain was easing as juanita walked quickly along high street shed made up her mind she would ring jim once more and then take a drive up there she caught sight of her reflection in the darkened window of the veggiebar from a distance of five feet in an almost sophisticated ensemble under an umbrella backlit by the golden streetlamp she could almost be a refined version of the sylph with the headdress on the front of that longago avalonian maybe she ought to change before going to jims the door of the former holy thorn ceramics its sign had gone opened suddenly making her heart race some primitive part of her quite ready to see the goddess standing there in all her dark glory but it was only tony dorrelladams and a suitcase tony he scowled at first then saw her the way she was dressed oh hi juanita you look normal thanks you know what i mean she could almost feel the accumulated sorrow and the bafflement vibrating around him yes i do im sorry tony i really am i bet you are his car was parked by the kerb an old cavalier hatchback he put his suitcase on the wet pavement released the rear door look juanita said im not part of this you know youre a woman that makes you part of it why dont you come over to the shop have a cup of tea talk about it you cant leave like this cant just give up watch me tony said ive been given the car wasnt that kind i get custody of the car so ive got the means to remove myself it would be appreciated if i do this quietly while everybody including my wife is in the protest meeting tony threw the suitcase into the boot and slammed the door lamplit drops ricocheting into the night like angry sparks this stinks tony oh no this is glastonbury its too holy to stink tony wiped rain out of his eyes probably rain where will you go back to teaching i expect ill find something naturally ill fight the cow for everything i can get she wants to keep this place open shell have to get some money from her precious sisters of the fucking cauldron not that anybodys going to want to buy pot goddesses with big im sorry im sorry ok maybe you werent involved in which case id watch my back if i were you they cant touch me no he looked her in the eyes half pitying they can touch anybody destroy anything christ i used to think we were ultimately inseparable domini and me meeting of minds spiritually attuned good sex bit of a blip stupid fling that meant nothing but this was going to be where we got it all together again that chap who works in your shop jim jim yeah he said last night that this was the last place you should come to repair your marriage wise man there should be barbed wire around this town come and have a drink no ive got to get out of here he wiped his eyes again it certainly wasnt rain this time i dont claim to understand any of this i wont be able to explain it to anyone i wish i could but i cant just hang on a minute ok one minute juanita gave him the umbrella to hold and ran across the road to the bookshop she was back inside the minute to find tony standing at the kerb arms by his side the umbrella pointing at the pavement soaked through and he didnt seem even to have noticed it was raining she shoved the book into his cold damp hands whats this you said you wished you understood it might help he peered at the book i cant see its colonel pixhills diary oh that he didnt seem impressed domini had one threw it away people do juanita said some people do he can make you feel very depressed until something like this happens and then maybe hes the guru youve been searching for im not even supposed to sell it to people unless they specifically ask so im giving it to you read it when you get to wherever youre going harlow essex harlow new town my parents live there no legends no history to speak of a real sanctuary thanks thanks for the book tony raised a hand unsmiling climbed into his cavalier and started the engine but it was a while before he could pull out into the road and a while before juanita could cross it because of the sudden traffic from a distance it looked like a motorbike when she saw what it was juanita went weak a bus with only one headlight and an engine like a deathrattle then a converted ambulance with national elf service across its windscreen and then a humpback delivery van the kind the post office used to have only with a window punched in the side and then an old hearse and more of the same gasping and limping through the endless rain a mobile scrapyard oh no juanita shrank into the holy thorn doorway both hands around the umbrella stem holding the thing in front of her like a riotshield as they rumbled past and clattered past and groaned past under the diffident cranenecked gaze of the seenitall glastonbury streetlamps the convoy from hell the umbrella shook rigidly in juanitas hands a sick ritual on the tor followed by a death and they had the nerve the arrogance to come back maybe theyd returned for the meeting that was all poor old woolly needed but no she watched them proceed like a ramshackle funeral cortege along high street for chilkwell street for wellhouse lane and the tor the house lights dipped dramatically and archer ffitch became a powerful silhouette against a pure white rectangle he was suddenly so much like their father because all you could see was his shape thicker but no hint of fat because you couldnt see their mothers moist lips and their mothers grey eyes because like father he seemed at his most relaxed standing up or erect on a hunter and he was awfully relaxed at the moment i want to show you some pictures he said i want to show you a possible solution but i want first of all to make it clear that i am acting here not as a politician but as a concerned resident of this area what i am about to outline is a preliminary proposal to be tossed around the democratic arena adjusted refined and perhaps at the end of the day who can tell rejected i hope this will not be the case because i believe it is the only way to correct an unhealthy imbalance in this fine old town the hall was hushed i believe said archer that the only solution to the problem must lie in restricting the activities of hippies travellers and undesirables without in any way diminishing the rights of local people archer lifted a hand and a picture appeared on the screen behind him the top of glastonbury tor the st michael tower ruling the screen from top to bottom the tor said archer is the property of the national trust a body responsible for making our nations heritage accessible to the general public and none of us would wish that to be otherwise the next picture was an aerial photograph looking down on the st michael tower and the discoloured grass around it i have been unable to establish said archer precisely how many tons of earth have been replaced here in recent years because of erosion caused by human feet or how many sheep have been killed by uncontrolled dogs i would hate to estimate how many tons of human excreta have remained unburied by people flouting the fairly unenforceable laws about camping out on the tor and there are no records of how many innocent people and children have been disturbed or disgusted by the most shameless and perverse sexual shenanigans taking place in full public view is this i ask you now what we expect of a national trust site the response was immediate and deafening diane didnt reply she was struggling with a terrible sensation of foreboding oh archer would be canonised all right archer was very good at sincerity the slide changed to a less dramatic picture a closeup of an ordnance survey map intersected by hand drawn black lines archer tapped the map on the screen with a pen let us first of all ask ourselves why these members of what they like to describe as an alternative society flock like lemmings to this tiny hill it is because of an unfortunate legacy archer paused a memory came to diane of a christmas when she was seven or eight a boxing day afternoon spent hiding in her bedroom trying to read her book and blank out the sound of the hunting horn shed fallen asleep in her mothers old rocking chair and awoken to find a legacy of nonsense from that most unstable of decades the nineteensixties when a socalled culture founded upon psychedelic drugs and led i imagine by bearded gurus from tibet decided that the tor was a place of power where many socalled leylines intersect the fact that no archaeologist or anyone with even basic common sense gives any credence whatever to this famous rubbish he would know of course that the person in glastonbury most obsessed with leys was councillor woolly woolaston whose reputation would be seriously eroded tonight diane briefly closed her eyes and remembered half waking in her mothers chair that boxing day and stroking fur shed wanted a dog as a pet her father had refused he said dogs were for working and hunting dogs were for outside archer was laughing gullible and rootless people who believe that they can get high on glastonbury tor with or without the use of mindaltering drugs is this what that august body the national trust exists to promote this was just awful now the tor archer said is as my friend mr daniel pointed out a few minutes ago a pretty place on a summers day a place where doubtless some of you would like to take your children or visiting relatives were you not afraid of what they might see or tread in griff daniel commented from a few yards along the stage quite im also quite sure that none of you would wish to go there at night or on some pagan solstice or for the purpose of altering your perceptions so let me outline to you a comprehensive plan as a new slide appeared on the screed diane remembered sleepily stroking the fur in her lap wondering vaguely why her skirt was wet and her hand sticky oh dear perhaps the puppy had but it hadnt been a puppy at all it was a fox or rather its head a trophy from the boxing day hunt one of its eyes was missing its jaws had been prised open its needly teeth gleamed with blood blood from its neck had soaked through dianes christmas kilt the old image brought tears of horror and pity to dianes eyes she blinked them away tried to focus on the screen the picture on the screen was not of glastonbury but it was instantly familiar diane remembered archer denying having anything to do with the foxs head denying it with such appalled vigour and absolute sincerity that by the end of the afternoon father was almost accusing diane of having planted it to get her brother in trouble blooded at last eh archer had whispered in her ear as they left the room on the screen storm clouds glowered over the grey sentinels of the worlds most famous prehistoric monument stonehenge no she clapped a hand over her mouth he couldnt he couldnt be suggesting but archer didnt do anything he wasnt fairly sure of archer hated the thought of ever looking silly which always the picture of sober sincerity he never did diane stood up slowly her back to the rear wall she fell as cold as marble realising shed always hated him it just never seemed right to loathe your only brother archer explained his proposal simply and concisely connecting with the fears and prejudices of his audience diane felt an undercurrent of excitement in the hall as if each person was linked to the people on either side to the front and the rear by a thin copper wire with the ceiling lights out and stonehenge still on the screen she looked down and thought she saw a softly glowing net a grid of pulsating energy she felt an utter despair and something else that squirmed inside her wanting to get out so you see archer was saying there is a very clear and obvious precedent for these restrictions all i need to know at this stage is do you the people of glastonbury want it to happen too bloody true a man shouted out soon as possible and there were other cries of affirmation and support a mindless response the most alarming sound diane could ever remember having heard she couldnt see archers eyes across the darkened hall but she knew they were focused on her as their gazes locked triumph with dismay an odd smell came to her salty earthy and fleshy not the freshblood violentdeath smell of the poor fox more like the inside of an old fashioned butchers shop there was a horrible warmth to it and a sour kind of voracious life it pulled at her stomach she felt disgusted and somehow strengthened on her other side in the dark canal of the aisle she knew that a shadowform crouched could feel it rising with her own bruising fury she moved into the aisle at once something swirled around her denimed legs there was a roaring in her head the stage seemed miles away the screen a distant window archer diane called out in a voice so loud and precise that it scared her silence made a hollow in the hall diane felt as if she was standing in mercury oh my god what am i doing her jaw fell she felt limp and soaked with sweat i heads turned people recognising her at once i no she could feel a cool but urgent pressure a hand on her wrist resist it said resist nanny people began to laugh as diane turned stumbled and ran sobbing from the hall juanita called jim for the eighth time that day on the cordless from the upstairs sitting room come on come on answer the damned phone you stupid proud opinionated old bastard the phone still ringing out she went through into her bedroom put on the lights flung herself on the bed kicked off her shoes she was still wearing her grey jacket all dressed up for woollys meeting she started to laugh halfway to tears no answer he might be in bed he might be lost in his painting he might simply be drunk but with the travellers camped in wellhouse lane there was no way she was going up there to find out juanita lay back suddenly fatigued and gazed moodily at the picture on the wall opposite the table lamps either side of the double bed were perfectly placed to bring out the subtleties of jims twilight masterpiece the tight red thread over the somerset levels she lay on the bed half closing her eyes so that there was nothing but that rosy slit and she thought sorry jim sorry sorry sorry sorry he rumbled himself into his old khaki shirt covering his bare chest stood there feeling very confused and not too well his throat was burning the thick air was full of flitting shadows so was his head and it ached dully where had he been his palette lay on the edge of the worktable he saw that all the colours on it were dark there was a smell of turps more than a smell he could taste it he could taste the buggering turps the bottle of white spirit was on the floor at his feet upright but empty jim tell to his knees beside the bottle he gagged wiped the back of a hand across his lips smelled it clutched at his throat hed finished the whisky and drunk the buggering turps he tried to spit his throat was too dry he had a sickening image of his tongue like a flattened toad on the floor of his mouth he covered his face with his paintsmeared hands and sank to his knees sending the empty turps bottle skittering away what had he done as he tried to pick himself up longsuppressed images of his old life burst like blisters in the spouting pus of memories he saw the wife hed deserted bloody pat poor bloody pat all she wanted was for him to be ordinary pursue his pension relegate his art to evening classes jims hobby how hed hated that word nobody in glastonbury had a paltry hobby coming to glastonbury was a buggering quest for a grail jim staggered to his feet selfdisgust and revulsion fluttering frantically in his stomach as if hed swallowed a small bird his insides felt raw abraded as if the wings of the bird were tipped with razor blades he looked round for something to touch either to prove he wasnt asleep or to wake him up all he saw were the three metal easels in a tor shape with a feeling of explicit foreboding jim advanced on the conical formation the three canvases which should be aglow with the holy fire of dusk all three were black hed painted every square buggering inch black jim began to weep went to the fire for warmth where he found all the logs reduced to black smouldering husks then where was the light coming from how could he even see the black paintings in a last vague hope that this was all a sour whisky dream he stumbled to the sunset window and saw the rearing ash tree something hanging from a branch two yellow moons the source of the bleak light in the room he saw it couldnt be it just couldnt be that the yellow moons were the weak and vapid headlights of an old black bus parked where no bus could possibly park in his small square garden surrounded on four sides by a hornbeam hedge jim cowered hands over his face hed gone mad black black black black sound of the rain slapping at the windows he turned his back on the window peered in dread through his fingers at a room which was cold and drab and full of failure reeking of regret he began to moan aloud hed broken through the darkness expecting images of such intensity that they would fuel his paintings forever make them burn with rembrandts inner light and vibrate with the wild energy swirling in van goghs cypresses so that juanita his beautiful juanita would be drawn into the vortex hed thought she was already there with him thought hed seen her face in the sunset window but there was nothing after all on the other side of the darkness but a darker darkness and hed done something very bad killed it hed killed a beautiful dusk jim began to scrabble in the hearth among the ash and cinders and the exhausted flaking logs grizzling on the stone had to get it back the sacred energy had to relight the dusk impulsively he snatched a handful of greasy paintrags from the worktable thrust them into the fireplace for kindling he snapped his long brushes the ones oozing black paint the black hed avoided for years like monet it was the right thing to do a sacrifice he groped for the matches on the mantelpiece struck in three at once and watched the paintrags flare and hiss until the broken brushes began to crackle logs he needed more logs apple logs from local orchards which burned sweet and heady avalonian sunset behind his eyes he saw his lovely juanita as shed been the day hed first arrived in glastonbury his middleaged life a fresh canvas he saw her leaning in the doorway of her shop summer dress brown arms those gorgeous ironic frankly sensual brown eyes woman of avalon he was warmed for him she was always standing in the doorway of her shop but the flames were fading he needed flames to feed her image jim picked up the coffee table he used as a palette swung it round by the legs and smashed it into one of the supporting pillars smashed it again and again into the ironhard oak until the table was in fragments then fed the pieces to the fire and watched the oil and varnish flash golden he pulled out a flaming tableleg held it aloft like a sconce he was the god of the tor again was there time oh yes jim felt almost triumphant as he plunged the blazing log into the nearest canvas no blackness now he watched juanitas warm brown eyes glistening with compassion she held out her arms and he reached for her the cottage began to fill with a red fog through it he saw the generous mouth darkly sparkling eyes under the tumble of hair until with a soft smile of regret she turned away and walked back into her bookshop sorry jim sorry sorry sorry he watched the shop door slowly close sixteen the sunset window there was the sound of a key in the shop door below juanitas bedroom window she called out come on up diane was the glastonbury first meeting over already maybe it had been a total flop about four people in the audience sure and maybe a ufo had come down on wearyall hill and joseph of arimathea had strolled out with his staff and the teenage christ in tow juanita im frightfully sorry diane appeared puffyeyed and flustered in the bedroom doorway i sort of i couldnt stand to hear any more that bad huh juanita sat up and swung her legs from the bed juanita diane sank down making the mattress howl you cant imagine just how bad they couldnt do it juanita walked to the window high street looked damp detached and faintly hostile theres no way they could get that through they got away with it at stonehenge when all the hippies and travellers and people went to worship the sun at midsummer and started having festivals and things and causing chaos they got a special act of parliament to make it into a restricted area yes but and now nobody can get in at all you have to look at the stones from behind a fence or through binoculars from across the road or something but the tor isnt an ancient monument apart from the tower i mean its an ordinary hill well ok an extraordinary hill but you cant fence off a hill juanita theyve got it all worked out it begins with a complete parking ban in wellhouse lane the next step would presumably be some kind of tasteful wiremesh fence with metal gates and no access to anyone after dark thats impossible anyone wants to get in theyll do it it worked at stonehenge they say its a completely sterile place now the great temple of the sun where nobody can go in and watch the sun rise any more or feel the rays on the stone and now if archer gets his way nobodyll be able to see it set looking out from the top of the tor to brent knoll and bridgwater bay thered be security patrols at the solstices theyd have juanita blinked people supported this in there they loved it no more hippies no more pagan rituals the farmers were ever so excited there were all these muddy mendip growls of approval youre one of us zurr this sort of thing god juanita said woolly will blow a fuse i mean the tor would you know lose all its magic all its mysticism if you had to buy a ticket or something oh yes rather and archer was absolutely upfront about this the undesirables dont come to glastonbury to see the abbey ruins or the tribunal building they come for the tor and if the tors no longer accessible glastonbury will lose its magnetism and well get decent tourists and decent shops and local people will be able to walk the streets without tripping over drug addicts and if they want to go to the tor theyll be able to go at a civilised time without having to tread in faeces and vomit and oh juanita its just awful awful awful she saw that dianes eyes were full of tears stains all down her cheeks which didnt seem as plump as they used to was she losing weight its terribly personal for me you see diane said ive loved the tor all my life it wont happen diane therell be an outcry there was an outcry over the new road but thats going to happen it all depends on whos crying out she stopped fingers at her mouth sitting on the edge of juanitas bed she began to sway you ok diane oh gosh diane crying out that explains it it was the tor crying out what the visions the vinegar bottle the salt pot the washingup liquid dont you see im afraid not but juanita was awfully afraid she actually did it knew the tor knew the tor was crying out something bad was coming and the tor knew juanita suddenly juanita was rather glad she hadnt taken diane to the police station it was calling out diane whispered to those who are close to it diane listen to me juanita sat down next to her on the bed i hate what archer and griff are planning as much as anyone and ill fight it on freedom of access grounds we cant have them putting britain behind bars but if you start putting two and two together and getting sixteen juanita i know this in my heart it called me back juanita said gently colonel pixhill thought it had called him back too and he wasted the rest of his life trying to work out why and never did just went bonkers but diane wasnt even listening she wouldnt even look at juanita just gazed at the walls at jims picture anything i was thinking why me id concluded that it wasnt me at all it wanted it was nanny three violet dion fortune i thought ceridwen could perhaps explain it if you know if they could get through to her but now i know it is me no diane because archers the threat to the tor and all the magic of glastonbury avalon out dont you see it wants me because im archers sister it wants me to stop him sure fine as long as and you were right juanita with the avalonian it was meant you have a purpose too well thanks thank you very much diane there was a long fraught silence diane staring hard at the picture on the wall then she said thats the same picture isnt it the one youve had for ages diane had gone pale she looked close to fainting it was ridiculous she shouldnt go dashing about working herself into a state people carrying too much weight around there was always a danger ill make some tea juanita said no diane didnt move whys it gone dark the sunline in the picture whys it gone dark juanita ill ring him again trying to sound calm but her toothin nervous fingers prodding at the wrong numbers she held the phone up to the light began again and the phone rang and rang and the old bastard didnt answer juanita pulled feverishly at her cigarette there was a time when she didnt actually need to smoke didnt need the wine never overreacted the breeze tossed some rain at the window like a handful of pebbles ok how did you mean her voice limp how did you mean it had darkened diane swallowed that red fine like a redhot wire it had gone black it was a black line it was like a thin cut bleeding black all over the painting why cant i see it i cant see it now these things dont last juanita started to shake her head wrapped her arms around herself began to pace the room staring down and rocking diane youd ok listen youd come in off the street into a darkened shop darkened hallway and then you burst into a lighted room juanita sometimes youve got to trust me juanita blinked look ok ill go over to jims check him out you stay here stay by the phone just in case youre not going on your own well youre not coming juanita i can be frightfully stubborn you are not going on your own if i have to get the van going and follow you juanita told her why it was impossible she told her that her friends the pilgrims were back not all of them maybe half a dozen but back theyd be spread all over the hill oh diane became very still in that case therere a few things i need to ask them about headlice juanitas calves ached varicose veins was it now your time is close woman itll happen sooner than you dread diane said ill get the van no ok well take the volvo juanita was sweating her posh grey jacket felt like rags hot sweat cold sweat menopause hag st johns church tower was watching them from above unfeeling behind its lagging of rain and night juanita pulled car keys from her shoulder bag gripped them until the jagged edges bit into her palm listen ok just listen facing diane over the bonnet of the volvo we go directly to jims we dont stop for anybody is that understood diane nodded juanita didnt trust her she pulled the old afghan coat out of the boot dragged it on the rain was relentless as they drove into chilkwell street a few cars parked a little light traffic small town rainy night halfway up wellhouse lane they came to the first vehicle the old post office van you agreed juanita snapped you agreed we dont stop i dont care who you recognise we keep going then the hearse mort diane breathed shut up dim lamplight in some of the buses and vans a few people plodded from one to another metallic music rattled the volvos windows its them its morts hearse i dont care if its storming normans bloody tank were not stopping i dont think i want to anymore diane actually seemed a little scared good juanita trod on the gas eased forward past the hearse and then collapsed on the brake what the hell as a grey cliffface arose in their path the motor coach was in the middle of the road not moving no lights the volvo stalled juanita wound down the window in rage and screamed at anybody what do you think this is the municipal dump laughter came like breaking glass stay juanita hissed at diane just dont move an inch she slammed out into the road there was a group of people or it might have been people and bushes it didnt move what if hes here with his sickle gwyn ap nudd in his animal mask juanita tasted oil and wanted to run away but she made herself speak to them excuse me we need to get past cant be done lady a calm voice unhurried youre gonna have to turn back all she could see was a tall grey figure and a cigarette end too small to fizz in the rain did whoever it was recognise her from the other night did they all recognise her mels bus broke down ok we cant fix it tonight you gotta go back theres another way wherever youre headed theres like always another way lady not to where were going i dont get this what are you guys doing back here lady we are the army for avalon public meeting yeah about the road were the public cant you just reverse it down the hill its fuckin clapped dont you listen well get it seen to when the morning comes i do like your coat a cruel female cackle my granny had one like that juanita was preparing an acid reply when she saw that diane was at her side mort are you there for christs sake what did we agree diane the roads blocked anyway one of their buses broke down mort diane cried out shrilly wheres mort shiiiit one of the female travellers drawled from the darkness we got bleedin fergie rozzie is that you its me di molly its molly fffortune she on about interbreeding it is the man said been poking their cousins for centuries all got brains the size of fuckin walnuts the mild rain between them was as dense and muffling as a velvet curtain diane

be down at that meeting got to stop this fuckin road ladies you come down with us well look after you diane come on she yours lady diane will you why did you leave diane screamed why didnt you take poor headlice to hospital why did you let him die whyd you leave him silence juanita had a horrible sense of deja vu she tensed snatched at dianes arm somebody laughed and held up a hurricane lamp that passed from face to face and there were beards and plaits and dreadlocks and facepaint and juanita didnt recognise thank god anyone sweetheart paul pendragon said we took every case of headlice to hospital the health serviced grind to a bleeding standstill diane was all fuzzy and bewildered they arent the same theyre different well they had to be no way the last lot would return after the death the possible murder of one of their tribe juanita was entirely relieved if you wanted the truth they got back into the car and she reversed about twenty yards pulled into the side of the lane half in the bushes switched off the engine and the lights i think what we do is we walk from here but we let them go past first juanita leaned across diane pulled a torch from the glove compartment as a bunch of them came down the hill with the hurricane lamp the army for avalon marching to something mournful played on a tin whistle she opened the drivers door and stood in the bushes until all she could hear was faint music and the echo of laughter she and diane moved past the vehicles six juanita counted including the bus blocking the road it was still raining but they were less than half a mile from jims a stupid exercise really when after nearly ten minutes walking a light appeared ahead of them and there was the sound of solid footsteps juanita was convinced it was jim himself and started thinking of an excuse it would have to be the headlice issue they wanted jims opinion before going to the cops tried to ring the footsteps stopped immediately in front of them like a soldier coming to attention and he turned the beam of his lamp on himself lighting up a barbour so old and worn it could have been mr barbours prototype and a face like a round of rough cheddar is it the fire of hell mrs carey or is it the wrath of god cursed it is this place the devil in a black buzz and now the fire of hell don juanita wondered if shed ever squeezed more disappointment into one syllable i think we can do without the evangelism tonight she thought you were jim battle diane said oh don moulder let his lamp arm fall to his side the beam trailing in the road mr battle aye when i heard your voices i did hope as he were comin up with you i called em already look soons i seen it went back up the house called told em to get their fingers out juanita felt herself go limp now dont you start worryin nor nothin he couldnt be in there no way my love when i seen it i thought it were them hippies an their paraffin again i mighter smelt it and went down there earlier look but for this rain and and things oh god juanita howled she pushed past don and tore blindly down the little lane which led to jims track she could smell it herself now sour and acrid i wouldnt go there don moulder shouted out corning after her mrs carey you wait for me she ran down through the trees her skirt snagged on some brambles and she ripped it free feeling the material tearing under the afghan coat don moulder stumbling behind you wont get no nearer than i could mrs carey the air grew bright around her rosy as dawn but no dawn ever smelt like this you wait for the fire brigade they dhave machines asll get down that track no trouble youll get trapped down there look juanita found the track at last ran across the turning area where shed parked the other night on to a grassy hump stumbling over a root and sinking to her knees s far enough i tell you dont be s damn stupid woman when she stood up it was like thrusting her head into an enormous blow drier she couldnt breathe her mouth filled up with fumes and she fell back into the wet grass don moulder screeching godzake woman she crawled on hands and knees around the grassy mound until she came to the little wooden gate leading into the tiny square cottage garden where jim would erect his easel on warm evenings a high hedge protecting his privacy she stood up by the remains of an old trellis where roses had once hung her eyes were already sore and streaming and she had to blink four five times before she could see the whole picture the whole terrible bloody picture jims cottage and the garden were in a little flatbottomed bowl with a bank rising up behind it and the enormous ash tree one and a half times as high as the cottage the bowl looked like a frying pan with a straight piece of track forming the handle although shed never seen it that way before but then shed never seen it all lit up like this the lower windows of jims cottage were bright and warm like the welcoming windows of a storybook cottage especially the floortoceiling studio window the sunset window looking now as if it had stored up all those thousands of liquid red sunsets and was starting one of its own the november night was as warm as a kitchen the air carried the breathless rise and fall of distant sirens diane and don moulder came to stand on either side of juanita thats far enough mrs carey brigades here now look the firesirens went on and on and got no louder hes surely out here somewhere don moulder was wiping his eyes with a rag hes not daft isnt mr battle the roof timbers of jims cottage produced a cheerful crackling as fierce little impish flames began to poke through like gasjets and still the sirens went on and on and got no louder in a gush of panic diane realised oh gosh mr moulder they cant the fire brigade wont get through the whole lanes clogged with buses and wagons we couldnt even get the car past whazzat miss travellers theres a bus broken down right in the middle of the road a buzz its blocking the road diane was aware of juanita pulling open her afghan coat and ripping at her skirt oh my god juanita said oh my god look pointing at the ash tree something hanging from it aye don moulder was saying a buzz maybe you seen it but were it a real buzz thats the big question miss diane were it a real christ are you mad woman beside diane a muffled ragged figure clothraced like a scarecrow began to run towards the inferno the sunset window cracked first like a gunshot and then it exploded a thousand fragments of hot glass blown out at juanita muffled like a muslim woman a torn off length of her skirt wound around her face as she threw herself at the cottage diane rushed forward squealing like a piglet but don moulder grabbed her both arms around her waist and held her back a huge gush of fire lunged out of the cottage and hit the ash tree with a lurid splash of sparks like a welding torch in a foundry whatever was hanging limply from a branch was lit up very briefly before the flame pounced like a cat on rat and consumed it diane screamed wildly inside don moulders arms juanita had disappeared brittle burning dead leaves from the ash tree danced like frenzied fireflies to the futile warbling of the trapped fireengines as out of the shattered sunset window toppled a frightful thing a monstrous shape a fossil tree with rigid projecting branches a twisted blackened pylon coughing and retching with don moulders leathery farmers hands clasped over her spasming stomach diane saw just about everything she saw that the tree was something entangled and kept upright by a metal artists easel or maybe two easels or even three entwined fused together into a single horrific firesculpture all black and flaking at the top of this twisted creation was spiked a charcoal ball like a halloween pumpkin which had fallen into the bonfire when the construction teetered the ball twirled to display it was impolite to be sick on someone diane found the strength to pull away vomiting into the grass she could still see it the grisly twinkle of teeth as the charred remains of jim battle toppled into juanitas flungopen arms and the cottage roof collapsed into a gush of pumping bloodorange smoke before she fainted on don moulder diane glimpsed something at the very centre of the billowing obscenely like the hands of a conjuror letting loose a black dove it was a smoking cup of shadows a dark chalice seventeen of the heart the cottage was fine just as peaceful as it had ever been arnold limped contentedly around mrs whitney brought homemade soup and all the books stayed on the shelves outside there was snow on the hilltops and a stack of logs nicely dried and split in the old barn winter was at the door season of rough walks and hot fires and whatever had been happening inside joe powys to cause that period of upset that blip it was obviously in remission so fine well except for the no fay aspect and even that was fine for fay who was a peopleperson and had been getting increasingly restless through the summer it hadnt been love joe powys kept telling himself this so much as mutual need the need for someone who had also experienced these things to be there when you awoke before dawn in terror and self doubt would fay still awake in terror in brussels or munich or amsterdam perhaps not so fine ok really anyway there was another woman now in hazy sepia a cheerful buxom lady in a hat and a long woollen skirt pushes a bicycle with a shopping basket over the handlebars colours slowly fading into the picture as she crackles through autumn leaves in a halfwooded lane to a steep and narrow path at the end of this a big shed with lace curtains at the windows the shed built into the flank of a hill of cucumber green rising almost sheerly it seems from here to a church tower of greybrown stone a church tower without a church her real name was violet firth evans when she married she was born in in north wales although her family later moved to somerset as a young woman during the years of world war i she became quite a successful psychotherapist initially attracted to the new ideas of sigmund freud which she rapidly outgrew realising there were phenomena of the mind and spirit which freud could not approach during this period she discovered she was telepathic psychic and a natural medium she also discovered glastonbury somebody gave her a redundant army hut and she put it up directly under glastonbury tor and it was here that she founded the mystical order which became the society of the inner light powys already knew a little about her during his research for the old golden land hed learned that she was the first writer to discuss the psychic aspect of leys those mysterious alignments of ancient sites across the countryside what had put him off further reading was the name under which she produced her novels and magical studies dion fortune it was developed apparently from her family motto deo non fortuna not her fault that from this end of the century it sounded like a fifties rock and roll singer anyway this was probably one of the reasons hed never got around to reading avalon of the heart all hokum well over the top dan frayne had said presenting him with the paperback to read on the train home but it left me with a kind of warm glow you know made me feel yeah this is the place dangerous stuff in retrospect powys read it twice it was just over a hundred pages long a personalised guide to glastonbury and its mysteries in a style which was kind of helen steiner rice meets enid blyton dan frayne was right it was wonderful when he came off the train he went directly to the hereford bookshop beside a famous leyline near the cathedral and ordered everything of dion fortunes still in print then went to the library to find out who she was really the book glowed it was concise vivid and haunting it was a love story about a torrid affair between a woman and a town it told you exactly why people did what dan frayne and this juanita had done going to glastonbury in search of something they couldnt define while uncle jack powys in a book more than ten times as long explained why they all failed no wonder fortune hadnt exactly taken to a glastonbury romance published just two years earlier do we behave like that at glastonbury she wrote i must have missed a lot we do not quite come up to mr powiss specifications mischievously misspelling powys joe powys decided he really liked this woman the night he got home he made a space on the shelf next to the romance and inserted avalon of the heart the antidote powys grinned and went to bed and slept the whole night through without interruption and another six but last night hed been appalled to find himself lying awake almost wishing it would happen again having awoken first of all feeling cold feeling empty missing fay and then wondering am i slightly mad this was an unnatural situation mrs whitney had said as much no life joe just you and that dog walking the hills hair going greyer circles under your eyes getting bigger and dan frayne before he left london all im asking joe is why not spend a couple of weeks in glastonbury absorb the vibes i guarantee a pivotal experience alter your life one way or the other if you agree theres a book in this ill hare the first instalment of the advance in the post inside a week im empowered to go to twenty grand half upfront cant go higher for nonfiction these are hard times powys down to his last two thousand in the bank and golden land royalties slipping fast had said can i think about this he could have had ten thousand pounds in his hand by now and hed said coolly can i think about this mad probably and cold and lonely and his hair going greyer was ten grand going to change any of that plus hed have to write the book with fraynes exgirlfriend plus what id also like from you right up in the introduction dont get up dont hit me is the uncle jack story the stuff corby told me about the glastonbury romance bit gives us a hook for the marketing department well sod that for a start be like hanging a sign around your neck that said crank and somebody with expert knowledge of the powys family tree would be sure to come out of the woodwork screaming charlatanimpostor he was all mixed up he needed to read some more dion fortune a calming influence shed gone to glastonbury another seeker after spiritual truth but she hadnt been screwed up by it like the amateurs like dan frayne read more fortune this was the answer slowly by which time it would be nearly spring and perhaps fay would have come back and they could go down to glastonbury together maybe fay could get a radio programme out of it joe powys got up and made some tea for himself and arnold who was he kidding not long after nine am the phone rang you asked for time to think im still thinking powys said this was unusual at this stage of the game publishers hardly ever chased you whats the problem dan frayne didnt sound cool any more didnt sound laid back didnt sound superficial powys tried to think of an answer a strange choked silence coming down the line listen you have to get your act together joe you read the stuff yet dan frayne didnt sound right lacked coherence heryou know letters ive been a bit busy for fucks sake joe listen the thing is i cant go down there you know that i have to be in new york next week anyway powys felt he was missing something why do either of us have to go wheres the urgency there was a ragged pause then dan told him his voice like there was a dry twig stuck in his throat i nearly missed it wouldnt have known it only made a couple of paragraphs in the national papers i mean there are lots of fatal fires all over the place they didnt have any names at that stage anyway relatives hadnt been told im really sorry dan powys knew there were a lot of questions he should be asking but this wasnt the time giving him a big brown jiffy bag containing the collected letters of juanita carey frayne had said written to me at least three times a year for twenty years if i wasnt here i think shed still write to unload the shit read and i guarantee youll see the book mapped out before your eyes powys read for nearly two hours arnold lying gloomily across his feet sleety rain coming like tintacks at the cottage window he read about the people of presentday avalon as seen by juanita carey june news just in alice flood the curates wife has left her husband for the guy who runs the wearyall wine bar the proposed astral festival has been attacked by one of those fundamentalist christian sects claiming itll attract satanic influences one of the women at the tourist office in the tribunal building has resigned because she says its being haunted by a ghost in monks robes and oh hell just another week in bloody avalon powys smiled sadly went back to the earliest letter april and discerned a different tone less cynical more wideeyed mrs carey was writing it while listening to alan stivells totally transcendent breton harp music she was organising an earth mysteries book fair in glastonbury and was a little nervous about inviting the bigger names did danny think colin wilson might be persuadable you never found out whether the book fair had been a success mrs careys next letter was about a relationship she was developing with an astrologer called matt rutherford who was a bit magnetic around the eyes the matt thing lasted on and off nearly seven years though juanita didnt write much about it powys could imagine dan frayne seething with jealousy but the general mood was changing in the eighties the thatcher subtext greed is patriotic was penetrating glastonbury shops hadnt actually been selling chunks of holyest erthe in cans but the possibility was in the air there were now people in town who were seeing the new age as new money and one of them was matt rutherford who set up an agency offering astrological services to industry star screening employees and job applicants to calculate their suitability for particular posts juanita carey had been furious to think that rutherford was getting people fired because pluto and venus happened to be badly aligned when they were born exit matt quite right too powys thought mercenary bastard he became aware that the letters were laying out for him a groundplan of postfortune glastonbury he could see high street with all the new age shops clustering at the bottom of the hill near the ancient george and pilgrims he could see the lofty tower of st johns with the war memorial outside where the hippies gathered to play and sing with guitars and whistles he had a sense of the abbey ruins amid hidden green acres enclosed by streets full of shops and strange music and on the edge of the town the tunnel lanes leading to the pagan enigma of the tor i suppose this means youll be going now then powys after whats happened i suppose so arnold powys sighed on the evidence of the carey letters the contrasts and tensions of glastonbury hadnt actually altered much in the sixtyodd years since uncle jack had fluttered the dovecotes commercial interests squeezing into bed with the spiritual a lot of seriously screwedup people and frustrated visionaries endless petty disputes and maybe a wriggling vein of kinky sex in the mideighties after matt rutherford had left town to pursue his business interests in where else los angeles juanita rarely referred to men the last letter very recent was a cool and cynical overview of new age glastonbury it also discussed the problems of a scatty female of seminoble birth called diane ffitch and the publication of the gloomy diaries of a certain colonel pixhill there was a copy enclosed it was a dismal dark green with no picture on the front dan had said he really couldnt face reading it joe powys had another look at the photo of the girl in the white dress juanita carey iridescent mesmeric if you looked closely you could make out some kind of amulet around her neck if you held the picture away from you you were even more dazzled by the wide white smile and the laughing brown eyes more than all this powys had liked her style he was deeply sad that she couldnt help him now part four mr powis sic has fluttered our local dovecotes to a painful extent do we behave like that at glastonbury i must have missed a lot i am afraid that if people make the glastonbury pilgrimage expecting to find glastonbury romance they will be disappointed we do not quite come up to mr powiss specifications dion fortune avalon of the heart one after the fire the caller said this is lord pennard i wish to speak to my daughter now no question it definitely was him voice straight out of the freezer compartment sam daniel the printer had seen him around as you might say heard him ordering his huntsmen about very big man in these parts and oh yes this was definitely lord p on the phone no doubt about that sure it is sam said and im the pope now piss off and stop bothering us or ill call the police diane looked up from the oldest and simplest of sams office wordprocessors your old man sam said and not a happy old man if im any judge what if he shows up at the door hes left a couple of messages on the answering machine at the shop diane said i just wipe them off he wont come here hes always employed people to show up at doors for him fair enough sam turned back to his computer screen he was laying out this illustrated feature piece by matthew banks one of the five million local herbalists about the glastonbury thorn it listed all the holy thorn trees in and around the town suggesting which was the oldest and examining the case for the various thorns being actual descendants of the staff of joseph of arimathea complete load of old horseshit in sams view but diane said the thorn was a potent symbol which united the alternative types and the locals local people were proud of the thorn diane said well samuel mervyn daniel was about as local as you could get and proud was putting it a bit strong pauls digital clock said twenty past bleeding eight and theyd been at work for over an hour marking up copy transferring it to the computer experimenting with layouts it hadnt even been light when hed unlocked the printshop he hadnt had a shave for two days nor a proper meal nor seen any telly nor been in any fit state to do much with charlotte the upper classes always been good at getting the peasants working the clock round for a pittance except diane was always here too head down a woman driven a lot of grief a lot of upset inside but she wasnt letting any of it out not in front of sam daniel she had guts and you didnt expect that or else it was another aspect of her reputed insanity diane pushed her chair back ive got to go got to open the shop bet youve not had any breakfast have you she was losing weight too not that she couldnt afford to lose a couple of stone but not this way and her face was always pale it was like somewhere behind her eyes there was always an image of what shed seen that night oh well you know ive got some carob bars at the shop diane pulled her red coat from the peg the kind of coat youd think twice about donating to oxfam in case the third world sent it back sam raised his eyes to the ceiling bloody carob bars im not saying the humble carob hasnt got its place look but a slice or two of toast soya marg a dab of marmite nothing wouldve died to bring that to the table would it thank you so much for your concern sam diane gathered her stuff together in a plastic carrier bag listen could you let me see a proof printout whatever of the piece on the towncentre enhancement scheme when youve finished it no hurry but if i could have it by three at the latest strewth anybody excluding family wants to see you diane what shall i say oh send them round to the shop theyll have to join the queue bye he watched her through the window walking quickly head held high out of grope lane on to magdalene street gonna crack nothing surer after the fire and no juanita sam had figured the magazine idea would be straight down the tubes but then the day following the funeral diane had appeared palefaced in the printshop a cardboard folder under her arm talking about getting started on the avalonian like pronto i owe it to her ok was all shed say then they started work on the first dummy how do we know sam read on the screen that the thorn tree on wearyall hill is even in the same spot as what we like to think of as the original matthew bankss original draft had been a sight more cumbersome diane had ripped into it subbing it down to neat sentences short paragraphs the alternative community diane had said firmly have to learn from the outset that this is our paper not theirs sam grinned remembering that bloody tightarsed jenna a voice therapist coming in with a piece written by the women of the cauldron with its own headline on top why the anglican church denies the goddess mary diane giving it back without even reading it pointing out politely that the avalonian would be doing its own headlines and any comment pieces would be specifically commissioned suggesting they cut the piece by half and submit it as a readers letter with actual names at the bottom jennad gone out with a face like an old shoe sam was starting to warm to diane one thing about the upper classes they knew how to put people down with style and slavedriving they knew about that three weeks after starting from nothing no design not even a paper size they now had almost enough for a respectable dummy with real features real news stones idea being they could take it around and show to people to stimulate advertising the plan was to start out as a monthly then come down to fortnightly anything beyond that theyd need staff which they couldnt afford diane insisted every contribution had to be paid for even if it was just a token amount couldnt rely on volunteers like the guy with the threelegged dog you had to start out diane said how you meant to go on professional incredible shed seemed so soggy that first time she came in ah well sam stood up twenty to nine young pauld be in soon then he could get some breakfast no carob bars for sammy not after another dawn shift funny everybody was up early this morning even lord pennard who was obviously monitoring dianes movements having her watched and with this family it had to be more than just paternal interest like she didnt have enough problem middecember already the towncentre christmas tree had just gone up in front of the victorian gothic market cross there was a thin glaze of merriment on the streets carol singers and also bands of pagan mummers with shamanic drums the former holy thorn ceramics now called the goddess shop had a banner wishing customers a happy solstice carey and frayne had no specific wishes for anyone diane had found a box of christmas ornaments for the bookshop window including a chubby little electric santa claus with coloured lights around his hat which woolly had made last year in his workshop she hadnt the heart to display it it reminded her too much of jim battle jims funeral had been awfully depressing woolly had rounded up a bunch of local mourners for the sake of appearances but there was no family his abandoned wife unsurprisingly had not attended neither had his son who also lived in bristol an inquest had been opened and adjourned until the new year after taking her statement the police had told diane an open verdict was possible although accidental death or death by misadventure were more likely thered certainly been nothing to suggest suicide unless she knew otherwise diane had shaken her head in truth she didnt know what to think through the shop window she saw a lanky redhaired man in black jeans and one of those lumberjack shirts slapping something to the side of a yellow litter bin on a lamppost darryl davey the biggest boy at sam daniels school apparently like a shark in a goldfish tank case of premature development shaving at about ten and a dad at sixteen but now his sons sixteen and darryls pissed off that nobody looks up to him anymore he seemed to be employed by the glastonbury first people to display their material all over town probably illegally but nobody stopped him he was certainly quite open about what he was doing now standing back to admire it it was a sticker about four inches in diameter like a no entry road sign diane went to the window to examine it it was horribly effective you just knew that it was going to be all over the oldestablished shops and pubs in glastonbury in the back windows of cars and delivery vans and farm vehicles on the sides of buses the idea of restricting access to the tor had caught on in a big way given immediate and urgent impetus by the fire before that inaugural glastonbury first meeting had even finished fire engines had been struggling to reach the top of a wellhouse lane effectively blockaded by travellers vehicles one of those frightful coincidences for which glastonbury was famous the local and regional press had seized the angle giving a tremendous boost to glastonbury first and of course to archer who had been interviewed on the local tv news had this system been in operation archer had said soberly and sorrowfully i believe we should not now have a tragedy of this proportion on our hands i hope these people wherever they may be skulking can sleep at night efforts by the press to find these particular travellers had of course failed woolly said theyd never even arrived at the roadprotest meeting eventually the rescue services had managed to remove the old bus which had broken down in the road it apparently had carried no licence disc and all the other vehicles had gone the following day an entirely innocent travelling couple just passing through had returned to their van on the central car park to find all four of its tyres slashed and the words murdering scum spraypainted along one side the chairman of glastonbury first mr quentin cotton had appealed for calm and restraint although as he told the evening post it was understandable that emotions were running high poor jim battle would have been sickened as the afternoon trailed dismally away verity endicott sat in the deepest corner of the dining hall and welcomed the dark by inhaling it dr grainger had taught her how to do this you breathed in expanding the diaphragm imagining the air inside your body to be of the same consistency and texture as the atmosphere in the room and then you directed the smooth dark air to the extremities of your body to your hands and feet and along your spinal cord until the restful darkness filled your head finally you exhaled through the mouth sending some of your essence out into the room a mingling thus verity had taken her first tentative steps along the path to penumbratisation fusion with the dark dr grainger had spent hours with her over the past few weeks refusing to take any payment because he said meadwell was a real palace of shadows in which it was a privilege to work he was an earnest humourless man and verity seemed to be becoming rather dependent on him on three occasions they had meditated together in one of the upstairs rooms sitting side by side on straightbacked chairs with their hands on their knees a tincture of moonlight on the rim of a wardrobe here dr grainger had instructed her in the techniques of tenebral chakrabreathing which he said would put her in tune with the dark physically mentally and emotionally there are five other stages after this he said but its gonna take you maybe a couple more weeks of nightly exercise before youre ready to move on up verity clung with little confidence but certainly no misgivings any more to the tenebral exercises the house might be growing ever darker but the real oppressor was oliver pixhill whose undisguised intention was to dispense with her services presumably seeing her as the final link with his despised father dr grainger was right if she could not love the dark as he did at least she might learn to live with it it was her duty to stay to resist all attempts to force her out to hold out until until when colonel pixhill had always said she would know major shepherd had said someone would help her that she would not have to be a canary until she finally succumbed to the gases all she was sure of was that the person coming to help her was not oliver pixhill she just couldnt get him out other head he had never returned but his sneers lingered he obviously hated meadwell too had he inherited it he would doubtless have sold it at once which was perhaps one of the reasons the colonel had laid the foundations of the pixhill trust verity felt very lonely day to day she seemed to see only dr grainger wanda never telephoned she was it seemed spending much of her time persuading influential people to support the campaign against the bathtaunton relief road and was also apparently involved in setting up some sort of christmas event uniting pagans and christians in the person of dr liana kelly the liberalminded new bishop of bath and wells all fine and good in its way this surely was what glastonbury was about a healing of ancient rifts so was christmas it should be a time of rejoicing but on the town streets there were few smiles to be seen she missed very much the joviality of mr battle with his sketchbook and his bicycle and the careless elegance of juanita carey even if she was always too busy to talk for long such an unbelievable tragedy in its wake and in the aftermath of the unpleasantness at holy thorn ceramics there seemed to be in the air of glastonbury a cold hostility which verity had never before experienced not what the holy town was about it was as though avalon itself awful thought was going the way of meadwell at least woolly looked cheerful in orange trousers and a yellow jacket over a lurid hawaiian shirt but then he always looked cheerful apart from that one suit clothes like these were all he had his face was doleful though today tis slipping away from me diane i can feel it theyre taking over he pulled a stool to the counter daft to complain on one level tis a wonderful job shes doing dame wanda knows more famous folk than i even heard of that woman actors artists and such yes but woolly the sad fact is that when it comes to infrastructure im afraid its the kind of people archer and my father know who really count infrastructure theres a clever word you gonner use words like that in the avalonian certainly not diane said its going to be simple and direct its really gonner happen of course its jolly well going to happen diane lowered her eyes i think she worked on the avalonian every waking hour even when she was in the shop with the little laptop shed borrowed from sam studied the customers for people who might be recruited as correspondents preferably straight people well as straight as you could find among customers at an alternative bookshop you know ill help all i can woolly said i know and dont think im not grateful but theres a limit to how much you can help or at least be seen to help youre a politician now sheesh do i look like a politician we have to be seen to be independent in the window a sign sam had printed said coming soon the avalonian shed been a little worried about that suppose people remembered the old hippy magazine and thought it was going to be the same sort of thing the phone rang diane never answered the phone in case it was her father she waited for the answering machine to cut in juanitas voice still on it there was silence the caller not sure whether to leave a message er tis miss diane i wanted i know that voice woolly said its tis don moulder here i er i needer talk to miss diane bout bout them hippies look i right the line was cut well theres a man really at home with the new technology woolly observed you gonner call him back i might actually go and see him diane said i keep hearing rumours that hes gone sort of strange thats no rumour my love apparently hes put up a huge cross on his land i thought it might make a piece for the avalonian for the dummy i mean hes not an alternative person is he you mean hes like a straight religious maniac yeah i suppose so i do admire what youre doing you know the way youve thrown yourself into it at a time like this its because its a time like this diane said two jacket potatoes standing under the swinging sign of the george and pilgrims joe powys watched diane ffitch walking down from carey and frayne hands plunged into her coat pockets a beret plopped on tangled brown curls a stiffbacked folder under her arm she smiled shyly this is awfully good of you although i mean it might actually be ok it might just make the journey then again it might fall off he went to unlock the mini well yes i suppose so returning to the inn tonight powys had encountered her in the car park sitting in her pinkspotted van with the engine running it was making a noise like a small aeroplane diane had said does this mean its sort of broken it was only a hole in the silencer but it looked like a very old exhaust system not safe to drive it to bristol especially at night diane squeezed into the mini put her folder behind the seat at least theres a place at the hospital where you can go and get a cup of tea or something while youre waiting or powys said perhaps i could pop in and see her for a couple of minutes just so i can tell dan something oh gosh diane fluttered embarrassed bit of a prob there actually she wont see anyone well you know except me shes in quite a bad way i mean emotionally too yeh i can imagine powys drove up high street the headlights of an oncoming car flashlit a yellow poster in the window of an empty shop it said lets tame the tor shes feeling a lot of guilt about jims death one way and another i mean she was sort of sort of close to him but i think not as close as he wouldve liked if you see what i mean oh right i mean no ones saying he you know killed himself no ones saying that he just seems to have got rather drunk and careless people have been muttering about the artistic temperament meaning drink but he actually wasnt like that he was terribly balanced really ever so stoical even after a few drinks diane went quiet for a while a big girl squashed on to a tiny bucket scat in a car so small that she and powys were almost touching i do find it easy to talk to you she said at last so im going to say it i think she took a deep breath i think this was you know meant they were leaving town powys saw in his rearview mirror the sign that said glastonbury ancient isle of avalon he felt a tingle of unreality at the very base of his spine this is a town ruled by legend secretly governed by numinous rules bollocks he glanced at diane she was looking directly at him he could see her face very clearly its openness seemed to belie everything hed read about her in the letter from juanita carey to dan frayne lady loony arnold was sitting placidly on her knee her arms around him let it go said his wiser self dont react change the subject joe powys sighed his wiser self had quit years ago disillusioned meant he said how exactly do you mean meant dan frayne had said ive rung the hospital and she wont speak to anyone ive rung this diane ffitch cant get a word of sense just goes on about this fucking pixhill jesus joe all i want is to know whats going on christ forget the book if you like go for a winter bloody break at harveycalders expense just help me powys had driven down a week ago under deep grey skies the famous tor looking passive disconnected as though this crazy plan to have it fenced off had already diminished it hed booked into the george and pilgrims into a dark room with an uncurtained fourposter bed and gothic windows edged with richly coloured stained glass from his window if he leaned far enough out he could see the bookshop carey and frayne on the first day powys had walked arnold round the streets buying flimsy small imprint books on the grail the goddess king arthur and joseph of arimathea on the second day hed led the dog halfway up the tor and then carried him to the top where mist over the levels obscured the views and a man with a red beard and two pigtails played a tuneless tin whistle into the wind battering the empty hollowedout church tower on the third day hed driven up through a housing estate to wearyall hill where no signpost marked the path to the holy thorn it proved to be a windthrashed little tree absolutely alone on the hillside protected only by a wirenetting tube there were views to both the tor to the right and the abbey ruins behind the town centre of all the places hed been in glastonbury this was somehow the most moving hed wished fay had been here to share the moment and then feeling as lonely and exposed as the thorn he had blinked away tears on the fourth day hed planned to visit the abbey which was totally hidden from view until you went under a medieval gatehouse in magdalene street and paid your admission fee hed left it until last maybe worried hed be disappointed this would be an unfortunate reaction to the holyest erthe in all england finally hed decided to save it and gone into carey and frayne waiting until there were no customers noting five paperback copies of the old golden land watching diane working on a laptop behind the counter and then going over to request a copy of the little book hed already read four times diane had fumbled under the counter the seaweedgreen volume of colonel pixhills diaries as the letters had implied was not exactly on display i know your face diane looking up to meet his eyes as if the exchange of a pixhill was a secret sign like a masonic handshake dont i shouldnt think so but shed surprised him diving across the shop for a copy of the old golden land a bit unnerving because hang on theres no author picture on the paperback no diane had blushed but there was on the hardback it lived in my locker you see for an entire term it was lunchtime shed closed the shop taken him into a little room behind made some tea kneeling down with a saucerful for arnold as if a threelegged dog was yet another sign as he was to learn diane ffitch was always spotting signs and symbols it emerged that shed been packed off at sixteen to this absolutely frightful private school near oswestry all outdoor pursuits and lukewarm showers feeling like a fish out of water on the cold welsh border so far from the mystery and allure of avalon feeling so utterly miz the whole time until juanita had thoughtfully sent her the old golden land inspired by the book shed found a bronze age burial mound on the edge of the school grounds seen how it aligned with the village church and then a hill fort on the horizon and realised that the welsh border was actually quite mysterious not such a ghastly place after all powys had told her about dan fraynes proposal diane never taking her eyes off him after a while hed begun to feel a little uncomfortable im messing up your lunch hour ive not been having one actually takes up too much time i tend to just sort of nibble things telling him about the magazine she was trying to put together determined to have it all organised for when juanita came out of hospital because shed need something to take her mind off everything well powys said if there was anything he could do to help thinking that working unobtrusively on a little local magazine would get him discreetly into the centre of things in glastonbury and if there was to be a book he felt her eyes somehow looking into him we can use all the help we can get she said in avalon the following day again in her lunch hour shed taken him to see the guy at samprint whod struck powys as being fairly cynical about the avalonian venture but at least had never heard of the old golden land hed made a big fuss of arnold asked how hed lost his leg a farmer shot him accused him of worrying sheep but it was a fitup sam the printer said what did you do his shotgun kind of wound up in the river powys said it was a family heirloom sam had shrugged approvingly then diane had asked powys if hed interview the new bishop of bath and wells about his attempts to reconcile christian and pagan elements again powys had begun to feel detached from reality it was like a halfwaking morning dream where you watched yourself being drawn into unfolding situations too lazy to pull yourself out even after reading the pixhill diaries all i know is its itching like hell she said this nurse was small and bossy but not unsympathetic she was called karen thats a good sign lets have a look she leaned across the bed the only one in the sideward hey dont back off it wont hurt sorry oh i do need to get out of here dont we all only some of us have to feed our kids just be glad were not kicking you out before your time you get the best bits now relaxing and being looked after and not having to worry thats the idea anyway sorry im just a naturalborn ungrateful bitch the lookingafter bit that was the worst of all you had to drink from a babycup with a spout sometimes with a nurse holding the cup although recently shed learned how to grip it between her wrists so long as it wasnt hot tea or coffee what she hadnt learned was how to turn on taps with her toes and obviously she couldnt sink her boxingglove bandages into hot water so they had to give her a bath sitting there with her arms in the air having her bits washed the unutterable degradation of it juanita sighed i thought id be out in a week well we didnt order you to develop pneumonia because of the pneumonia caused they said by shock theyd had to delay the skingrafts you couldnt have a general anaesthetic with lungs seemingly committed to becoming a nogo area for oxygen theyd pumped her full of antibiotics but it was two weeks before they could get around to pulling the skin off her thighs and applying it to her hands for all that time she actually hadnt wanted to smoke now the need was acute this morning shed got karen to take her down the corridor and put one in her mouth unlit the fury was building too but that was irrational wasnt it there you go karen straightened up everythings fine theyll probably take the dressing off again in the morning do they have to cant i wear a permanent dressing its only you wholl notice most of the time exactly the sight of the bandage balls at the end of her arms still inflicted horrendous scorched images of jim fragmenting in his jagged molten cage falling at last into her arms because because oh god i couldnt turn away from him again and then like a wound slowly turning septic the other insidious imaginings would begin to manifest you were very lucky said karen who cleaned her teeth and god help us wiped her bum you want to thank your lucky stars sorry thanks lucky stars actually they tell me it was the lucky afghan but for the afghan my tits wouldve been jacket potatoes dont think about it all right sure said juanita she looked down at her pure white cotton nightdress and the image of the jacket potatoes brought her to a decision listen i need to ask you something diane asked him who was john cowper powys it had been an easy run to the hospital along the m powys explored the parking area for a space he was a famous author i know that i mean to you what relation forget it powys said not your problem in the diaries diane said theres a bit where pixhill comes into glastonbury and meets his teacher whom he doesnt identify and john cowper powys who he thinks he isnt going to like much but he seems to get on with him in the end im glad somebody could the suggestion is that colonel pixhill and mr powys were involved in something together it diane hesitated its become very important to me to find out what this was he said nothing he was finding that if you asked diane direct questions you were apt to scare her off better to wait because you see the other person the teacher the person colonel pixhill doesnt name i think that was someone close to me he writes several tunes about visiting his spiritual teacher twice he mentions going up wellhouse lane which was where where she lived diane went quiet you think his teacher was a she powys said carefully why do you think that because shes my teacher too diane said not looking at him that is she was my nanny powys did some quick calculations they were clearly not edging around the same person sorry he said i thought we might have been talking about a woman who lived in a converted army hut at the foot of the tor she turned to him they were in a shadowed area of the car park but he didnt need much in the way of lights to know her eyes were aglow diane powys said very carefully treading eggshells the sound of a distant ambulance echoed the warning sirens going off in his head dion fortune died more than twenty years before you were born diane considered this i dont think she would consider that a problem diane said eventually sorry the nurse rearranged the bedclothes over the cage thing that prevented them touching juanitas upper thighs where the skin had been removed ruth who dunn nursing sister what here dont know where she was it might not even have been anywhere in the west country but it probably was dont recall friend of yours juanita laughed shortly like that is it i can ask the girls tomorrow anything in particular you want to know about her just whatever look dianes here dont say anything to her about this ok offended you in some way has she this dunn woman no juanita said she paid me a compliment what lovely slender hands ceridwen had said juanita stared grimly at the white boxing gloves they covered scar tissue and transplanted skin but not the unspeakable memory of gripping a melting metal easel and staring into jim battles fried eyes three doesnt matter with her hair around her shoulders no makeup and the pristine white shift she looked very young diane thought like a recumbent version of the sylph on the front of the old avalonian but awfully vulnerable with her hands inside those enormous bandages theyre taking them off tomorrow juanita said thats super least it means i can get out of here when im thinking about it you mean youll discharge yourself diane said disapprovingly she really didnt think juanita was ready to face glastonbury she never spoke of the fire or jim juanita said you know youre looking distinctly washedout youve lost weight are you eating sure its just been a bit sort of frenzied what with people placing orders for christmas and look i wanted to get your opinion on this she pulled her folder on to her knees the artwork had the avalonian across the top in lettering which was only modestly celtic the rest of the front cover was a black and white photograph of the tor surrounded by a high barbedwire fence with two searchlight towers we got the fence from one of those postwar pictures of belsen or somewhere paul put it all together on his computer with a practised elbow juanita prodded a pillow into the small of her back and studied the mockup im impressed but it doesnt make any secret of where we stand on the issue does it i mean belsen ive also written to quentin cotton asking if hed like to write a piece expressing his views not archer not griff this way neither sam nor i have to deal with estranged relatives you and archer are officially estranged i dont know i havent spoken to him oh gosh i meant to say you know who his new constituency agent is domini dorrelladams oliver pixhill juanitas eyes widened its true woolly rang to tell me just before i came out apparently the constituency party isnt awfully well off at the moment so archer offered to bring his own agent free of charge as it were juanitas eyes narrowed whats the scam he just wants somebody he can trust i suppose olivers a shit said juanita even as a kid he was a shit so im told diane shrugged archers a shit do you think we should run the contents along the bottom or down one side you could start off a column aligned with the the in the masthead if you see what i mean actually as an example of a first issue i suspect there ought to be something less hard line contentious upfront less inyourface oh diane was crestfallen i just had the idea and and its a really great idea diane and it looks terrific but for the dummy maybe we need to be a little pragmatic hey is pixhill married or anything girlfriend oh really diane felt herself blush public schoolboys together juanita raised an eyebrow both late thirties unattached its an appealing thought diane concluded but i dont think archer is actually gay just doesnt have regular girlfriends never mind tory central officell find him a nice fiancee before the election then theyll part amicably when he wins you watch i dont want to watch no juanita lay back on the pillows i cant help thinking we might have stopped it and shafted the glastonbury first movement along the way obviously meaning the headlice thing but as it had turned out it was just as well they hadnt been to the police wearing her avalonian hat diane had made a legitimate call to street and learned from a detective sergeant that it was no longer a murder investigation a post mortem had revealed that the young man now formally identified as alan carl gallagher aged twenty missing from his home since last summer had had a weak heart and had taken a large quantity of drugs it was very borderline now the sergeant said off the record i still think somebodys been got at juanita said you cant just dismiss head injuries they virtually have the sergeant had said the injuries were not sufficiently serious to have caused alans death he might have been in a fight he could just as easily have been stumbling around stoned out of his head and been superficially struck by a car or walked into a tree and then staggered back into his bus driven it into the woods because he couldnt see where the hell he was going none of the travellers theyd spoken to had admitted knowing him but then they wouldnt would they as for the false number plates on the bus well it was hard to find any of these hippy wrecks with genuine plates was it his own bus i dont know diane said i havent seen it it would be easy to tell if for instance there were yellow stripes under some of the black shed been thinking a lot about the bizarre episode with the girl hecate and the children with their spray cans somebody had told them to spray the bus black to make it less conspicuous less identifiable i think the travellers killed him she said thered been bad magic on the tor that night colonel pixhill would have understood would have recognised what shed seen in the sky and again in the fire powys was waiting for diane in reception a styrofoam cup in his hand in a baggy sweater and jeans he still looked a lot like his picture on the back of the old golden land although he must have been ever so young when that came out at school other girls had photos of tom cruise in their lockers she dreamed about dishy j m powys earthmysteries writer how could she not trust him now how is she powys asked a little overwrought i think i didnt tell her you were here you dont mind do you he shook his head theres a lot she isnt telling me diane said she keeps talking about coming home but i think she needs to get as much as possible out of her system before she comes home youre a bit of a psychologist then diane ive been to enough she said he tossed his cup into a bin i um meant in the dion fortune sense oh she said yes i know what youre asking the answers no ive never had what you might call a practical involvement with the occult never even been to a seance tried to take up meditation once but i was hopeless i things just sort of happen to me when they were back in the car because he was jm powys who dismissed nothing she told him about the lightballs about the tor and about the third nanny you saw her i didnt exactly see her i was aware of her sitting on the edge of the bed and um what made you think this was dion fortune youre not going to put this in your book are you not if you dont want me to and he wouldnt of course he wouldnt he liked to think hed gone way past the stage where books mattered more than people all the same she proved difficult to pin down on this one at first she told him she used to think she was a reincarnation of df but the basis for this seemed to be little more than a teenage crush on the novels and those initials powys didnt imagine dan frayne had any illusions about his initials she wasnt quite sure when shed first made a connection between df and the third nanny who to powys sounded suspiciously like a fantasy figure to help her cope with life under the authority of the real ones what happened to your mother she died when i was born that is i was born in rather a hurry after she fell down the stairs at bowermead im sorry my fathers rather held it against me ever since i dont think hes ever been able to look at me without feeling a certain resentment powys thought this and being brought up by starchy nannies was enough to disarrange any kids psychology several miles further on somewhere down the m she said it isnt a coincidence no we were called back you for john cowper powys me for dion fortune dion fortune didnt have much time for jcp powys pointed out she even misspelt his name that was deliberate a sort of smokescreen if she didnt know him well enough to spell his name right she could hardly be involved with him in a secret operation what secret operation was this exactly i dont know but i think we have to find out why else have we been brought back i havent exactly been brought back ive never been here before also youre a powys ive been commissioned to write a book diane thats all but it isnt all is it is her third nanny on the edge of the bed any more crazy than having your living room repeatedly rearranged by a kinetic copy of a glastonbury romance diane said do you believe in evil probably i mean yes in glastonbury good as anywhere or as bad colonel pixhill believed in it very strongly at the end thats one very depressing book said powys people hate it in glastonbury i can imagine they would doesnt fit the ethos diane said theres an american called dr pelham grainger who lives locally and apparently maintains that we dont let enough darkness into our lives ive taken over thirty orders for his book in the past fortnight i think somebody mentioned him a week or two ago sounds like a very sick man she nodded and stroked arnold and didnt say anything else until they were well past the isle of avalon sign ive seen the dark chalice her voice seemed to reverberate which didnt happen in minis powys slowed down drastically the lights of glastonbury all around them now there was a sort of shelter in the centre of the car park under which diane had left the van powys turned the mini so that the headlights lit up the side of the van he was waiting this could mean almost anything the dark chalice seemed to be pixhills all purpose metaphor for bad shit oh no said diane although it wasnt yet nine pm the car park seemed completely deserted it was another bright sharp night the moon not long past full the tower of st johns sticking up like a candlestick on the edge of a table diane said oh please he followed her eyes oh he got out the back window of dianes van had been smashed so had the drivers side window glass all over the seat across the side panels where diane had painted friendly pink spots there was uneven black spray paint lettering six inches high diane stared at the van in numbed silence powys squeezed her right hand with both of his he saw the black paint was glistening still damp it was in the fire diane said tonelessly when jim died that was the second time the first time was over the tor like shadow hands holding up a shadow cup that was when i felt the evil ive never felt anything like it ill call the police powys said no you cant just let them the police are never going to catch them theres a garage i used to go to ill get them to take it away first thing tomorrow bastards powys said have you any idea who might it doesnt matter diane cried she turned away from the van it doesnt matter she whispered four horrid brown fountain woolly said mind if i move some of this stuff diane i need to spread the maps out she put on all the shop lights it was a dark morning gosh how many have you got three i need to put em all together think were gonner have to use the floor this is heavy shit diane man this is like endoftheworldscenario woolly squatted on the carpet and began to unfold an ordnance survey map sliding one edge under two legs of the display table for current bestsellers hed phoned just after seven to check if he could come round before the shop opened he needed to lay something on her couldnt believe what he was seeing for once diane hadnt wanted to get up not even for woolly shed been out long after midnight yes ok shed lied to j m powys it did matter about the van it mattered terribly i got the proof here look no hype woolly said proof about the road you all right diane yes fine sorry go ahead the maps were covered with little circles and ruler marks all woollys ordnance maps were customised into leyline plans with prehistoric sites stones and burial mounds and ancient churches moats beacon hills and things neatly encircled in red ink people like woolly could prove all kinds of wonderful things with maps and rulers and setsquares what you did was to find how many of the old sites fell into straight lines and then draw them in it never failed youd finish up with a whole network of lines some with four or five points sometimes a whole starformation of lines radiating out from a single point indicating a very powerful ancient centre glastonbury tor of course was the classic example perhaps the most important power centre in the whole of western europe sure enough there it was on the second of woollys maps with lines of force spraying out in all directions spent all night on this diane couldnt believe it myself at first where the road goes bit of a mindblower girl dont know how we missed it here of all places woolly was a very intelligent chap but hed done so many exotic drugs in his time that he tended to approach life obliquely from strange directions so that rather mundane things seemed to him quite astonishing of course there was the possibility that what woolly saw was the truth and everyone else was blinded by the familiarity of things diane liked to think that most of the time she made some tea when she came back he had the three maps pushed together taking up more than half the shop he was thumbing through one of the paperback dion fortunes wish this lady was still around diane shed get us organised all right diane handed him his tea and said nothing ever heard of the watchers of avalon diane sort of the group she founded to defend britain against nazi black magic in world war two i believe that woolly said everybody goes on about the v or whatever it was being the nazis secret weapon but the secret secret weapon was heavyduty magic they were well into it now the watchers they were all over britain but they all concentrated on the tor at certain prearranged times and like pooled their energy really heavy a real reservoir of psychic power to keep the enemy out the tors a very powerful beacon diane said a few weeks ago all this would have sent her into overdrive but this morning everything felt so dull and stagnant some people say the watchers of avalon are still around you know not the original ones like but magical adepts whove picked up the banner what i wanner know is if they are around what the hell they doing about this fuckin road right woolly rubbed his hands together got your notebook ive got a good memory oh gosh huh nothing its ok what if colonel pixhill and john cowper powys were involved with df in the watchers of avalon pixhill first came to glastonbury in the war while recovering from his wounds in fact was that how the three got together ok woolly said gimme a sec to get my head together everythingll be cool everything will be cool repeated a voice as smooth as cashmere is this a cartographers convention diane or have i wandered into a timewarp woolly spun round in alarm dark overcoat briefcase gloves dianes brother archer in his city clothes leaving early to catch my train to london archer said saw the lights the sign said closed but the door was slightly open so i took the liberty of walking in woolly dived at his maps like a maniac gathering them to his chest the one held down by the table legs ripped in two places not inconvenient i trust archer said young paul who thought even anoraks were a little avant garde was wearing a sleeveless pullover in maroon he was waving his arms about swear to god sam im coming back from the avalon internet group at dean wiggins flat im taking a short cut across the car park and there she is got three four spray cans and shes going at it like a loo like mad painting her van at night sam leaned back in his favourite directors chair legs stretched out hands behind his head you dont by any chance take hallucinogenic drugs at meetings of the avalon internet group paul looked insulted the kid didnt even drink his idea of hard drugs was extrastrong mints sam i saw it sam needed to think about this hed been in the printshop since seven no need to be here wasnt expecting diane cracking the whip or anything the avalonian dummy was more or less in the can just waiting for the interview the guy with the dog was doing with the bishop so no sleep lost over the avalonian just diane daft eh found he couldnt sleep for ages last night through not exactly worrying about her trying to puzzle her out track down her motivations odd that never lost a wink of sleep over charlotte or the row with his dad or even getting arrested over the sabbing come to that probably the last time was the fox cub six nights feeding the little guy with a dropper seven eight years ago this must be a hunt orphan from pennards land nearly got himself snatched by that bastard rankin hughie painter shouting leave it sam theyll see your face he couldnt do that rufus cute little guy still had that sweet puppy smell used to fall asleep on sams knees hed cried like a baby into his pillow the night rufus died ok paul sam said you dont mention this to a soul no sam good boy sam sat up in his directors chair beyond puzzlement this time verity arose at seventhirty and made a point of not putting on any lights doing her tenebral breathing as she found her way through the shadows to the kitchen although it was the youngest and least museum like part of the house the victorian kitchen was depressing in its own way those tall dark stained fitted dressers leaving hardly any wall visible knotted exposed wiring crawling along two beams like varicose veins the water pipes coiling in the shadows making intestinal noises in the drab stillness the telephone rang just after eight am rattling the plates on the dresser the combined sound somehow reminding verity of the shrill protesting warble of the fire engines trapped in wellhouse lane less than half a mile away while poor mr battle had burned to death she picked up the receiver sharply it was dr grainger he came straight to the point verity ive been thinking about this a good deal also discussing it in confidence with my partner the psychotherapist eloise castell bottom line is if you are going to gain any benefits from our work together we need to get around to some corrective therapy for the house itself yes but dr grainger i dont he was suddenly a runaway force in glastonbury the publication of his book embracing the dark had been brought forward to coincide with the winter solstice the shortest darkest day and the sunday times had done an article on him for its colour magazine but she really couldnt have him tampering with the fabric of meadwell i would like to check this out soonest verity specifically the old well itself but you cant get to the well its sealed up dr grainger concreted over because of contamination there was a a health risk precisely the sealing of the well put the house into a state of denial what you have there is a vital subterranean artery you can no longer access i say vital because this was the reason for the house being built in this location could we say tomorrow eleven am oh but i verity frantically fingering her wooden beads i would need to consult the trust and im afraid to because i dont know who controls the trust ant more or to what extent it still honours the colonels wishes verity he said with heavy patience i ran into oliver pixhill last night we discussed the problem at some length oliver is concerned about your situation he wants to help you he said to me go ahead go ahead and unblock the meadwell afterwards verity who had not been down to the old well in years felt so jittery that she was obliged to take a measure of dr bachs rescue remedy before she was even able to leave the oppressive kitchen archer stood in the doorway exuding presence diane wondered if this was something they taught you at conservative central office how to walk into a room and dominate everybody or perhaps hed just had lessons from father councillor woolaston archer smiled managing to make diane feel as though hed discovered her and woolly dancing in the nude woolly shoved roughly folded maps under his arm to shake hands archer said i suspect well be seeing a good deal of each other in the years to come or perhaps not if you get elected woolly said diane glanced at him wasnt like woolly to be so abrasive he must have been very startled she saw archers full mouth develop a petulant twist swiftly straightened too swiftly as if hed been studying his less appealing expressions on video with a view to strangling them at birth quite archer said pleasantly look i dont want to intrude on you diane if s ok woolly said hurriedly i was just off got this sitemeeting out at meare in half an hour catch you again diane interesting to meet you councillor archer watched him go shaking his head almost kindly quaint little person surely the last of a dying breed hes a nice man archer diane moved defensively behind the counter im sure he is diane reason i called fathers been trying to reach you with a conspicuous lack of success to find out what you were doing for christmas if you remember diane said icily the last time i saw father was when he had me kidnapped oh diane archer twitching off his gloves what can one say the old man was thinking of me a trifle embarrassing if the news of ones election had appeared next to the arrest of ones sister along with two dozen smelly hippies for public order offences but youre quite right an overreaction educated people make allowances for you now archer smiled his vulpine smile she noticed hed developed lady thatchers mannerism of finishing a sentence by putting the head on one side and exposing the teeth archer diane stopped suddenly realising she was being given a chance to mention what the rankins had done to headlice archer was watching her unblinking and diane felt a stillness come upon the room the colours of the books on the display stands seemed to be neutralising before her eyes she let her arms fall to her sides in defeat it its just you cant do that you know that that sort of thing the words mushy and inexact not quite aware of what she was saying i mean im twentyseven which which makes me a grownup person you know blinking to clear her vision i mean what what was he going to do lock me in the attic archer retracted his smile if he was relieved she hadnt mentioned the headlice business he wasnt showing it diane believe me when juanita carey arrived to collect you we couldnt have been more happy a responsible woman in spite of archer gesticulated at the books with a certain nosewrinkling contempt really palling tragedy though wondering if i ought to pop in and see her in hospital take a bunch of flaaahs perhaps not diane said carefully she felt as if she were standing in a pool of grey water its temperature just above her body heat whatever you think best anyway were all jolly happy to see you apparently settled and working on this little ah periodical pamphlet thing diane let it go they werent making a great secret of the avalonian but the less archer knew the better she didnt want to talk about the new road either and certainly not the tor archer was its enemy and her so he beamed what are you doing for christmas because father and i thought you might like to join us family friends neighbours party people at bowermead the usual christmas day gathering and then the hunt of course on boxing day we couldnt possibly think of you being so close and not joining in the festive fun diane could almost feel the bloody dampness on her thighs as she remembered archers idea of festive fun she could hardly see him now the shop was so dark its window and door clouded with fog she heard her own voice say tell father its terribly kind of him but i think juanitas going to be out of hospital for christmas and she wont be able to use her hands much you see not properly not for some time ah yes how good you are diane i shall try and explain it to father diane felt a movement in the pool of mist at her side of course it was his original intention archers little smile was almost coy to invite patrick and his family she clutched at the counter feeling sick with hatred the loathing solid and real inside her and also somehow existing separately in the room if youd then refused to come hed doubtless have sent patrick to fetch you and it would all have been horribly embarrassing tact diplomacy and forethought never being fathers middle names dont worry my dear ive talked him out of it thank you diane said on a long volcanic breath thank you archer ill be on my way then archer slipped a glove over his hand paused in the doorway and when is this little paper of yours to be published er er next year perhaps oh nothing imminent then we want to get it right absolutely im sure father will be delighted to see you deploying your ah newfound journalistic skills she saw how cold his eyes were even if it is in our backyard as it were archer said even if it scorns all our best endeavours he raised a gloved hand look after yourself diane damned hippies and squatters are turning this town into a jungle drugdealing burglaries muggings vandalism he caught her eyes graffiti dianes insides were already pumping like a sewage works as she slammed the door in his face and barely made it to the kitchen sink before her meagre carobbar breakfast came up in a horrid brown fountain five all for real sam tried to gaze casually out or the printshop window his chair angled meaningfully away as charlotte rushed out slammed into her golf blatantly parked on the doubleyellows daddy being in the same lodge as the chief superintendent and wafted imperiously off down magdalene street bitch he saw two blokes unloading the lights for the christmas tree in front of the bank some bloody christmas this was going to be whats that sam didnt say a word paul oh right thought you didnt paul young mr tact went back to his work he didnt like charlotte sam could tell he guessed the kid was still a bit scared of highoctane women not realising they could be just as halfbaked under the gloss charlotte eh like what a snotty cow all the advertising she could have pointed the avalonians way what with working for stan pike and daddy being chairman of the chamber of trade and all this crap she could even have put the arm on pike to give the avalonian the allclear to his mates it is not a hippy rag sam had insisted how many times i got to spell it out its a genuine solid publication with diane ffitch charlotte had replied just now diane ffitch you call being edited by that fruitcake solid all right stuff it then sam had snarled we dont need pike bloody backstreet usedhouse dealer charlotte bloody charlotte eh things had been very much on the blink since hed made that minor scene at the glastonbury first gig over the old man and archer ffitch time to call it a day three years though three years of storms and upsets and sexy makingup sessions three years of political arguments and being produced as charlottes bit of rough at too many posh parties naturally shed backed him all the way in starting up the printshop becoming a local businessman like daddy like stanlow pike when sam became a businessman charlotte started circling dates on the calendar for the engagement party cracked it at last brought the anarchist to heel charlotte had got sam the contract for printing all pike and corners property brochures which was a major deal the major deal until juanita carey had come up with the idea for the avalonian which little charlotte of course didnt like the sound of at all from the outset sam lit a cigarette another thing about charlotte was the way she nagged him about his smoking like he was already her property and she was making sure he came with a full warranty how could a woman of twentysix come over so bloody middleaged nil prospect of her moving into the flat without something official on paper signed in triplicate twice theyd almost wound it up trouble was she looked so seriously edible waiting for him by the market cross parked on a double yellow could he really stand to see her hanging out for some slimy accountant with a bmw difficult one that he brightened when he saw diane crossing the road by the christmas tree she hadnt been in all morning and after what paul had said about her painting the van in the dark hed kept thinking maybe he should take a walk up to the shop check her out just that he didnt feel he knew her well enough to ask why she was behaving like a fruitcake she didnt come in she didnt even glance at the shop just walked past like a bloody zombie people getting out of her way sam watched her cross magdalene street and head straight for the abbey gatehouse she didnt go in there either she turned her back on it fell against the wall like a drunk trying to stay upright what the sam was up and out of the door not giving himself time to think diane when he ran across the road a truck driver braking and blasting his horn she looked unseeing in sams direction he could see that she was shivering uncontrollably like a longterm junkie run out of smack shit the girl was ill you all right something happened oh diane looked up vaguely sam whats wrong a few people staring at them now but not many because this was glastonbury and there wasnt much they hadnt seen in these streets only lady loony he heard one woman with a kid and a shopping bag say knowingly to another and they both laughed and sam wanted to kick their bloody arses halfway to benedict street diane face slightly blue was staring vacantly across the road to where the two guys were untangling the christmas tree lights sam took her arm come on come for a hot chocolate diane easing her away from the wall catch your death darryl davey came past with a couple of mates nudging each other and smirking dont you say a fucking word sunshine sam snarled darryl narrowed his eyes and gave him the finger tosser you see and this is strictly off the record the bishop of bath and wells lit a thin rollup some of my predecessors have been frankly embarrassed at having glastonbury in the diocese the bishop was a compact man in his early forties he wore cord trousers and a purple denim shirt his white clerical band under the buttondown collar powys wondered if he always rolled his own cigarettes or just wanted to appear cool for the local radical rag point being joe the church of england might have owned the abbey for most of the century but the ambience remains rc and i imagine many people still regard us being the landlords as the final insult even if we have tidied the place up stopped it being treated as a convenient stone quarry for local builders but the catholics arent the problem right now are they powys said youve got what we might call an older denomination to contend with pagans the bishop laughed be so much easier if the buggers still wore horns and bones through their noses but theyre quite likely to be academics in suits he nodded towards the window could be a few hanging around the cathedral as we speak but he didnt seem to regard this as much of a threat they were in wells a very small city a short drive from glastonbury at a window table in a pub facing the cathedral the bishop drank perrier his name was liam kelly he didnt sound even vaguely irish but you see joe are they really pagans what you have today as we approach the millennium is a great yearning for spirituality we the human race have been everywhere and realised what a terribly small place the earth is how finite are its resources a microcassette machine lay on the table between them the bishop pulled it a little closer even been to the moon and what a dreadful anticlimax that was so more people are realising theres only one real voyage of discovery left to them and that is inwards its a very promising situation you think so you dont the bishop seemed to see powys for the first time to wonder who he was powys hadnt mentioned his proposed book diane had arranged the interview which presumably was why the bishop had agreed to do it he hadnt been here long enough to risk offending the house of pennard how was he to know how things stood between diane and her immediate family powys said you dont think inner trips can be a little risky for some people are we on or off the record whatever you like powys stopped the tape look i dont know precisely what kind of magazine this is ah joe but if you can somehow get over the message that i dont regard my visit to glastonbury next thursday as any kind of crusade or the pagan element as the enemy i like to believe that were all working towards the same goal if for instance some women like to regard the divinity as having a distinct feminine aspect how can i legitimately argue against that the battle for the ordination of women has been fought and won and its a victory i applaud not answering the question didnt seem to realise either that the avalonian didnt yet exist and would hardly be on the streets in time to get over any message about thursday goddess worshippers powys said youll be meeting them on thursday as i say which is simply the shortest day as far as were concerned to them its christmas without the christ as yet god is that the time already sorry about this but i do have to be in bath for lunch oh powys realised the solstice thursdays the winter solstice wont the pagans be having their whatever they do the bishop stood up i dont know what they normally do but on thursday before exchanging opinions about the future of glastonbury we shall go together at dawn to st michaels chapel where i shall conduct a small service with carols which followers of the ah nature religion will find not incompatible the holly and the ivy this sort of thing st michaels chapel look im sorry im not too familiar with the geography but thats part of the abbey is it no no the bishop finished his perrier its the one on the tor powys pocketed his tape machine let me get this right youre going to the top of glastonbury tor with a bunch of pagans on the winter solstice doesnt it bother you if you believe bishop kelly laughed and shook his head the winter solstice as i say is merely the shortest day the pagans if we have to use that term will be represented by dame wanda carlisle who ive already met socially and who is in all other respects a delightful person and the tor is ah just a hill powys couldnt believe this indeed said the bishop just a hill so what are your feelings about this plan to restrict public access the bishop smiled good talking to you joe hope to see you up there diane went over to sit in her usual red typists chair she looked pale as watered milk go on sam turned on an extra bar of the electric fire and moved to the corner where paul kept the tea and coffee and dianes chocolate everything washed and neatly arranged what did the slimy bastard want me for christmas said diane dolefully at bowermead they have a gathering most years and the awful boxing day hunts been revived so has it now well well going are we bowermead for christmas gosh no i might never get out again they still have sort of dungeons underneath anyway juanita might be out of hospital by christmas shell need a lot of help right said sam right soya cream in your chocolate perhaps not sam good job were clean out of soya cream sony does anything ever you know ever happen to you the way it does to some people quite a a bigger percentage of people than normal i suppose in glastonbury boxing day hunt he was thinking got to have a go at this one especially after that mp elect bollocks make christmas worthwhile for once ring hughie get some of the old crew in from bristol sorry diane god but she looked tired wanted looking after this kid diane watched him unblinking i was saying did you ever have did anything ever happen to you that that you couldnt explain like oh theres a whole lot of stuff i cant explain sam dumped two spoonfuls of drinking chocolate into a mug why folks will cheat and lie for a few quid that isnt gonner make them happy why its always the best people who wind up dead before their time why otherwise humane civilised folksll go out and make little animals run till they cant run no more and then watch em get ripped apart i dont include your old man in this mind i can understand why he does it its because hes soulless and pigthick he pulled a cigarette out of the packet sorry shouldnt talk like that he is your dad diane shrugged she had her hands clasped between her knees every few moments her shoulders would shake like she was fighting off flu i know what youre asking sam wanted to put his arms around her if he could get them all the way round im just avoiding the question not the time to come on with the arms probably never would be after he said what he had to say shit should have realised hed have to deal with this at some point shouldve been prepared course if he hadnt grown to like her so much as a person it wouldnt have been a problem in fact he usually got quite a buzz out of laying it on people in this headcase town the people whod looked at him with his tangled shoulderlength hair and his bit of an earring and made certain assumptions which were way way out both of them veggies too they agreed totally about animal rights although diane was a bit more discreet about it than sam was didnt seem to feel quite the same urge to go and beat the living shit out of a huntsman and ok she had this incomprehensible appetite for these totally disgusting carobcovered cereal bars beyond this it got more difficult look at me diane shook again ive been like this all morning couldnt open the shop you seen a doctor diane smiled thinly not anything a doctor could deal with ive spent most of the morning sitting in front of the fire trying to deal with it archer sam a sort of blind hatred comes over me fair enough and when it does things start to happen awfully strange things in the room or wherever i am sometimes i can almost see it see my own rage i suppose its always been there he just touches something in me and sets it off seems a perfectly normal reaction to me we are talking about archer ffitch here when i was a child i got a sort of perverse comfort from it i would hug it to me my hatred hug it to me like a dog i think its it happened during the glastonbury first meeting when he unveiled his plans for the tor it was as if the tor knew what he was planning and hated him for it and all that hatred is coming into me ah said sam wishing he was out of here right and thats why the tors been coming through to me since i was a baby the tor knew what was going to happen as we approached the millennium it was all preordained why violet dion fortune was chosen to be my spirit guide because i have to stop them destroying the tor diane they dont wanner destroy the tor they just wanner restrict its the same thing rage dancing in dianes eyes the tor the road scheme its all antispiritual you ask woolly woolly was in the shop this morning talking you know endof the world scenario what happens in glastonbury affects the spiritual life of the entire nation this is the cradle diane if woolly runs out of dope its an endoftheworld scenario sam handed her the mug drink your chocolate dammit most situations you could work with people for years and they never needed to know where you stood on the big issues which way you voted etc sam took a big breath pulled on a handful of his long hair looked at diane and kept seeing rufus the fox cub the thing is ive got a big problem with all this look im like coming from a different direction right like far as i can make out you believe in just about the whole bit ufos god ghosts the holy grail you have a way diane lowered her eyes of making it all sound frightfully tawdry whereas i im like how can i put this an atheist sam said diane looked up and sought his eyes this time it was sam who looked away from what seemed a long distance he heard diane whispering you dont believe in anything i believe in looking after the planet and you know each other and not being cruel to animals or even people most of them you dont even believe in the possibility of anything i believe in cleaning up your own mess i believe in being kind but as for you know diane said very faintly the otherworldly if you like i think quite honestly i think its all bollocks the grail the holy bloody thorn the abbeyvery pretty look but its all bollocks in glastonbury he thought you were allowed to be a christian a pagan a buddhist a hindu a muslim and maybe at a pinch a liberal kind of agnostic anything but where im coming from sam said this is a town built on bollocks big big patch of quiet then diane just said oh and for that moment and maybe the one after it sam daniel wished he did believe in the resurrection of the body and the forgiveness of sins and the shroud of turin and the holy virgin of knock and the men in silver suits the whole bloody shebang diane was sitting there looking down at her clasped hands she hadnt touched her chocolate it occurred to sam for the first time seeing her half in shadow eyes downcast that she was actually kind of beautiful diane stood up id better go no dont go i could have second thoughts yeah he said ok then at the door he said its coming along really well diane the avalonian if this was for real i reckon we could have it on the streets before christmas diane said very quietly its all for real everythings part of everything else and its all for real six small things juanita sat in the bedside chair and stared at her hands until her vision went blurred there said karen the nurse isnt medical science wonderful she was too upset to reply every time they unwrapped the dressings the hands seemed to look more alien the transplants in her palms the revolting pink of an oldfashioned condom and shockingly clean devoid of lines at first theyd looked like the hands of an excavated corpse which someone had joined to her wrists frankenstein hands now they were claws shed shrieked at the doctor i cant move them oh christ i cant bend the fingers the doctor said theyd become more flexible in time and the pink would fade in time as would the pain oh sure she knew she was lucky knew it could have been so much worse if she hadnt covered her face if she hadnt been wearing the afghan and just for a moment shed imagined how it would have been the other way round if shed died in flames and jim had been left with hands which wouldnt hold a paintbrush wouldnt paint with any delicacy perhaps ever again jim gazing into his beloved dusk and watching it recede about to cry juanita sat up in the chair think angry what beautiful hands you have juanita take it easy now said karen shed come on duty at four as usual juanitas hands had been unwrapped since ten shed got dressed for the occasion in the offtheshoulder lemon top which jim liked so much and a long aztecpatterned cotton skirt which lay easy on her flayed thighs juanita looked up into the small face full of professional interest a couple of times theyd sent a trauma counsellor to see her at least shed claimed to be a trauma counsellor her questions reflecting a certain concern for juanitas mentalhealth after all what kind of normal person would hurl herself at the blazing flaking corpse of even a close friend she said to karen did you find out anything about ruth dunn karen looked even more anxious then her face went blank talk about it later come on karen what did you find out wheres she now juanita this woman glastonbury not in a hospital no private clinic nothing like that thank christ for that jesus karen ill see you later sisterll be on my back well have a chat juanita glowered at the uniformed back a hospital was like a police state she thought about discharging herself walking down to the motorway intersection holding up her weird hands to thumb a lift frighten the lorry drivers then she sank back into the hard chair and wept san paced the office he had to do something couldnt just sit around like a spare prick sod it he snatched up the phone and rang hughie painter central somersets most experienced huntsaboteur mastersab they called hughie once jailed for three months after trying to ram a hunting horn down the throat of some pompous bloody master of foxhounds a hero a legend in sabbing circles when you talked to hughie on the phone you kept it short and careful half an hour right under the christmas tree well be like anonymous figures in the crowd sam laughed ok see you about the only thing he could do for diane was spoil archer ffitchs boxing day she couldnt bring herself to go back to the shop she walked right past some people gave her sidelong glances she knew she probably looked pretty awful shed never felt so isolated there wasnt anyone she could trust how could how could anyone live in glastonbury and not believe in anything how could you be like sam a good person who cared about people and animals and the welfare of the planet and not believe that it all existed for some purpose how could you live in glastonbury and not feel closer actually she didnt feel close to anything she felt used the candyfloss sunbeams rolling down the tor and the icecream lights at night giving way to fragmented images sharp and threatening as slivers of glass to the dark vaporous forms which passed as fast as birds to the black portentous symbols you could only wish youd never seen all nonsense to sam all bollocks she didnt know whether to pity him or envy him his freedom what he thought of her this mattered more sam daniel thought diane ffitch was a loony it didnt matter that most people had thought this for years were thinking it now as they watched her trooping up the street like a fat scarecrow it suddenly mattered awfully that sam now thought it too it wounded her it was terribly unfair there was a funny atmosphere in the town again the shapes of the buildings sharp against a cold grim sky everything so vivid a thunderstorm air of energyinwaiting she wished she could drive away for a while and think but she hadnt even had the nerve to collect the van from the garage and of course that started her thinking about archer again that parting shot he knew about the graffiti on the van he might even have told them to do it he was taunting her why did he always have to do that she wandered inevitably up wellhouse lane past the trees which screened chalice orchard where df had lived probably fooling herself over that as well what would the legendary high priestess of isis want with someone like her there was an unhealthy engine noise behind her then an ancient landrover clattered alongside lookin for me miss diane oh gosh moulder forgotten all about this mornings phone message hop in my chicken another sitemeeting more disillusionment under discussion this afternoon had been a griff daniel proposal for a new housing estate out on the meare road green field site daniels plan an executive housing estate four bedroom luxury homes two bathrooms with bidets and and this as far as woolly was concerned was the worst of it double garages double bloody garages a double garage said this it said you were expected to have two cars and maybe a third and fourth in the driveway far your teenage kids woolly had tried to explain to his colleagues on the planning subcommittee that the only way to avoid gridlock somerset by the year was to start building homes with single garages or even no bloody garages at all and did they listen his council colleagues they looked at him in his red and yellow bobcap and his pink jeans and then they looked at each other and they smiled in that hes from glastonbury kind of way except for griff daniel at the meeting in his capacity as developer whod looked at woolly like he hoped hed die of something painful in the not too distant future afterwards woolly had gone to a pub out past wells for a bite of lunch with fred harris the elderly wedmore councillor fred trying to talk a bit of sense into him be pragmatic fred said your time will come ho ho his time wouldnt come until they had a new age party with about a dozen likeminded members if you could find twelve likeminded new agers and a sympathetic central government which was about as likely as a mothership from alpha centauri coming down to a civic reception on glastonbury tor on the way back to the poor beleaguered isle of avalon he shoved julian copes autogeddon into the cassette deck you and me jules you and me ah but nobody took julian cope seriously either possibly on account of him being the only rock star left who dressed like woolly hed go and see diane again shook him up that did bloody archer ffitch strolling in just as he was about to lay it on diane about what the new road would do to the st michael line coincidence or what ok karen said no names and you didnt get this from me all right juanita nodded her mouth felt very dry she needed to hear this but didnt want to she composed herself crossing her hands lightly with these hands you had to do everything lightly in her lap in the vinyl bedside armchair karen sat down on the bed geriatric ward all right im not saying where this is what ive been told that situation ive been there i know how easy it is to become impatient when youre on your own at night and half of them are incontinent a saint would blow some nights she isnt juanita said a saint i was just saying that i just need to know before i go any further that shes not any kind of friend of yours i mistrust her i think shes a dangerous megalomaniac a bad person to be around ok all right karen lowered her voice well this goes back twentyodd years its small things hard to prove publicly fitting catheters to old men who dont need them putting bedpans just out of reach of the disabled ones and then not cleaning them up and leaving the bedding unchanged for hours telling them stuff their relatives have said about them never coming home again and renting out their rooms when they havent said anything of the sort stealing their sweets taking away pictures of their grandchildren in the night telling them that theres like no god that this is where it ends except for those who are condemned to walk the ward as you know as spirits take it from me geriatrics are like little kids theyll believe what you tell them jesus those are small things came to a head when dunn left a dead woman on the ward all night unscreened karen slid a robe around juanitas bare shoulders the warmth helped go on juanita said she took the anglepoise lamp from the nurses table and placed it on the dead womans bedside table so that it was lighting up the corpses face not a peaceful face you know lit up for them all to see all these old people all night how do you know this because a doctor came in unexpectedly and she was reported she was sacked after that and blacklisted the doctor did a good job got a few signed statements although the girls were pretty intimidated god i only had to mention the name ruth dunn to jane who came to us from oxford anyway sister dunn worked in another general hospital as far as they know the next they heard of her she was a matron at a public school where dunno but some of these fancy schools they like a sadist dont they just stay well away from that woman my advice i better go juanita ill be getting hauled over the coals hang on could i talk to this jane what about the doctor who reported i shouldnt have told you her name leave her alone juanita janes jittery enough at the best of times what about the doctor karen rose to her feet expressionless they say the doctors died thats all i know you take care juanita puttering into magdalene street in his old but catalytically converted renault six woolly spotted the coloured lights of the christmas tree he liked coloured lights and he liked christmas trees he wondered what it would be like if you could only see the tree lights instead of headlights if the only sounds you could hear were like carolsinging and stuff not the rumble of this twenty ton truck coming up behind carrying godknowswhat to godknowswhere all freight this size should be made to go by rail was woollys view fred harris the wedmore councillor who was a bit green around the edges bless him had patted him on the back as they straggled off daniels site never mind old son worldll catch up with you one day look fred always said that to woolly be dead by then woolly thought as he drove down to where all the streets converged on the tree he wondered why his cassette player had suddenly cut out forget it my advice hughie painter pulled sam out the doorway of the crown hotel and up into high street towards the natwest bank and the george and pilgrims jeez was this your brilliant idea to come here cant hear yourself flaming talk the kazoo band was doing a syncopated o little town of bethlehem kids singing along a bunch of young drunks dancing in the street look come on sam hadnt been expecting this not from mastersab they havent done that hunt for three years at least not on boxing day too expensive look too many people to entertain too many huntfollowers but now pennards pushing the boat out again for some reason and youre saying im saying leave it we got more important stuff to worry about no chance hughie im gonner ruin that bastards christmas hughie pulled him up hard against the ancient walls of the george and pilgrims and bawled into his ear and how did you find out about it eh sammy not been widely advertised am i right yeh i know what youre thinking she let it slip out by accident ok haw you been set up boy hughie roared he was about ten years older than sam grey in his beard but sam wasnt about to be humiliated hughie this is straight up sam was shouting too now and the words were coming very fast she dont even speak to the old man its a dysfunctional family leastways dianes not functioning in it i figured what if we were to make a bit of a recce maybe then we could have a meeting draw up a ground plan get it dead right fuck these bastards good he spotted his old man swaggering down the street with quentin cotton both of them wearing big shit eating grins and enamel lapel badges with that picture of the tor and a white noentry sign slashed across it sam wanted to leap out at the bastards start a nice public barney but hughie held him back whats got into you boy whats got into me shit listen hughie yelled the big issue right now has got to be the new road right the big wildlife issue its not just trees and fields its badger sets the lot wholesale devastation word is well have bulldozers in by the end of january so so naturally we got to have the manpower ready like not on bail well sure i appreciate that but this is they could start anytime sammy could be starting now for all i know some civil servant never been west of basingstoke gives the word out go two damn big nasty blokes with chainsaws private contractors thats the way they work it now times money evil buggers whole armies of security guards yeah well pennards in full support of the road archer certainly is we could like work the wider message in somehow while disrupting their hunt hughie painter shook his head in disgust this is not so much the hunt you wanner target this is pennard himself right whats this sudden thing you got about that bugger something to prove maybe bollocks sam felt himself going red so whats the angle here hughie grinned afraid well all think you sold out going into this magazine thing with big di piss off sam wanted to hit him half aware of how ridiculous this was because big hughie was a really gentle guy nobody ever got into a row with hughie he walked away into a soup of swirling street noise carolsinging laughter whoops and cheers he saw traders in the doorways of their shops some of which seemed to have reopened lots of children of all ages there was a roaring in his ears he looked up at the tree saw coloured lights floating down like snowflakes what bloody thing woolly shouted sheesh nothing works for weeks together these days and it was because he was fiddling with his stereo worrying about the tape snapping and getting all chewed up in the mechanism that he didnt notice it until it was almost on him oh shit sweat seemed to spring out of the wheel it was like hed suddenly woken up lights all around him the big truck behind people waiting to cross and this bus rumbling in a leisurely rickety way down the wrong side of the road the driver grinning or maybe the bus itself was grinning its radiator grille hanging open between the bleary headlights woolly hit the brakes hammered his foot into the pedal wrenching at the wheel lurching inside his seatbelt and feeling the renault spinning side on into the middle of the road and the bloody big lorry behind gasp of airbrakes screech and a groundwobbling rumble like an entire block of flats collapsing blur of rights a coloured blizzard woolly sat for a long isolated moment noticing how bonechilling cold it was in his car and that his throat was ashdry only vaguely aware of the screaming all around him whoops of terror and pain that didnt stop not even when he was struggling to open his door through the christmas branches seven lady loony councillor crackpot diane stared up at the cross did you make it yourself what a blindingly stupid question it was an abandoned telegraph pole with a fence post crudely nailed across it come away now don moulder said i dont hang around here after dark no more he led her out of the bottom field up towards the farmhouse it was nearly dark the cold bit through her sweater the tor looked remote dogs wont go down there nmore don said night or day what dyou say to that miss diane nothing she said nothing maybe you dont believe me don pushed into the farmhouse kitchen kicked off his wellies wifes wi night hed told diane in the land rover they could talk freely thought it anyoned believe me itd be you because of my reputation as a loony the kitchen was unmodernised pale green cupboards with ventilation holes in the doors and a big bright fire in the range don moulder waved her to a chair sat down opposite did i say that nobody ever has to im a frightened man miss diane two years ago i dcome to jesus for protection all the weirdies round here the evil heathen things i seen when i looks across at that thing that hill can you tell me about it now exactly what you saw he wouldnt talk much about it when they were down in the bottom field he was genuinely afraid she was remembering the night of the fire the way hed kept talking about the black buzz i thought it was a oneoff thing he said now somethin theyd kind of left behind em like most of em leaves ole rubbish this lot leaves well all the drugs they takes maybe something in the air i dont know i dont twas just a small hope but i makes the cross i prays to the lord to bless the field and i tries not to think about it but then the dogs the dogs wont go in there look not even in broad daylight the dogs slink off they can sense evil dogs can then where are we now not last night the night before im doin the rounds padlockin the sheds when it comes again he leaned close to her across the scuffed formica top table engine noise lord above it went through me like a bandsaw i could smell it the fumes of oil i could no moreve gone down that field than dug my own grave so you tell me miss diane what was they at what was those scruffy

radiator on i remember thinkin that aye it stuck in my mind and thats what i seen what they done miss diane what they done in that buzz to taint my land oh gosh the fire was so warm she was so tired all her caution dropped away they nothing happened in it while it was here not while i was here anyway but later i think it was found oh look it was the one they found at stoke st michael the one with the body in it don moulder sat up stiff by golly i dremember readin bout that i never thought by the howd he die i dont know he stood up began rapidly to pace the kitchen whys he come here whys he

live with that knowing its out there black evil im afeared to set foot outside that door when its dark case i hears it again chunner chunner chunner howm i gonner do my lambin now these things it wont harm you mr moulder but terror was contagious diane bit her lip wont it wont it miss that cross dont keep it off what kind of evil defies the christ i dont know i dont know the cold blue flashing lights the hysteria of ambulances the stolid red hulk of a fire engine steam rising figures were in motion in the halflight fluorescent paramedics with stretchers and oxygen equipment and out of the murky stew of noise moans and yells a baby crying and the escalating whirring whining keening of a saw attacking metal there was a woman wailing const ance the name caught in sams head he heard it again in the squealing of the saw reaching a frenzy and the rending of metal before two firemen backed into view with most of a lorry door held between them trampling sawnoff christmas tree branches into the tarmac naaaaaaaaaaaaw echoing across the marketplace like some old streettraders cry a womans shredded shriek close to sam a man was being eased out of a metal cave like a snail from its shell squirming into vicious life when his boots touched the ground was that little tosser jabbing a finger slams on and just fucking a pool of newly spilled oil shimmering like smoked glass with beacon blue light a police boot slapping into the pool get back get back please a stretcher shape coming through red blankets paramedics as the policeman pushed him back sam saw the lorry skewed across the road the new christmas tree snapped like a matchstick the lorrys crushedin cab garlanded with branches and little coloured lights red and yellow and green and white the cab was crushed because behind the tree had been the great rigid finger of the market cross theyd had to cut away the side of the cab to get the driver out and he was snarling in selfdefence didnt have no choice mate that fucking lunatic come on now back a policeman snapped its not a flaming funfair everybody back the first ambulance squealing away revealing a small muddied maroon car in the centre of the road a sticker on its rear side window resist road rape the car was a renault six sam stared at it in horror and disbelief ask him ask that little bastard the lorry driver yelled and there was woolly standing in the middle of the road blood on his fingers one sleeve torn away and bloody skin peeling from his wrist like curled shavings from planed wood and he was weeping oh jesus his face ragged it shit its im going outer my fucking head man you hear that officer ronnie wilton the butcher normally a jovial bugger amid the blood and offal his face bulging and twisting now hes admitted it you take that down ill be a witness look another one who hadnt voted for woolly yes thank you sir now if youd just one of the policemen wore glasses twin ice blue beacons strobing in the lenses concealing expressions feelings mr woolaston you better go in the ambulance no im not taking up ambulance space woollys agonised face was frozen by a flashgun some press photographer dodging in front and then there was an awful sound all the worse because in other circumstances you might have thought it was a howl of glee as a ball of crashed and bloodied metal was handed through the despoiled jungle of the great festive tree oh chrrrrrist woollys hands covered his face sam saw that the metal ball handed from fireman to fireman was the crushed remains of a babys pushchair iridescent mesmeric with rage it looked like bad move he thought wrong night he would have turned round and left quietly but shed seen him powys had started having second thoughts about this as soon as he was inside the hospital if she wouldnt have visitors except for diane wouldnt even talk to dan frayne on the phone it youre another one come to talk me out of it you can sod off now said mrs juanita carey acid in her voice powys said nothing just gave her a smile the session with the rt rev liam kelly had left him disturbed and dismayed that anyone who thought glastonbury tor was just a hill could get to be bishop of bath and wells wonderful material obviously for a book hed be there at dawn on thursday no question fascinating stuff fascinating for an author fascinating if you were outside looking in if you didnt let your viewpoint become cluttered by something plump and vulnerable all the stuff diane had told him about dion fortune pixhill and the dark chalice was still washing restlessly around his head hed wound up in bristol because to get a handle on whatever was happening or whatever diane imagined was happening he needed to talk to someone who wasnt diane someone who knew the score but was temporarily apart from the game also face it he was very curious to meet juanita carey and after what had happened to her van there was a fairly good chance diane would not be here tonight you a friend of hers the nurse in the burns unit had asked him not waiting for an answer do you think it might be possible to talk a bit of sense into her oh mrs carey glared at him she was fully dressed which was a slight surprise long skirt full of exotic colours low cut sunny lemon top bright orange moccasins copious dark hair down below her shoulders skin aglow iridescent the bed between them her eyes like distant warning lanterns he became aware of the way her arms were hanging unnaturally away from her like the arms of a dress shop mannequin plugged in at the shoulders the wrong way round the hands frozen like a mannequins but not with that fashioned abandon they were both curled arthritically and as colourful in their way as the skirt um joe powys he said dan frayne sent me the awful energy something like this generated the town would be alive with it all night the sick mythology was already taking shape sam had heard one teenage girl telling another that the baby had been taken away in two shoeboxes i cant believe it hughie painter said not the most original remark tonight its just couldve been one of mine you know not very original either sam watched two coppers taking measurements and photos the container lorry car parts for swindon had been pulled out of the market cross monument council blokes checking out the stonework in case it was in danger of collapse think hell be charged woolly i dunno hughie was still looking quite white can you be done for slamming on your brakes without warning maybe if half these people had their way the poor little buggerd be hanged he didnt help himself hughie said severely you heard what he said when he got out of his car i didnt hear it i was told every buggers probably been told by now so with woollys past everybody naturally assumes he was doped up to the eyeballs thisll finish him hughie whos gonner vote for him now good news for your old man yeah good news for glastonbury first all round once the weepings over aye well hughie sniffed im off home now sammy going to count my kids sam nodded and walked into the road singlelane traffic going through sluggishly now counting his kids a lot of mums and dads would be doing that tonight even alternative mums and dads with a shelf full of meditation tapes and a cannabis plant in the greenhouse why did he think that even hughie painter father of three might well think twice about voting for woolly again the fucking irony of it though the great antitraffic evangelist slamming on in the middle of the rush hour for a bus that nobody else managed to see just swerving out into the centre of the road the driver of the lorry behind him pulling the other way to avoid smashing into the back of woolly and the lorry going out of control and crunching through the christmas tree the people and the pram smack into the side of the market cross neither of them couldve been going very fast not in the town centre in the rush hour but they didnt have to be const ance ah jesus was he going to hear that every time he walked past here like the shriek was imprinted on the fabric of the street constance morgan four months old hardly aware she had a life before it was gone her mother now in danger of losing a leg was kirsty morgan nee cotton daughter of quentin cotton so the chairman of glastonbury first loses his grandchild gets his only daughter crippled in an accident caused by i cant believe this sam hissed scuse me squire would you mind a bloke wanted to set up a black tripod sam moved back thinking it was a police photographer until the bloke slid a big video camera into the top of the tripod and a white light came on revealing a woman in a sheepskin coat very short blonde hair tammy white from bbc bristol with a big boom microphone in a furry cover what about we do it here rob tammy white said can you get the lorry in yeah if the two of you come out a bit thats fine thatll do sam stepped into the doorway of the crown hotel as the camera light shone bright as day on the face of archer ffitch sorry to put you on the spot like this tammy white said in a low noninterviewing voice theyll only use about half a minute but i need to cover myself is that all right anything you require tammy archer said smoothly its a pretty difficult situation for me but youve got your job to do im recording the cameraman said in your own time tammy tammy white straightened up held the microphone between her and archer just above waist level mr ffitch this is obviously a terrible thing to happen particularly in the week before christmas what are your feelings archer said it is the most appalling tragedy people children gathering for this joyful occasion the lighting of the christmas tree my heart goes out to the family and you saw what happened i was returning from the station when we were held up it had happened only minutes before and there was tremendous chaos the driver was trapped in his cab the poor mother was semi conscious and i dont think anyone realised at that stage that there was a pram underneath archers voice faltered sam saw his jaw quiver sams fists clenched tammy white said now youre one of the supporters of the plan for a central somerset relief road which many people are objecting to tammy archer held up a restraining hand this is not the time to make political capital i realise that many local people will be saying that if such a road existed commercial traffic of this size would not be passing through glastonbury personally i would rather not comment at this stage especially as the leader of the campaign against this road is tonight being questioned by police in connection with the incident this is the second death in just over a month connected with traffic congestion in the town the other involved a fire which emergency services couldnt reach because of new age travellers vehicles on the approach road to glastonbury tor youve initiated a campaign to limit access to the tor do you think thats a related issue tammy made a face at the clumsiness of her question but archer was straight in there i think what both these tragedies are telling us is that this is a town which has been getting seriously out of control i think we have to calm down consider whether we believe glastonbury has been going in the right direction and then take steps to ensure the town is run for and by normal decent lawabiding people meaning avalon out woolaston out sam felt like rushing out there making a scene giving them some real footage for their programme thank you tammy nodded to the cameraman to wind up got all you wanted archer asked obligingly as the camera light went out fine unless youve got any views about the bishops meet the pagans mission on thursday silly man archer said off the record of course also off the record murmured tammy the word is that not every member of your family a backing your tor scheme archer smiled diane just talk as yet look strictly off the record archer said awkwardly weve all been terribly worried about diane whos in a particularly delicate state you remember she was at that awful fire plus shes been working nonstop on this ah hippy magazine thing from early in the morning until late at night must be a problem for you tammy said ambiguously oh lord yes archers expression was no longer visible shes given us a few headaches in her time you must have heard about all that tammy well you know god knows we help her all we can try to help her ha ha sam was so blind furious he could have smashed his fist into the wall the twofaced git so smooth so deft tossing his sister to the pack like a fox cub mad restless energy was pumping through sams body no way he could go home sit there with a can of lager and a sandwich and wait for the slimy turd to come up on the box no way he could go to any pub in this town tonight and listen to the gloating gossip about how councillor crackpot had helped kill an innocent little baby archer and tammy and the cameraman were moving away really very good of you to talk to us at a time like this mr ffitch archer please probably be seeing a good deal more of each other in the months to come do you and your colleague have time for a drink sam watched them walk away from the mess of magdalene street wanted to scream at archers broad dark back like a hooligan no good he decided to go alone to bowermead hall climb a few fences jump a few streams figure out how to sabotage the forthcoming pennard hunt eight scorched earth the case was very light as though it contained nothing but discarded bandages and stale hospital air joe powys carried it out to the car outside she seemed to wilt her blue threequarterlength belted coat looked too big for her her gloves too small she shouldnt be wearing gloves at all according to the young doctor called george whod said to powys i hope you know what youre taking on mate because she couldnt use either of her hands powys had signed her out the little nurse called karen had said stonefaced i hope youre proud of yourself and george who had a halfgrown beard said this is very silly mrs carey trying to sound grownup youre going to have a lot of pain you know juanita had looked raw and frayed for reasons i cant discuss id be in a lot more mental anguish if i didnt get out can you get my case karen do i have a coat juanita does this have something to do with that woman sister dunn look karen please just leave it all right think of the extra bed sorry i really am grateful for everything youve done no longer iridescent juanita carey stood shivering in the hospital carpark looking at the filthy dented white mini and at the black and white dog with enormous ears and three legs um arnold powys said juanita instinctively put out a gloved hand to the dog then drew back its ok powys said he likes all women before he noticed that she was afraid of patting the dog because of her hands that she was afraid to touch anything stupid she said i had the physiotherapy but told the shrink to sod off youve got to deal with things yourself havent you is there somewhere i can get some cigarettes weil find somewhere he held open the passenger door for her watched her get in without using her hands holding them in front of her as if the gloves were borrowed and mustnt get dirty she fell back into the little bucket seat closed her eyes and breathed in they stopped at a newsagents and he bought her forty silk cut unwrapped a packet lit one for her sorry this is pathetic but i just feel so frail they tell you youre going to but you dont really expect it youre so looking forward to your first breath of real air and real smoke waiting to get into the traffic he was aware of her taking the cigarette from her lips trapping it not very effectively between the very tips of her fingers the next time he glanced at her she was shuddering breathing very fast can we stop im sorry he pulled into the side of the road to a chorus of hooting revvedup road rage from behind sorry she let him take the cigarette thanks i nearly dropped it this is ridiculous i just its on fire you know it never occurred to me before that they were on fire christ she exhaled i always thought if it ever came to this id get myself quietly put down powys said dan fraynes been worried about you good old danny she leaned her head back over the seat stared at the tear in the roof fabric your publisher now possibly you are the only one arent you i mean he hasnt persuaded a whole bunch of esoteric authors to come to the aid of the disabled bookseller im not going to find john michell redecorating the flat colin wilson hoovering the sitting room juanita sat up laughed and coughed god what am i going to do if half of mes screaming for a cigarette and the other halfs terrified to hold one dont forget to note this for your report im doing a report to dan hes sent you to find out how crazy ive become right why i tried to burn myself to death well no powys said the official brief is to find out how crazy glastonburys become glastonburys always been crazy he knows that he told her about the book frayne wanted them to cowrite she spent some time examining her gloves forget it she didnt look up hes just being kind you dont need me were i to write about glastonbury the way im feeling now itd read like either paradise lost or dantes inferno he doesnt want that he sent you because hes feeling a bit of residual guilt from a long time ago but hes afraid to come himself hes afraid to see you again he thinks it might destroy his marriage mr smooth mouth if he saw me now hed be booking the hotel for his golden wedding i dont think so um ive read your letters everything you ever wrote to dan frayne since about after a considered silence she said l may kill him for this she held up a gloved hand im not supposed to wear these theyre quite painful im supposed to let the air get at my hands how squeamish are you my dog has three legs powys said diane collapsed against the abbey gates closed as if god had shut his eyes she looked up at the charcoal sky through her tears how could you doesnt this town matter to you anymore across the street men with chainsaws were cutting the remains of the christmas tree into slices don moulder had driven her back into town until they came up against a traffic tailback and diversion signs diane had got out in the safeway car park where don could turn round hed been silent most of the way then as she was getting out hed said field i got next to the road i agreed to let em have it for car parking when the bishop comes to the tor on thursday i been thinkin maybe if i was to ask him the bishop to bless the bottom field sure to count for something a bishop diane had nodded dubiously anythings worth a try minutes later she was learning about the terrible accident from matthew banks the tall willowy herbalist loading apples and grapes and linda mccartney tv dinners into his cv this is awful matthew why did he stop like that cat run across the road or something oh something bigger than that matthew had said so big that nobody else saw it diane turned her back on the abbey edged around the police accident signs and the tapedoff area and walked down benedict street where woolly had his shop she had to tell him not that it would help him much credibility wise the good news somebody else believes you saw a black bus that wasnt there the bad news its lady loony you could see the big house now the lights just coming on winking through the strippedoff trees only it wasnt a friendly wink the lights were a baleful white in sam daniels view bowermead hall made dartmoor prison look like the house at pooh comer the moon had risen over the woods making it easier to see the footpath even when it got tangled so far he was legal not even trespassing although you wouldnt know that from the signs new signs aggressive signs with red lettering private land keep out security patrols all trespassers will be prosecuted sam knew all these public paths two or three years ago he and hughie had joined a protest with the ramblers association when gerry rankin had fenced off a rightofway with barbed wire theyd taken wirecutters to the fence and rankin couldnt say anything apart from ill remember your faces which was when hughie grew his beard there was plenty of new barbed wire now dense and high but there were ways rankin had to get in and out stay clear at the hall was the answer go for rankins farmhouse which was about five six hundred yards from the hall tucked into the bottom of a wooded hill the vineyards were the other side of it facing the town and glastonbury tor between the farmhouse and the entrance the vineyards sam saw what looked like new hunt kennels two long low sheds in a cobbled yard he thought about the possibilities maybe he could pull a stroke the night before like letting the hounds into the vineyards or presuming the meet was at the old bull like it used to be with stirrup cups and all this shit well that was over three miles away so theyd be using transport horse transporters dog wagons maybe he could find out tonight where theyd got the trucks then come up here very early boxing day morning and slash all the tyres wilful damage sammy hughies voice in his head theyll throw the book at you this time son you re known youve been warned conditional discharge conditional yeh also you just dont do this kind of stuff when youre angry thats how you get nicked oh i see you do it when youre feeling rather tolerant about blood sports my mistake sam stopped hallway over a rotting wooden stile bloody well talking to himself now you really are in a bad way now sammy you know what this is its what love does to you piss off dont be soft a dog barked in the kennels and then another damn once they started it would go on and on that was why it was normally best to do a recce in the daytime come the innocent rambler bit if anyone saw you except when they know your face sam detoured off the path and into the woods behind the new kennels he was on higher ground now and suddenly he could see the tor like an upturned paraffin funnel prodding the white moon the tor would do that suddenly come into view from nowhere if poor bloody woolly was here now hed be climbing to the top of the next hill to see if he could see the tower of stoke st michael church which was the next point on his beloved st michael line poor little sod hed probably be hounded out of town out of somerset in fact and then the old man would swagger back with a bloody huge majority thanks to glastonbury first which stood for traditional standards and road safety and getting rid of nutters sam kicked at a branch which turned out to be dead and rotten it shattered into a shower of sodden splinters and one lump flew into his face bastards everything collapsing everything diseased how could any silly bugger believe there was a god up there the full implications were only now becoming sickeningly clear the way the scum was rising back to the top the return of councillor griff man of the people and archer ffitch smarming his way into parliament the cool blatant way ffitch had planted the idea with the tv people that his little sister was a hopeless fruitcake and you mustnt hold her against him sam peered down the slope towards the bulk of a barn youd get a couple of horse boxes in there no problem if he got here before daybreak came round under cover of this wood he could do all the tyres before breakfast no way theyd get them all replaced in time not on boxing day hunt off piece of cake merry christmas mr fox so need to check for padlocks on the doors might need some cutters sammy going equipped for burglary is the charge coppers find you with bolt cutters youll go down for three months and when you come out nobody respectables going to give you any more work get off my back hughie sam was about to slide down the bank towards the big barn when he smelled something smoke burning well he wasnt daft if pennard was hosting a toppeoples barbecue over the next rise he wanted to know about it he scrambled back up the slope holding on to bushes torch in his pocket slowing up the nearer he got to the top trying not to breathe too loudly the hill was longer than it looked must have been two three hundred yards scrambling to the top he nearly toppled into empty air he dropped flat didnt move kept very quiet for two minutes the acrid smell everywhere now peered over the unexpectedly abrupt edge almost like a big slice had been taken out of the hill it had that was precisely what had happened you could make it out now a big wide trench jcb job what we got here then sammy no sign of flames no sounds not even an owl he was well out of sight of bowermead hall and presumably rankins farm he pulled a torch from his jacket pocket a maglite big beam snapped it on stared in disbelief shit on toast at first sam didnt understand used to be all woodland here lovely woods used to sneak in here as kids it was legendary for conkers giant horsechestnut trees also beech and sycamore and huge thick oaks now for as far as the torch beam would stretch it was a sea of stumps and fallen tree trunks whose branches and winter foliage had been cut off piled together and burned burned it was horrible a massacre when he switched off the torch he could detect glimmerings of red the damped down smouldering of bonfires i dont get it i dont get it hughie come on sammy wheres your brain gone its the road the sensitive glastonbury stretch of the bathtaunton fucking relief road its happening now here in secret sam felt like one ofthose poor bloody trees all the sap in him drying up everything crashing to earth around him this was some of the finest broadleaf woodland in somerset a wildlife paradise with badger sets and all kinds of birds and wild orchids scorched earth now he scrambled down stood in the deep wide trench flashed his torch from one side to the other it was massive surely twice as wide as a dual carriageway but then they had to allow for the banks the verges and the hard shoulder it made some sense when you thought about it if pennard had sold a chunk of his precious land for the road what he didnt want was a few hundred ecoguerrillas camping out on the site and living in the trees to prevent them being axed this was a preemptive strike he shone his torch ahead of him the beam faded out before the road did when he looked up he could see the tor again looking shadowy and majestic and dead straight ahead the full horror of the plan the awesome scale of it made him go cold hed never liked the idea but hed figured he could live with it not quite the stab to the heart it was to woolly and those guys but suddenly he wanted to cry aloud this was england ancient england he could hear the traffic already he could smell exhaust and diesel fumes see the articulated lorries and holiday coaches and the flash gits in their porsches all the men like archer ffitch all the women like charlotte the hounds began to howl in their kennels heard him maybe so what he was going to let this out what theyd done illegally no doubt and it would damage pennard and archer a whole lot more than just sabbing their hunt the howling went on it dawned on sam that this was no ordinary howling he began to feel uncomfortable exposed he moved away along the trench walking quickly along the ruts dodging the remains of bonfires the hounds going at it all the time like the wild hunt of bloody gwyn ap nudd it was creepy like moving through an open wound like he was stumbling into a bleak and ravaged future up on the banks exposed bare saplings were writhing and rattling unexpectedly he saw glastonbury tor again it was a shock it was so close and sheer like a castle the road aimed straight at it it couldnt be of course because the published plan showed the route giving the tor quite a wide berth it just looked like it the way this section was aligned like it would cut directly through the middle of the hill under the tower the howling stopped there was a great stillness an icy stillness sam had that feeling of being watched of someone rearing up behind him he spun round irritably and all the breath went out of him there was a man standing staring silently up at glastonbury tor an elderly straight backed man in an overcoat he held a pipe in his mouth sam smelled the tobacco just briefly the old mans face was pale and hazy and fibrous like soiled cottonwool there was a ridged scar under one eye least it wasnt pennard sam tried to laugh with relief tried to speak to the old guy but he couldnt find the breath the man turned very slowly to face him sam saw that he wore very long dark trousers so long that they covered up the shoes in fact he couldnt see where the trousers ended this was because the old man was hovering about six inches above the rutted track his rigid arm was pointing at the tor his jaw fell open revealing no teeth only a black void and his eyes were like white gas the old mans scream was silent unlike sams nine meaningless kind of violence it must have been halfway down benedict street where woolly lived and worked that diane got a bad feeling it said go back she stopped and frowned she seemed to spend most of her life responding to feelings waiting for signals and beacons on the horizon never seemed to think for herself never seemed to reason so she walked on this had after all been one of her favourite places in all the world ever such a little shop in a tiny square at the end of a short alley off benedict street and all it said over the door was woollys as a child of about eleven or twelve she used to persuade rankin to bring her into town to visit a friend he didnt of course know who the friend was shed spend hours watching woolly in his workshop in the back he was with a lady called maria then the business hadnt been going long and they were mostly working on specialist jobs recreating medieval string instruments for folk groups woolly was a fan of people like the incredible string band and amazing blondel who diane was a bit too young to remember but on their record sleeves they wore colourful medieval patchwork clothes and woolly said they came from a gentler time and she believed that it always sounded like a different dimension like middle earth everybody wearing floppy clothes and laughing a lot light as butterflies diane paused sure shed heard a footfall behind her but there was nobody it was unusually quiet as though the tragedy had made people want to lock their front doors and cling to their families it must be wonderful to have a family you cling to she stopped a shadow had flitted around a corner about a hundred yards away and vanished into the alley leading to woollys square and another one another shadow she saw them through a vague mist so much mist on the street these nights diane slipped into the doorway of a dry cleaners about seventy yards away from woollys alley just as there came one of those sounds that instinctively made you cringe the shattering of glass and then woolaston echoing from the square weve come for you woolaston get yourself out here you murdering little fucker a rolling local accent young diane dragged in a long trembling breath held herself close to the shop door more breaking glass but a blunter sound this time she pictured a boot hacking out the shards left at the edges of the window woollys shop had just the one window about the size of a livingroom window in a small terraced house it screened a little museum display of reproduction antique instruments usually a narrow eighteenthcentury spanish guitar and a tiny mandolin with lots of mother ofpearl and unless hed sold it at last one of woollys own inventions with a long neck and a terracotta sound box the size of a football there was cackling male laughter then a different voice mockofficial councillor woolaston silence oh gosh dont let him be in but where would he be where could he go tonight and not have to endure the stares and the righteous abuse councillor woolaston sir louder rougher a roar you better get into your best suit and your dinky little bobcap youve just been invited to a special meeting of the beatingtheshitoutofmangylittlehippies subcommittee and are you juanita said i doubt it i doubt he was capable by then the selfservice restaurant had a christmas tree and all the counter staff wore little santa hats it was quite crowded and juanita was feeling jittery holding her hands in front of her like pieces of cracked porcelain she sat down at a window table as far away from other people as possible she needed to find out very quickly whether jm powys was someone she could trust so if you arent his son then its probably in some way down to me some aspect of me comes down in the night rearranges the shelves untidies the room something in me that hates being a hasbeen recluse and would like to be a great and famous writer like his namesake something that wrecks the little refuge to force me to get my act together and dispatches you to glastonbury that was dan frayne and coincidence thats not very convincing mr powys im slightly horrified to hear myself say it but this is one of those cases where the paranormal explanation seems the more logical she watched him unwrap a straw and put it into his coffee thats the slippery slope mrs carey some things we are not meant to make sense of thats the cowards philosophy juanita said ok its been my philosophy too otherwise glastonbury buggers you up pixhills parting message ignore it at your peril glastonbury buggers you up and how did it bugger him up powys asked in the end he went out one cold morning in november and had a fatal coronary halfway up the tor they brought him back and hid him out on the dining table at meadwell where he lay for three days guarded by little verity his housekeeper that er that room according to legend was where the last abbot of glastonbury had his final meal before they strung him up on the tor on november which was of course the date pixhill died another coincidence for you feeling slightly foolish juanita sipped her coffee through the straw the first time shed done this in public mrs carey powys said i im not sure how to put this i seem to have walked into a a situation oh yes diane says its meant diane thinks everything is meant juanita said let me guess youre john cowper powys shes dion fortune and youve both been brought to glastonbury to help deal with something of apocalyptic magnitude powys stirred his tea so you think shes off her trolley juanita thought for a while watching the young waiters looking overworked underpaid and sullen in their santa hats no she said at last thereve been times when ive thought she was shall we say psychologically stretched a victim of her upbringing living a fantasy life of her own creation because real life at cold comfort hall was so bloody dire and restrictive i feel a bit ashamed of thinking that now now being in hospital you have a lot of time to think thats not always good i dont know maybe im just as screwed up as she is what do i do about these powys pulled over a plate with two chocolate muffins on it embarrassing juanita said cant pick it up powys in hospital they fed me like an animal in the zoo little karen was probably right i could be in deep trouble out here how about this powys presented a muffin in a napkin ill hold it while you take a bite or i could take a bite out of the other side at the same time and then everyone will think were soppy lovers and theyll be embarrassed juanita smiled theyd smashed the window with a brick and pulled out about five instruments the eighteenthcenturystyle guitar was clamped to the stomach of a stocky wideshouldered man who was standing in the middle of the street trying to prise heavy metal chords out of it another much younger person was banging on a shamanic drum with half a brick and bawling up at the window over the shop come on out woolly join the band you little piece of dogshit diane had recognised him at once it was wayne rankin eighteen years old the farm managers son who had kicked headlice in the face while he lay on the ground she had crept to the corner of the cobbled alley could see them clearly under a tin shaded exterior bulb she might be called on to identify them if they got away before the police came if woolly was inside he would surely have telephoned for help by now if he wasnt it was up to her all the other premises in the little square were lock up shops and there were no lights in the apartments or storerooms no one had come out either they hadnt heard the breaking glass and the shouting or they didnt want to get involved if thered still been a policeman back in the town centre she would have run to him as it was she would have to knock on someones door the half brick finally ruptured the parchment of the deepbodied stannic drum wayne rankin let it fall drew back his foot and sent the drum rolling down the cobbles like an empty barrel come on woolly the heavy man bellowed we wants a private consultation with our councillor look he gave up trying to find power chords on the little guitar swung the instrument round by the neck and shattered it against the wall diane cringed thats what were gonner do to you woolaston wayne rankin sang you gonner come out babykiller we know youre in there the big man had put on an american cop voice he pulled a beer can from his pocket and ripped at the ringpull woolaston wayne screeched you dont come out you piece of hippy shit were gonner have your door in he began to jump up and down on the soundbox of the guitar it was too much dianes eyes flooded they were making as much noise as they could and where was everybody she couldnt stand it turned away and walked blindly back up benedict street determined to beat furiously on the first door with a light behind it it was no use pretending everything would return to shambolic normality because it wouldnt colonel pixhill was right there was a growing darkness and an evil in this town which fed on division and extremism and prejudice the road scheme the glastonbury first which polarised people and led to tragedy and accusations and a really despicable meaningless kind of violence and and like a vision of the grail it came to diane then what she must do here in benedict street named after the little church which may or may not be the resting place of the bones of st benignus the hermit she saw her direction she had to write about it like pixhill had but in a far more immediate way she had to find the courage to throw journalistic balance to the winds and document it all and name names tell everyone about headlice and rankins involvement about the glastonbury first movement and how it existed to split the town in two the avalonian they would bring out the first edition for christmas late on christmas eve when thered be no other papers until after the holiday even if everyone rejected it and scorned it as lady loonys ravings even if sam refused to get it printed because it wasnt up to his professional standards even if juanita was frightfully angry and never spoke to her again because shed gone down the same sad deadend road as colonel pixhill she had no choice diane felt for a moment quite awesomely calm and then in the shadows between streetlamps she walked into a pair of open arms hey now the long arms closed lovingly around her she thought sam she smelled beer the arms manoeuvred her under a streetlamp who we got here then the light splattered like egg yolk on a great shambling grin built around the kind of large yellow teeth which according to sam looked appealing on donkeys but rather less so on darryl davey sam had had a lot to say over the weeks about darryl thick as shit but king of the third form on account of being overdeveloped for his age like a shark in a goldfish tank lovely lady loony darryl davey said holding her tightly to his body please excuse me i dont think so she felt his hands through her sweater clasped between her shoulderblades youre quite a handful you are my lover darryl davey said he began to move jerkily down the street pushing her before him his wiry red hair springing as he pressed himself against her stop it how dare you hed bulldozed her back to woollys alley i do what i like lady loony go on struggle push them big titties out get off me you disgusting all right darryls hands parted and he stepped back thank you relief streamed through her darryl grinned as arms in a thick check workshirt came around her from behind diane shrieked darryl bellowed with laughter diane struggled and tried to turn her head to see the face although she knew it must be the wide shouldered man whod smashed woollys guitar on the edge of her vision she saw wayne rankin slip back into the alley he wouldnt want her to see him she couldnt see the face of the man holding her whenever she tried to twist away from him he danced her around from behind he was quite a bit shorter than darryl he pulled her to him and she felt something hard press into the base of her spine darryl said conversationally they dsay sammy daniels been shaggin you leave me alone ah you can do better than him my lover diane kicked back hard with her trainer there was a grunt fuckin fat slag a hand plunged into her coat and squeezed her left breast hard she screamed out woolly call the p then she was choking on a mouthful of thick leathery fingers and was hauled into the alley the heels of her trainers bouncing on the cobbles in the little square the tinhatted bulb hung like a showerspray over the smashed window and the broken string instruments she was absolutely terrified now it was already a sexual assault and they knew shed be able to identify them this was more than drunken bravado it was madness division extremism prejudice violence take your dirty common fingers out of her mouth leonard darryl said shes a lady deserves better than that she was lowered to the cobbles her head against the remains of the window and shes gonner get better darryl giggled fragments of broken glass fell into dianes hair and bigger and then fiddling with the zip of his jeans darryl davey burned their boats what you doin hidin in there wayne she cant have you flogged now boy to her horror wayne rankin emerged from woollys doorway and went to stand by darryl so that she could clearly see his face he stood like a man in an identification parade expressionless a wiry youth with close cut hair like his fathers then the heavy man leonard joined them all three of them blocking the alley wayne smiled slyly all right there miss diane lanky shambling darryl davey started running his zip noisily up and down if if you go away now diane said her voice high and breathless the taste of leonards fingers in her mouth i wont say anything about this there was dead silence the three men looked at each other and then back at diane ho fucking ho darryl davey said ten black as sin go on then mrs moulder yelled back from the wi dont bugger about been a sight too many fires hereabouts you cant be sure don protested feebly coulder been a glow from a torch headlamps well seeing where it come from thats not much better you should neverve let them hippies down there i told you at the time halfway through the door don turned back lets call the police then dont be stupid farmer for near forty years and scared to go out on his own land theyve all heard about that cross too lizzie strode said is it true hes holding openair services now they can mock tis a pit of sin this place a pit of sin don moulder snatched his lamp from the big hook behind the door and walked into the dark protect me lord protect thy servant yea though i walks into the valley of the shadow verity was in a stiffbacked kitchen chair her back to the aga rereading john cowper powyss maiden castle the novel bad been bought for her many many years ago by her fiance captain hope and shed never been able to open it without picturing him a strong stocky man with a faintly practical errol flynn air and a wide white smile which would simply erupt across his face when she opened the door of her mothers house on a sunday afternoon captain hope had been ten years older than verity who was twentyfive when they became engaged he liked to call her the child bride although this was more a reference to her stature than her years his sudden death from peritonitis barely a month before the scheduled wedding day had been followed a week later by her widowed mothers first stroke and then fifteen years of caring for her increasingly querulous before her death dispatched verity all alone into the world two unhappy housekeeping jobs had followed before she and colonel pixhill had found each other recognising the qualities that each required for the quiet untroubled life that never quite came about colonel pixhill was not at all like bernard hope being more refined less vigorous in his manner but then when they met he was so much older verity had often wondered what might have developed had she met the colonel twenty or thirty years earlier before the unfortunate mrs pixhill before oliver the mere thought of oliver pixhill spoiled her concentration and she found herself miserably counting the christmas cards on the windowsill seventeen fewer and fewer every year as her friends died off and verity was crossed from the lists of distant great nieces and nephews who presumably thought she must be dead by now but did not think it worth a phone call to find out she imagined that years after her departure from the house or from life whichever came first there would stall be a handful of small cheap cards addressed to miss v endicott meadwell glastonbury there was quite simply nobody left now to whom she might turn for help having this afternoon telephoned the only contact number she now possessed for the pixhill trust shed at last reached a solicitor called mr kellogg and asked him if the trust could prevent dr pelham grainger from uncovering the meadwell as in her view this would not be complying with the colonels wishes mr kellogg had laughed actually laughed miss endicott the trust is entering a new era meadwell is a delightful and historic house and its been hidden away for too long while the chalice well gets tens of thousands of visitors ours is ignored but thats because we want to see the colonel take his place among the great pioneers of modern glastonbury along with with all the others and for meadwell to become recognised as architecturally on a par with the tribunal the george and pilgrims but the colonel quite deliberately sealed up the well so that nobody probably because he was unhappy about spending the money that would have been required to clean and repair it but times change miss endicott there are now thousands of tourists with an unassuageable thirst for the spiritual and if this man grainger can help put us on the map put us on the map was major shepherd the last of them to realise that the colonels last wish had been for meadwell to stay for the forseeable future entirely off the map any faint hopes that mrs rosemary shepherd the majors widow might have picked up his sword had been dispelled by a telephone call around teatime miss endicott ive been trying to clean out tims study getting rid of all the silly books pixhill made him read and i keep falling over this blasted parcel full of boring papers connected with the pixhill diaries and addressed to a mrs carey if ive phoned her once ive phoned her a dozen times keep getting the same tedious answering machine would you have any idea at all what on earth the problem is with this woman verity had explained that mrs carey was in hospital having been injured in a serious fire oh well how longs she going to be in hospital look suppose i send this stuff to you can you pass it on to her yes that makes sense i shall do that nothing makes sense any more verity thought coming into glastonbury there were several police diversion signs one said avoid town centre still got bloody roadworks i see juanita said id ignore it its just to avoid congestion in the daytime seconds later they were stopped by a policeman youre going to ask me if i can read arent you powys said i wouldnt insult you sir i was going to ask you which paper you worked for and then i saw the dog and mrs carey welcome home mrs carey im sorry juanita looked fogged its ok you wont recognise me the policeman leaned on the wounddown window i was at the fire oh juanita said im glad to see you looking so much better we were a bit worried about you i put my jacket under your head tried to keep you calm until the ambulance got through you kept saying get the cat i thought if theres a cat in here he can get himself out powys felt rather than saw juanita go absolutely rigid the one time don moulder had felt safe going down to the field was at dawn when the cross would make a proud and rugged silhouette against the eastern sky and the tor at night no silhouette was a good silhouette bloody woman how could she have seen flames down here and wouldnt it have been easy just to stop the car and have a quick glance over the hedge she did it on purpose sensed there was something he didnt like in the bottom field but wouldnt tell her trouble with this field you approached it from the farmhouse and you couldnt see what was inside it till you were practically through the gate protect me lord don slid the bar and walked in praying under his breath no flames no light at all except from his lamp which he kept switched on and tightly in his right hand all the way to the cross feeling safer when he reached the cross he went to embrace it that good and sturdy telegraph pole hed bought far p when they moved the lines the cross felt oddly light when he threw his arms about it and brittle like a husk he felt his fingers sinking in his arms dropped nerveless to his sides the lamp still clutched in his right hand he backed away and held up his left hand to the light it was black he let out a cry as the wooden cross started to shiver charcoal it was burned to charcoal lord how could it be how can it be lord dyou hear me he shone the light on the cross black as soot black as sin burned to a black cinder and still standing like the fire had come from inside this was what the missus seen not ten minutes ago coming home from the wi shed seen the cross on fire couldnt be don flung himself at the cross and hugged it close feeling it flaking in his arms beginning to crumble he began to whimper it was burned through and worse than that worse than that worse than that it was cold in a corner of the field an old engine cranked into unholy life behind the barriers the christmas tree lay in slaughtered sections at the side of the road christmas had been cancelled and the market cross exposed again a solitary finger accusing god powys winced i suppose you know this guy woolaston yes her voice sounded slack and kirsty cotton he pulled sharply into the kerb just below carey and frayne the pavements were deserted most of the shop lights were out even the george and pilgrims had looked quiet a muted glow beyond the ancient windows woolly has a reputation juanita said for being the slowest driver under seventy in the entire west country it doesnt bear thinking about but she still sounded as if there was something else pressing on her mind something the policeman had said before he told them about the horrific accident maybe it was being reminded of the fire by someone else whod been there more likely though it was what the policeman had said about the cat had jim battle had a cat powys climbed out of the mini took the suitcase from the boot went round and opened juanitas door wide it was a penetratingly cold night she stood shivering in the road almost directly across the street the goddess smouldered in purple in one of the very few windows which remained lit my god juanita looked slowly around her as if she might be in the wrong town if its all changed so much from this morning powys thought what the hell must it seem like after more than a month she seemed unsteady he put a hand under her arm guided her to the pavement and stopped there was a new sign in the window of carey and frayne it had been pasted to the outside and was clearly legible under the streetlamp he realised it was effectively covering a sign which the printer guy sam had made and diane had stuck up on the inside of the glass the sign which said coming soon the avalonian this one was much bigger it had foothigh black letters on luminous yellow paper pasted the full width of the window right at the top where you couldnt hope to reach it from outside whoever had done this must have had ladders or maybe parked a van on the pavement and stood on its roof the sign said theavaloonian is here eleven home temple its all right oh please please no i wont tell any oh no no please dont shhhhhhh no get away from me you dis open your eyes diane youre safe nobodys going to do anything to you she opened her eyes into other eyes shut them in panic take it easy youre all right oh oh gosh you see have they gone yes they have they wouldnt tangle with me diane my dear youre trembling horribly light from the tinshaded bulb sprayed down on her her relief turned it into golden tinsel they were going to rape me i do believe they were said ceridwen juanita ran up the stairs with her coat flapping and her useless gloved hands held out in front of her like fins diane diane joe powys followed doing what juanita couldnt tossing doors open smacking lights on he found her standing in the middle of the upstairs living room she looked about to faint he made her sit down shes not here powys where is she why isnt she here oh hey she could be anywhere shes working flat out on the avalonian goes to meetings and things teaches correspondents how to write shorter paragraphs well she cant have been here when whoever it was put that sign up they could have done it in the last few minutes anytime these glastonbury first guys move fast whats more nobody seems to stop them how do you know its them i dont but i cant think who else would want to discredit diane on the other hand none of the glastonbury first people ive met struck me as clever enough to think of that one he helped her take off her coat and she sat there looking lost in the absurdly festive aztecpattern skin and the lemoncoloured offtheshoulder top her face was white powys had never been up here before it was cozy densepile carpet many bookshelves between them paintings of luminous twilight skies jim battle let me moisten your lips there better lie back on the sofa thats it where is this place a sanctuary it was dark and warm she could smell something musty but not unpleasant not quite incense domini dorrelladams and the angular woman jenna had picked them up in a car she vaguely remembered going through backstreets and across the car park didnt remember arriving because shed collapsed against ceridwen in shuddering tears on the back seat of the car remembering darryl davey his copperwire hair his buck teeth his penis out better than a tube of smarties my lover terrible ordeal diane they he put his but hes gone yes drink this what is it only herbs its sweet its for shock drink it slowly my youve lost weight diane dont seem to have had time for meals you need looking after shouldnt be on your own certainly not tonight no i mean ill be ok comfortable mmmm thank you whereswhere is this youve been here before havent you diane i dont think so its wandas temple oh she almost smiled when she was up in yorkshire juanita had sent her a twopage picture spread from hello magazine it had said dame wanda carlisle newly adopted into the pagan faith receives us in her home temple in mystical glastonbury the actress had been photographed in egyptian costume thered been no mention of the cauldron diane listen to me ceridwens voice so close she could feel the warm breath on her cheek ive dealt many times with this situation if youre alone you wont sleep you wont feel secure you know they know you can identify them youll feel so much safer here there are plenty of rooms and we shall watch over you honestly i she tried to lift her head from the soft cushion it felt so incredibly heavy which brings us to the question of the police do you think we should call them i think perhaps we should especially if one of the attackers works for your father gosh no please unfortunately i didnt see them do anything they scattered when they saw me advancing i could testify that they were there of course i know the rest would be your word against theirs but no really my father mustnt know that above all please dont tell the police i dont think i could face it i dont think i could summon the strength i just feel you know so awfully tired diane i know you re there will you at least do me the common courtesy of returning my calls there were nine messages on the answering machine down in the shop most of them from lord pennard yes well not calling him back was the most sensible thing she could do under the circumstances juanita said his family have been pushing people around for centuries and dianes easy if he gets to speak to her he gets what he wants she does seem a bit malleable powys said for an upperclass rebel shes not a rebel she shes been pushed around all her life father archer nannies even the socalled third bloody nanny thats your rebellion df right juanita accepted a cigarette in her lips thanks there was a different tone to pennards final message diane this is difficult for me juanita snorted smoke i should have talked to you properly that night old bastard should have talked to her properly from when she was a kid juanita said but we were both somewhat overwrought i know what i did was highhanded im sorry i beg of you to telephone me at the earliest possible he can sound very plausible sometimes if the chainmail gauntlet doesnt work slip on the white evening gloves shush powys said this one sounds interesting mrs shepherd in coln st mary gloucestershire i understand you have had dealings with my late husband juanita went still late who before he died was most perturbed that you had not contacted him after promising you would oh my god said juanita he rang up the night before the fire id forgotten all about it i promised to go and see him pick up some papers documents which when i was sorting through his effects i realised should have been collected by you i have made several attempts to telephone you and i now merely wish to say that i am sending the package by courier to miss endicott at meadwell if you wish to collect them from her that will be in order thank you oh shit juanita extracted the cigarette using the tips of her fingers i should have gone over there the day i woke up in hospital i dont think ive thought about it from that moment to this now the poor old boys dead he sounded awful thinking about it really ill thats another one ive let down oh come on powys said like you were supposed to ask the ambulance driver to take you to bristol via gloucester i wouldnt feel so bad if id even thought about him just once dianediane its woolly oh god here we go got to talk im at the end ofoh fuck we just got to talkim at home please call me when you can please there you are powys said thats where shes gone ok if you hold the phone ill call him before you do these papers the ones that woman mentioned oh well it was strange normally i wouldve listened harder when he called but that was a night we had other problems with ceridwen downstairs and hearing about this man headlice major shepherd said he said there was a missing chapter from pixhills diary that they couldnt publish for legal reasons he said that it cast light on what was happening here i dont know what he meant why was he telling you if it was unpublishable i dont know he said verity couldnt handle it on her own any more god how could i forget this id like to see this stuff powys said juanita said sharply youre thinking about your book arent you the secret pixhill wasnt allowed to tell she looked up in alarm as something fell against the shop door like a heavy refuse sack powys moved across and lifted up the blind diane for chrissake let me in weve got to talk god juanita said its diane listen the voice still slurred but low and urgent now i know this isnt the best time but i love you i love you diane sam daniel twelve from a high shelf they took sam upstairs he was certainly pissed but juanita suspected there was more to it than that some imbalance something which had toppled him from his comfortably cynical nonchalant perch the sudden perception of a slowburning desire for diane devastating but not enough to do this to him there was a kind of desperation here juanita is that juanita sam peered at her eyes wide and blurred a tremor went through him i need to be sick powys showed him the lavatory and shut the door on him im quite shocked juanita said i dont think i knew about this i dont think that even in my wildest i may be wrong powys said but i dont think diane knows about it either christ said juanita the perfect suitor a drunken leftwing antibloodsportscampaigner if only pennard were here she collapsed into the sofa ok lets call woolly ask him to keep her there for a while some things need to be put into perspective powys held the phone to her car and called the number there was no answer juanita swallowed her throat felt very dry she found herself looking at one of jims pictures was flung brutally back into the moments when she was ringing jim and ringing and ringing and he didnt answer kept on not answering that was when they went to the cottage juanita staring at the picture was it going dark she must have told karen the nurse about that when she was feverish karen had said next day that happened to my gran the night before grandad died it used to be well known the pictures in the room go dark before a death come on powys on his knees in front of her calm down huh just tell me where he lives ill go and check this out as soon as we make sure sams ok powys you think somethings happened to her dont you im more worried about you youre not well youre very pale im ok leave sam to me you go ill leave arnold hes a dowsers dog what on earth does that mean pray you never have to find out powys produced his enigmatic earth mysterygurus smile but she could tell it was a struggle there was the sound of the lavatory flushing and then we need to talk he said about what that policeman said about jims cat not his cat she said hoarsely his hat on his way out powys spotted on the table in the downstairs parlour an ancient copy of the avalonian there was a drawing on the front of a woman looking up towards glastonbury tor he recognised her at once and felt an almostaching sadness despair made a cold compress on veritys heart as she switched off the light and padded in her pompom slippers to the bed dr grainger had said go to bed earlier in the winter semihibernate like the animals and if sleep will not come make use of the peaceful hours to commune with the dark listen to the night sounds the conversing of owls the creaking and shifting of the house listen to the ancient beating heart of meadwell verity lay under the sheets with her eyes open drawn to the windows two chalkygrey rectangles like paving slabs like gravestones in the wall there were no owls tonight occasionally she would hear traffic from the main road half a mile away but only the loudest lorries she wished the road were close enough for headlights to flash on to the glass dr pel grainger would wince at such defeatism what did dr grainger know rolling over on her cold pillow aware of that painful tug her left hip arthritis although it would be more comfortable that way she could not lie on her back remembering how her mother had eventually died in the night and verity had found her next morning eyes wide open to the ceiling like a stone effigy upon a tomb verity felt utterly lost almost wished that she could see powys said woolly the little guy dropped his shovel in alarm spilling fragments and splinters of wood under the lamp projecting from the wall his scalp gleamed through sparse hair behind him was a hole where a window had been im sorry we havent met powys felt foolish there were shards of broken glass on the cobbles and remains of what might once have been a guitar he was getting a bad feeling if arnold had been here arnold would have growled that particular growl who are you woolly retrieved the shovel brandished it like a weapon powys swiftly identified himself jm powys woolly smiled the smile of a man for whom everything comes too late heard you were in town tried to find you once ask your advice sheesh he lowered the shovel been a bad night jm bad as they get we picked up your message for diane on the answering machine where is she we thought she might be here we juanita carey and me shes back woolly ran a weary hand through his hair shit she picks her nights dont she no dianes not here has she been here i hope not spent the last hour walking got a taxi back from street couldnt settle that poor woman kirsty i saw her face you know just before they sedated her gonner see that face forever man wiped out how do you even start to live with that woolly patrolled the square in circles not looking up so i left the message for diane then took off walked along wearyall one of my places fetched up at the thorn prayed a bit you know prayed to anything that would listen know who i felt like he looked at powys at last judas fucking iscariot the chosen instrument of death the thorn it felt hostile never felt like that before man never then i came back and found some upright citizen had decided to like express the feelings of the whole town you told the police about this you kidding if theyd set light to the damn place i wouldnt feel i had the right to call the fire brigade its over man not gonner walk away from this one dont deserve to woolly kicked away the neck of the broken guitar powys bent and picked it up the strings were still attached to the bent machine heads who did this does it matter towns crawling with vigilantes now glastonbury first i thought itd blow over keep quiet dont make a big deal out of it let it bum itself out sheesh everything that happens deals em another ace jim battle and now you said chosen huh you said chosen instrument of death what did you mean ah you dont wanner hear this woolly wiped his forehead seminal book for me the old golden land somebody said youd changed thought it was all balls now didnt wanner have anything to do with leys and locationphenomena powys said nothing that being the case youll be saying to yourself what a shithead gets pissed causes a truly horrible fatal accident and the best he can think of is to blame the paranormal get me outer here youll be thinking woolly was close to tears powys thought about all the crazy stuff hed heard tonight he thought about uncle jack woolly he said i think im changing back sam sat for a long time with his head in his hands take your time juanita said although she truly didnt think there was time too much happening too fast it was like one of those magic eye pictures where there was a lot going on but it all looked like mush until your eye learned how to resolve the vibrating strands and then in the centre of it all was a shatteringly obvious symbol a very dark symbol we had kind of a row sam said diane said everything was real and everything was a part of everything else something like that this was so close to juanitas own thoughts that she had to drink some whisky very quickly through her straw sam had tried to clean himself up he was wearing an old torn army parka camouflage trousers and walking boots where have you been sam he sighed bowermead pennards got a hunt coming off on boxing day thought id see how i could spoil the fun rankin catch you no didnt see rankin i saw i saw where hundreds of beautiful broadleaf trees had been destroyed the ground all dug up and flattened you know how poor old woolly was saying they could start anywhere at any time clearing wood for the new road this is for real sam swear to god his hair was stuck to his forehead where hed splashed cold water into his eyes what i figured pennards worried about hundreds of protesters descending on his woodland like at newbury and batheaston so hes got in first destroyed his own trees remains of bonfires everywhere where they burned the branches the mind boggles juanita said dynamite stuff certainly but why would that send sam off to get crawling drunk take it slowly sam does diane know about this he shook his head did she know youd gone to bowermead no what happened look after the crash the telly were interviewing archer ffitch hes coming out with all this pious hypocritical shit trying to lay it all on woolly and then when the cameras off he puts the knife in for diane with the reporter how theyve tried to help her but shes a lost cause very sick girl all this discreetly planting the information that dianes batty and anything she says should be treated accordingly which would include anything printed in the avalonian black lettering on yellow started to roll across juanitas brain like one of those advertisements on a belt in the post office oonian is here the avaloonian is herethe aval i just went insane i wanted to go off fuck up the ffitches any way i could and now you can juanita said you can blow it to the papers about all the trees theyve destroyed prematurely where did you get pissed sam down the riflemans four double scotches and a pint on an empty stomach im missing something how did you get from bowermead to the riflemans arms walked ran ran mostly left the van back on the pilton road wasnt going back that way oh christ juanita the reason we had the row me and diane was over what you believed in and what you couldnt handle im surprised it took you so long working together so closely and her being of a mystical persuasion while you juanita sam pushed the hair away from his eyes and his hands stayed clutched to either side of his head so help me i think ive seen a ghost help yourself jm woolly pushed a bottle of bells across the workbench untied his pathetic ponytail you wont mind if i dont powys poured less than half an inch of scotch into a tumbler he wasnt in a drinking mood either the little room was like the picture you had of the workshop of the man who made pinocchio curved planes and fancy chisels and lots of tools you wouldnt know which end to pick them up with and rich woody smells im out of here tomorrow woolly said best thing people dont want to see me around even my friends theyll just be uncomfortable wherell you go dunno yet here i am one day an old hippy in the place where all old hippies would want to come to die next day boom outcast woolly lit a roll up like the bishop of bath and wells sheesh he said vacantly look powys said i dont really know this place i just came because someone wanted me to write a book about the new age culture decline of woolly said its gonner be all washed up again you know the last time this happened the dissolution of the monasteries when the state fitted up the abbot here topped him woolly picked up a wooden guitar bridge with little holes for the strings to go through and began to sand it down with a small piece of glasspaper i seen it coming a long way off man just never thought it was gonner happen so fast i knew there was gonner be a showdown and i knew id be at the centre of it what i guessed was itd be the road that brought it all to a climax big protest on the site us occupying the trees they were gonner bring down digging tunnels forming human chains then this business with the tor comes up need a human chain round that too i had this feeling that was what id been born for my destiny to form human chains around a holy hill powys formed pictures of woolly as this little hereward the wake figure rallying the new age troops woolly on the tv news woolly in sunday newspaper profiles stupid woolly said what id been born for was to help kill an innocent child at precisely the right time thereby making a key contribution to the second fall of glastonbury apocalyptic jm he put down the wooden bridge powys said i dont understand ok woolly started rolling the glasspaper between his hands lets start at the beginning this is the most important spiritual powercentre in the country maybe in the western world this is where they brought the most powerful mystical artefact the world has ever known because it brings together christianity and the old religions the chalice right lets not call it the holy grail lets just call it the chalice whether it dispenses wine water or just pure spirit its a symbol of harmony right ill go along with that good the tor itself is like an upturned chalice pouring spiritual energy into the earth and it flows out in all directions spreading harmony at least the possibility of harmony and the strongest of those currents cutting straight across britain the st michael line it doesnt stand up to too much scrutiny woolly a lot of those st michael churches miss the line by a mile aw shit man i walked that line from st michaels mount to bury abbey i know it exists woolly touched the little scroll of glass paper to his head in here powys smiled he had no quarrel with that not tonight st michaels the hardman angel woolly said defender of the spirit plays it straight literally that line coming down across the countryside like a big sword theres also the possibility of another current weaving in and out of the line a feminine current this dowser guy found the st mary current all very harmonious and then the thought came out of nowhere somebody puts a new road through it woolly rose to his feet picked up the wooden bridge threw it into the air and caught it in triumph its about covert secularisation jm the states always done it because government even the vatican when they ran things is antispirit the state is about like rules and money spiritual values they get in the way but shit there aint time to go into the politics of all that you just got look at the effects of this conflict on the ground on the landscape when the normans conquered england powys said and they wanted to establish a physical power base they built their castles on ancient sacred burial mounds you got it jm course when christianity came they built their churches on mounds and inside stone circles too but thats ok cause its still spiritual but the number of norman military strongholds built on pagan mounds is staggering and it goes on where do the army do their training bloody salisbury plain so all the countryside around stonehenge is churned up by flaming tanks and splattered with nissen huts and stuff then they ban free festivals at stonehenge and that screws it for the genuine pagans and druids who cant find sanctuary there anymore leaving glastonbury tor leaving the tor where archer ffitch and griff daniel and the gl crew propose to have restricted access they strangle the powercentre pump the st michael line full of diesel fumes negative emotions roadrage fatal crashes the mention of fatal crashes seemed to drain the energy out of woolly as rapidly as if hed been shot he sat down is this paranoia jm i can show you the maps how that road will be visible to some extent from every significant church every ancient sacred site from burrowbridge mump to solsbury hill where it meets up with that other evil little bypass you wont be able to stand on any holy hill or in any st michael churchyard without hearing the roar of transcontinental juggernauts its horrifying like i say the worst thing to happen to this town since there was a thump inside powyss head as it all landed on him like a big thick book from a very high shelf sam brought the book up from the shop this the one juanita nodded pop it down on the table youll have to flip through the pages for me it was one of those glastonburyinoldphotos books not really carey and frayne subjectmatter with its sepia lineups of longdead councillors and women in big hats stop juanita said no sorry carry on skip this section hold it there sam swallowed juanita extended with some pain a discoloured lumpy forefinger sam looked up from the book oh jesus god he said hes younger but but thats him sam nodded his face looked as blurred and lost and scared and overwhelmed as one of the small boys in kneelength shorts on the very edge of the photograph the caption underneath said october children from st benedicts c of e primary school receive their prizes from the vicechairman of the school governors col george pixhill part five and though the well is dark with blood the tor is bright with fire dion fortune avalon of the heart one crows feet deepening she awoke to the voice of ceridwen the last transition for a woman can be a wonderful and fulfilling timealso a time of disillusion and decay constantly chilled by the draught of death the moan of distress brought powys rushing in he saw her head twisting on the pillow in a dark swirl of hair before she woke big brown eyes full of dread and not recognising him at first arnold whined his outsize ears pricked up um joe powys powys reminded her hed spent the night under cushions and a rug on the living room sofa juanita blinked at him is she powys shook his head sorry no sign the winter morning hung in the window like a damp rag juanitas head sank back what are we going to do on the wall opposite the bed was a battle duskscape the red light reduced to a thin line powys thought of the st michael line a ghostly ribbon linking the high places and interlacing last nights feverish dreams while arnold had stayed watchful in juanitas bedroom maybe you could call her father powys said like hed tell me if she was there he might if she isnt there juanita said i dont think it would be good if he knew she was missing i also suggested to sam that we should keep quiet about what he saw the road until we find diane gloomily she contemplated her face in the dressingtable mirror whats woollys state of mind not good somebody smashed up his shop window last night while he was out no her face crumpling in pain in benedict street whats happening to people glastonbury first vigilantes woolly reckons or maybe just ordinary citizens appalled that they voted for a man who caused the death of an innocent child after hallucinating a black bus in the rush hour what do you think he saw well powys said if sam daniel who you say is a confirmed unbeliever in anything is categoric about seeing pixhills ghost then um anythings possible isnt it he held up the daily press christmas tree horror most of the front page was filled by a panoramic picture of the fallen tree half smothering the lorry there was also a smiling motherandbaby photo from the cotton family album and one of a crazy man staring into the camera with eyes which were wide and glazed he looked like a junkie or an absconder from some highsecurity psychiatric hospital there was a grimfaced policeman on either side the caption read im shattered councillor edward woolaston minutes after the horror he says hes leaving town doesnt want to make his friends uncomfortable he cant do that juanita said firmly ill call him we need woolly he sighed theres something else along the bottom of the front page it said mp moves on tor ban page three it seems powys said his voice flat that your ailing member of parliament sir laurence bowkett is tabling a private members bill he turned to page three and read the glastonbury tor limitation of access bill is tabled with the full support of the local branches of the national farmers union and the country landowners association it is also understood to have considerable support inside the executive of the national trust which owns the tor oh my god juanita slumped this could be passed it could be law it could be law next year she turned to powys i wasnt taking this in very well last night woolly sees it as some kind of government conspiracy more of a cosmic conspiracy i think the establishment becoming a tool for the forces of evil because of their economic tunnelvision governments are particularly susceptible to the forces of evil as symbolised by the dark chalice if the holy grail is the symbol of harmony and light and the healing power of the spirit the dark chalice the antigrail represents hatred and division greed and corruption and well you get the idea and was there a dark chalice is there anything in british mythology corresponding with that um i reckon pixhill invented it he wanted a symbol something easily understood maybe its taken on a life of its own if dianes seen it juanita sat up where sam i think i got dis bug feel rotten all bunged up so it dont look like ill be id for a couple of days sorry boss ah well he was relieved if anything couldnt sit here after last night and listen to paul rabbiting on about megabytes and cd rom the machine said click whirr thats the lot no word from diane his head throbbed where was she walked out of this door very sad its all real everything is part of everything else and its all real an hour later its all mayhem and chaos in magdalene street where was she it was nearly half past nine outside the town was wrapped in dour greybrown fog sam stood at his window watching people moving about not laughing not wishing each other merry christmas a sombre stillness settled around him and the world seemed a denser place he caught himself wondering if any of the muffled passersby were ghosts his mind still squirming away from the dismal image of an old man who could not speak only scream in silence shit sammy too heavy son what he should be doing was getting on to hughie hanging it on him about pennard and the new road calling in the ecotroops mass protest mass trespass wait till we find diane would he ever find diane did anything ever happen to you that you couldnt explain in the sky powys said over the tor a cupped hands effect something very dark between them and also in the fire at the heart of the flames when jim he nodded or so she says maybe she didnt tell me because she thought id dismiss it she thinks im cynical which you arent of course ive tried god ive tried she turned back to the mirror shook her hair winced look at that bloody hag there was the residue of something before the fire funny but that very night i got all dressed up for woollys protest meeting saw myself in a shop window and i was quite cheered i thought theres something left you know now im a hag the last transition chilled by the draught of death powys saw the reflection of her eyes widen in panic the crows feet deepening thats absolutely not true juanita he stood up and came behind her picking up a hairbrush from the dressing table tilt your head back she closed her eyes brushing her hair he felt the softness of the skin on her long neck he thought of that yellowing cover of the avalonian the sylph in the naturegoddess headdress theres something i havent told you juanita said don moulder waited until mrs moulder was out collecting the eggs and then he rang his neighbour melvyn carter and he said that bit o ground melvyn im ready to talk look now melvyn expressed surprise and deep suspicion on account of it was only two weeks since don had refused to discuss even the possibility of selling melvyn a certain four and a half acres of pasture at any price ill be reasonable melvyn i promise you in return i need a particular favour and nothin else will do your soninlaw look still in the police is he oh inspector now is it well i dneed his help and i dneed it fast with regards to dons hand sweating on the phone with regards to a certain buzz feeling better now it was out the lord had thrown him into the heart of the great conflict and yea though he walked through the valley of death he would turn his face unto the light and not be afeared to put his arse on the line his hat they took his hat they seemed to find that funny juanita said i was bloody terrified totally convinced we were both going to die how could they chop off his head and let me go you think new age travellers are either young idealists pioneering a new way of life or else sad urban refugees who need to be perpetually stoned but these were very sinister the guy in the mask i can still hear him whispering didnt speak just whispered i swore to jim id never tell a soul cant harm him now powys stood up how about i run you a bath the storys not over i saw his hat i ive been blocking this out ok youre the first person to hear this id virtually talked myself into believing id imagined it until that copper jims cat when they hold the inquest on jim early in the new year im going to have to give evidence im going to have to explain why i ran at the house why i i know powys gently squeezed her shoulders you dont know thats the point nobody knows they all think i threw myself on the bonfire all trussed up like some indian wife even i the phone rang ignore it powys said theyll leave a message go on what if its diane diane wouldnt phone she doesnt even know youre out of hospital the ringing was cut off snatched away by the answering machine all right juanita said theres an ash tree overhanging the cottage one of the branches almost touching the window his hat was hanging from it i was standing there with diane and don moulder hoping to god jim wasnt within a mile of that fire and i saw his hat no mistake not a bunch of dead leaves not a piece of cloth it was the damned hat i was furious the travellers were blocking the road i thought theyve set fire to his cottage and theyve left his hat a message a taunt so i i mean ok irrationally i can see that now i just went after it i tore my skirt and wrapped it round my face and i just ok he gripped her shoulders was he very attached to that hat inseparable wore it riding his bike wore it painting in his garden in celtic magic powys said a mans soul is in his head the celts kept heads in streams and wells they made stone heads sorry im thinking aloud you dont want to hear this crap no go on i was just thinking that if they went through all the ceremony of an execution a beheading and then they just took his hat he still died didnt he juanita said quietly within two days possession of a mans hat especially when that hat was such an essential part of what he was would they might think give them access to his head to his soul to put thoughts there to arouse certain feelings emotions sorry im theorising he felt very uncomfortable this was the kind of theorising hed sworn he was never going to do again emotions juanita looked up at him what did diane tell you about jim and me that you just wanted to be friends ok the situation was hed left his wife to come to the vale of avalon and paint that was his dream his gauguin fantasy except the only vaguely dusky female he knew was me and in all those years we just enjoyed each others company we had laughs and he looked at me and he patted my bum and that was as far as it went and as far as he wanted it to go sure hed say if only id known you when i was younger that sort of stuff he enjoyed all that the banter the what if but the truth was he didnt want to get involved with a woman again certainly wouldnt have one in his cottage she mightve fractured the idyll messed up his routine she was looking at the painting of the thin red glowing line he was an obsessive painter increasingly obsessed with the mystery that night he was absolutely outraged at what the travellers were doing on the tor spiritual vandalism maybe he sensed more than i did hed certainly become very attuned to the dusk to the ending of a beautiful day nine oclock passed and with it that last small hope that diane would arrive to open the shop powys and juanita sat in the shop and didnt open for business juanita told herself the girl was scatty easily deflected and sometimes she would let you down also that diane was a grown woman and could look after herself that to think otherwise was patronising and insulting so why did she feel desperate with anxiety the answering machine didnt do much to relieve it diane its matthew banks that article of mine for your dummy edition were going to have to scrap it something absolutely awfuls happened please call me two our first christmas tree should they have let you come home matthew banks was a very tall spare fastidiouslooking man in his fifties waiting for him to arrive juanita had told powys how banks had sold the family garden centre to finance his selfpublished books on plantlore a fanatic she said but he knew his stuff i can treat you banks said i can make you something up to put on those hands you neednt have had grafts potato peelings forms a kind of skin never mind matthew too late juanita was impatient this is jm powys by the way the author and er descend ant of jc powys ah banks inspected powys down his halfglasses the old golden land you know i and his dog arnold juanita said lets not mess about it opens at ninethirty doesnt it outside the sleet was gathering force and every lamppost and signpost seemed to have one of those glastonbury first stickers with the white slash across the tor banks tore one off as he passed this should be stopped you know were going to turn tomorrows solstice service into a sort of smallscale protest against this tor lunacy all the more urgent with bowketts blasted bill if the bishop is so keen on developing a sort of ecumenical attitude towards paganism let him speak out against this youd better make sure it is a small demo juanita muttered through her scarf as they crossed into magdalene street or youll be playing directly into their hands she found herself glancing at every passing woman in the futile hope that one of them might turn out to be diane it will be discreet and dignified banks strode through the abbey gates his jaw jutting it was powyss first visit to the abbey pity he was thinking that it should be at a time like this for a reason like this they reached the modern visitor centre where banks was nodded through by the attendant but powys paid for himself and juanita there were showcases inside the centre and relics of stone and pottery books and leaflets on sale glossy pictures of sunset silhouettes the centrepiece was a scale model of the original abbey in all its soaring honeyed splendour there were also several information boards the first one telling the story of joseph of arimathea said to have settled here with eleven disciples in ad and so juanita pale and muffled and following a threelegged dog they entered the holyest erthe in all england thirtysix acres of lawns and ruins the reason for glastonbury there was a tall wooden cross set in a vast lawn greying under a skim of sleet the cross was modern but timelessly simple despite its size it had humility it said were not even trying to compete powys saw the abbey ruins stark beyond it theyd always reached him these ancient spoiled places more than palaces more than cathedrals but there was no time to explore the ruins matthew banks was striding storklike towards a wellpreserved grey chapel with a tiled roof and a tiny belltower on a small walled lawn with a path going by stood a little tree arnold edged towards it perhaps not arnold powys said matthew banks bit off a short arid laugh it really doesnt matter now the thorn another descendant of the staff of joseph of arimathea this one was like the kind of tree a child draws with its thin grooved trunk and its clouded mesh of branches ive seen the one on wearyall hill powys said which is the actual they all are banks said wearyall hill was where the first one grew but theres been a greater continuity of holy thorns here this is the one most people see for most visitors this is the holy thorn the one that flowers at christmas should he flowering now the thorn wasnt in flower yet although powys could see what looked like buds juanita said are you sure about this matthew i mean i dont know much about these things but it looks as if it might flower of course im sure matthew banks said harshly its dying juanita put out an inexperienced hand the tree was like a curledup hedgehog you couldnt get inside it shed discovered a little surprised that she was crying quietly it was only a tree for gods sake and whatever had happened here it hardly compared with the arboreal massacre found by sam daniel it was a bad summer banks said phenomenally dry into august and then the blight which went on until the end of november and then winter came in with a crunch the strange part is i examined the tree less than a week ago and it was thriving id stand by that it was ready to flower as i say but if it wasnt lack of water powys said there is lack of water banks bent snapped off a twig easily between finger and thumb look feel it embrittled parched inside this doesnt happen overnight no cold on the outside juanita thought as powys accepted the twig parched and arid inside like me damn it this wasnt the holy oak it wasnt the holy giant redwood it wasnt even much of a myth an old guy shoves his stick in the ground and it turns into the kind of arboreal runt that gardeners rip up and feed into the shredder and yet that was why theres a poetic truth about this little tree she said yes powys said you know what pixhill said oh please banks snapped must we bring that man into this pixhill had a dream right powys tossed the twig to the foot of the tree or claimed he had anyway he goes all apocalyptic dreamt i saw the dark chalice in the sky again and the meadwell was spewing black water from hades and stop it banks shouted merciful god are things not bad enough must we talk like this must we juanita stared at him in despair did it ever occur to you matthew that not talking like this is whats allowed this situation to develop youve all been so airyfairy peace and love open up the healing forces of nature that you havent noticed it growing matthew banks recoiled until its everywhere but he obviously didnt want to face anything apocalyptic not what glastonbury mysticism was about in avalon of the heart powys said dion fortune described the thorn as our first christmas tree i like that juanitas eyes widened i know what youre thinking do i i cant say that i do banks was obviously feeling himself being pushed from centrestage what are you saying hes thinking about the other christmas tree oh this is stupid banks backed away from them i dont think it is matthew theres a malaise in this town powys said i dreamt i saw the dark chalice in the sky again and the meadwell was spewing black water from hades and and i saw that josephs holy thorn juanita said had withered in the earth and stop it pixhill was a paranoid sick old man and the feet which walked in ancient times juanita was amazed she could remember this stuff had walked again in the winterhardened fields of avalon but this time banks walked away in anguish his head bowed like a monks this time powys said they left tiny left cloven prints jesus arnold juanita saw the dowsers dog whimpering and backing away from the murdered thorn powys picked him up looking juanita thought more concerned at the dogs reaction than anything all i wanted said banks when they caught him up was for diane to withdraw my article not to initiate a witchhunt i wish id known this when i saw her last night matthew when did you see her must have been before eight because safeway was still open oh and then i saw her again with jenna gray juanitas hands began to throb the gloves felt too tight powys said where was this mr banks from my my friends window you mean mr seward what were they doing where did they go this is very important matthew well i think they got out of a car i wasnt paying much attention juanita do you do you think i should inform the bishop what juanita was making letsgetoutofhere eye movements at powys about the thorn should i tell him about the thorn well his mob owns the abbey what do you think powys whatever powys said unless ive misunderstood the guy hell probably just send one of his minions to the nearest nursery for another one the bloody idiot juanita said when they parted from banks at the gatehouse how could she do this the sleet was coming harder looking thicker and whiter a christmassy crust was forming on the sawn up sections of tree behind the barricades around the market cross banks has this intermittent thing going with an antiquarian bookseller called godwin seward sewards flat is more or less opposite wanda carlisles house where the cauldron meets powys said but lets not jump to conclusions you sound like banks if i want to jump to conclusions how confident are you about facing this woman he looked at her hands im not afraid i never thought you were thats not what i meant just think a slanging match at this stage all i want is diane out of there at this stage obviously powys said but what if she doesnt want to come three the solstice tree hello are you awake i think so a little comfortable i think so let me moisten your lips it felt sweet on her lips her head felt very heavy so did her eyelids and yet they fell softly like petals its very dark i thought it was morning dont worry let me tell you a story yes about a baby whose mother died when she was born thats me its my story diane whispered she had to whisper it was dark and she didnt want to waken the other patients thats right your mother died when you were born she was actually dying when you were born she fell downstairs no my dear she was pushed downstairs everybody knows that i dont understand she did see you she opened her eyes and saw you before she died did you know that no lie back now your lips are very dry drink some of this put your head back which hospital is this your uniform head back now open your mouth there relax youre going to be fine did you know my mother like you i didnt meet her until she was dying i was your age then perhaps a little younger i was an assistant midwife at the belvedere there were two of us we put you in your mothers arms oh she died holding you diane knew she was crying didnt you know that no i its so beautiful she bleeds we have put you in your mothers arms as she bleeds do you remember her arms around you and she bleeds and bleeds and her arms grow cold the petals of her eyelids floated like waterlilies on pools of tears you are lying in her dead arms we leave you there in those dead a rms until other arms encircle you powys let the knocker fall twice the sound tumbling away into the slender georgian house the barbed tower of st johns soared above the surrounding roofs almost shockingly close to this discreet but hardly modest pagan temple nobody answered the knock powys glanced at juanita for guidance try again she was tense theyve got to be here where else would they be you ok stupid question she looked close to fainting her face taut as parchment it was a lovely face but not iridescent not mesmeric he wanted to take her home come back alone smash a window with a brick storm the place drag diane out of there get them all the hell out of this increasingly unholy town before they too like jim battle like woolly fell under the malaise powys raised the knocker again this time when it fell back on the metal plate the door glided eerily open of course juanita said electronic she followed him into the hallway there was nobody waiting for them he saw closed doors and bloodyhell whats that in a corner a tangle of dead branches rose sombrely from a black tub the branches were wound with holly and mistletoe and there was a circle of small stones on the carpet around the tub i suspect its what you might call a solstice tree juanita said on the topmost sprig where the silver yuletide fairy would be expected to perch a large white mushroom sprouted flabbily its obscene s pretty isn it s extremely pretty god powys found himself clutching juanitas arm one of the doors had opened the shape which hung there was as white and moist as the mushroom she wore her druidic white robe with gold edging it hung open exposing a black satin shift there was a huge gold tore around the neck glittery slippers on the feet a sheen of perspiration on the face whore you she was obviously pissed as a newt wanda juanita thought rapidly ill come straight to the point were looking for diane you remember diane diane fortune the druid giggled oh gawd diane bloody fortune he should have recognised her she was after all famous thats right juanita said tensely diane fortune the eyes unclouded for a moment youre not diane fortune i know who you are youre that woman from the bookshop anita been away havent you something happened to you what the hell was it come and tell me about it is this man with you she peered at powys do i know you darling think idve remembered stonishingly few shaggable men in this town place is full of new men show em your tits and they offer to do the washingup dame wanda cackled juanita adjusted a glove with her teeth wanda she said very deliberately may i present jm powys the writer and bastard son of john cowper powys jm this is dame wanda carlisle and whispered to powys go with it we have to make her talk put your hand up her robe if you have to she was drowning in a red tide thick salty wetness in her mouth she awoke in terror from a long long long sleep with blood in her mouth breath bubbling through blood blood drying on cold arms she said please have i been in an accident what makes you think that i feel i cant feel no lie down you re all right youre fine no you havent been in an accident but i no i dont remember but im sorry to tell you my dear im very sorry to tell that you were attacked i i dont remember i dont remember what you were be calm you were raped diane nooooooo

that woman is come in come in solstice felishi felicitations have some mulled bowermead plonk dreadful piss they followed her into the opulent room with the velvet drapes the gold braiding and a superior coaleffect gas fire dame wanda rumbled at the drinks cabinet and knocked over a brass lamp bloody thing powys righted the lamp wanda squinted at him she wore lots of mascara which had blotched and run she looked as though shed been shot through both eyes when she flopped down on the sofa juanita sat next to her wanda listen to me wheres diane you remember plump girl jenna brought her last night and ceridwen was ceridwen here nobodys here darling nobodyt all youre saying youre alone all alone in this big house wanda poured wine clumsily were all of us alone and chilled by the

shouldnt wonder theyre on their uppers you know swhy hes so keen for the bloody road to go through done a dirty deal with government for about fifty acres got a drink have you darling yes said juanita but were going wanda stabbed her in the chest with a goldencrusted forefinger to stop them yes we are cridwen will cast the most enormous sodding spell not that ill be there bitches im not toh totally stupid know im just a figurehead also kept for menial chores like looking after little fucking verity whats the problem with verity i thought you were friends lord above said wanda im a fucking actress she leaned her head back into the sofas goldbrocaded cushions dyou know what ive to do today have to invite her for solstice tomorrow gawds up at dawn to join the fucking bishop on the tor and then verity for the duration you imagine that verity for solstice stringy old bird no breast wanda cackled she adjusted herself on the sofa picked up an imaginary phone oh but darling you simply must come no way you can spend solstice alone in that dreary dreary house and the other point you see is dilys my housekeeper has gawn down with this awful bug verity would you could you ive a lovely room overlooking st johns wanda beamed lecturing juanita now pleased with herself she seemed to have forgotten all about powys double whammy darling you see shell be desperate to come but shell feel it her duty to stay in that hellhole so the clincher will be the housekeeper line housemaid mentality that woman got to be doing for people or she doesnt feel jus justified in living powys nodded to juanita and moved quietly to the door piece of cake wanda was saying putty that woman dear little parcel under the solstice tree set of naff hankies with a monogrammed v basket of potpourri powys slipped out of the room and back down the thickly carpeted stairs he entered cauldron country there was a huge drawing room and library perhaps two rooms knocked into one a lecture room now with about thirty chairs in rows shelves around the walls held about twice as many books as you could find in carey and frayne but the same kind of stuff alphabetically arranged under fortune he found about forty volumes some different editions of the same book under powys nothing choosy or maybe no male authors on a plinth at the far end of the room sat an enormous rude goddessfigure not unlike the thing in the goddess shop window but carved out of oak with bangles and necklaces of mistletoe it was all very tidy no smells of herbs or incense but for the goddess it might have been a conference suite in a hotel there was another door between bookshelves powys found himself in wandas home temple it didnt make sense he told juanita outside it was done up like tutankhamens tomb only more comfortable sofas drapes nice coloured pillars a stone altar fat candles it felt as phoney as that woman looks why did she come here fell in love with the whole avalon bit juanita said thats the official story the truth is she went to dry out at a discreet newagey sort of health hydro a couple of miles out of town ceridwens friend jenna worked there realised that here was a woman with unlimited wealth in need of a cause the reason i know this my reflexologist sarah was doing sessions there two days a week jenna wasted no time introducing wanda to ceridwen who administered a little psychic psychotherapy next thing wandas bought this house and is spending a bomb on it i dont claim to be heavily attuned to this kind of thing powys said but if theres ever been a heavy ritual in that house its somewhere else isnt it this place is a front juanita shivered she looked ill now powys was very scared for her when wanda set up here this was when the cauldron really surfaced over her scarf juanitas nose was blue it became the goddess group virtually overnight all kinds of women whod never been seen at the assembly rooms attended cauldron meetings and lectures because of wanda including verity the lady with the pixhill papers i think we need to collect them dont you what about diane shes not here juanita she may have been brought here last night but theyve taken her somewhere else where does ceridwen live tiny little flat near the glastonbury experience arcade she wont be there too obvious juanita walked to the end of the mews where it led into high street time is it nearly tenthirty dianes been missing for over twelve hours we could tell the police shes twentyseven we cant say shes missing from home juanitas teeth were chattering her brown eyes were full of sickness youre going home powys said now the sleet had eased but it was very cold and the sky behind the tower of st johns foamed with purplish cloud four pixhills grave for the first time pel grainger had his partner with him the psychotherapist and sociologist eloise castell a slender blonde with a mideuropean accent who never seemed to smile verity had seen her at gatherings of the cauldron but they had not spoken shivering despite her bodywarmer verity followed the two of them up the garden under a hard sky which sporadically spat out sharp grey fragments of itself verity felt an ominous tug on her hip with every step it could not simply be arthritis it had come too suddenly it felt like colonel pixhills ghost urging her to stop them bring these foolish people back but dr grainger was jovial and bulging with confidence he hadnt even knocked at the door shed just seen them both walking briskly through the garden gate see just because people cant drink this water verity dr grainger called back cheerfully that is no reason to seal the well against the weather he wore a thick black cloak like the ones church ministers wore for winter funerals but surely verity ventured hurrying to keep up if anyone was ill they could then sue us for some enormous amount not if theres a sign specifically warning them not to drink hell you seal off an old well youre blocking an ancient energy flow water and darkness must not not ever be stifled the garden extending now to little more than threequarters of an acre was well tended by verity close to the house a small area of lawn which she kept mown and its hedges neatly trimmed then it narrowed a rockery began and so did the wilderness do be careful dr grainger unfortunately there are thistles and nettles we did once have a parttime gardener but when the well had to be sealed and people no longer came to it you know verity the more i think about this the more incredible see its clear from the name that this house was built in this location all those centuries ago precisely because of the well no wonder it lost its identity turned in on itself you have a scythe or something im sorry no that an old spade over there would you pass it to me thanks he began to slash at the brambles laying bare what used be a narrow path verity who hadnt been to this end of the garden in many years seemed to remember there once being cobblestones ms castell made no attempt to assist indeed seemed uninterested in what her partner was doing she paid no heed to verity either but gazed beyond the boundary of meadwells land to where glastonbury tor hung above them its base bristling with trees its church tower black as a roosting crow dr grainger his back to verity looked disturbingly neanderthal as he swung the spade like an axe smashing through a clump of tall thistles verity clutched her body warmer to her throat she saw that ms castell was watching her now with a crooked little smile i dont like you verity thought suddenly she was not one to make snap decisions about people and wondered if this was another warning communicated to her by the colonel dr grainger let out a small yip hey i think we found it he stepped back goddam is this a crime or is this a crime they had emerged into a circle of concrete surrounded by a low wall bramblebarbed and overhung with twisted brittle bushes most of them clearly dead or dying yeah said dr grainger i feel it all is cool at the centre of the circle was a raised concrete plinth about four feet in diameter he stabbed at it the spade rang dully on the concrete chalice well where the holy grail was said to have lain was at the top of a lovely garden by the foot of chalice hill which flanked the tor below the well were circular pools of redbrown water it was owned by the chalice well trust and on summer days people would pay an entrance fee and sit or lie on the grass eyes closed in meditation verity had always wanted to think the meadwell had been like this once a place of ancient peace it looked harsh and desolate now and in truth she had never seen it otherwise when shed arrived to take up the post of housekeeper the meadwell had already been partially scaled and colonel pixhill never spoke of it you have a pickaxe someplace oh verity stumbled feeling a sudden intense glow of pain at her hip almost immediately it began to fade dr grainger i really dont think hmmm there may be too much light there a metal cover under here like with the chalice well i believe so but yeah he said thoughtfully see you hit it with harsh sunlight after all these years the shock could completely negate the effect am i right here eloise ms castell stood back i sink the well should certainly be in shadow when the cover is raised the emanations will be powerful after all these years of confinement and the energy goes kind of whoosh whereas we seed a gentle subtle mingling he made sinuous snaking movements with his hands verity felt herself begin to tremble ms castell said maybe first we put over it a tent to subdue the light ya verity grasped the stump of a dead tree to steady herself dr grainger are you a christian what the question seemed to throw him im sorry its just that the type of clothing you habitually wear makes you seem rather like a priest so i well he gave it some thought pursing his little round lips i guess i think of myself as a scientist first my lifes a search for understanding i dont like to be too much in awe and also theres the tenebral conflict out of the darkness and into the light i cant buy that christianity makes too many naive assumptions i guess that answer your question yes im sorry verity turned back to the old house crouching in the shadows of the grey morning i dont think i can let you do this dr grainger froze the spade in midair whaaat i cannot let you expose the meadwell verity he peered at her as though he thought she might have been replaced by someone else and he hadnt noticed im very sorry dr grainger she rose up in her tiny shoes the colonel would not wish it the colonel dr grainger was hallgrinning in amazement we are talking here about pixhill the late pixhill i sink said ms castell in her somehow unconvincing mideuropean murmur zat colonel pixhill felt himself to be in a defensive position as regards the world in general he wanted to close himself in to seal up all points or access the well permits water from the hill maybe from under the tor to enter his domain and so she shrugged all around lay rubble and uprooted dead bushes their whitened branches like bones verity was beset by the disturbing sensation of dr grainger and ms castell hacking into colonel pixhills grave how dare this woman speculate about the colonels state of mind please leave dr grainger kicked away a slab of concrete dislodged by his spade i dont think so he said this is important to me now juanitas head twisted on the pillow her hair felt damp on her neck she could hardly focus on the thin red line slicing jims painting in half on the wall opposite the bed im going to call a doctor powys said he sounded scared that made it worse she was frightened for diane and he was scared for her no have you got that you know what a doctor would say and im not im not going back just been overdoing it i need a rest and the worry a glass of still spring water stood on the bedside table a red and white striped straw in it she tried to sit up and take a sip she fell back powys held the glass for her im not leaving you like this youve got to she tried to smile besides you know how badly you want to know about the missing pixhill stuff itll wait it wont wait none of this will wait ok if you wont see a doctor what about banks id rather die if you dont mind christ juanita hes an old woman hell fuss around ok ok call him hes in the index she closed her eyes patches of grey and black coalescing last transition disillusion and decay draught of death hey will you look at this dr grainger squatted down its iron and theres some kind of a symbol here if i can just get out verity said icily get this slab of concrete out the way come check this out eloise you know how the lid of the chalice well has these interlinked circles symbolising the conjoining worlds see what were looking at here verity flew at him the way stella the little cat had flown at her from the cupboard on the night of the abbots dinner unfortunately she didnt have the claws for it her housework blunted nails raked ineffectually at his tight black shirt she felt a wrench from her hip and stumbled verity for chrissakes what the fuck is the matter with you the spade fell back into the beatendown bushes behind dr grainger verity was aware of eloise castell drifting mildly away watching the struggle with that same supercilious unconcerned smile on her thin face please go verity was on her knees in the dirt please leave at once verity cmon listen to me grainger put his hands on her shoulders holding her away from him holding her down hear me out i dont want to know im grateful for all your help with the darkness please send me a bill her hip was aching abominably now but he wouldnt let her rise verity listen up my studies are entering a new phase extending naturally into the psychic ecology of caves and tunnels and ancient wells are an aspect of the subterranean tenebral network i had neglected to consider until eloise here made some connections for me now if you think that the ah ambulant shade of colonel pixhill is gonna be offended then well respect that well replace the covering later after we check it out he was very strong verity couldnt move ms castell was kicking at the crumbled concrete with her cowboy boots pel ve are vasting time maybe i fetch oliver verity dr grainger persisted with his wellhoned soothing intensity nobody appreciates more than i do the kinda stress youve been under what the psychic ecology eh the bushes parted a man stood there subterranean psychic network wow the man wandered down from the bushes a black and white dog at his heels sorry i was just passing couldnt help overhearing any chance you could decode this impenetrable jargon for me dr graingers grip on veritys shoulders eased she scrambled up you see i may be wrong here but it sounded like you know complete bollocks he stepped down to the meadwell plinth he was quite a young man although his hair was grey the dog did not follow him it stopped at the edge of the bushes and growled it had only three legs the young man smiled bugger me its pel grainger isnt it sorry doctor grainger that would be i think an honorary postal doctorate from somewhere like the university of nerdsville indiana right who the fuck are you dr grainger picked up the spade im the um earthmysteries correspondent of the avalonian ill be reviewing your book the young man shook his head serious bullshit pel but you dont need me to tell you that you better watch your mouth or youll attack me with the spade pel said ms castell we go dr grainger started forward pel snapped ms castell dr grainger snarled and hurled the spade to the ground grainger and his partner walked back to the garden and down the path to the gate neither of them looked back powys pushed some slabs of concrete back over the well cover with his shoe waiting until they were off the premises before stepping down into a clump of dead thistles stark as brown pylons he was glad to be away from pixhills well as for arnold he wouldnt go near it thank you the little woman verity endicott smiled hesitantly thank you for your help it was a pleasure powys said honestly would you like a cup of tea perhaps i would love a cup of tea i um i was coming to see you i knocked on the front door but everybody seemed to be up here so he grinned apologetically i slipped over into the field came round the back way he followed her back towards the house you seem to be acquainted with dr graingers work miss endicott said a little the doorway of meadwell was like a fissure in an ancient tree she vanished into it like an elf he followed her arnold didnt arnold shuffled around on the path looking uncomfortable ok powys said whats wrong arnolds first peculiar reaction had been when they turned into the meadwell drive two yew trees meeting overhead gnarled fullbellied trees knotted with parasites and arnold had started to pant when the house came into view with its weathered stone mullioned windows and leafless creepers like torn fishing nets on the rocks the dog had begun to whine hed been ok once they got into the field but he wouldnt go near the well dowsers dog arnold used to go out with henry dogs like to please sniff out drugs or dead bodies arnold was attuned to less physical items well all dogs were psychic to an extent just that arnold had learned to tell you what most dogs would be surprised you didnt already know about well discuss this later powys told him then picked him up and carried him into the house you dont mind dogs miss endicott i love all animals a note of sadness there they entered the darkest room you could imagine in daylight stone walls like a castle corners which disappeared into black shadow he made out a huge inglenook like the maw of hell a long oak table he stopped this would just have to be the table where theyd laid out colonel pixhill please sit down miss endicott said im sorry i dont even know your name powys he put arnold down on the flagstones joe m powys at that miss endicott seemed to freeze her woodland mammals eyes were startled and then confused he saw that the skin around the eyes was doughy suggesting exhaustion her dry puckered lips formed the word powys but only a thin ribbon of breath emerged at that moment powys could almost swear the shadows in the room were moving how could shadows move without light he could never live here hed be constantly walking into the darkest comers just to reassure himself there was nothing there that really moved always scared that there would be something grisly shadowteeth closing on his fingers powys said miss endicott her small eyes coming slowly to life like the valves in an old radio as arnold screamed it was a sound powys had never heard from arnold nor from any dog hey he bent down and grabbed at him arnolds head came up his ears flat his eyes bulging with fear and a kind of fever when powys reached for him he lunged and snapped his teeth clicking together in the air once like a mousetrap and then skittered away his three sets of claws scraping frantically at the flags until he reached the oak door and began to hurl himself at it as if he wanted to smash his own skull break his own neck five preordained dont do this woolly sam said whatever you got in mind dont do it at woollys shop hed found hughie painter and his brother gav helping to board up the broken window woolly was loading stuff into his renault looking uncharacteristically dowdy in dark jeans a green waterproof jacket hed cut off his ponytail shaved his head at the front he looked older and unhappy where you gonner go sam planting himself between woolly and the renaults raised back door well first off woolly said im going to the cops to confess to what to whatever they wanner charge me with man get it over thats the main thing then im off to walk the line park the car some place take my bags and my tent walk the line and

there look heres hughie hes got kids mr fertile yet here he is nailing boards across your window hughie come on is woolly gonner weather this one or isnt he aint that simple sammy said big hughie my first reaction im angry i think whyd he do that is his brain even working then i think well hes a friend hes a good guy best councillor as you said we ever had besides which it couldve been any one of us hughie brushed sawdust from his beard what other peoplere gonner think though in the final analysis i cant say theres a lot of shit going round right now sammy lot of extremism so well maybe woolly does need to get away for a while sam shoved his hands in his pockets not what he wanted to hear he stared at his trainers for a couple of seconds ok spare me two minutes woolly over there excuse us lads he led woolly out of the square away from hughie and gav over towards st benedicts where it was quiet ive been at a bit of a loose end this morning sam said i just walked round looking for diane asking if anyones seen her dianes still missing since last night shit said woolly like i know shes done this before but i dont care if shes done it before or not things are different now sheesh woolly said looking hard at sam i can see they are yeah aint life runny let me get this other thing out ive been talking to people in and out of the shops people i havent talked to in years both sides of the fence what we thought was a fence theres two topics on everybodys lips the crash obviously but the other ones bowkett and his tor bill most people they just didnt realise they just never thought it could happen most people want it to happen woolly said theyve had it with the new age i reckon most people dont want it to happen ok maybe a lot do but still less than half lot of folk out there got no big feelings about magic and earthforces and all this crap but they do care about freedom and they dont want bloody griff daniel back so you stand against him take on your old man aw woolly some of these people like to go into the countryside and shoot rabbits watch the hunt and that they dont want me neither but i reckon youll see the size of the opposition look at dawn tomorrow when the bishop goes up the tor this christian pagan common ground stuff it might be crap but if the bishop comes out against archer and bowkett better im not there sam i got a bad feeling about that better im miles away sam had a major struggle with himself at this point not to tell woolly about the evil road burrowing through bowermead leaving the ashes of slaughtered trees also woolly said on a personal level this may be the last chance i get to walk the line before its sliced up he put out his hand youre a good boy sam i always said that diane could do worse he shook sams hand solemnly and walked towards the church and sam thought with a horrible jolt hes not going to come back not ever hes going to be found dead in his little tent near some forgotten standing stone woolly his sense of loss compounded woolly listen you gotter help us were all shit scared here about diane about the way this towns cracking up before our eyes you cant just walk out on us you cant verity unscrewed the top of the brown phial dr bachs rescue remedy if you can hold his mouth open i shall put three drops on his tongue does it work on dogs powys held open the car door it was snowing freely now why not said verity simply she leaned into the car from the other side arnold lay on the back seat a tartan travelling rug half over him powys patted him and then as if to give arnold the chance to bite him nuzzled his face into the furry neck arnold licked him apologetically it was different out here do you know what this is powys asked her i think i do verity squeezed the rubber bulb on the end of the glass dropper her wizened face tight with determination they had bathed quite a deep cut beneath the dogs ear where hed caught it on a nail protruding from the door theyd felt around his skull finding no obvious damage but his breathing was disturbingly erratic its simply the house verity said like she was shedding a great weight all animals hate it here a few weeks ago i had to take a very placid little cat to the cats protection league to be rehomed she went berserk attacked me they sat in the front the snow accumulated on the recumbent wipers powys was not anxious to go back in the house how do you stand it im a very dense person i do not see and lately theres been dr grainger to help me help you to cope with the dark i thought he was harmless i was very lonely you see and my friend wanda carlisle is very persuasive between them they persuaded you that this tenebral therapy nonsense was going to help you cope with what the house was throwing at you thats exactly it foolish wasnt i and yet when oliver pixhill came and made it clear he wanted me out grainger was very kind this is colonel pixhills son she nodded i thought they didnt know each other dr grainger appeared to be on my side i thought he was harmless you see he might be harmless his theories might be complete bollocks but bonding with the dark while unlikely to cause problems in most places could be well in a place like this it could be close to suicidal ive been very stupid loneliness i suppose verity looked out at the snow do you know why youre here mr powys joe im here to collect a parcel for juanita carey she turned and examined his face its funny she said you dont look at all like him hawthorn hops a little rosemary some other things matthew banks said whats it for juanita felt utterly limp shed drunk the herbal mixture and about three pints of water most of which shed surely sweated away it began in her feet a prickly heat like warm goosepimples crept up her legs like unwelcome flaccid hands and then her whole body instant sauna breasts and face burning up at least the duvet lay quite comfortably for the first time on her flayed thighs to which matthew had applied some ointment it had stung like hell at first but that was preferable to the other thing which came and came again a hot tide four or five times in an hour and left her flung against the headboard like a rag doll whats happened to me did i just do too much too soon or what forgive me matthew said but when did you last have your period no no no no missed one maybe two shock they said its normal the last transition for a woman what are you suggesting she panicked hitched herself up on her elbows listen christ it doesnt happen like this it cant be i mean it doesnt happen from nothing like overnight it doesnt come at you time and again not nothing and then jesus christ matthew no he straightened the duvet no it shouldnt happen like that they were all there all the main ones anyway weymouth sands maiden castle wolf solent porius morwyn owen glendower a glastonbury romance well naturally and the autobiography hardbacks too several in leather she had them arranged in what might once have been a bread oven in the jagged inglenook powys shrank back hed never seen all the books together before like a reception committee took you long enough boy what almost a yelp his senses swimming or maybe drowning i said id be most honoured verity repeated if you would sign them for me later perhaps im sorry he was imagining all the books spinning out of the black hole whizzing around his head blown by unearthly laughter i doubted him poor major shepherd assured me that someone would come he said i would know um look maybe were both in danger of overreacting do you think the high melodrama of it might normally have made him smile anywhere but here in a room like an ancient vault haunted by the leatherbound spirit of uncle jack of blessed memory the collected works seemed to shimmer on the shelves in triumph preordained in this hard cold uncompromising house it all seemed horribly preordained he thought about what diane had said about the three of them george pixhill john cowper powys and dion fortune the avalonians greygreen light from mean leaded windows tinctured the silver lettering on the spines of uncle jacks books verity and powys sitting once more at the old shadowed dining table where the colonels body had lain in state a brown teapot and cups on it now he came here powys said only once while i was here a tall and immensely striking man with curly hair and a hooked nose he sat well where you are sitting now i was so much in awe having read his work that i could not speak to him let alone ask for his signature on the books a brown paper parcel lay on the table between them are you going to open it verity asked it isnt addressed to me mrs j carey very private very firmly written fountain pen job do you know whats in here verity im perhaps as curious as you are mr joe powys felt on edge the nervous part of him needed to be well out of meadwell by nightfall something was building here and it wasnt a new jerusalem blakes dark satanic mills in this house you could almost hear those mill wheels grinding the other side of glastonbury it had always been here as had verity and not being sensitive was not necessarily a defence shed survived perhaps because she hadnt yet been personally attacked but now grainger would go back and report to whoever had set him up and wanda to come on to verity get inside meadwell and into the well itself for whatever reason this puzzled him too if they wanted to penetrate that well why not come at night graingers chosen medium go through the field as powys had done hack it open at their leisure can i use your phone the telephone was in the kitchen a lighter room because of its white walls one of which bulged out unpleasantly like a corpse under a sheet powys called carey and frayne he didnt get the answering machine he got matthew banks shes sleeping at last banks said ive made her comfortable she shouldnt be disturbed i shall stay with her as long as i can he left as severe pause glastonbury as we know it mr powys may be about to collapse into a chaos unseen since the dark ages but as juanita appears to be my patient now i must put her interests first i hope you understand that yes powys said im glad if she wakes up before im back tell her everythings tell her im doing my best whatever that meant he went back to open the brown paper parcel six extreme and everlasting the old vicarage coln st mary gloucestershire my dear mrs carey your no doubt somewhat bewildered receipt of this parcel follows either my death or my discreet removal to some secluded nursing home where the wheelchairs are locked up at night to ensure the inmates do not escape no do mot mourn for me my dear save all your grief you may well need it let me say at the outset that burdening you with this matter is something in the way of a last resort the flailing gesture of an old tired and sadly ineffectual man who has for some years been attempting to stay afloat in waters beyond his depth i was hoping to as they say sort things out myself with the help of others this has clearly not been possible in the time left to me especially as there now seem to be remarkably few others i feel able to trust also the situation seems to have escalated at an alarming rate as poor george implied it might as we approach the millennium be assured however that i would not expect you to do anything beyond coming to the rescue of my good and staunch friend verity endicott who is in grave and mortal danger standing as she does directly in the path of and god help me i do not exaggerate an old and utterly merciless evil oh mrs carey how it pains me to have to use language of such biblical intensity yet i beg of you not to dismiss it as nonsense as i to my shame have done in the past as a highly intelligent and worldly woman you must have wondered many times why in seeking a strictly limited outlet for george pixhills diary we approached you and indeed your shop was hardly picked at random from yellow pages the truth is that despite your merits as a bookseller and indeed your not inconsiderable personal charms you were chosen primarily because of your long association with diane ffitch a young woman who i am obliged to say may now also be in danger of a most extreme and everlasting nature i do not know the girl but i rather suspect it would be unwise to show her this material directly perhaps the facts could be broken to her in stages i leave this to your personal assessment of miss ffitchs state of mind as you can imagine my association with colonel george pixhill and how often i have cursed the poor man has compelled me to delve with a good deal of distaste into arcane and occult matters better left in my view to moulder among the pages of ancient and disreputable books perhaps your professional knowledge of such volumes will render some of this more accessible to you than it has over the years been to me as i may have mentioned the most important items here are the missing sections of the pixhill diaries which we were unable for reasons which will become apparent to publish you have probably asked yourself many times what was the point in publishing the diaries at all and in such a restricted fashion well firstly as i have tried to explain george was most insistent that his knowledge of the dark chalice become not widely known but yet accessible to those might find it meaningful at a time when the twothousandyearold glastonbury tradition would face a terrible challenge i believe that challenge is upon usor upon you secondly it is especially clear to me now that had we not published when we did the pixhill diaries would never have seen the light of day i did not realise for a long time how close george was to the source of it and that some of the danger might emanate from within the pixhill trust itself it can only have been a rare prescience on my part that persuaded me to publish the diaries when we did and to entrust them to an outside agency that is your good self how drastically things have changed in that short time i had my health then and there was a sound nucleus of us old comrades at the heart of the trust as i write i am the only founder member left alive when you read this there will be none of us left unclaimed by disease senility or accidents of the kind which tend to befall the elderly had i been a wiser man i might have sought protection ah but we are old soldiers used to an enemy we can perceive how could we have had any idea of the possible implications of helping out a friend i have no more to say let george pixhill speak for himself thank you my dear from wherever i am i pray for you for verity and for miss ffitch god bless you all timothy shepherd powys folded the letter in his head a big book fell from a shelf a tweed hat swung on a branch a steaming black bus roared through the night the irony of it did not escape don moulder he laid the tenpound notes one by one in the scrap dealers outstretched hand threethirty threeforty threefifty fat grey snowflakes came down on the yard like sheep at feeding time what you gonner do with it then the scrap dealer asked none o your business don moulder wound the rubber band round the remains of his wad three hundred and fifty exactly what hed been paid for letting the parasites in a terrible ripoff but it could be bad luck to haggle you wanner start im up have a gander at the engine the dealer trying it on now no thank you bloody morbid you ask me said the dealer bold bugger now hed got his money well no bugger is askin you so you keep your trap shut mister the scrapdealer grinned pocketed the money the extra fifty for the time of delivery don moulder drew him a little map after dark well after dark all right no need to knock on the door i dont want the wife to know you just leave it there got that don walked out to his old subaru he didnt want anyone to see it till the bishop arrived at dawn verity put the letter down such a kind man she said is that all you can say powys drank half his disgusting camomile tea without blinking this guy thinks youre in mortal danger standing he picked up the letter in the path of and god help me i do not exaggerate an old and utterly merciless evil what does he mean do you know do you have any idea verity went prim i really dont consider myself qualified to attempt a definition powys tried another one what does grainger think is inside that well energy that is what he said energy which has been stifled i heard that verity i didnt believe it i dont think you believed it they had taken the parcel into the kitchen even with all its lights on the dining room was not the most suitable place in which to read for long verity poured him to his dismay more camomile tea joe im sorry you will have to excuse my apparent unwillingness to cooperate im unsure unsure of what i know and what i only think i know more than that im unsure of how much the colonel would wish me to say hes dead verity he remains through his trust my employer who runs the trust now then faceless people verity said solicitors accountants and oliver i dont know how oliver worked his way in as an employee i am not party to such administrative details but they didnt get on i fear thats something of an understatement after mrs pixhill had her breakdown she and the boy went to live in a rented flat in the town neither of them would have understood why the colonel could not sell meadwell meadwell was the reason for her breakdown it couldnt have been easy verity said for any of them and oliver was resentful oliver hated his father joe the thought that the work of the trust might now be influenced by a man who would do anything to besmirch the colonels memory fills me with horror and what is the work of the trust whats its actual purpose officially verity said to further the cause of peace and harmony in a troubled world rather inexact im afraid but unofficially unofficially verity hesitated unofficially to prevent meadwell falling once more into the hands of the ffitch family how did my mother die i wondered when you would ask that they told me what she died of they never told me how she go on i dont know what im asking i think you do sometimes she awoke thinking it was morning thinking shed slept a very long time sometimes it was as if shed only minutes before closed her eyes sometimes she felt relaxed sometimes frightfully agitated always this question at the back of her mind someone someone said she was pushed downstairs well there you are you do know dont you do you need the bedpan again nurse fetch a bedpan please why wont you tell me you were there no one knows more than you because you must work it out for yourself and decide what to do about it who pushed her you know who pushed her you were very small not yet born but you know your mother told you through the blood seven lourdes and slowly it all began to make a kind of incredible sense as he read page after page of primitive typescript powys lost all contact with his surroundings he was entering pixhills avalon here was the lost heart of the diaries insert the missing chapter the missing parts of existing chapters and what you had was no longer the aimless ramblings of a man without a discernible purpose but the record of a tense thirty year defence campaign by the stoical old soldier and whether she was aware of it or not a little spinster who could not see first there was the section of the introduction bridging the void between pixhills vision of the tor in a stifling tank and his arrival in glastonbury it opened with the colonel back home in a military hospital where trying to pin down the image i produced drawing after drawing of the conical hill i had seen and showed it to everyone who came through the ward they looked at my rough efforts to humour me i suppose and shook their heads until one day a dapper man in a goodquality brown suit came to visit me he pulled a chair close to the bed and took from an inside pocket one of my drawings which he said one of the doctors had passed on to him glastonbury tor he said in somerset there is no mistaking it it is a place we ourselves have been made aware of lately we i said suspiciously at which he took out his wallet and produced his papers quite an eyeopener my visitor one stanley willett turned out to be a highly placed civil servant in the war ministry intelligence i guessed for these fellows will never say as much he then began to question me closely about my apparent obsession with glastonbury tor he started to throw names at me one in particular had i had any contact he demanded with a certain violet mary firth known to her readers as dion fortune well of course the name meant nothing at the time and it seemed to me that whatever line of research he was pursuing i could be of no great assistance but this was wartime no time for secrets between fellows on the same side i therefore feeling somewhat embarrassed related to willett the circumstances of my vision in the desert to my surprise he neither laughed at me nor attempted to belittle the experience my life i suppose would have been happier if he had do you think the doctors would mind if i were to smoke he asked hardly i said all the doctors smoke keeps this place going tobacco we both smoked in silence for some time and then he sat back and observed me shrewdly through his rimless spectacles weve been studying your record pixhill youre a man of intellect rather than action who nevertheless adapted to his circumstances with courage and resourcefulness we could send you back to the front when you re fit to leave here as i fully expect you will i said or we could send you to glastonbury he held up my drawing to the hill of visions a very significant spot did you know that think carefully before you answer my immediate notion was that the tor concealed some clandestine bombproof hq it would explain the secret services concern if some shell shocked patient at a military hospital was turning out crude drawings of a secret subterranean refuge for mr churchills war cabinet but it was nothing so orthodox for mr stanley willett was to be my first introduction to miss dion fortune and the watchers of avalon powys sat up so fortune had been pixhills teacher how had diane known pure guess wishful thinking hed read about the watchers of avalon but apart from df he didnt know who they were or precisely what theyd got up to he went outside to check on arnold let him out to relieve himself arnold did this on a rear wheel of the mini and then immediately hopped back into the car it was nearly dark now and the snow was as fluffy as a sheepskin on the roof of the mini against the snow meadwell looked even darker violet firthdion fortune said willett was an unqualified freudian psychologist who had been drawn into the occult and had become a member of a rather fashionable magical society of the period known as the hermetic order of the golden dawn among whose betterknown adherents had been poet wb yeats and that sinister shyster aleister crowley miss firth or mrs evans as she was then though parted from her husband went on to form her own occult fraternity called the society of the inner light which drew together her interest in both christian and pagan mysticism it was this loose organisation which interested willett and his colleagues for dion fortune it seemed had joined the war we all knew of hitlers obsession with the occult and himmlers aryan fantasies centred on his medieval schloss dion fortune it seemed was convinced the nazis were using black magic against the allies and that a suitable defence should be fashioned to harness the group mind of the nation and shield our islands from this alleged psychic onslaught members of the society of the inner light throughout britain were therefore recruited into the watchers of avalon and given their instructions in a series of monthly bulletins from df herself working both from london and from her home on the very flank of glastonbury tor as willett understood it they were all to meditate at a prearranged time simultaneously visualising the same powerful cabalistic symbols and forming a kind of psychic wall around these islands they were taught to visualise as the mystical beating heart of the british psyche a place referred to as the cavern under the hill of vision each week the minds the souls the inner consciousness of the members of the society of the inner light would gather here glastonbury tor of course i saw my own drawing with new eyes seemed harmless enough to us willett said last thing wed want to do is discourage this biddy if all the harebrained mystics in the country are turning their minds to hitler it cant harm anyones morale but we would to keep an eye on them thats where you come in pixhill youve had a rough time spot of convalescence in order i think nice place somerset oh dear i said i felt an excitement tinged with a very definite trepidation i remember wondering what the cricketer had let me in for now perhaps in a week or so you could drift along to glastonbury willett suggested tell a few people about your ah vision see who you encounter if these people trust you wed like you to stay there keeping us informed from time to time about what exactly is going on my eyes widened you mean as a sort of secret agent a spy me i was never a master of subterfuge not much of an actor you know willett chuckled precisely you have an honest ingenuous face pixhill and i really dont think we should use words like spy do you thing is what we really want to know is all this mumbo jumbo having any actual effect the fact you yourself stuck in a tank in libya were getting pretty unmistakable pictures of their socalled hill of vision may well suggest that something is being transmitted i was staggered had i in my weakened state passed to a higher plane of consciousness and become the unwitting recipient of a psychic broadcast by the selfstyled watchers of avalon you see if it turns out that this woman is having an impact said willett we want to know about it because if it actually works to some extent i think youll agree it could hardly be left in the hands of a collection of eccentric women and fuddled old occultists however wellintentioned they might be get my drift ah the arrogance of the man to imagine that a bunch of war office boffins could take over a mystical tradition over two thousand years old as a psychological weapon but of course i was intrigued whatever the source of that vision of the tor i was convinced it had saved my life perhaps this was why perhaps this was the part i was destined to play in the liberation of the world from fascism and so ten days later upon my discharge from hospital i journeyed for the first time to glastonbury at this point the story was picked up by the text of the published diaries pixhills arrival in glastonbury his impressions of the town and its people their wartime spirit but in the published diaries he was hazy about individuals especially one powys felt a small thrill of unease pixhills first description of her corresponded so closely to his own impression formed out of avalon of the heart that he couldnt believe he hadnt read it before she was waiting for me in the garden a hefty jovial woman comfortably middleaged she wore a thick blue woollen dress with several rows of beads on her mantelpiece bosom a chairwomanofthewomensinstitute sort of person certainly not my idea of a high priestess of isis so she said you are the young man who has come to our town in pursuit of a vision i nodded feeling duplicitous in the extreme i had been summoned no better word for it into the presence the previous evening i had spoken of my desert experience to a curious collection of misfits lodging at the house in which i had found accommodation in the bovetown are now i had been approached by a small boy in a schoolcap who informed me that mrs evans would be expecting me for tea at fourthirty her bungalow among the trees at chalice orchard was a much more primitive structure than it is today someone it appeared had donated to her an old army shed or nissen hut i had approached it as you would a shrine with my head down df of course knew at once why i was almost afraid to raise my eyes wait she commanded dont look yet come this way she guided me through a welltended garden fragrant with the perfume of herbs and on to a small paved area now she said look up i could feel the blood literally draining from my face as i raised my eyes to the emerald majesty of that all too familiar sacred hill its church tower rushing away from us into the clear spring sky i do not know if i actually fell to my knees i know i wanted to yes df said as i recovered my faculties that is all i need to know you are the one i must have blinked it was one of those moments when the world stands still and you know that your life is about to change forever how was i to know then that those moments are all too commonplace in the rarefied air of avalon it doesnt matter that was the moment well george said df dont just stand there like a complete nincompoop follow me i suppose that is what i did from that day until she died a few all too short years later she was the most remarkable person i have ever met she taught me who i am and that what we are is seldom what the world sees i cannot imagine how many hours i spent in the bungalow at chalice orchard sitting on handmade wooden chairs and surrounded by roughly hewn local pottery homespun mats and linens drinking tea from a pot which as she told me proudly it would have taken a sledgehammer to crack df born in north wales of yorkshire stock liked things to be sturdy honest and without compromise it was hard to imagine her as a robeandpentacle person although when i saw her thus attired i believed in her just as completely you are the one as if she knew that i would come but what would a woman like this want with an invalid soldier whose metaphysical experience was limited to the cricketer and a fevered dream in a disabled tank if the watchers of avalon needed advice on military tactics there were surely betterinformed sources than myself to tap ah the watchers she said when i let slip a reference as i had tried to explain to willett i have a limited capacity for subterfuge i wont embarrass you by asking how you knew about that but yes we use the idea of gwyns cavern as a focus a gathering point the energy here as you obviously realise is hugely powerful df and willett there was no contest as to who was more formidable i was approached by one of our chaps i confessed at our second meeting to find out if you were having any effect on the enemy so df slapped her thigh but how wonderful they are taking us seriously a breakthrough indeed they do not like to dismiss the idea of a secret weapon i said at that she grew serious george you must not let them think of us engaged in any kind of psychic warfare our role is one of protection to ensure that no jackboot ever steps foot on this sacred soil we are all too aware of the laws of karma to attempt to invoke forces of an offensive nature no matter how justified we may feel to launch a psychic attack is to walk the left hand path the first step along this path is an easy one to go back requires ten times the strength at this point she produced a copy of a book she had published some years earlier entitled psychic self defence let this be your bible george you are a trained soldier in a just cause but to invoke negative forces even for a positive purpose can get you into a lot of trouble as i know from personal experience and incidentally this experience has a bearing on my reason for bringing you here bringing me here but surely i told her of my assumption that i had somehow tuned in to a signal broadcast as it were by the watchers oh no george she said the signal was for you or for someone who turned out to be you for a vital and specific task i have need of an individual who is clever but uncomplicated strong but sensitive i therefore placed what you might call an advertisement via the inner planes powys said colonel pixhill came to glastonbury after answering an advert df placed on urn the inner planes did you ever discuss this with him by the time i arrived verity said mrs evans was several years dead no he did not discuss her the inner planes powys thought the psychic internet he sighed the war will end df said it may take some time yet but the allies will win and hitler will never land here our own small part in the defence of britain will never be acknowledged nor widely known but that is as it should be no george the reason i sent for you relates to a danger which far precedes the rise of nazism and will be with us when hitler is long gone it may not become fully apparent again until the end of the century and while i and a certain gentleman remain alive it will certainty he contained however i suspect my own time here is limited i protested she was in formidable health she held up a hand death is a mere station between trains george theres a spirit in avalon which is far more important than the transition of individuals i dont want that to die not again the abbot abbot whiting verity this was the first death the first death of the spirit of avalon november the fifteenth was a very solemn day for the colonel we have a dinner the abbots dinner powys thought about what woolly had said tis all gonner be washed up againlast time this happened the dissolution of the monasteries when the state fitted up the abbotcan you imagine what it was like here after that when they hanged whiting stripped the abbey it took centuries to recover and when the spirit came back it was in different form a recognition of the pagan element but a kind of coming together this was the original message of the cauldron verity said a convergence of goddess worship and the marian tradition i suppose this was what encouraged many of us to go to the lectures that and a chance to see inside dame wandas house perhaps verity smiled right at the end of avalon of the heart powys thought df describes herself as an impenitent heathen but shes got a soft spot for the catholic church expresses the hope that glastonbury will one day become the english lourdes this was over ten years before she summoned pixhill eight depth of evil when the spotlight came on it made the mini look older and shabbier and the whole idea like a nonstarter too late to turn back now the man in the leather cap he presumed was rankin looked deeply suspicious especially when he saw the dog in the back of the car it gets even worse mate powys said cheerfully the only department of transport id ive got is a driving licence all you have to do is con them long enough to get into the presence tell you what lets forget it ill be back at the ministry on monday ill ring lord pennard from there if you get any trouble before then youll just have to ask the police to sort it out we dont work weekends since the cutbacks oh and if the press ring just tell them no comment and hope for the best powys smiled blandly and got back in the mini cheers then he slammed the door rankin opened it again look hang on you can understand i mean turning up in an old car with a dog in the back sure sure i probably look like the local poacher i know all the local poachers rankin said of course you do sorry no as you can imagine after newbury and batheaston and twyford down weve learned that going around in a ministry rover wearing a pinstripe suit and carrying a briefcase is rather asking for trouble rankin nodded tentatively he was a hardlooking bastard m his fifties a man with one boss at newbury powys said colleague of mine had all four tyres slashed and the words green power scratched across his bonnet in letters about a foot long no bloody joke especially as were now obliged to keep a staff car for three years or eighty thousand miles whichever all right rankin said ill call the house tell my wife youre on your way mr powys had to give his real name in case they checked his id but he pronounced it poeis no basic reason why the name should put rankin or pennard on their guard but you could never be sure he drove up the straight drive bare trees gathering snow either side rankin watching the gate the road surface was pitted an indication that pennard had no money to throw away the house was as hed imagined it possibly even grimmer jacobean or earlier but shabbily victorianised no finesse didnt even look like local stone not many lights economy again any thoughts arnold since his ordeal at meadwell arnold had been a little diffident lying on his rug slightly cool with powys not even glancing at rankin should have warned me powys ok i didnt know about that place i really didnt know know now though he parked the car directly in front of the house at the foot of a flight of six steps already slippery with trodden snow there was an unattractive doubleglazed porch a light came on behind it inside the porch a door of heavy new oak was already open a weatheredlooking woman stood there tweed skirt and jacket hair tightly braided mrs rankin housekeeper a tight ship there was a son as well training to be the huntsman in charge of the hounds according to verity who knew these things follow me please inside it looked and felt like an oldfashioned office complex heavy panelled doors in walls of butchers shop white all the interior lights had lowwattage bulbs on show through clear shades lord pennard will see you in the gun room not the old mellow kind of gunroom with racks of purdeys and the heads of victims on shields there wasnt a single gun on show only steel fronted cabinets there was a practicallooking desk with a stack of copies of horse and hound and shooting times under a bright white shaded metal lamp a leather chair and a straightbacked leather sofa of the kind you round in solicitors waiting rooms an electric fire was on if the only womans touch at bowermead was applied by mrs rankin all of this figured she didnt invite powys to sit down and he didnt he was in that was what mattered lord pennard kept him waiting for ten minutes plenty of time for nervousness to develop well nobody had said this was a good idea there just wasnt another one juanita was ill diane was missing and verity little verity was bearing up under the circumstances mr powys he filled the doorway he did not say poeis juanita awoke feeling sodden and soiled the duvet limp on her like a tarpaulin she couldnt bear it any longer needed to get out of the bed into the shower blast away the halfdried sweat which coated her like soured cream cheese matthew turned on the shower for her how long was i asleep no more than an hour im afraid you were rather distressed juanita i shall have to go soon i have to see wanda carlisle im taking her to the tor before dawn to meet the bishop need to get to bed early got an alarm call arranged for five sorry youve done too much for me already the water was hurting juanita coming down on her like hot nails her flayed thighs were stinging like a very bad nettle rash she held her arms out in front of her like a sleepwalker to prevent contact with her precious hands only the pain kept her this side of hysteria when she could take no more she stepped out and into a towelling robe with wide loose sleeves she couldnt dry herself matthew turned off the shower she sat in front of the biggest radiator drying inside the robe afraid to ask him did i while i was asleep she was just so exhausted juanita he pulled over a dining chair a lot of women consult me now they want a herbal alternative to hrt perhaps they find it easier to talk to me because im gay but i do think i help them its just matthew i had none of these symptoms not even yesterday can shock bring it on is there i mean its not even overnight but is there such a thing as an overnight menopause his lips tightened like the thin red line in jims painting i think you should see a doctor i have to say ive never encountered anything like this before im sorry juanita im out of my depth powys had declined pennards offer of a whisky could have done with the courage but a clear head made more sense our information is that it could happen anytime he said we just thought you ought to be warned why they wont get in lord pennard snapped out a bunch of keys he was dressed as though ready to stop them himself khaki shirt moleskin trousers his eyes were piercingly blue his hair a kind of gunmetal grey almost a pity havent had a siege here in centuries he crossed to the metaldoored cupboard fitted a key into it turned it anticlockwise twice both doors fell open a line of shotguns like black organ pipes pennard took one down you shoot powys powys shook his head not much need for it in the um dtib not yet anyway wish there was then do you pennard took down a box of cartridges my head of department has been known to express a desire to blow a few um protesters away pennard broke the gun dropped in a cartridge then another so let me get this absolutely straight youve come here to inform me that a bunch of these ecoguerilla chapsve caught a whisper that weve been preempting things on the new road how did you get that information weve um infiltrated the movement cant say more than that have to protect our informants lord pennard quite pennard snapped the gun shut with a ferocious click powys thought if hes trying to intimidate me hes succeeding good of you to drop in and tell me powys in your undercover attire too suppose you need to mix with these scum do you gather your intelligence sometimes the problem was he hadnt decided on an actual strategy beyond getting in to see pennard meeting the guy rather reduced the options the handful of lords and dukes powys encountered while exploring their grounds for ancient sites had been generally affable so confident of their status they could be almost humble and youre prepared to protect us are you pennard said gun in his arms if things get rough well we um we value your cooperation in this rather delicate situation delicate powys whats delicate about it well some people seem to think the road will damage not so much the natural ecology as the um spiritual ecology if he wasnt careful hed be talking like pel grainger in what way pennard demanded well these people consider this particular landscape to be sacred more so than anywhere else in britain damned idiots then arent they depends on where you stand i stand on my own land powys where do you stand we civil servants powys said we generally stand where were told to stand lord pennard shouldered the twelvebore sighted on the ceiling and then brought the barrel down until its two holes were aimed either side of the bridge of powyss nose know what i think powys i think youre a damned liar powys swallowed to begin with pennard said i dont for one minute believe theres such an organisation as the department of transport investigations branch he moved the gun barrel an inch or two to point at the leather bench sofa siddown his eyes were diamondhard powys sat lets have it then all right powys looked away from the gun i said i was with the department of transport because you wouldnt have seen me if id told you who i really was which is oh im just a bloke who writes daft books and ive been helping out with the magazine dianes going to be editing where is my daughter i wondered if you might know i dont you ought to powys said dont you think pennard was silent the gun barrel steady um do you really need that thing pennard lowered the twelvebore broke it youre right he slipped out both cartridges if the occasion arose i could tear your head off with my bare hands he hung the gun in the cupboard shut the doors and locked it powys said this thing you have about tearing peoples heads off would that be hereditary by any chance lord pennard went so stiff and so pale in the cold white lamplight that powys thought for a moment that the occasion had arisen youre either a brave man pennard said or an extremely desperate one and verity darling wanda said on the telephone youll never guess whats happened no said verity i dont suppose i will bloody woman always gets the flu at the wrong time i mean could you would you for solstice verity glanced at councillor woolaston who nodded i suppose i am at rather a loose end splendid ill have your room ready shall we say one hour im not happy about this verity said replacing the receiver the kitchen pipes gurgled with an ominous glee youre better out of this councillor woolaston said its not my place to be out of it youve done your time verity youve served him well better than he had any right to demand it never was in his nature to demand but i was thinking more of you you should not be here alone i wont be alone he said when they come to do the well councillor woolaston i dont think you realise the poor little man looked quite wretched his eyes deep with sorrow his beard almost white she was sure his beard had not been white the last time she saw him the depth of of evil that is in this place i know that sounds almost ridiculously melodramatic the end wall of the kitchen seemed particularly swollen tonight like an abscess about to burst oh said councillor woolaston with a nonchalance which only betrayed how little he now valued his own life and sanity i think i do i think ive known it for a long time go on verity man wanda dont get her gin and horlicks shell never be up in time tomorrow ill get my overnight case dont forget to switch off all the lights said the little councillor verity felt very afraid for him nine contaminant lord pennard uncapped a new bottle of famous grouse youll have a drink no th wasnt a question powys you will have a drink powys shrugged pennard poured him an inch of scotch in a thick tumbler and went to sit at his desk with the pile of hunting and shooting magazines so that devious milksop bastard pixhill wrote it all down if this is blackmail powys i have to tell you were not a good prospect the ffitches havent been for years not since the great days of the dark chalice bunkum pennard gazed into his scotch as if pictures might form there spent half a lifetime telling mself that father was a great believer always react against our parents isnt that the way of it like archers reacted against you outside the snow had turned back to rain and sprayed the window which was protected by metal security blinds powys pennard rolled the name around his mouth with a slosh of whisky you a descendant of the old hack maybe met him a time or two thought a good deal of himself talked and bloody talked but thats the welsh for you he wasnt welsh bugger should have been then thats what he thought too powys said did he talk much about the chalice not going to let that go are you no he didnt learned his lesson by then some chap in town forget has name convinced hed been portrayed in that damned great book as the villain of the piece sued the piss out of powys made bugger all from that book in the end served him right powys smiled come along pennard said get this over tell me what the bastard said you want the lot got all night i havent powys thought worrying about juanita and diane and verity and everything that might need to be done before dawn as far as i can gather he said your family seems to trace its roots in somerset back to the mideighteenth century at least the first viscount pennard roger ffitch like my father but the ffitches had held land in the area for a long time before that over two hundred years in fact basically since and the dissolution of the monasteries when a certain ffitch was rewarded for services rendered to the king pure legend its all legend but legends are often more persistent than facts only if you permit it said pennard get to the point ok fact glastonbury abbey was very rich and powerful and built out of the very cradle of christianity and henry viii had to crush it fact abbot whiting was a hard man to nail because he was an unassuming kind of guy who tried to help the poor and was consequently very well liked sir henrys hit man cromwell had to find a way of fitting whiting up fact in the end they found writings in whitings chambers criticising the kings latest divorce also a gold chalice from the abbey which he was accused of stealing lord pennard appeared uninterested and drank some whisky pixhill seems to think this chalice was later awarded along with a few hundred acres of land and a farmhouse known as meadwell to the man who agreed to plant it a benedictine monk at the abbey called edmund ffitch spelt f f y c h e who happily dumped his calling moved into meadwell and founded a famous dynasty fact pennard grunted inasmuch as meadwell was our first home the legend of course is that when whiting was hanged and then beheaded on the tor ffitch collected his blood in that same chalice in deliberate parody of joseph of arimathea catching christs blood from that famous spearwound on the cross in what became the holy grail thereby founding another tradition as you say pennard leaned back in his chair stretched out his legs chin on his chest legend littleknown one too so littleknown it was probably invented by pixhill to bolster his own fantasy of himself as a crusader sad little man you did have a family chalice though didnt you i wouldnt know he sounded very bored or trying to sound bored certainly not in my time and in your time powys was beginning to despair of denting the armour that is since the war the family hasnt exactly prospered has it investments collapsing bad seasons in the vineyards land having to be sold couldnt help noticing as i came in that youre down to using sixtywatt bulbs where you need hundreds youre an idiot powys perhaps the family has always associated its good fortune with possession of the chalice lose the chalice money starts to go down the toilet powys if your illustrious ancestord been able to make up stories as good as this he might evenve profited from his scribblings drink up man he advanced on powys with the bottle of grouse of course there was a down side powys looked up at him meadwell became somewhat spiritually tainted hard to live in always a miserable hole dont cover your glass its discourteous either drink with me or get out reluctantly powys accepted another inch of scotch so this place was built comparatively small at first but massively expanded after the industrial revolution by the outbreak of the first world war the family was very wealthy which brings us to the previous viscount pennard your father roger ffitch bit of a lad roger a bit cocky not being discourteous here am i my father pennard said no hint of a smile would have pulled your head off quite a few minutes ago did you admire him he was an obstinate man immensely brave wouldve received the vc after the somme if he hadnt shafted the wrong generals daughter but thats by the by since you ask i did not admire him he was a chancer a gambler and not only with money no pennard said soberly not only with money with his soul in fact powys said such as it was juanita dressed slowly painfully and impractically she still couldnt bear jeans tight or otherwise against her thighs her thickest skirt was black velvet calflength she dragged it on thumbs through the loops then wriggled into a sloppy lemon sweater the softest thing she had and it still felt like staff cardboard her skin was starting to feel moist again her head an oven in the kitchen she turned on the cold tap with her wrists put her head under the jet the water hurt so cold it burned matthew had left a glass of water with a straw a note to say there was a light salad which she could manage to eat in the fridge which she could manage to open blinking horrified at the clock she thought powys nearly nine oclock hours since hed gone to veritys a long time since matthew had delivered the message that powys was doing his best whatever that meant and no word from diane time to call the police time to call pennard christs sake stay cool sick joke she went down to the shop no messages on the answering machine she rolled the phone from its rest slipped out the meadwell number with the tip of a thumb bent over the receiver heard the number ring and ring and ring no answer no answer oh no she staggered back upstairs to the living room hell be back he will be back a little surprised at how much she needed him to be back him not just somebody to be with her to open things and switch things on him joe powys burnedout earthmysteries writer another jaded grailseeker she eased herself into the sofa her arms spread along its spine opposite her jims depiction of the mystical roads converging on the tor as beams of dying sun which lit the fields but not the tor a black silhouette a hill or shadow the pictures surface glistened and glowed tonight as though the paint was wet again as though the ghost of jim battle was breathing on it she didnt like that thought made her want to look away but the colours burned out of the canvas the sweat on her face felt as slick and rich as linseed oil there was a sour tang of turps she blinked water filmed her eyes colours smeared then there was a small movement on the picture could be a fly from the attic could be a spider crawling along one of the red sunbeams following the line exactly towards the tor nothing there it was the fever the room tilted she saw the fly on the move again except it wasnt a fly any more it was a small black bus swaying and rattling down the black road from the tor a noxious dinky toy stinking of burning oil and diesel smoke puffing around it feeding the blossoming shadows in the room a thin scream ribboned between juanitas lips as the carpet hardened under her feet like stone like tarmac she arose from the sofa edged towards the door of the sitting room keeping her mouth tight shut refusing to let the scream out corrosive fumes stinging her nose and it wasnt just smoke and oil there was a harsh acrid animal stench a tomcat smell a hundred times more pungent and the bus was coming at her spewing feral breath from the tornscab radiator between its heartless yellow headlights juanita burst out of the room tugging the door shut behind her shutting it all in there and she carried on tugging and wrenching long after the catch had clicked into place becoming gradually aware almost with a sense of awe that she was using her lurid pink patchedup frankenstein hands the right hand gripping the door handle the left hand around the right hand all melded together in a pulsing lump of crippled flesh fused to the handle as jim had been fused to his easels she felt no pain at all as she fell to her knees on the landing unable to breathe lungs full of black smoke head full of burning and those other images she suppressed even in her dreams the explosion of the sunset window jims blackened dead grin his boiling eyes behind the twisted bars in her arms her own hands torched in the night blue fire from sizzling fat the ash tree the dangling hat and then the pain as wild and brutal as crucifixion nails through both palms and the breath pumped out of her in hiccuping yelps as one hand came free and prised the other from the handle finger by finger powys put it to lord pennard that when roger ffitch came back from the trenches he was in a very bad state not so much physically as emotionally hell of a lot of chaps afflicted that way three weeks in some petty little skirmish these days and theyre sent for counselling gulf war syndrome falklands fever any of em even imagine what it was like at the somme but he did find counselling didnt he powys said did he he was directed to a psychoanalyst new word in those days who hed probably have rejected if she hadnt been blonde and twentynine years old with a certain glint in her eye id guess for the first time pennard looked fleetingly nervous youre not drinking he said not drinking with me watching him now powys could imagine the problems violet mary firth must have had with his father he would meet her at meadwell he didnt want his family to know that wouldve been a sign of weakness not his style not the family style pennard almost smiled anyway she does seem to have been able to help your old man with his nervous problems putting a stop to his recurring nightmares of the blood and the filth restoring his selfconfidence getting rid of that embarrassing nervous tic making it so he could function again he must have been impressed although he wouldnt have shown it couldnt let women get above themselves could you pennard didnt look at him but he really wanted her powys said my guess is he sensed her power something hed never encountered before and he wanted some of that too pennard snorted but because she was a woman he had to subdue her if she was into magic then hed bloody well show her magic the holy grail hed show her a real grail pennard was looking at him now this stuff was obviously new to him pixhill wrote about this he spoke almost mildly powys nodded your father took violet to see the dark chalice and then perhaps feeling that the power was at last his power he tried to make love to her pennard scowled did he rape her or did she manage to fight him off i prefer to think she did big strong girl maybe he was still weakened by the war asthma wasnt it still she was furious justifiably this was the man shed spent weeks helping out of his crisis maybe shed even fancied him a little whatever she didnt anymore he decided to pass over the next bit how violets hurt and her craving for revenge had manifested into an elemental force in the form of a wolf stay close to established fact maybe a month later roger ffitch comes crawling back to violet his nightmares have returned worse than ever what were those nightmares do you know pennard grunted before my rime all this if it ever happened which i doubt i dont think you do i think its making terrible sense to you now dont you threaten me you little shit pennard half rose from his chair fists clenched wasnt a threat jesus you bastards are so just finish your fucking story pennard sat down again and his hand shook as he poured himself more scotch all right your father sent a message to violet she refused understandably enough to go back to meadwell so they met in the george and pilgrims she um well she was shocked when she saw him hed lost over a stone in just a few weeks he was getting no sleep couldnt keep a meal down his tic that was back in a big way and his asthma had worsened to the point of being lifethreatening he was a holloweyed mess your dad and he virtually threw himself at her feet fighting for breath not his style pennard snapped meaning not our style powys shrugged as it happened violet hadnt been too good herself since exposure to the chalice if youve ever read pixhills diary youll know the kind of dreams she was getting glastonbury not as a peaceful haven but as a volatile unstable place and always potentially a battlefield the dark chalice could this be the antigrail was there a parallel tradition absolute non nonsense pennard scowled at the break in his voice and cleared his throat fucking bunkum so violet made a deal with your old man she would treat him again work with him and he would let her dispose of the chalice however she saw fit which wasnt going to be easy she knew that at that age she really didnt feel up to dealing with evil on this scale my guess is she probably consulted her own teacher theodore moriarty he ran a clinic specialising in cases like roger he went away lord pennard said suddenly a look of astonishment crossed his face my mother told me this many years later he went away for six months in to a clinic this is ridiculous a wave of anger quite visibly went through him shone in his eyes as his arm swept over the desk sent the whisky bottle spinning across the room until it hit the gun cupboard while he was away powys said being treated bydr moriarty your mother cooperated fully with violet she gathered some people leading magicians of the day powerful pagans and i suspect christian mystics and they took the dark chalice and they hid it just as joseph of arimathea or the fisher king was said to have done with the holy grail in a well pennard sighed powys heard the whisky gurgling out of the bottle into the industrial carpet below the gun cupboard they did their best with the meadwell they blessed it in the name of god they did a powerful binding ritual but its a bit like burying nuclear waste its not possible to destroy something like the dark chalice which exists on more than one level you can only contain it and hope for the best but its a hell of a contaminant i dont know where the well leads but thats a black spring now you can see what its done to the house i wouldnt know pennard said not our house anymore that was part of the deal roger ffitch agreed that when he died that house would be sold to violet firth who by this time had her own home and teaching base in glastonbury documents were drawn up your mother lady pennard was party to it of course but violet died first in as id guess she knew she would after her unique contribution to the allied cause met the woman once you know as a boy gave me a bag of sweets lord pennard actually smiled bullseyes never allowed bullseyes did you like her did matter of fact jolly like a scout mistress interfering bitch the fall of the house of pennard bunkum useless businessman my father incompetent all there was to it never the same after the war cracked up spent most of his last years in bloody church whatever all the wealth the family acquired with the chalice began to drop away so pixhill says he reckons you did everything in your power to get meadwell back bloody disgrace under the table deal while i was away in national service bloody pixhill what damn right did fie have to take away our property worth over a quarter of a million now that house of course i tried to get it back who was the bloody man just someone violet could trust she needed a custodian for meadwell she was only fiftysix when she died leukaemia shed known it was coming maybe years before you know what these people are like i doubt if it worried her death was just a station between trains that was what she told pixhill just saying it hearing himself powys felt aglow with the certainty of it all confirmation now in every response from pennard every change in expression every involuntary gesture what changed pennard didnt reply he reached for the whisky before remembering the bottle wasnt there anymore why did you give up the fight to get meadwell back powys said legal costs no no of course not pennard stood up whats your angle on all this powys what do you hope to get out of it book bloody bestseller powys shook his head ill be honest i was going to tell you id publish the whole thing if you didnt play ball and now its too heavy until just now i dont think i entirely believed it he leaned back at last on the stiff sofa i dont want to threaten you it would be the wrong thing to do i wont write about it pennard looked at him for a long time im inclined to believe you then tell me what changed why do you think i should because i think its something to do with diane powys said who according to the late chairman of the pixhill trust is in and i quote danger of a most extreme and everlasting nature and shes disappeared lord pennard collapsed into his chair he suddenly looked much older ten save them from themselves it was archer wasnt it she kept opening her eyes but they wouldnt focus she saw the blobs of faces around her in the gloom but their pictures fled as she tried to identity them flitting from one to another very quickly she thought she saw the pilgrims rozzie and mort and viper and gwyn she must be hallucinating dredging memories from the sludge of her subconscious but in the end she could concentrate on only one thought it was archer archer pushed her downstairs archer killed her capturing the certainty before sleep reached out for her ive never met him powys said reasonably never even seen him got no reason to think ill of him hell im not even very political working on information now that he hadnt found in pixhill papers piecing together what hed gleaned from juanita and particularly from verity verity who pattered about the streets and chatted innocuously sometimes inanely and heard things is this gossip lord pennard seemed stunned is this talked about i dont honestly think it is it just suggests itself maybe maybe it suggested itself to you how can i discuss this with you ive never even seen you before tonight certainly never heard of you you lied to get in here how do i know youre not lying now powys said nothing pennard had his head in his hands hed found another bottle of whisky my wife died after falling downstairs shed been to the nursery liked to spend time there been redecorated refurnished in pink she had her bed moved into the next room said she knew it was going to be a girl because a wise woman had told her my wife believed in such nonsense shed sit in the nursery alone and read for hours as though the fact of the pink paint could influence matters at that stage he drank some whisky his face no longer smooth and polished but blotched with tension closed that part of the house now dont heat it dont light it let it damn well rot if it falls down it falls down were you in the house at the time i was in here didnt like her in her maudlin nursery moping mood one of the maids still had maids then came to tell me theyd found my wife at the bottom of the stairs semiconscious called the doctor and the belvedere the private clinic sent a midwife with an assistant buggerall use they were how near to time was she seven months baby came out but the damned placenta wouldnt because of the fall place was like the inside of an abattoir he choked back something and became annoyed with himself and pushed all the bloodsports magazines to the floor powys said someone told me archer and his mother didnt get on who told you does it matter no its true this dark chalice business this blasted woman this fortune firth biddy spent a lot of time apparently with my mother while my father was away at his clinic whatever she told her my mother evidently passed on to helen my wife one christmas few glasses of wine told the boy about the legend of the chalice my wife was furious insisted it was up to the women of the family to exercise constant vigilance to counter any attempt arising from male avarice or poverty as she put it to unbind the thing archer of course was immediately enchanted well get it back father wont we damn it if he hadnt learned about it from me someone else would have told him sooner or later was that why your wife was so determined to have a girl because the women doubtless archer was ten at the time dont think she was ever close to him again almost afraid of him and of course he played up to that i remember he once walked in while we were having dinner solemnly carrying a chalice with a candle burning in it said hed found it buried in the grounds helen had hysterics turned out some boy had stolen the thing from st johns i think archer paid him it was smoothed over the sleet had stopped it was very quiet in the gunroom after a while lord pennard said had the sheets burned and the mattress and then the fucking bed chopped up and burned sat in the library window all the lights out watching the bed blazing in the walled garden powys thought nearly twentyeight years ago pennard would have been around his own age never imagined hed be feeling so sorry for the guy rankin did the burning been with us about a year soaked everything with paraffin lit up most of the lawn when the fire burned low rankin went away then archer came out pennard pushed his whisky away had enough cant get drink any more cant get merry yes archer came out arms full of toys and baby bedding from the nursery pink teddy bear i remember the pink teddy bear with a bow archer burned them all he was grinning the baby was born i couldnt look at her she had blood on her so i sat in the library in the dark and watched archer burn all the toys saw his grinning face in the firelight lord pennard began to weep after much frantic struggling juanita managed to get the shop door open and she threw herself out into the street blue coat under her arm into the empty town moving in a staccato sporadic fashion stubbornly doing normal things taking in images of ordinariness she walked across the zebracrossing to the post office looked into the phone box an oldfashioned red one but the coinbox and phone were modern a standup sandwich board said lps tapes cds rooks bought sold on the other side a sticker had been slapped across the board put glastonbury first tame the tor it was cold but the sleet had stopped leaving a thin glaze of slush on the pavement few feet tonight to trample it away the sky was clear again almost starlit there could be a hard frost icy roads alone on high street juanita felt utterly wretched but she couldnt go back couldnt live with those pictures couldnt take them down or hide them away that would be the final rejection for jim she struggled into her coat and stood for a while outside the delicatessen near the crossing she felt agitated her body twitching itching her hands ached abominably she felt used and betrayed as if her body had been strengthened just sufficiently to support the mindtwisting terror which began with the painting altering recreating itself in her head an unseasonal fly from the attic mutating obscenely into a symbolic black bus there were no roads at all in that picture no hazy ley lines somehow her mind had created them as an opening for the horrid black bus which came out of the shadowtor and tunnelled into her brain a black bus was not a real hippy bus hippies had rainbow buses the pilgrims though they were different gwyn ap nudd lord of darkness his sickle raised the pilgrims laughing because they knew the tor had betrayed jim and juanita the hill of dreams where shed sat all night and drunk cheap wine and watched for the good aliens the mystic hill which jim had painted reflecting the last light had reversed dramatically into the negative image of itself thus becoming a dark hill and spewed out the black bus of death and the good hopeful hippies who danced like butterflies and wished people love had given way to twisted embittered hippies children of the dark chalice she felt the whole town twisting and turning and tightening around her like the grey snakehair of the black priestess ceridwen who had diane diane juanita screamed where are you answer me nobody answered her alone on the cold wet street she sobbed and scuttled away a verity in the making there were questions he didnt have to ask any more like why lord pennard had abandoned attempts to get meadwell back why hed placed his daughter in the care of strict oldfashioned nannies who would take no nonsense who could be relied upon to keep her away from archer why hed sent her away to school after school why he wanted her to marry a man in distant yorkshire you could never be sure could you whether it was real or the whole thing was fantasy whether archer had actually pushed his mother downstairs and might one day do something similar to diane you were just trying to keep them apart as long as it was in your power to do so hes my only son when pennard looked up his face had hardened again my heir the next viscount pennard and before that hell be the mp for mendip south its coming right again powys were selling the land for the road the futures sound we never needed the chalice thats what archer thinks too is it get out go on pennard turned away we never had this conversation ive never seen you in my life just get out of my house do you know where your daughter is now have you any idea get out dont you think it might be a good idea to report her missing to the police theyd listen to you theyd pull out the stops pennard didnt reply he didnt move he was like marble powys found his own way out down a shabby leathersmelling passageway frugally lit rankin was waiting for him at the front door get what you wanted more or less thanks i was listening rankin said other side of the door what the aristocracy rankin shook his head sometimes they can be very naive quite often we have to save them from themselves he was half a head taller than powys held himself very straight his face was without expression because we need them you see theyre our backbone you might not think much of him and his kind mr poeis but theyve made this country what it is they deserve our protection most people have to protect themselves powys said nervously i cant let you spread this around rankin said very matteroffact you know that i had my son break into your car take it round the back of the house for tonight weve killed your dog sorry about that sorry about all of this but i take my job seriously and that man in there and what he stands for is worth ten of you and all the pathetic sods down in that town with their medallions and their dowsing sticks you understand that dont you sir all im saying this is nothing personal rankin held open the door after you he said eleven blood of the goddess powys went quietly rankin held open the doubleglazed door of the porch for him not good form to soil your masters premises powys noticed that it was cheap aluminium doubleglazing the economic way to cut heating bills he felt almost lightheaded as he turned to rankin and said you dont really have to do this do you you dont have to kill me wanting to sound at least frightened but aware that it only came out puzzled faintly incredulous that there could still be men like rankin who would murder without compunction if it was a matter of supporting the system which supported them wondering distantly as if he was watching from above or on a closed circuit tv how exactly it would be done one of those sas blows that drove your nose bones into your brain perhaps or a slim knife to the heart he wondered if his body would end up drawn and quartered like abbot whitings and buried under what would become the central somerset bathtaunton relief road its the way things are rankin said apologetically immediately outside the door he put on his leather cap preserving what has to be preserved so much of its gone you see yes arnold was gone weve killed your dog sorry about that well that wouldnt be hard a three legged dog recovering from shock while rankin was neatly closing the porch door he thought about arnold the night the vet had taken his leg off everything theyd been through since the long walks along offas dyke after which hed sometimes have to carry arnold home please he said knowing this time that there were real tears in his eyes cant you and seeing a definite naked contempt in rankins eyes in the half second before he felt his face contort in blind fury as he sank his left fist into the mans gut distantly aware as rankin doubled up of all his rediscovered new age credentials floating away into the ether surprised at the surge of maddened strength which hurled rankin back into the porch snarling fucking scumbag cunt a face smashing again and again into the doubleglazed door which did not break aware with a sense of dismay that it was his voice and rankins face fully aware that all this would have been entirely beyond him if rankin had not blithely mentioned having killed his dog hey shit come on pulling on powyss shoulder stop it you dont wanner go to gaol for shit like this powyss hands were covered in blood he got back to his feet rankin sat up on the top step and spat out blood his eyes were moving coldly weighing up the situation working out his best move powys kicked him in the throat bugger me sam daniel said as rankin went down gagging i thought this was the age of aquarius just lets get the hell out eh powys remembered now how hed called up woolly on the off chance he was still around needing someone to be at meadwell if verity got the call from wanda and woolly had turned up with sam whod offered to go with powys to bowermead hall slipped out of the car at the bottom of the drive to find his own discreet way in keep an eye out he killed arnold powys said rankin didnt move lay wheezing quietly to himself he what wheres the car its down there by those bushes sam said you left it unlocked remember i let the handbrake off and rolled it a few yards to the bushes out of the light to give me some cover as we ecoguerrillas say arnold hes lying on his rug what did you think why would this guy say hed killed him its the kind of guy he is powys or maybe he was going to or maybe somebody else shit powys turned and saw a mirror image of rankin at the foot of the steps dad this is wayne rankin sam said hes training to be as big a psycho as his old man wayne rankin was looking at powyss hands what you done to my dad your dad sam said made a slight miscalculation about the aggression quotient of new age man now just back off son its two against one and neither of us is in the best of moods rankin moaned you can get him to hospital when weve gone look sam walked slowly down the steps wayne rankin moved away but he didnt take his eyes from sam youre a friend of lady loony yeah sam stopped we banged her last night wayne said sam froze wayne kept on backing off gave her a good seeing to dont react powys said in a low voice if his dad lied about the dog come here wayne sam said tell me all about it three of us wayne had vanished beyond the feeble house lights one after the other sam charged out powys grabbed his arm dont go out there hell be waiting wayne rankins voice came out of the darkness squealed like a stuck pig she did woolly told himself he and meadwell deserved each other sitting in the dark here was probably as close as you could get on this earth to authentic purgatory sitting waiting for pel grainger hed actually been at that lecture of graingers at the assembly rooms been unimpressed superficial bullshit even if you could welcome the night like you did daylight how was that really going to expand your life the exercise when grainger had all the lights put out that felt good on the surface it was the harmless kind of meditation exercise woollyd done a thousand times but that night it produced a serious buzz but that was a weird night anyway woolly had had to leave before the end after getting a message that somebody had been smashing windows out on the street whatever you were doing that night it was going to be intense off the wall something had been happening somebody doing something he should have seen it then dark chalice rising he wondered what hed really do when they came for the well simple jm powys had said you just call the police report intruders let them handle it nobody knows youre there dont enlighten them dont even think of going out there after them but he might the fuzz might not make it in time and he didnt have a lot to lose he might well go out there needing to do something dark chalice rising corrupting everyone in its path like grainger grainger had been corrupted he could stop grainger if he was on his own pompous fat git woolly felt he really needed to stop somebody he was feeling totally useless a whole pile of bad shit coming down and nothing that soontobe former councillor woolaston could do about it right now he didnt want to leave this kitchen wasnt that wimpy he didnt want to go anywhere in this spooky old house just to sit right by the aga listen for a car the sound of the gate opening and then maybe face it any kind of action outside was better than being in here little verity had to be a really strong person to have survived this a really good person mother teresa class even on top of the aga he was still cold moonlight fluttered in through the high window like the ribbons on a shroud this was an evil house as black as the black bus he kept thinking about that bus was it his own private demon was it a representation of everything he most feared the fastbreeding traffic monster which fed on the english countryside had that bus come out of his own head bred from his own paranoia woolly projected himself back back into the car coming down along magdalene street seeing the tree lights he remembered thinking how nice that was what a really good vibe christmas put into the town trying to see those lights in his mind before they all went up in the air and he saw the other lights the wishywashy yellow either side of a peeling grille was there a driver he peered harder down his dopescarred memory focusing on the headlights on that grille that was like a lopsided evil grin full of rusty teeth into the window this really oldfashioned window with a divider strip of rusting chrome his hands groping up the side of the aga in the dark the warm shiny metal like he was climbing up on to the bonnet of the bus peering in through that window if he could only see the drivers face hed know he could feel the engine throbbing now under his feet could see the street hang on this was wrong had to get down high street from the top coming down from chilkwell street left into high street down towards the post office and the zebra crossing under the wash of amber streetlight the big steering wheel vibrating under his hands that loose spring irritating his bum gotta patch that seat glaring through the muck on the windscreen driving the bus driving the black bus i never wanted children juanita said hoarsely she found she was talking to the purplespotlit pot goddesses in the window of the shop belonging to domini dorrelladams it was always going to be you know a wonderful place to bring kids into not just glastonbury the new world we were going to make everybody loving one another we didnt of course we still had our petty jealousies prejudices infidelities but the fact that we felt it was possible for everyone to love each other that we could aspire to it the pot goddesses leered and when it all started to go down the drain i didnt want to bring kids into it any more that was why danny left really he wanted offspring he wanted his own little glastonbury family but you cant be an ordinary guy in glastonbury its not allowed one of the purple spot bulbs in the goddess shop window went out with a little phut she could hear even through the glass phut gone like goldenhaired dominis marriage like jim battle and his cottage and his paintings like headlice how swiftly lights were snuffed in this small town how quickly they were forgotten all that energy going bad no place to raise a child and too late now anyway she heard laughter behind her laughter as light as a ball of windblown paper she turned slowly in the middle of the road stood ceridwen in darkest robes juanita went very still there was a hazy light around ceridwen her hair like grey snakes sprayed out into this light which was purple like the spotlit goddess well shed dreamed of this moment the big confrontation but on her terms by daylight in ceridwens tacky fortune tellers booth or wandas house where there were things to smash candles to knock over when she wasnt feeling sick and feverish and broken and ceridwen laughed and disillusioned and decaying constantly chilled by the draught of death she began to pant looking down at the hands she hadnt been able to straighten out since theyd gripped the door handle an old womans curling claws the goddess comes in three aspects ceridwen said her voice echoing as if the whole street the town the world was empty apart from the two of them she was looking past juanita at the goddess shop virgin she said juanita turned in time to see another purple bulb going pop putting the smaller goddesses into darkness now there was only one bulb remaining it lit the largest of dominis pot goddesses purpling her pendulous breasts the obese idol squatted smugly on her swag of white satin and simpered while from the large black hole at the top of her roughglazed thighs a dark fluid was dripping making viscous rivulets on the white satin juanita backed away she could almost smell it she tasted bile she looked up at the tower of st johns but it looked coldly down spurning her and the dark taunting menstrual blood of the goddess soaked into the satin mother ceridwen hissed as the last bulb went out phut just like the baby juanita had had aborted secretly dannys baby danny becoming terrifyingly undanny when he heard danny throwing every book in the shop to the floor pushing over the shelfunits smashing up the window display and walking out and never returning never setting foot on the holy isle of avalon again juanita turned to face the road and ceridwens white hazy pointing finger there was a moment of stillness a moment of knowing it was not as it seemed a smell of fumes souring the applescented woodsmoke from the chimneys bad energy forming a grounded cloud and then with a sensation of pins and needles in both feet the flush began the big one the flush of flushes she felt fire in her limbs a fire that dried her blood and her juices she felt her skin slacken her breasts shrivelling into pockets of old leather her mouth stretching into a scream which she knew would crack her face into a spiderweb of deep blackening fissures hag ceridwen said juanita raised her hands like the claws they so much resembled and rushed out at her shrieking hatred and despair but ceridwens image went out like another lightbulb and there was nothing in the middle of the road but juanita and the big black bus bellowing and farting smoke with its radiator hanging off she felt the buildings tremble and wrapped her arms around her sagging body as if that would hold her together twelve my goddess sam threw open the bowermead gates ran back and jumped back in the mini wayne hangs out with darryl davey he said of the provisional glastonbury first brigade if that yellowtoothed twat sam he was lying he was winding you up im not even going to mention it to juanita the state shes in already it could however be a police matter whatever they did you think the police got a better chance of finding her than we do they could pull this davey in i could pull him in go round the pubs till i find him and get filled in by his mates powys drove out of the bowermead turning towards the lights of glastonbury time is it gone ten what did you get out of pennard too much whisky didnt do you much harm when it came to dealing with rankin if we both went round the pubs id rather you went to meadwell keep woolly company because thats where theyll show up sooner rather than later you think i know sam who else is in the cauldron apart from ceridwen depends what you mean by in sam had arnold on his knee clutching the dog to his chest a whole lot of women go to the meetings i mean the socalled inner circle theres a woman called jenna thinks shes well in i dunno you see we need to find out where the inner circle meets thats where shell be i mean diane wanda carlisles surely its a front just like her nothing happens there its somewhere else i dont get this powys surely theyre all going up the tor with the bishop for this solstice dawn crap theyll be at wandas i think youll find they arent all going up wandas going alone with the bishop thats a measure of how important they think it is shes about as halfarsed as he is two lightweights representing the great traditions of paganism and christianity on the most powerful hallowed site in britain it doesnt make sense and yet its got to its bloody got to sam said woollys coming out with all this stuff about the biggest blow against spirituality since i mean what kind of blow was that really the roman church was pretty bloody corrupt by the reformation the popes were just more bent politicians in tall hats something had to give it was a blow to glastonbury if you try not to get spirituality confused with organised religion you find you can keep a better perspective what about archer ffitch where might he be he got any kind of apartment in glastonbury a girlfriend youre joking archer ffitch no hes got a place in london or maybe he shares somewhere with oliver pixhill but nowhere in glastonbury anyway diane wouldnt be with archer dianes not been having good feelings about archer powys glanced sharply at him whats that mean she said and i was a bit cynical about this at the time that she sometimes feels her hate for archer has a life its own say that again try and remember exactly what she said sam tried powys listened transfixed gripping the steering wheel hard and tried not to crash the car he drove into chilkwell street indicated left for the town centre he needed to talk to juanita and he needed a copy of dion fortunes psychic selfdefence fast i just want diane sam said thats all if those scumbags halfway down high street powys braked hard behind a stationary bus a big obviously decrepit black bus stopped in the middle of the road its another accident sam said i dont believe this powys pulled out alongside the bus switched on his headlights a woman in a blue coat was lying in the road he came out of the car so fast he lost his balance effects of the whisky shouldnt even be driving and pitched over in the road hitting his head on the kerb and rolling over buildings of brick and stone spinning overhead lights coming on in windows over upsidedown shop signs pale amber streetlamps a church tower with a dusting of weak stars around its crown of stone thorns the bus had huge balding tyres bloody thing shouldnt even be on the road a few people were gathering he kept hearing the words not again again and again and again he crawled towards the wheels pulling himself up saw a guy bending over the body the body wrapped in the blue coat she said she always wore something blue lucky colour nothing would happen to you if you wore blue cant credit it the driver of the bus presumably the guy in an anorak with a castrol sticker i mean i know this town i know where wellhouse lane is but i didnt turn into wellhouse lane did i i come down here if id got it right she wouldnt but like anyway she just comes leaping out like christ i never slammed on like that before thought i was gonner have a heart attack powys stumbled to where she lay she was very still the coat had come loose her long neck shone light brown under the headlights faintly freckled her eyes were full open big brown eyes one arm flung out the hand ungloved a livid pink powys nothing moving but her lips youre crying woollys guts turned over and he threw up in the sink he could smell smoke and diesel and burnt rubber he turned on the taps let the water hot and cold splatter down on his face and neck for over a minute until the old pipes were snorting and gurgling like a bad case of dysentery woolly washed his hands wiped them on his jeans that was it he went and put on all the lights in the kitchen just for a minute just to get rid of the image of juanitas face in the headlights before he trod the brakes screaming out loud praying to god forcing his whole being into his feet and those brakes a lesson never close your eyes at meadwell she sat on the bed in the lamplight the lamp in the stone and timberframed bedroom had a tiffany shade almost matching the stained glass in the apex of the gothic windows the bulb in the lamp flickered perhaps it would go out soon i dont like bulbs that do that her arms were by her sides held away from her body ill get them to change it powys said they were in his ancient mellow timbered room at the george and pilgrims juanita wouldnt go home wouldnt go back to the shop its infected shed kept saying shed stood up shakily in the road unhurt how can you be hurt by a phantom bus giggling hysterically at least the driver was happy powys had handed his car keys to sam meadwell quickly her blue coat lay on the floor by the bed arnold had curled up on it i couldnt move her loose sweater had slipped down over one shoulder i didnt want to move it was very peaceful in the road cant remember ever feeling as peaceful i lay and i stared up at that torn radiator grille and i waited to die he sat down next to her on the bed looked hard into her dulled eyes how do you feel now not here i feel like im not here listen juanita he wanted to touch her didnt know where it was safe to it was a real bus ok sam talked to the driver hes a scrapdealer from taunton he was delivering the bus to a mr moulder who has a farm up wellhouse lane the eyes wavered but he took the wrong turning he doesnt know why he did that because he knows glastonbury very well but he took a wrong turning he came down high street and there you were in the middle of the road he said he braked so hard he nearly had a heart attack and still he thought hed killed you and i me too you know joe powyss head fell into juanitas lap he felt brittle and exhausted like the holy thorn no sap left he knew more than his mind could handle about pixhill and dion fortune and the dark heritage of the ffitches and yet he knew nothing hed very nearly murdered a man in a rush of mindless violence hed thought his dog had been killed also the woman he really he felt juanitas lips on his hair you were crying she said you thought i was dead and you were crying i shouldnt have cried he sat up its only a station between trains what he kissed her her checks were wet and hot her lips dry and cracked he moistened them with his tongue felt her shiver her face at last moved under his and her arms went round him just her arms powys hugged juanita and they stayed like that dazed and weeping for several minutes only in glastonbury who said that im a mess she said it isnt possible to be a bigger mess than me i dont even know whats real i dont trust my eyes i dont trust my body im real i think she pulled away from him listen im serious of all the things thatve happened to me tonight i dont know which ones are real you tell me that bus was real an hour or two ago i saw that bus in a painting that actual bus with its radiator and then i saw one of the goddess shop pots bloody well menstruating and there was ceridwen in her robes in the middle of the road talking to me instructing me that i was now officially a hag which which makes a lot of sense when youve had about two hundred hot flushes i do mean two hundred very real hot flushes which matthew banks will confirm im a hag a crone look at me she wore no makeup she was very beautiful she was to die for look at me she began to cry he kissed her his hands slid under her sloppy sweater there was nothing there but warm skin um would you mind if you dont want this kind of hassle powys he could hardly breathe he fumbled the sweater over her speckled shoulders draping it over arnold who murmured but didnt move ok juanita was looking down at herself its a relief i thought they were going to be around my navel powys touched a brown nipple with his tongue it had an aureole of freckles dion fortune would have understood he tossed his sweater on arnold and wriggled out of his jeans what youve been through mmm psychic attack juanita nobody but nobody has two hundred hot flushes out of the blue in a few hours he unzipped her velvet skirt that woman really hates you were going to have to break the spell guiding her back on to the bed this creaky victorian fourposter the mattress was rather too high to fall back on he lifted her in his arms she felt unnervingly light a bit cold say i am very beautiful say i am a goddess sliding her into bed she said i know what this is youve seen that bloody picture of me havent you the avalonian powys said issue six and nothings changed no she lifted the sheet with an elbow this is where they took away the skin to repair the hands it means this is the principal sick joke it means i cant take any pressure on my thighs juanita closed her eyes laughing her arms wide open a hand on each pillow it was the first time hed ever seen her relaxed not a problem his lips moving down to the scars where the strips of skin had been scraped away too rough nnnnnn and slowly up to the bush juanita moaned her legs opening turn on your side maybe she said softly this is ridiculous this oh my god my goddess powys breathed around midnight he returned from carey and frayne with a suitcase he also had a tray of tea from the george and pilgrims kitchens juanita was sitting up in bed she had the sweater on he poured tea i forgot the straw typical juanita said and so little to think about um im going to say this now ever since i saw that photograph of you in dans office she put a discoloured finger to his lips dont say any more its bad luck thats an old avalonian superstition is it its how i feel ok ok he put the book on the bed turned it towards her it was a hardback copy of psychic selfdefence by dion fortune have you read this bits of it you read the werewolf story where she conjures the elemental beast lets read it again he opened the book under the tiffany lamp whose bulb no longer flickered listen to this powys said chapter one signs of psychic attack we live in the midst of invisible forces whose effects alone we perceive normally we are protected by our very incapacity to perceive verity juanita said just a passing thought ok its about page fifty ah i had received serious injury from someone who at considerable cost to myself i had disinterestedly helped and i was sorely tempted to retaliate lying on my bed resting one afternoon her resentment materialises at the bedside juanita shuddered as a kind of grey wolf powys sat on the bed held a cup of tea to her lips before we read the rest i have to tell you where i went this evening its like a truly horrible grimms fairytale juanita said after hed told her about violet and roger ffitch and pixhill he told her about archer the blood and the fire and the pink teddy no wonder the nannies were horrible juanita said those werent nannies they were bodyguards he never knew for sure powys said and he still doesnt know thats what hes had to live with makes you feel sorry for the old bastard doesnt it it makes a lot of things clear poor kid the retained placenta i vaguely knew about that not being well up in midwifery i didnt know about the amount of bloodletting it caused did i tell you that when she was little and not so little she used to go missing and quite often shed be found asleep in the chalice well garden the blood well a wells a kind of symbolic womb isnt it she was going back to what she couldnt remember oh powys i know weve got to find her all this gets worse he picked up the book now violet no nonsense type even then is more than a bit alarmed at what shes conjured she tries the stern approach down boy and to her faint surprise the wolf turns into a dog and trots off and fades away but violets not daft and shes not terribly surprised when another woman in the house gets into a flap claiming her dreams have been disrupted by images of wolves and when she woke up there were eyes shining at her from a corner of the room violets seriously disturbed by now she goes off to see doc moriarty her teacher and he confirms her worst fears that the beast is part of her and that if she doesnt get it back shell be er no longer a nice person powys said its a lefthand path situation if she doesnt get it back shell be on the satanic slippery slope but she does get it back doesnt she not easily but yeh in the end it all worked out because she helped roger with his problem and she put the dark chalice on hold with a little help from george pixhill and the man i hesitate to call uncle jack this is leading somewhere isnt it powys poured the rest of the tea according to sam on at least two occasions recently dianes felt her rage at archer which probably goes back even farther than she knows becoming almost detached from her fermenting into patches of mist feral smells in the room oh my god how much has she studied dion fortune would she know that story oh dear what you have to understand about diane is that she doesnt have the magician mentality even if you believe in reincarnation the idea of her being the next life of dion fortune is slightly preposterous dianes a romantic a mystic very probably more than a bit psychic someone who if df is still around in some form she might want to protect the third nanny juanita said sits on the bed and doesnt leave a dent in the mattress or something the more you think about it the more you realise that if anyone needs a third nanny its diane but look this is important you dont think dianes capable of conjuring an elemental force are you kidding in that case someones sending it to her someone whos been working over a long period to corrupt her juanita closed her eyes someone powys said who wanted her back in glastonbury at this particular time who was disturbing her making her restless sending her images of the tor a very practised magician or group of magicians who can conjure elementals like the wolfthing like a black bus in fact why would moulder have a bus delivered jesus powys none of this is making sense im not up to making sense of it lets just call the police the police wouldnt be able to find her and even if they did they wouldnt know how to handle any of this its down to us or you juanita shrank back against the oak headboard she looked very small and frail in the fourposter youve got to rediscover the goddess powys said in yourself youve got to go back to the heart thirteen eve of midwinter in the meadwell kitchen woolly and sam were playing threecard brag by torchlight whered you learn to play like this sam said old hippies taking peoples money is not what theyre about every time he lost it was down to sam to go and check they were alone which meant an ominous trek through that bloody eerie dining room youre just not concentrating woolly said i can understand that but you got to keep playing man you let go of your mind in this house it you just dont ok something happen to you i dont know woolly growled thats the other thing you never quite know some things you know sam said not thinking of the house woolly picked up on it he grinned shes a wonderful girl sammy surprised me though i got to say you coming round to it after that charlotte mmm well sam said something happened like like why a confirmed atheist and nonbeliever in anything you cant either spend or save from predatory upperclass gits with hunting horns is suddenly scared to go in that room next door oh said woolly like that ive seen bloody pixhill sam said ive seen pixhill ok old bloke in a deerstalker hat though i like to think he wouldnt ever have stalked a deer and dont ask me dont anybody ever ask me about his eyes sheesh woolly said when was this and so sam told him and because it was cardson thetable night he told woolly about the devastation of the trees the road woolly threw his newly dealt hand on the table youre not winding me up tonight im not winding anybody up woolly tonight winding up is on hold i dont know what to do woolly said dont do anything juanita said to hang on until when i dont know until we got diane back you know what i think woolly said i dont even like to ask i think we got a battle on two levels here on the material level the glastonbury first bit the road bowketts bill and all the side effects that lots having on the invisible layers or maybe its the other way around and g and the bypass the whole things a manifestation of something going down on the inner planes oh shit said sam im not that much of a sodding convert so what i think i just think its time we threw everything we got at this situation youre just saying that cause you reckon youve got nothing to lose maybe woolly said does it matter wheres verity keep the phone never was any good at keeping my trap shut sam stared at his cards aw for fucks sake woolly you dealt me a bloody kingflush and threw your cards in yeah well woolly said it was about time i took a stroll after i use the phone they entered the cradle henry viii could steal the gold pull down the walls powys thought but the fat bastard couldnt take away the atmosphere sometimes when i am alone in the abbey grounds colonel pixhill had written i become afraid of my own reverie afraid that my soul will rise before its time even at night it was not eerie merely awesome juanita knew how to get in she said most locals did you just had to be quiet as you climbed over a certain garden wall in a backstreet in the old days juanita said many a bottle of mateus rose had been consumed under a full moon on the holyest erthe in all england theyd gone back to the main entrance near the dying thorn this was the way to approach it juanita said beyond the wooden cross uneven stone walls had evolved into a kind of organic life could almost have been closecut layered hedges other walls other buildings heaps of hallowed rubble were all features in what even without the lawns and the manicuring was a garden powys laid down the suitcase on the dark grass it was cold and wet but the snow had gone this in the beginning and at the end was the heart this was where it all came together thirty six secret walled acres in what was still the centre of the town glastonburys streets guarding their abbey like like the holy grail his gaze was raised to the focal point the summit of the ruins hed seen pictures of it many times the light flowing like a river between twin towers except they werent towers and your second concept an arch with the top part missing they werent that either they were the ends of two high buttressed walls a flawed mirror image of each other but they rose like forearms from elbows resting on the green turf ending in compliant cupped hands hands which could almost be supporting an invisible bowl powys felt juanitas tentative arm against his and realised hed been standing here staring for several minutes at the moon through the space between the stone hands its like theyre holding a chalice he said or waiting for one they say some people say this is the heart chakra in the body of the earth the higher emotional centre i know you could almost swear it was warmer in here than the other side of the walls you warm enough juanita nodded she was wearing the long woollen cloak hed brought from her wardrobe somehow powys said i cant quite believe that when we talk of the dark chalice we mean the gold cup planted on abbot whiting by edmund ffitch i still think its a metaphor an ancient symbol of division intolerance if the holy grail is a symbol of conciliation both a pagan and a christian symbol the antigrail its logical to believe theres always been an antigrail these things have their time its as if when henry destroyed all this he was caught up in something that was trying to happen they all were abbot whiting nice guy kind to the poor they put his head on the abbey gates isnt that right the whole town must have been absolutely flattened people terrified not least juanita said because this was the place where jesus himself walked you believe that juanita looked up at the hands of stone accepting the invisible chalice sure why not if his rich uncle joe wanted to broaden his horizons so when the abbot was killed and the building violated and vandalised by the king of england they must have powys hesitated they must have questioned the very existence of god juanita stood in front of him it would have taken a long time to get back to that level of spirituality we thought that maybe we were close to it once now its gone the other way standing here in the silence of the ruins on the eve of midwinter powys could almost feel the veil shredding like a cobweb ok juanita nodded he pulled at the ties which fastened the cloak at her neck she raised her arms her crippled hands in the cup formation like the great stone buttresses and the cloak fell away from her shoulders and dropped to the grass powys caught his breath juanita shone in the moonlight she was wearing the dress last featured on the front the avalonian issue six sammy woolly hissed theyre here heart in his mouth hed been upstairs to the lavatory the torch lighting up the dirty black beams and all those doorways some of them ajar shadows oozing out and on his way back glancing out the window at the top of the stairs hed seen the sidelights moving very slowly up the drive what do we do sam whispered we call the cops i reckon we see who it is first if its grainger i dont reckon we need bother the fuzz christ said sam you still call them the fuzz after all these years but woolly had crept out into the dining room a sliver of moonlight thin as fusewire on the table where pixhill had lain sam shivered funny it really did go up your spine any normal earthly fear like having the crap beaten out of you by a master of foxhounds it never happened like that woolly was standing on a chair to see out of the high window two of them men grainger dont look like it both tallish guys shit said sam ones got a pickaxe double shit woolly dropped to the floor you wanner go for this or what maybe not maybe we should play safe you want me to ring the cops being as how im slightly less well known to them at this moment in time only one of ems your mate mr davey said woolly ah sam rubbed his jaw well this changes things just slightly powys wondered afterwards if perhaps hed fallen asleep which seemed in the normal way of things unlikely on the eve of midwinter sitting on a low stone wall under an icy moon if he hadnt fallen asleep then it wasnt a dream in this dream the one that wasnt juanita stood on one side of what tourists sometimes saw as a broken archway where the stone arms reached for the chalice on the other side of the archway that wasnt stood another woman both white incandescent in the moonlight when powys either awoke or didnt juanita was alone woolly came out of the garden shed aint much useful in there man to be honest he handed sam a garden fork its got a wonky handle the alternatives a bent lawn rake whats yours then im a man of peace remember woolly whispered come on move it they climbed over into the field under the moon the tor looked surprisingly sinister sam figured he was seeing it from the same angle as when dont think about it you know your way round here shit this fields waterlogged couple of hours itll be icelogged woolly muttered sure i used to do a bit of gardening for the colonel he had a greenhouse then i figured maybe i could grow certain exotic plants on the side like never thought hed know what one looked like still he was very nice about it died the following year poor old soul sam looked up at the tor something was bothering him woolly where i saw this road look theres no way they could run it through there i was so blown away by you know him that i just didnt figure it out proper i remember thinking it looked like it was aimed straight at the centre of the tor under the tower and like you see from here thats where it would have to go else meadwelld be right in the middle of the central reservation and its a doublelisted building so thats out right what you saying and keep your bloody voice down i dont think that excavations anything to do with the road not directly so what was it fuck knows youre the earthmysteries expert think about it later woolly said we got to scare these bastards away before they have the top of that well off by moonlight they skirted the edge of the field keeping to the hedge they heard the clunk of a pickaxe on concrete saw the muffled glow of a lamp on the ground sam moved quietly through the shallow drainage ditch his shoes and the bottoms of his jeans soaked through there was an old stile he vaguely remembered from his days with the ramblers association from way back when there was like a little pilgrims way to the meadwell amazingly he found the stile tested it with one foot it seemed solid enough to stand on so he stood on it he signalled to woolly then just as the pickaxe struck metal he bawled out avon and somerset police dont no bugger move and then he was over the stile and going hard for darryl davey swinging the garden fork like an axe at a tree darryl had started to run and the shaft of the fork caught him under both knees and he came down on the concrete with a smack sam was aware of the other guy legging it but that didnt matter because the lamp on the ground showed him where to put the fork like hard under darryls chin woolly was with him now you see who the other fucker was dont give a shit this is my man darryl as i recall it was in when you persuaded me to part with my dinner money or face a difficult nosebleed situation i got to tell you you got precisely five seconds to say what you done with diane else its a prong up each nostril and then i start beating your lovely big teeth out with the handle look and after that darryl twisted his neck round and a rusting prong nudged his adams apple he screamed wheres them cops four sam said three two i dont fucking know do i darryl began to cough sam raised a foot leave it out woolly said he cant say much with your shoe on his gob one sam said no listen all we done was scare her then ceridwen comes in and tells us to piss off i dont know what they done with her after that honest to where was this darryl outside woolastons shop len and wayne done his window right im following lady l diane following her why cause they told me to who like your old man yeah shit sam said in disgust you get your orders from the old man sometimes woolly said who was with you then darryl went silent we missed that darryl sam said you can kill me darryl davey shouted but i aint sayin no more so they let him go they let the bastard go they went back to the house and they put on every light in the place it was gone three am would you trust darryl davey with anything worth knowing woolly said would you trust my old man not unless i had no choice woolly said go on go get him boy im not leaving you here woolly what if the other bugger comes back then ill handle it go sammy cant we both go this well thing is that really so yeh it is it is sammy go sam drove away from meadwell in joe powyss mini glad on one level to be leaving meadwell not glad to be leaving woolly premonition not that much of a convert fourteen pale lightball she felt her anger like a bed of whitehot coals in her plexus her eyes wide open watched the mist weaving between the great pillars diane watched the tendrils of cold steam interlacing the air above her hearing archers politicians voice dark old oak seasoned by his heritage all i need to know is do you the people of glastonbury want it to happen damned hippies and squatters turning this into a jungle archer who all through their childhood had watched her from a distance which was frightfully easy to do at bowermead archers face still as an owls amid the branches of a tree as she pushed her dolls pram through the wood an enormous pine cone suddenly landing like a grenade on its blankets archers petulant expression seen from a high chair across the table a spoon at his big meaty lips diane bit the bedclothes archers finger at his lips shhhhh almost a man now very strong as he lifted her out of bed and carried her in his arms down the stairs diane drowsy halfhypnotised aged seven down through the grounds sweetscented in the summer night and oliver pixhill waiting in the shrubbery almost dawn as they carried her halffascinated mostly terrified to the place where the tor was a huge fairy castle bring out the lights diane diane felt starved and ill she was drenched in the sort of spasmodic sweat which keeps congealing on your face thick and sour as daysold milk she was here because she was ill it was a hospital wasnt it the old man had a big house now selfbuilt to a much higher standard than his usual crap in an acre of illgotten ground set back from decently suburban leg of mutton road far enough off the road to make it what griff daniel would call exclusive but near enough to cause him serious aggro with his nice neighbours if there should be a highdecibel altercation resulting from the distinguished builder refusing to admit his prodigal son at halfpast three in the morning sam started politely he rang the bell there was no response this time sam kept his finger on the bell and at the same time battered his knuckles on the panel below the tasteless slab of bullseye glass above the front porch a bedroom window opened and a security spot bulb threw a circle of light around sam what the bloody hell you think youre doing sam stood openly in the middle of the circle of light well i could do a tapdance dad sing a couple of songs of a cabaret for the neighbours or you could just let me in and well have a little chat and yeah i do know its half past three bugger off said griff daniel on the other hand to save a bit of time i could just put that sundial through your lounge window and set the burglar alarm off and i could have you banged up for the night now for the last time id like that sam said i could sit in the station down at street and keep the night shift entertained with your history culminating in your arrangement with davey len whatsisname and wayne rankin its cold dad im not gonner piss about three minutes later griff let him in paisley dressing gown and a face like a gargoyle with stone fatigue you got a bloody nerve boy yeah well well skip over the pleasantries if you dont mind sam pushed past him through the hall and into a splitlevel lounge with a floortoceiling rainbow stone fireplace and a cocktail bar with mirrors he didnt have time to laugh things i need to know now or by god ill put you under so much shit itll take more than a jcb you got nothin on me boy griff glanced back at stairs no waving a dismissive hand bring her down sam said lets have a party he didnt want the old mans latest scrubber cluttering the place up but anything to cause more disruption however when the woman appeared in the doorway clutching a white robe to her scrawny throat she wasnt what he was expecting it was jenna from the cauldron ceridwens pipecleaner it didnt make sense what was she doing here with the old man why wasnt she with ceridwen and the rest of the socalled inner circle and diane wheres diane sam said weakly thats all i wanner know griff daniel sneered and dropped into a kingsize easy chair you stupid little sod never did know when you were playin outer your league and what about you i know my level and her jenna stared at him her lips like a thin zip why arent you with ceridwen she knows her level too golf said i thought you were a lesbian sam said i thought that was what the inner circle was about the inner circle isnt what you think jenna said and im not in it and not all feminists are lesbians thats something he would say this was weird sam shook his head in noncomprehension it was kind of sick dont think this is no more than a loose sexual arrangement jenna said haughtily he isnt going to be wearing an earring go away boy griff daniel said we dont know nothin somethin ive learned these past few weeks local politics is my pond look local politics is knowing which people to help when they d want you and when to keep out of it some things tis better to know nothin sam clenched his fists shut the door on your way out griff said but when sam was on his way out he thought of something the old man did know mist still rising around the bed like smoke in a perverse way diane found this comforting it suited her mood enclosed her dark thoughts in the midst of it she thought for a moment that she could see a very pale light ball when she was very young she used to go all trembly and run downstairs and father snorted impatiently and nannies said nonsense child and felt for a temperature nannies there was a certain sort of nanny later known as a governess which father expressly sought out nannies one and two both the same the sort which was supposed to have yellowed and faded from the scene along with crinolines and parasols the sort which in the s still addressed their charges as child the sort which as you grew older you realised should never be consulted about occurrences such as lights around the tor and then there was the third nanny her memories of the third nanny remained vague and elusive she remembered laughter the third nanny was the only one of them that ever laughed and one other thing she would sit on the edge of the bed but never left a dent in the mattress when she arose the pale lightball hovered part of her wanted to clutch at it and part of her wanted to push it away in the end that was what she did for lightballs belonged to childhood and she was grown up now she wondered what day it was was it christmas yet always hated christmas all those fruity voiced oafs smelling of drink and cigars and then going stiffly to church merry christmas mlord merry christmas thank you mlord very kind very kind of you and boxing days echoing to the horrid peremptory bloodlusting blast of the hunting horn time we had you riding diane doubt if weve got a horse fat enough and stupid enough father ha ha time to wake up diane ceridwen was at her bedside its still dark it will soon be dawn ceridwen no longer wore the starched uniform of the nurse or the nanny but a long purple robe this is not a hospital is it it has made you well however ceridwen said youve learned what you needed to learn without this knowledge you could never be free i i suppose thats true she had dreamed of blood the blood around her birth she had remembered her mothers cooling arms she knew who had murdered her mother she was at last approaching an understanding of who she was you once came to me to ask if you were an incarnation of dion fortune you always knew that didnt you i ceridwen went down on her knees at the bottom of the bed i honour you diane fortune and then there was a rustling all around her and other people in robes emerged from behind the pillars bearing candles among them faces she knew rozzie and mort and viper and hecate the girl who had been so rude to her and had made the children paint the bus black they all dropped to their knees and then gwyn appeared tall and bearded in a shroud of mist and he held up his sickle before throwing it to the ground at the bottom of the bed and all the people in the room said in unison we honour you diane fortune verity awoke into shrilling darkness and clicked off her travel alarm she had slept for four hours after making wandas supper and mugs of calming cocoa wanda who had drunk too much had been in one of her unpleasant resentful moods at being obliged to rise before dawn to put on a public relations sideshow with a bloody christian the luminous hands of the travel alarm told verity it was five thirty she arose at once against the tug from her hip into the tainted luxury of her suite at wandas tainted by guilt she arose into guilt she had deserted her post she had allowed mr powys to guide her away from the grave and mortal danger foretold by major shepherd and left little councillor woolaston in its path perhaps that part was over perhaps the intruders had been caught and detained by the police and perhaps something horrible had occurred verity washed in cold water for the heating had not yet come on she heard the first spatter of sleet against the window she felt sick to her soul fifteen lights go out woolly played patience at the kitchen table and didnt once win life was like this all you could do was keeping turning over the cards never knowing how they were stacked of course this wasnt the case with everybody some people cheated and some people actually knew how to shuffle the pack glastonbury had far more than the average number of people who thought they knew how to stack the deck but woolly had no illusions he dealt himself three more and turned over the stack but nothing would fit he knew hed done one good thing this past night but couldnt figure how hed done it maybe just that once hed turned the right card maybe hed found an opening in the houses black atmosphere whatever something had let him take the wheel of the black bus and hed saved a life woolly hoped it was a good life he was hoping this when the lights began to go out powys put his hands on her shoulders and was horrified there was a layer of frost on the muslin im all right she said leave me youre not he thought what are we doing what have i done shes had pneumonia shes been through hell just for odd moments hed thought this is it without quite knowing what he meant or even what he hoped for it had been a really crazy thing to do madness he opened the suitcase and took out her cloak and put it around her shoulders very gently he brought her to her feet her face was very close but he couldnt see it very well the moon had gone the mist had arisen there was a thin and icy wind i ccould see her a tremor in juanitas voice she was in a grey place and she was lying down i ggot a feeling of terrible confusion i tried to tell her i was there sure she knew at one point but then she turned away she buried her head in his chest and he held her under the arms of the abbey as the sleet came deceptively gentle at first i felt a light go out juanita said as they came back over the wall juanita shivering inside the cloak powys heard the rumble of traffic the crisscross of headlights on the stone two vans came out of high street he turned and saw them enter wellhouse lane an ancient clattering rover followed and then oh god a bus a couple of dozen people were walking up high street they wore big boots and carried backpacks and rucksacks whats happening you dont know a young woman said demo mate where are you from a bloke said bristol ecoguerrillas beg except we dont be people here from all over the country by morning you know they started the road a woman spotted juanita in her cloak you one of the pagans its getting like a bit confused groups everywhere been waiting for the call on the road you know someone leaned out of the back of a truck happy solstice sister lets get out of here juanita whispered powys wasnt aware until they were heading through the already crowded central car park to the back entrance of the george and pilgrims that she had taken his hand in hers shortly before seven matthew banks and his friend the secondhand bookseller called for wanda in matthews discovery wanda was petulant and bothered about her clothes settling at last for the capacious black and white cape and a black widebrimmed hat which verity knew would be blown away by the wind on top of the tor youll have to carry my bag darling she snapped at verity i cant manage everything the bloody bloody bishop why couldnt he have simply waited until the summer solstice im not coming verity handed matthew the flask of coffee shed made for wanda and a half bottle of glenmorangie dont be ridiculous get in the car im needed at meadwell that damned house needs nobody except possibly a demolition crew now get in verity im sorry wanda i should never have come here i know you couldnt refuse i know how much you owe ceridwen what on earth are you talking about they made you invite me to stay didnt they what utter non to get me out of the way well you can tell them im going back she turned her back on the discovery and walked off down the mews someone would give her a lift perhaps verity wanda screeched ive done everything for you you sad little woman don moulder was manning his field gate keeping the riff raff out shouting at them that it was private property who were all these buggers they never said this thered been talk of a small demonstration against bowkett s restriction of access bill of which don moulder was fully in favour no you cant he roared at some cretin in a cagoule leaning out of his car and waving a twenty pound note this is the official car park at last two newlooking cars prodded through the cold mist which was alternating with freezing clear spells and sudden wintry mist the tor appearing and disappearing against a filthy night sky mr moulder peter wakery archdeacon thank christ indeed shouted the archdeacon the bishops behind me in the bmw just tell us where to go over there under the tree by the buzz don moulder didnt look at the bus he hadnt been close to it hadnt even liked putting the keys in his pocket maybe the bishop could bless them too and then hed sell the bus back to the scrapyard for half of what hed paid give the proceeds to charity thus cleansing himself and his land the bishop was wearing a tweed overcoat buttoned around a purple neckpiece he stepped out under an umbrella morning your grace donald moulder this is my field good morning mr moulder and a very fine field wonderful view of the tor about the buzz bishop the buzz i spoke to a feller in your office reverend williams couldve been arranging for you to help me with this buzz this one behind you my god said the bishop i dont think we can tow it away to cleanse it bishop to free this buzz and my field from unwanted presences this reverend williams said you could like exorcise it im sure he said no such thing mr moulder the archdeacon a powerfully built man in a goretex jacket thrust himself behind them like a bodyguard i think you must have misunderstood you sayin this man lied to me he was in no position to make any such promise and on a day like this with a schedule like ours i suggest you write to the diocese im sorry mr moulder we do have to get on drop us a line said the bishop as he was hustled towards the field gate don moulder looked back towards the bus all he could see in the darkness was a great black bulge in the field and the glimmer of the scab like radiator grille rust on it like dried blood on grinning teeth grinning at don moulders stupidity as the bishops party left the field another bmw pulled halfway through the gate a head leaned out of the drivers window mr moulder archer ffitchs voice hells going on don wandered over somebody told em the new roads under way but thats nonsense you tell them that looks like hundreds of the bolshie devils comin from all over look wont do your campaign no harm though will it mr archer you wanner get up there argue with em be telly crews in a bit make the most of it i would he knew he sounded like a ranting lunatic ill come later archer said i have to see my father he reversed out of the field don moulder followed him not looking back people with torches and backpacks were swarming all over the lane it was like armageddon they went into the george and pilgrims through the back door and quietly up the narrow stairs to powyss room when arnold leapt up at her juanita pushed both hands into his fur powys looking on not sure if the dream was over juanita held both hands under the tiffany lamp they were still luridly discoloured but she could flex the fingers without pain she reached up very hesitantly and untied her cloak juanita and powys looked at each other neither said a word powys pushed his hands through his hair sat down on the bed i suppose juanita said after a minute that most people would say it was a nervous thing that i you know could probably have used them any time but i was scared to is that what you think she thought about it if that was the case i think id have been able to use them when i wasnt thinking about it like when we were making love how long have you known i suspected from the moment i put my hands up before the stone arms to receive the chalice i didnt think about it again juanita mmm who was the other woman did you see another woman i think i did there was power there wasnt there a lot he couldnt stop looking at her hands they were loosely clasped in front of her against the muslin dress a whole reservoir he felt her stare what he said nothing i dont know listen maybe maybe it wasnt the right time what does that mean i need to wash ill think about it she seemed unhurried suddenly ill take arnold round the block he said in the middle of the carpark arnold taking a leak against the church wall powys encountered sam daniel powys where the hell you been around what was he supposed to say he couldnt explain any of it its chaos up there gonner be a lot of trouble count on it woolly he wouldnt listen half the bloody green partys moved in over the last couple of hours he told them about the road didnt he and he was wrong its not a road i seen my dad he did the work his lads his jcbs what do you mean its not a road you got a map i can find a map come up to the room sam you think this is important could be powys said i mean anything could be important couldnt it at this stage what times dawn eight i never notice they heard the angry warble of a police car bloody hell sam said words finally got through to street verity had walked all the way back to meadwell as quickly as she could manage with her dragging hip she pushed open the garden gate over her head the yew trees clasped each other against the icebarbed predawn wind councillor woolastons renault car was parked under the wall no other car thank god was there all the lights in the house were out verity dug into the pocket of her winter coat for her keys she didnt need them the door swung lazily open at a touch as though the house was yawning with boredom verity entered silently and then lest he thought she was the expected intruder she called out mr woolaston dont be alarmed its verity endicott he didnt reply it had been a long vigil perhaps he had fallen asleep in the hall all was normal the dark tobacco pillars lunged like greasy old men and the water pipes bulged and croaked welcome home heh heh heh the pipes seemed to belch there was a sour and salty smell in the air as if the house had broken wind in her face and she knew then before she even noticed that the dining room door was ajar archers orders this was sam said not the old man powys had found the mendip hill west ordnance survey map downstairs among a rack of tourist guides they had it spread over the bed heres the tor right heres meadwell and heres bowermead hall i should have noticed that powys pencilled it in theyre in a straight line youd probably miss it because it runs so close to the st michael line but it is a ley see it goes on a mound here and through this farm called southbarrow farm so they built bowermead hall on an old leyline juanita had changed back into her sweater and skirt combed her hair why would they do that ok powys said if say they thought meadwell was too small and dismal to live in maybe a little too close to the tor for comfort but they warned to retain the link maybe even strengthen it by adding another point to the line and this is where they chopped down the trees dug it out they dug out the ley you get an immaculate view of the tor sam said side of it ive never seen before like at meadwell but even more dramatic and that was where you saw him pixhill i think it upset him juanita was tracing the line with a forefinger possibly powys thought for the sheer novelty of being able to do that he noticed she was breathing faster sam whats here the tip of her finger quivering sam peered at the map resr whats that mean reservoir powys said oh my god juanita closed and opened her eyes three times she was looking at the bed next to where powys sat thats it what its where she is this reservoir sam stiffened drowned its disused juanita said its a big grey place with she closed her eyes again three grey concrete pillars whats up with her sam was spooked wheres she getting this from arnold stood up on all three legs and powys seeing his big ears go back and his hairy snout rise dived to the floor and clapped a hand around it he was gonner howl wasnt he juanita smoothed the quilt next to where powys had sat never a dent she said upon the long oak table on which the colonels coffin had lain tor three days and nights little councillor woolaston now lay dead verity wept over his horribly disfigured corpse be assured that i would not expect you to do anything beyond coming to the rescue of my good and staunch friend verity endicott who is in grave and mortal danger standing as she does directly in the path of and god help me i do not exaggerate an old and utterly merciless evil she backed away from the body not through fear or revulsion at the way the head had been smashed nose and teeth broken the blood pooled in sunken checks but to give vent to her feelings how i hate you she told meadwell and then thought of the well itself it would be opened now sixteen yes nanny she lay back and let her eyelids fall the pillows were soft and cool the back of her head felt heavy like a bag of potatoes she let her arms flop by her sides the anger still burning somewhere below her abdomen was at odds though not uncomfortably so with the supine state of her body she was surprisingly reaching a state of relaxation but then she was getting rather good at that diane smiled the earliest light had hardened the tower on glastonbury tor into a rigid finger which poked and gouged blood from the raw flesh of the winter sky it was not yet seventhirty a false dawn don moulder thought watching from his top field through binoculars lights showed where the protesters were scattered like maggots all around the tor but don reckoned the police wouldnt let them go up for their own safety no doubt hed half expected there to be a counterdemonstration by the glastonbury first people but they were lying low sensibly let the new age hooligans dig their own grave would be their line he could see the handful of folk starting to wind their way up the tor under a big lamp dame wanda the beacon in her black and white cape and her big hat pretty tame pagan all the same too cold no doubt for the old egyptian priestess getup from hello magazine poor bloody christian too that bishop with his smarmy ways and his entourage and his minders don focused the glasses on a very bright spotlight setting up a small figure in a sheepskin coat the collar up around short blonde hair tammy white bbc bristol don had relented and allowed tammy and her cameraman to park in the bottom field tammy had parked her white peugeot right side on to that bloody bus god save her newshungry little soul the sky was on the move again darkening up again knew it was a false dawn not seen weather like this in a good long while first one thing then another like the heavens couldnt make up their minds which way to turn ok powys was driving how we going to do this do we go in through the bowermead entrance or what how dyou get in that night sam parked on the road scraped through a couple of hedges but it took me bloody ages powys we dont have that kind of time i say we go in state you left him last night i dont reckon rankins gonner do much juanita do it powys cut the headlights at the entrance to the drive sam did the gates nobody came out to stop him but when they reached the house there was a grey bmw parked on the forecourt archers home juanita said head down there sam pointed to an avenue of trees takes you past the barn past the hunt kennels we wake the dogs nothing we can do about that only problem is its a dead end they come down here in a couple of range rovers were screwed powys paused holding the mini on the clutch juanita sighed you want to know how certain i am about this dont you neither of them answered it was like a ouija board is all i can say something was moving my finger on the map just like something gave me a jolt when you came out with the word reservoir earlier oh shit sam said i dont like this i wouldnt like it either sam except whatever we picked up we picked it up in the abbey i wouldnt like to think you can pick up anything bad there powys let out the clutch you saw her sitting on the bed didnt you just like you in the abbey i dont know what i saw arnold sat on his rug on the back seat next to juanita powys watched him for a moment in the mirror he knows what he saw in the mirror powys saw a figure emerge on to the steps watching them as they passed under the avenue of trees she was starting to enjoy her anger and felt no guilt about this light dripped on to her eyelids like syrup and in the cushiony hinterland of sleep in those moments when the senses mingle and then dissolve when fragments of whispered words are sometimes heard and strange responses sought dianes rage fermented pleasurably into the darkest of wines the barns bulked to the right kennels beyond that sam said then you got no road left the mini went into a dip powys knew he wasnt going to make it up the other side ok leave it here youre out of sight they all got out sam took the torch led them up the side of the hill powys concerned when juanita slipped and went down on her hands ok seem to be it makes no sense but i do seem to be not a hag then not tainted by the whatsit of death i feel like i may live forever that probably means im going to die jesus god will you look at that it looked like what sam had thought it was the devastation before a motorway goes through the outraged rubble of a speedily shaven forest you could almost hear the screams of the trees if trees had ghosts this place would be haunted for centuries ive seen this before powys said theyre reawakening the ley theyre going to either bring something down from me tor or or send something up juanita said is that you talking or i dont know do we have to walk through this yeah sam stepped over a watery rut sorry about this somewhere behind them a hound began to howl powys looked sternly at arnold hopping between their legs before he remembered that arnold rarely responded to other dogs whered you see pixhill shut up sam said dont worry they rarely appear to more than one person i think theyre scared ha ha then sam gasped powys stopped the tor had arisen before them a huge black wedding cake surrounded by candles lamps the protesters sam said woollys ecoarmy on the march swelling the ranks of the locals opposing the tame the tor bill got here in no time didnt they all those little idealists phoning each other spreading the word taking a day off work those whove still got jobs piling into their cars and vans and trucks makes you proud to be british dont it theyll go to the tor first and then theyll start looking for the road do you think we oughter make sure they find it thats not a bad idea sam give me something to think about like the night i first came this way i was figuring out how best to sab the hunt trying to work off my temper at archer juanita said you know what will happen if diane does that if she lets go of the elemental what dyou mean she wont be the diane you know and and love shell always be the diane i know and love sam said that girl dont change yes she would sam you cant go bad juanita not like that absolutely like that thats the only sure way to go completely bad im not trying to scare you im just trying to explain what this is about sam didnt like this wheres the old cynicism juanita cynicism is no defence were close to the reservoir i feel close how can you know that youre just jesus powys handed sam his car keys and held out his hand for the torch do something practical sam youll feel better theres a can of petrol in the boot juanitas matches in the glove compartment he watched sam moving away hunched up against the unknown looked around for his dog arnold silence and then a sharp cry that he wasnt sure hed heard at all wasnt sure if it was in his head he looked at juanita wondering if shed heard it it said fetch juanita said there was a distant muffled yip an arnold noise then more silence it was coming light don moulder against all his best intentions had moved closer right to the edge of his top field from where he could see the figures moving up the tor quite clearly now he wondered what the bishop was saying to dame wanda carlisle discussing the terrible weather or wandas famous roles it was a joke even don could see that where was that bloody ceridwen why wasnt she up there bloody joke a stunt for miss tammy white its fur was as harsh as a new hairbrush it brushed her left arm raising goosebumps it lay there quite still but with a kind of coiled and eager tension about it she could feel its back alongside her its spine pressed against her it was lean but it was heavy it was beginning to breathe she put out her arm felt an almost liquid frigidity around her hand over the wrist almost to the elbow like frogspawn in a halffrozen pond it turned its grey head and the only white light in the room was in its long predators teeth and the only colour in the room was the still cold yellow of its eyes i am yours i cant diane said he killed your mother ceridwen spoke softly she stood at the top of the stairs she was always very careful coming down them afraid that the size of her belly would make her overbalance she came down one stair at a time one hand on the banister the other holding the pink teddy shed bought for her baby daughter the teddy had a bow around its neck do you remember that teddy no of course you dont because archer burned it on the bonfire your father had rankin build to destroy the bloodcaked sheets all the toys your mother had bought for you archer threw them on the bonfire horrid yellow flames leaping into the night he killed your mother and then he burned her dreams dianes head turned in anguish on the pillow she saw the flames in the eyes of the beast let it go ceridwen said ever so softly yes diane closed her eyes yes nanny seventeen ours the sky over the tor was for a moment as bright and shiny as the membrane over a cows eye and then it blistered lost its focus a fan of flickering colours sprayed up behind the tower before the raggededged clouds closed in like the night coming back and there was a low roaring like thunder deep underground and don moulder got scared he was a superstitious man werent all good farmers superstitious wasnt this what it was all about understanding nature getting a feeling for nature cause nature whatever they said nature wasnt scientific and a dawn that wouldnt decide whether to break was not in don moulders previous experience not even living where he did so don as a superstitious man thought straight off they done wrong the whole thing wrong christians and pagans conciliation you cant have it isnt meant there is but one god and he is sore offended and not only at the trendy bishop and the crazy pagan actress neither of whom was up to the job not only at them but at the bloody ole mad farmer whod brought back satans buzz why the hell had he ever done that miss diane shed brought that thing in miss bloody lady loony what shed got it was catching the heavens over the tor still locked in debate had gone into black and white like dame wandas cloak another lady loony all drawn to that abnormal hill maybe griff daniel was right when he said they oughter ram a jcb through glastonbury tor no more tor no more loonies no more bad dreams for honest godfearing farmers all of a sudden the sky above the tower went as black as old nicks arsehole and there was a great loud crack that had don moulder backing off in something like cold terror she saw the pale lightball again it shimmered like a second chance but she made the black mist cloud over it out of the foetid feralscented air ceridwen spoke and the voice came gutturally like a burp from out of dianes own solar plexus there thats better ceridwen smiled and stood before her diane felt very weak enormously relieved but the relief enclosed an equally enormous sense of loss which she couldnt comprehend it was like a nightmare where youd done something frightfully wrong but awoke before you could put it right and so the relief was relief only at having awakened there were more smiles she saw little rozzie her monkey face split in two with glee mort with his braided hair and his warriors face and inside his robe the biggest dick you ever saw she squirmed in the hospital bed visiting time but it wasnt right was it welcome sister ceridwen stood in the misty candlelight between the great grey concrete pillars her serpentine hair alive with electricity welcome to the inner circle wheres it gone it why its gone about its business ceridwen said ceridwen had been with her forever she must accept this diane giggled she did she felt better the truth was shed never been so relieved that was the truth wasnt it she clutched the darkness to her body wallowed in the dank cloudy vapour got high on the stench a man she didnt know said i think theres someone outside so let them in its probably gwyn you remember gwyn dont you diane when the wooden doors opened diane expected a great and hurtful surge of daylight but thankfully there was only more darkness and people well my goodness said ceridwen and she no longer looked quite so happy if it isnt sister carey st was like entering an elfs house in a childrens storybook but vaster inside the hall of the mountain king the subterranean lair of gwyn ap nudd in fact it was a small storage reservoir half underground with a mound over it like a tumulus it must have been out of commission for over twenty years judging by the size of some of the trees which overgrew it but it was the dream temple a hollow shell inside organic matter directly on the ley virtually under the tor itself any time other than this powys would have been fascinated inside there were no trappings of a temple white or black no pentagrams no inverted crosses only a few dark couches and rugs between the utility concrete pillars brownstained like nicotine fingers bizarrely in the very centre of the former reservoir there was a utility hospital bed metal framed white sheeted diane lay on it shed lost a lot of weight she had an unhealthy pallor obvious even down here she inspected them curiously her mouth tilted into a smile you could only call complacent she showed no relief at their arrival for the first time powys saw ceridwen a heavy wildhaired woman an old hippy gone to seed she was studying juanita in the light of candles held by others men and women in ratty looking robes you look well she said to juanita possibly surprised thats because im one of your failures ceridwen juanita smiled pleasantly the goddess shining in her ceridwen would see that i dont have failures ceridwen said coldly some things merely take longer than others well juanita was brisk we wont waste your time weve come to collect diane smiles vanished but ceridwen seemed unfazed so take her why not diane look whos here juanita said diane diane wore a black nightdress it didnt look right on her or maybe powys acknowledged a cold feeling in his gut maybe it did diane juanita said again approaching tentatively powys just hoping it wasnt too late praying the girl would see the light around her and rush to her diane gave juanita an uncharacteristically coquettish smile fuck off she said sweetly behind her the big wooden doors closed and a shutter clanged in powyss head ok juanita turned abruptly away from the bed powys thought she must be a good deal less cool than she looked forehead furrowed she faced ceridwen close up what exactly have you done ive set her free ceridwen said simply havent i diane yes nanny diane said and giggled powys said shes told her about archer of course ceridwen said to juanita goddess to goddess dark to light and shes conjured dfs pet elemental powys said the wolf from the north and sent it on its way ceridwens voice ringing if you only knew the beauty of it mr jm powys but still looking at juanita you want to explain it to me ceridwen smiled at juanita ill tell you then powys said realising with a feeling of deep sickness that he could goes back to when roger ffitch had the opportunity to lure df even then potentially the strongest magician in the whole of the western tradition on to the dark path by exposing her to the chalice ceridwen didnt react and possibly his cock powys said because roger wasnt subtle if they were going to get diane out of here theyd have to play for time sams fires would bring people any people would do all she had to do powys said was release that black elemental force against him the dark chalice him being a ffitch would have shielded him and both of them would have lived happily and satanically ever after they might even have married right ceridwen turned at last to look at him unfortunately powys said it rebounded as these things often do seldom do ceridwen said but then you would say that wouldnt you making himself meet her brooding dark brown gaze being a crazy old ratbag he smiled at her his insides freezing up at her expression this woman was steeped in it anyway he said she did produce it but she immediately saw what shed done and eventually she gets it back which was tough a lot tougher than letting it go but it made her a better person and stronger better equipped anyway to deal with what shed stumbled on ceridwens steady gaze was a long tunnel no light at the end no end in fact the chalice powys said a receptacle for evil naturally she wanted to destroy it the way shed wanted to destroy roger ffitch but the very act of destruction was negative and it rebounded violet was very confused she could have had it all ceridwen said if thats your idea of having it all powys said mildly it just shows how bloody shallow you bastards are anyway she went back to dr moriarty for advice and maybe he put her on to a third party not an occultist but certainly a visionary someone already obsessed with the concept of the holy grail he held on to ceridwens gaze talking slowly holding the floor aware of juanita moving closer to diane john cowper powys a man with a lot of personal hangups a seriously flawed character but a bit older than violet and smart i can hear df and jcp talking long into the night working out the implications of grail versus antigrail and realising ceridwen said as you obviously cannot grasp that they were dealing with a very ancient duality that everything has its negative that without evil how could we comprehend good that without the sterility of what you naively call good said ceridwen we cannot appreciate the beauty of what you call evil bloody hell ruth powys said admiringly youll be converting me i wouldnt want you as a convert ceridwen said youre no more use than your grandfather or whatever he was probably not powys conceded but they did manage it didnt they df would have decided they needed to conduct a binding ritual to put the chalice itself if not the force behind it into cold storage and give the ffitches at least a chance of salvation it wouldve been jcp who worked out how to do it how to put the arm on roger who by now was back into his nightmares and vulnerable so they bound the chalice to the general benefit of mankind but no help to the ffitches their fortunes hit the skids since when he shrugged the dark chalice has become a legendary prize for um certain species of spiritual pondlife the tall guy with the pigtail stepped forward holding his metal candlestick like a sword you dont have to take this let him finish im nearly there anyway thinking of diane in the hospital bed ceridwen the nurse an idea was forming to liberate the dark chalice and whatever it represents you had to actually corrupt the spirit of df which is no small undertaking it involved creating and developing a whole person you were there when diane was born werent you yes ceridwen looked uncertain and then her face broke into a beam like the sun actually shining out of an arse he thought yes she knows that i was her midwife he imagined juanitas eyes opening wider at that she was no more than a couple of yards away from where diane lay seemingly unaware of any of them through the residual haze of whatever shed been given to sedate her i dont know what you planted in that baby he said but you obviously thought you had to kill her mother to keep it alive archer killed their mother ceridwen said sharply it was quite simple he was a child with a childs simplistic views she was coming between him and his dreams of restoring the familys wealth and influence i bet he didnt do it on his own though youre fantasising mr jm powys but thats your profession isnt it i bet you had a little tug on the old umbilical didnt you ruth her face told him it was inspired thank you god thank you df thank you uncle jack ceridwen recovered rapidly powys thinking how twodimensional these people were it doesnt matter now she said dianes beast is loose the bind is broken the chalice is back in the world the reservoir doors opened archer ffitch stood there he showed no surprise hed been here before of course he had he must have seen the mini vanish in the direction of the barns and known where they were going sorry to intrude archer wore a dark suit but hed taken off his tie he was sweating but all of a sudden one begins to feel safer down here tricky phase transition all that difficult to settle until oliver gets the family trophy out of the well right powys thought they would have to cancel out df before they dare uncover that well the unbinding of the chalice was a number of strands entwining simultaneously something finally pulling them tight just as ceridwen must have sealed the fate of lady pennard by one wrench on the umbilicus he looked at dianes face the eyes flickering vaguely behind the twisted narcotic glaze it was unreal it was insane diane had been brought up from birth to develop a hatred for her brother to have that hatred finetuned to a pitch where it could be released as an entity in itself dragging down the entitys original unwitting creator juanita was standing only a yard away from diane but it was a very long yard come down archer ceridwen called out almost gaily well look after you she turned to powys as we always have ever since his schooldays i was their matron did you know that at school archer and oliver pixhill always inseparable let me get this right juanita said this would be after you were fired from the hospital in oxfordshire for persecuting geriatrics ceridwen turned slowly and jabbed a blunt forefinger at her i know what youve been doing i know youve been leeching on dfs residue or perhaps shes been feeding me juanita said softly i dont care if shes been feeding you ceridwen snarled shes over now juanita or shes ours she has that choice oblivion or the shadier path all this time diane had been quite silent sitting up in her bed like some soiled fairytale princess come on diane juanita said yes go on do ceridwen shrieked go with her diane take it out into the world and to juanita shell destroy you she was always going to destroy you and then shell come back she has to powys was aware of a deepening of the atmosphere in the concrete chamber as though it had become a hall of mirrors and went on and on until the tor rose above it a nightmare corruption of the cavern under the hill of dreams a picture began to form in his head of diane in five or ten years time no more the scatty but tolerable lady loony instead a fat and blackened slyeyed whore a parasite in high society vampish fallen sister of the conservative mp for mendip south fetch he heard it with belllike clarity in his head no one reacted the silence was dull yet charged and then limping down the middle of this endless chamber he saw oh no the familiar black and white amiably lopsided dowsers dog arnold pattered to the bed where diane sat up there was a ball in arnolds mouth a ball of pure white light powys saw it and then he didnt diane shrank back into the metal bars of the headboard powys watched as though from far away as though it was happening in a movie becoming only gradually aware that no one else was looking at the dog or the bed or diane or him but at the open doorway behind archer where lord pennard stood in heavy tweed shooting jacket and plus fours the dawn welling wildly up behind him archer pennards voice rang like steel around the concrete chamber where are you boy father archer didnt move go away this is nothing to do with you go back to the house who are these people archer not your problem ok well talk later is that diane down there i cant see will you leave this to me i wanted very much to believe in you archer pennard said damn it i had to believe to support the future for the simple sake of our continuity i had to believe that you didnt i didnt kill her archer ground it out through his teeth what can i do to convince you i didnt fucking kill my fucking mother you sicken me pennard said sorrowfully perhaps you always did but now you frighten me too and that that is something i really cant live with wait archer moved into the pink light at the entrance listen to me you want to know who killed her he turned to point into the darkness the very heart of the darkness she did you see her you recognise her thats your midwife father from the belvedere clinic ask her ask her the moment seemed to last forever archers finger frozen in the dawn the finger still hanging there as powys saw archers head burst like a bud into flower a free form flower of red and pink and grey and by the time his brain had registered the explosion seen the smoke from the twelvebore heard the shouting and the screams pennard was raising the gun again and the shot from the second barrel took ceridwen in the throat and she seemed to float to her knees astonishment in the deep brown eyes and blood pumping down the robe splashing on the concrete as her head fell off into her lap there was an instant of hollow nothingness at first powys thought he was trembling but it was the ground the ground was trembling still it didnt occur to him what was happening at least not until he saw the cracks appear in the grey concrete pillars of the old storage reservoir and he thought idly what a hell of a flood there would be if it was still in use then amid the incomprehension which preceded the stampede he saw juanita dragging diane from the hospital bed and when his legs would move again he ran to help her and they pulled her kicking and squealing out of the reservoir and into the bleak beginnings of the shortest day and the stubbly wasteland from where sam daniels trio of petrolfired beacons sent signals too late to glastonbury tor eighteen df at first powys thought it must be a frenzied kneejerk reaction to sams beacon fires and then he saw that the three of them were running against a tide of panic breaking on the tor flowing across the fields so many frightened people so much smoke so many abandoned protest placards he couldnt see sam anywhere he thought he heard another shot or maybe he knew that for what remained of the honour of that family there was sooner or later going to be another shot a bigeyed girl in an orange waterproof collided with him he helped her up whats happening whats exploded earthquake tremor the towers collapsing jesus stones and stuff crashing down like the middle ages all over again what powys looked up at the tor the shell of the st michael tower looked full and firm as ever against the pinkstreaked solstice dawn the rest of the church came down in the middle ages a guy with a beard dragging the girl away leaving just the tower doomsday man doomsday juanita heard none of this she was listening to only one voice and that voice came from far inside her and it was saying just get her out of here get her away diane was wrapped in juanitas coat so much weight gone now that it almost fitted her feet sliding about in the clumping shoes juanita had snatched from ceridwens corpse diane seemed completely fogged walking head bowed between juanita and powys arnold hopping ahead of them juanita wondering if anyone else had seen the ball of light in the dogs mouth or heard that headmistressy voice fetch occasionally without looking up diane giggled sister dunn and her drugs drugs that might keep you permanently at that stage between waking and sleeping when as df put it the etheric so easily extrudes drugs which might make it difficult to absorb the full emotional impact of your father discharging his shotgun into the admittedly unloved face of your only brother juanita had seen this happen from behind feeling a light splash of something like lukewarm soup on her forehead refusing to give in to the nausea concentrating on diane who as they were approaching wellhouse lane across the field stopped at a stile juanita followed her eyes they were just a hedge and a gate away from don moulders infamous bottom field juanita caught her breath in one corner was parked a black bus she turned away at once and for the first time dianes eyes met hers and an odd mute plea passed between them the struggle of something attempting to surface juanita glanced quickly at powys the glance said leave us be careful powys said there was a wintry silence around meadwell the gate seemed to click against it when powys lifted the latch he saw the house door hanging open but he didnt go in verity was standing on the path a rigid porcelain doll in a bodywarmer she saw him bit her lip and then beckoned turning away to walk across the lawn to the wilderness part and arnold set off after her which was curious the air was icystill and the tower on the tor seemed suspended in milky light verity led powys to the concrete plinth a perfectly circular black hole in it now a rusting castiron lid lay amid the rubble so oliver pixhill had done it feeling so tired he could hardly stand powys contemplated the final irony of a dark chalice liberated into a world where the only remaining ffitch had tripped over from airyfairy to obscenely possessed verity said nothing from the wet grass to one side she produced a big red rubbercovered flashlight and handed it to powys he knelt above the hole and shone it down recoiling at once looking up at verity oliver pixhill she said dead he he was down there when the tremor came that is i suppose perhaps he lost his balance he glanced back down the well without the light all you could see was a white hand fingers bent what did it mean most likely he was waiting for the dawn verity he had to bring the chalice out at dawn at that moment it was as if they knew about the earth tremor or that something would happen he was thinking of the alignment of the tor meadwell bowermead the reservoir precisely on it the way the road had been dug out the way the trees had been taken out a buildup of violence maybe they needed to unblock the well in advance like you let old wine breathe for a while but what they really needed was for verity to lay down her defences and invite grainger in to do it the little woman was as much a part of the defence system as the binding ritual itself she had to be gently defused like a bomb getting you out of the house was a last resort he said but if you hadnt responded to wandas invitation theyd have had to use a blunter instrument verity winced but he knew that oliver pixhill could never have killed verity such a forcefield surrounding her the little woman who could not see have you called the police oh no ive been praying with mr woolaston woolly she let him in through the back door so he wouldnt have to see woolly whose battered body shed sat beside for perhaps two hours unconcerned about the smells the atmosphere of brutal violence shed lived in the everdarkening meadwell she did not see powys couldnt believe how strong she was surprisingly arnold followed him in a plastic bag stood upside down covering something on the table on the hag it said safeway he swallowed he was very scared rose light dribbled in from the high window tinting the bulging white walls with the effect of watered blood dont you go near it mr powys verity said he stared at it bitter and sickened whatever it was woolly had died for it beaten to death with a brick the bag went in and out of focus he wanted to find that same brick and hammer the chalice flat we should never have left him he said we shouldve called the police no it was my fault if anyones i should have stayed it was my duty and then youd have been he shook his head we were expecting grainger we didnt know what we were dealing with i must have arrived quite soon after that is i didnt know he was still here there was just the hole i thought hed gone i thought it was too late i went back to the house and sat with mr woolaston praying how could she explain any of this to the police still someone would have to try do you wish to see it mr powys why not he said wearily verity grasped the ears of the plastic bag and tugged arnold sat at the foot of the table and growled but didnt move as powys looked with revulsion at the dark chalice don moulder unlocked the bus pulled back the rusted sliding door when juanita tried to follow diane she shook her head she took off juanitas coat handed it to her moulders eyes widened at the long black nightdress whats she gonner do he watched diane as she stepped from the platform into the body of the bus because that buzz look that buzz is full of evil mrs carey i dont care what anybody says in that case come away don well wait over by the gate whatever happens you dont want to see it do you i dont understand none o this no more he was wheezing a bit looking starved tis a black day mrs carey you coulder sworn that ole tower he were gonner go look swayed like in a gale some masonry come down they d say the bishop his face was as white as his collar look you had the feeling we was barely barely a breath away from i dunno the end of it the ole sky changin colour night achangin back to day and day to night i never all my years at this farm never seen nothin like it diane appeared at the bus door she sat on the platform and took off ceridwens shoes tossed them on to the grass then she went back it happened very quickly almost as soon as she entered the bus she knew it was waiting for her it was just as shed last seen it the seat and the couch bolted to the floor the castiron stove the filthy windows you could hardly see out of this was where something began oh a sudden stomach cramp made her double up and then fall to her knees the pain was briefly horrible and when it ebbed she found she had both arms curled around the bus pole she felt like ulysses when he lashed himself to the ships mast to prevent him responding to the call of the sirens when the sob came it seemed to have travelled a long way all the way from north yorkshire in a white delivery van with pink spots diane hugged herself to the pole the sob seemed to make the pole quiver and the whole bus tremble at some point it had begun to creak its chassis groaning as if in some frightful arthritic pain diane clung to the pole she and the bus bound together in the longing for release the dark air seemed to be rushing past as she and the old bus strained to shed their burdensome bulk to soar serenely towards the light but just as she was beginning to feel ever so shimmery as if those excess pounds had begun to float away and she could be as slim as a faun gossamerlight as beautiful as a may queen as pure as a vestal virgin just as the warmth spread over her tummy and down between her legs and she yearned to touch it and just as she began to uncurl her arms from the pole stop a bell rang quite sharply dianes neck arched her arms still enfolded around the metal pole her head thrown back and oh lord the bus begin to move it had been the bell which told the driver to start and stop it had rung only once but it kept on in dianes head a tiny shiny ting and then her face was slapped quite lightly but it was done a voice crisp as the snapping of a wafer dont you dare the other check was slapped and this time it was not done lightly but briskly and efficiently and it stung spinning diane around to look up eyes wide and straining with shock beyond the platform along the deck of the bus who who are you her voice faltered and she hugged the pole it had not been an ordinary slap and she went clammy with fright at what was beginning to happen for along the deck all the interior lightbulbs were coming on small yellow ones in circular holders set into the carved metal ceiling just above the windows the bulbs were feeble nicotinegrimed dustfilmed and flyspattered and they didnt work they didnt work anymore those lights the lights that didnt work shone bleakly down on two rows of seats they put a worn sheen on dark red vinyl they reflected dully from chromed metal corners diane began to blink in terror wet with live sweat lights where the lights were broken seats where there werent any seats this was a bolton corporation bus again which rattled and hissed down grim twilit streets about halfway down the bus there was a blur of presence a haze of movement the bell rang again ting the scene froze clinging to the pole diane saw a grey finger curled in the air there was a red pushbutton in the curved part of the roof and a grey finger crooked over it the grind and hiss of faraway brakes a smell of old polish damp raincoats and perspiration the pole was cold in dianes arms cold against her cheek come on now pull self gether not a baby the words happened in the air like the brakehiss diane saw a grey lady severe hair enclosing a face without features only sternness a hat large beads the face was a swirling of grey black and white particles like blown cigarette ash diane tried to pull herself to her feet using the pole but she couldnt feel her feet at all and the woman glided towards her along the buss dusty aisle diane began to gasp convulsively with fear the shiny pole misted from her breath none of onsense now the voice was thin and fractured like a carradio on fm during a storm in the hills diane sagged against the pole sorrow settled in her chest sorrow received from the greywoman sorrow shimmering in the vagueness of her in the half formed face like a scratched old photograph the scent of old dust and lavender nanny essence of longago nights pillows damp with tears lonely little motherless girl in a house of cold leather guns and uncompromising maleness dianes arms pulled away from the pole at last and she came to her feet and reached out for the crumbling bundle of dusty mothravaged fragments as the lights in the bus died one by one oh nanny and she saw in a comer the yellow eyes in the mist the eyes of her own hatred the evil in her diane felt her stomach shrivel in disgust she just wasnt that kind of person she had no natural aggression she was the sort who ran away and hid and never wanted to harm anyone or anything allow it then what take your edicine girl swallow it diane closed her eyes do it now now diane opened her mouth she breathed it in and it filled her inflating her checks swelling her throat and then her breast bloating her abdomen and finally throwing her to her knees her arms outstretched like a legless rocking doll so cold so cold inside her that it froze her eyes wide and stiffened her tongue she saw then her lower body had become luminous blue radiating icy light and she had no control over any of it was aware of being squeezed out reduced to a small helpless fragment of consciousness a particle of floating fear only a moment away from ceasing to exist she watched her radiant body tossed on to its back on the filthy floor of the bus like an old mattress was aware of the air corning out like vomit in a long swooooosh as if someone was sitting on her stomach diane rolled over it seemed as if shed been separated from her body for a long time but it must have been no more than a couple of seconds it felt strange to want to move an arm and for that arm to move she began to crawl and as the energy returned so did the panic in a rush the dark chalice glistened palely on the kitchen table thats disgusting powys said the words sounding so trite and ludicrous he almost broke out laughing its base was of old blackened oak like the beams of meadwell the wrists emerged from the oak like the stems of yellowing fungi whatever kept the bones of the hands and fingers together it still held strong and the skeletal hands still gripped the bowl of bone the upturned cranium who is it verity verity said nothing is this i mean is this the abbot verity pulled the safeway bag back over the horror shed said vaguely that she must have found it by the side of the well where hed placed it so that he would have both hands free to pull himself out powys banished for ever an image that came to him of verity fresh from her discovery of murdered woolly kicking oliver pixhills groping fingers from the rim of the well shutting out his scream she came down from the bus in floods of tears she didnt know if it was over how was she ever going to know she saw juanita and don moulder over by the gate on the other side of it joe powys stood with little verity and arnold the dog who had brought the lightball into the cold heart of it all and then came a strange jolt in her breast he was shambling slowly across the field towards the bus his head down as if he was scared to look at her his buccaneers hair was matted hed lost his famous earring diane full of tearful longing but still uncertain looked back along the deck of the bus go said the third nanny she had a nice smile epilogue prophecy is a dangerous trade but we may hazard the guess that history will look back to our english jerusalem as the cradle of many things that have gone on to enrich the spiritual heritage of our race dion fortune avalon of the heart for mysticism psychic studies earth mysteries esoterica carey and frayne booksellers high street glastonbury prop juanita carey december danny oh god danny where do i start wheres it going to end youll have read the papers seen the tv reports all concentrating on the pennard madness nobody making the right connections and i know powys phoned you maybe this is entirely superfluous as usual i dont know whether im writing to you or to myself today im going to try to have a long talk with diane ive seen a lot of her of course but theres always been someone else there policemen her solicitor quentin cotton and sam of course shes moved into his flat doesnt like to let him out of her sight she hasnt really taken it all in of course still talks about her father as if he were still alive and still the owner of bowermead hall which she is now of course i don t think any of us have quite taken that in two hundred acres powys keeps saying three vineyards and a pack of hunting hounds at which he grins delightedly at sam and sam looks terribly embarrassed were still staying powys and me at the george and pilgrims he brought the old amstrad across and i sit at the window and tap out this nonsense looking down on high street very unchristmas eve but still there you know still there still with the candle lit in the window of the wicked wax co even the quake didnt put that candle out and i think im happy happier than ive been since i dont know when theres no calm before a storm only tension after the storm thats where you find calm i feel guilty about this guilty because im glad have to be frank and honest here that old pennard killed archer and especially the hateful psychopath ceridwen i can still see pennard framed in the entrance of the reservoir where he was always grey and heavy to me there seemed to be a pure fresh light in him as he raised that gun which just has to be very wrong doesnt it god knows i hate and fear guns as much as sam daniel im sorry ignore this bit im mixed up theres too much i dont understand and yet aspects of it are coming clearer all the time it was only yesterday that it occurred to me that out of all those appalling people in the reservoir and i recognised many of them from that night on the tor there was one missing it was the man who called himself gwyn ap nudd the man in the hairy mask im almost certain now that behind that mask was oliver pixhill diane told me how the whole attitude of the travellers convoy began to change as they approached the start of the st michael line at bury st edmunds what i suppose you would have to call a dark element entered the less serious ones the colourful circusy types had dropped away so that the only remaining members of the original group diane had joined up with in yorkshire were this boy headlice and his socalled girlfriend headlice no home estranged from his family very much a lost boy they needed a sacrifice you see to activate the dark side of the tor on the anniversary of the execution of abbot whiting powys who when pushed will admit to knowing a little about these things says the rootless anonymous travelling population is regarded by working black magicians as a very accessible source of human sacrifices even babies whose birth are unregistered doesnt bear thinking about we know from diane that headlice had been prepared made to walk backwards into every church along the st michael line how more obviously satanic can you get but this kid from what diane says about him would have done it without a qualm equating antichristian with antiestablishment which is utterly wrong when the arimathean planted his staff on wearyall hill the pagans were the establishment and christianity was seriously radical man who actually killed headlice is no more clear than it ever was was it gwyn or mort or rankin and his son or all of them as with hindsight they seem to have been basically on the same side a sacrifice do i believe that really well people have died on the tor in strange circumstances and jim um yes why did jim die was it a case of gwynoliver spotting an opportunity for another abbots night sacrifice feeling that this bolshy little guy had been delivered into his hands it will remain a mystery he always treasured mystery oliver how can we ever know what drove that bastard apart that is from years of resentment at his father and exposure through archer to the allure of the dark chalice they were very close friends from an early age archer and oliver doubtless archer initially cultivated oliver to get close to meadwell and the family chalice he probably believed was calling out to him perhaps this is why colonel pixhill encouraged his poor wife to leave with his son sensing the evil growing in the kid by this time archer and oliver were at boarding school together in wiltshire or somewhere i forget who should be the matron there but one ruth dunn was this coincidence i dont think it was dunn would already have been a serious practising occultist by then who knows what she did with those two boys what perversity they conjured between them its my feeling that while archer initially dominated oliver pixhill it was soon oliver who was controlling archer i suspect he became genuinely powerful in a charles mansonlike way i can imagine him get getting a real buzz out of dumping his city suit every so often stopping shaving and joining up with the travellers as their revered shaman collecting around him a group of the kind of insane occultists this society attracts and acquiring the kind of reputation that scares off the routine travellers and always in the background there was ceridwen i have no explanation for her a psychopath is a psychopath and there are more around than we think even in glastonbury thank god her husband got the kids is all i can say ceridwen oliver archer this was the inner circle these were the people playing with the volatile glastonbury atmosphere i dont like to even imagine what went on down in that disused reservoir the perfect temple as powys called it because of its alignment an alignment they strengthened in the hope of somehow taking control of the tor they nearly did it too with the proposed restriction of access the tor would very soon cease to be everymans temple much of poor woollys paranoia seems to have been well founded and it makes you fear for stonehenge without archers influence i suspect the tame the tor bill will fade ignominiously away as for the road well for a start dianes instructed quentin cotton to tear up any agreement for the sale of land to the department of transport she insists shell actually invite the ecoguerrillas on to her property if it comes to it i suspect in the end we might at least force a change of route well fight anyway we have a lot of battles ahead not least to clear woollys name i want to have some kind of woolaston memorial this is very important to me and i want to publish the avalonian before march one of the issues i want to raise with diane the earth tremor i don t know what caused it was it a timely geological anomaly or was it the conflict of good and evil forces in a psychic hothouse climate some are saying it was the tor announcing its refusal to be tamed others maintain it was a manifestation of gods outrage at a bishop attempting conciliation with the pagans its interesting to me that it happened when the two great spiritual forces were represented on the top of the tor by two distinctly weak links wanda and the bishop not enough power between them to keep a cigarette alight if you imagine a fuse box when the power overloads its the slenderest thread that breaks i think if youd had ceridwen up there facing well maybe even me the way i was feeling that day and maybe still am then perhaps the tower would have come down im not kidding you may have detected that im feeling so much better more energised much more positive about the town about its future yes i believe we can all live together i believe we must invoke the grail which stands for tolerance and acceptance i won t say peace and love and the dark chalice the antigrail i never saw it thank god with don moulders permission verity she wouldnt let anyone else touch it placed the grisly item in the black bus exactly where the radiator grille was coming off and then we set fire to the bus well we didnt know what else to do we burned that damned bus to an absolute shell and then we paid to have it taken away we figured maybe the link was broken with the end of the last male pennard the speculation in the papers is that pennard killed his son by accident while attempting to drive out new age travellers setting up some kind of squat in the disused reservoir on his land the fact that one of the people seemed to be a wellestablished glastonbury citizen was one of the puzzles requiring further investigation another was the apparent murder of councillor edward woolaston by archer ffitchs agent oliver pixhill at his fathers former house verity is still staying with a somewhat chastened wanda i am expecting the home temple to be dismantled diane says she hopes to persuade verity to run bowermead until she decides what to do with it the rankins have gone of course just disappeared hardly a surprise sams been going to bowermead to feed the hounds convinced he can reform them when i start to get depressed about woolly and jim the thought of sam as some kind of pennard consort and particularly what that will do to his revered father always brings me round i mean can you imagine sam with the hunting and shooting mob at meetings of the country landowners association i just love it as for your glastonbury book coauthored by jm powys and myself we may well get around to it although its unlikely to contain much of the above were taking things day by day and night by night love
