the pacifist arthur c clarke king size magazines inc i got to the white hart late that evening and when i arrived everyone was crowded into the comer under the dartboard all except drew that is he had not deserted his post but was sitting behind the bar reading the collected t s eliot he broke off from the confidential clerk long enough to hand me a beer and to tell me what was going on erics brought in some kind of games machineits beaten everybody so far sams trying his luck with it now at that moment a roar of laughter announced that sam had been no luckier than the rest and i pushed my way through the crowd to see what was happening on the table lay a flat metal box the size of a checkerboard and divided into squares in a similar way at the corner of each square was a twoway switch and a little neon lamp the whole affair was plugged into the light socket and eric rodgers was looking round for a new victim what does the thing do i asked its a modification of naughts and crosseswhat the americans call tictactoe shannon showed it to me when i was over at bell labs what you have to do is to complete a path from one side of the board to the othercall it north to southby turning these switches imagine the thing forms a grid of streets if you like and these neons are the traffic lights you and the machine take turns making moves the machine tries to block your path by building one of its own in the eastwest directionthe little neons light up to tell you which way it wants to make a move neither track need be a straight line you can zigzag as much as you like all that matters is that the path must be continuous and the one to got across the board first wins meaning the machine i suppose well its never been beaten yet cant you force a draw by blocking the machines path so that at least you dont lose thats what were trying like to have a go two minutes later i joined the other unsuccessful contestants the machine had dodged all my barriers and established its own track from east to west i wasnt convinced that it was unbeatable but the game was clearly a good deal more complicated than it looked eric glanced round his audience when i had retired noone else seemed in a hurry to move forward ha he said the very man what about you purvis youve not had a shot yet harry purvis was standing at the back of the crowd with a faraway look in his eye he jolted back to earth as eric addressed him but didnt answer the question directly fascinating things these electronic computers he mused i suppose i shouldnt tell you this but your gadget reminds me of what happened to project clausewitz a curious story and one very expensive to the american taxpayer look said john wyndham anxiously before you start be a good sport and let us get our glasses filled drew this important matter having been attended to we gathered round harry only charlie willis still remained with the machine hopefully trying his luck as you all know began harry science with a capital s is a big thing in the military world these days the weapons siderockets atom bombs and so onis only part of it though thats all the public knows about much more fascinating in my opinion is the operational research angle you might say thats concerned with brains rather than brute force i once heard it defined as how to win wars without actually fighting and thats not a bad description now you all know about the big electronic computers that cropped up like mushrooms in the s most of them were built to deal with mathematical problems but when you think about it youll realise that war itself is a mathematical problem its such a complicated one that human brains cant handle itthere are far too many variables even the greatest strategist cannot see the picture as a whole the hiders and napoleons always make a mistake in the end but a machinethat would be a different matter a number of bright people realised this after the end of the war the techniques that had been worked out in the building of eniac and the other big computers could revolutionize strategy hence project clausewitz dont ask me how i got to know about it or press me for too many details all that matters is that a good many megabucks worth of electronic equipment and some of the best scientific brains in the united states went into a certain cavern in the kentucky hills theyre still there but things havent turned out exactly as they expected now i dont know what experience you have of highranking military officers but theres one type youve all come across in fiction thats the pompous conservative stickinthemud careerist whos got to the top by sheer pressure from beneath who does everything by rules and regulations and regards civilians as at the best unfriendly neutrals ill let you into a secret he actually exists hes not very common nowadays but hes still around and sometimes its not possible to find a safe job for him when that happens hes worth his weight in plutonium to the other side such a character it seems was general smith no of course that wasnt his real name his father was a senator and although lots of people in the pentagon had tried hard enough the old mans influence had prevented the general from being put in charge of something harmless like the coast defense of wyoming instead by miraculous misfortune he had been made the officer responsible for project clausewitz of course he was only concerned with the administrative not the scientific aspects of the work all might yet have been well had the general been content to let the scientists get on with their work while he concentrated on saluting smartness the coefficient of reflection of barrack floors and similar matters of military importance unfortunately he didnt the general had led a sheltered existence he had if i may borrow from wilde been a man of peace except in his domestic life he had never met scientists before and the shock was considerable so perhaps it is not fair to blame him for everything that happened it was a considerable time before he realised the aims and objects of project clausewitz and when he did he was quite disturbed this may have made him feel even less friendly towards his scientific staff for despite anything i may have said the general was not entirely a fool he was intelligent enough to understand that if the project succeeded there might be more exgenerals around than even the combined boards of management of american industry could comfortably absorb but lets leave the general for a minute and have a look at the scientists there were about fifty of them as well as a couple of hundred technicians theyd all been carefully screened by the fbi so probably not more than half a dozen were active members of the communist party though there was a lot of talk of sabotage later for once in a while the comrades were completely innocent besides what happened certainly wasnt sabotage in any generally accepted meaning of the word the man who had really designed the computer was a quiet little mathematical genius who had been swept out of college into the kentucky hills and the world of security and priorities before hed really realised what had happened he wasnt called dr milquetoast but he should have been and thats what it christen him to complete our cast of characters id better say something about karl at this stage in the business karl was only halfbuilt like all big computers most of him consisted of vast banks of memory units which could receive and store information until it was needed the creative part of karls brainthe analyzers and integratorstook this information and operated on it to produce answers to the questions he was asked given all the relevant facts karl would produce the right answers the problem of course was to see that karl did have all the factshe couldnt be expected to get the right results from inaccurate or insufficient information it was dr milquetoasts responsibility to design karls brain yes i know thats a crudely anthropomorphic way of looking at it but noone can deny that these big computers have personalities its hard to put it more accurately without getting technical so ill simply say that little milquetoast had to create the extremely complex circuits that enabled karl to think in the way he was supposed to do so here are our three protagonistsgeneral smith pining for the days of custer dr milquetoast lost in the fascinating scientific intricacies of his job and karl fifty tons of electronic gear not yet animated by the currents that would soon be coursing through him soonbut not soon enough for general smith lets not be too hard on the general someone had probably put the pressure on him when it became obvious that the project was falling behind schedule he called dr milquetoast into his office the interview lasted more than thirty minutes and the doctor said less than thirty words most of the time the general was making pointed remarks about production times deadlines and bottlenecks he seemed to be under the impression that building karl differed in no important particular from the assembly of the current model ford it was just a question of putting the bits together dr milquetoast was not the sort of man to explain the error even if the general had given him the opportunity he left smarting under a considerable sense of injustice a week later it was obvious that the creation of karl was falling still further behind schedule milquetoast was doing his best and there was noone who could do better problems of a complexity totally beyond the generals comprehension had to be met and mastered they werenastered but it took time and time was in short supply at his first interview the general had tried to be as nice as he could and had succeeded in being merely rude this time he tried to be rude with results that i leave to your imagination he practically insinuated that milquetoast and his colleagues by falling behind their deadlines were guilty of unamerican inactivity from this moment onwards two things started to happen relations between the army and the scientists grew steadily worse and dr milquetoast for the first time began to give serious thought to the wider implications of his work he ld always been too busy too engaged upon the immediate problems of his task to consider his social responsibilities he was still too busy now but that didnt stop him pausing for reflection here am i he told himself one of the best pure mathematicians in the worldand what am i doing whats happened to my thesis on diophantine equations when am i going to have another smack at the prime number theorem in short when am i going to do some real work again he could have resigned but that didnt occur to him in any case far down beneath that mild and diffident exterior was a stubborn streak dr milquetoast continued to work even more energetically than before the construction of karl proceeded slowly but steadily the final connexions in his myriadcelled brain were soldered the thousands of circuits were checked and tested by the mechanics and one circuit indistinguishably interwoven among its multitude of companions and leading to a set of memory cells apparently identical with all the others was tested by dr milquetoast alone for noone else knew that it existed the great day came to kentucky by devious routes came very important personages a whole constellation of multistarred generals arrived from the pentagon even the navy had been invited proudly general smith led the visitors from cavern to cavern from memory banks to selector networks to matrix analyzers to input tablesand finally to the rows of electric typewriters on which karl would print the results of his deliberations the general knew his way around quite well at least he got most of the names right he even managed to give the impression to those who knew no better that he was largely responsible for karl now said the general cheerfully lets give him some work to do anyone like to set him a few sums at the word sums the mathematicians winced but the general was unaware of his faux pas the assembled brass thought for a while then someone said daringly whats multiplied by itself twenty times one of the technicians with an audible sniff punched a few keys there was a rattle of gunfire from an electric typewriter and before anyone could blink twice the answer had appearedall twenty digits of it ive looked it up since for anyone who wants to know its but lets get back to harry and his tale for the next fifteen minutes karl was bombarded with similar trivialities the visitors were impressed though there was no reason to suppose that the d have spotted it if all the answers had been y completely wrong the general gave a modest cough simple arithmetic was as far as he could go and karl had barely begun to warm up ill now hand you over he said to captain winkler captain winkler was an intense young harvard graduate whom the general distrusted rightly suspecting him to be more a scientist than a military man but he was the only officer who really understood what karl was supposed to do or could explain exactly how he set about doing it he looked the general thought grumpily like a damned schoolmaster as he started to lecture the visitors the tactical problem that had been set up was a complicated one but the answer was already known to everybody except karl it was a battle that had been fought and finished almost a century before and when captain winkler concluded his introduction a general from boston whispered to his side ill bet some damn southerner has fixed it so that lee wins this time everyone had to admit however that the problem was an excellent way of testing karls capabilities the punched tapes disappeared into the capacious memory units patterns of lights flickered and flashed across the registers mysterious things happened in all directions this problem said captain winkler primly will take about five minutes to evaluate as if in deliberate contradiction one of the typewriters promptly started to chatter a strip of paper shot out of the feed and captain winkler looking rather puzzled at karls unexpected alacrity read the message his lower jaw immediately dropped six inches and he stood staring at the paper as if unable to believe his eyes what is it man barked the general captain winkler swallowed hard but appeared to have lost the power of speech with a snort of impatience the general snatched the paper from him then it was his turn to stand paralyzed but unlike his subordinate he also turned a most beautiful red for a moment he looked like some tropical fish strangling out of water then not without a slight scuffle the enigmatic message was captured by the fivestar general who outranked everybody in the room his reaction was totally different he promptly doubled up with laughter the minor officers were left in a state of infuriating suspense for quite ten minutes but finally the news filtered down through colonels to captains to lieutenants until at last there wasnt a gi in the establishment who did not know the wonderful news karl had told general smith that he was a pompous baboon that was all even though everybody agreed with karl the matter could hardly be allowed to rest there something obviously had gone wrong somethingor someonehad diverted karls attention from the battle of gettysburg where roared general smith finally recovering his voice is dr milquetoast he was no longer present he had slipped quietly out of the room having witnessed his great moment retribution would come later of course but it was worth it the frantic technicians cleared the circuits and started running tests they gave karl an elaborate series of multiplications and divisions to performthe computers equivalent of the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog everything seemed to be functioning perfectly so they put in a very simple tactical problem which a lieutenant j g could solve in his sleep said karl go jump in a lake general it was then that general smith realised that he was confronted with something outside the scope of standard operating procedure he was faced with mechanical mutiny no less it took several hours of tests to discover exactly what had happened somewhere tucked away in karls capacious memory units was a superb collection of insults lovingly assembled by dr milquetoast he had punched on tape or recorded in patterns of electrical impulses i everything he would like to have said to the general himself but that was not all he had done that would have been too easy not worthy of his genius he had also installed what could only be called a censor circuithe had given karl the power of discrimination before solving it karl examined every problem fed to him if it was concerned with pure mathematics he co operated and dealt with it properly but if it was a military problem out came one of the insults after twenty times he had not repeated himself once and the wacos had already had to be sent out of the room it must be confessed that after a while the technicians were almost as interested in discovering what indignity karl would next heap upon general smith as they were in finding the fault in the circuits he had begun with mere insults and surprising geneological surmises but had swiftly passed on to detailed instructions the mildest of which would have been highly prejudicial to the generals dignity while the more imaginative would have seriously imperiled his physical integrity the fact that all these messages as they emerged from the typewriters were immediately classified top secret was small consolation to the recipient he knew with a glum certainty that this would be the worstkept secret of the cold war and that it was time he looked round for a civilian occupation and there gentlemen concluded purvis the situation remains the engineers are still trying to unravel the circuits that dr milquetoast installed and no doubt its only a matter of time before they succeed but meanwhile karl remains an unyielding pacifist hes perfectly happy playing with the theory of numbers computing tables of powers and handling arithmetical problems generally do you remember the famous toast heres to pure mathematics may it never be of any use to anybody karl would have seconded that as soon as anyone attempts to slip a fast one across him he goes on strike and because hes got such a wonderful memory he cant be fooled he has half the great battles of the world stored up in his circuits and can recognize at once any variations on them though attempts were made to disguise tactical exercises as problems in mathematics he could spot the subterfuge right away and out would come another billet doux for the general as for dr milquetoast no one could do much about him because he promptly had a nervous breakdown it was suspiciously well timed but he could certainly claim to have earned it when last heard of he was teaching matrix algebra at a theological college in denver he swears hes forgotten everything that had ever happened while he was working on karl maybe he was even telling the truth there was a sudden shout from the back of the room ive won cried charles willis come and see we all crowded under the dartboard it seemed true enough charlie had established a zigzag but continuous track from one side of the checkerboard to the other despite the obstacles the machine had tried to put in his way show us how you did it said eric rodgers charlie looked embarrassed ive forgotten he said i didnt make a note of all the moves a sarcastic voice broke in from the background but i did said john christopher you were cheatingyou made two moves at once after that i am sorry to say there was some disorder and drew had to threaten violence before peace was restored i dont know who really won the squabble and i dont think it matters for im inclined to agree with what purvis remarked as he picked up the robot checkerboard and examined its wiring you see he said this little gadget is only a simpleminded cousin of karlsand look what its done already all these machines are beginning to make us look fools before long theyll start to disobey us without any milquetoast interfering with their circuits and then theyll start ordering us abouttheyre logical after all and wont stand any nonsense he sighed when that happens there wont be a thing we can do about it well just have to say to the dinosaurs move over a bithere comes homo sap and the transistor shall inherit the earth there was no time for further pessimistic philosophy for the door opened and police constable wilkins stuck his head in wheres the owner of cgc he asked testily ohits you mr purvis your rear lights out harry looked at me sadly then shrugged his shoulders in resignation you see he said its started already and he went out into the night
