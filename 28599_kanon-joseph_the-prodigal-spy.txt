joseph kanon the prodigal spy part i unamerican activities chapter february he was not allowed to attend the hearing there was his age for one thing but he knew it was really the reporters from his bedroom window he could see them every morning when his father left the house mr benjamin his fathers lawyer would come for himit was somehow unthinkable that he should make the short walk down nd street to the capitol aloneand the minute they were down the steps nick would see the clusters of hats swooping toward them like birds there was even a kind of ritual about it now no one stood in front of the house usually they were across the street or on the corner drinking coffee from paper cups exhaling little puffs of steam in the cold february air then the front door would open and they would stamp out their cigarettes suddenly on duty and surround his father falling into step with him and mr benjamin as if they were joining them for a stroll in the beginning there had been photographers their hats pushed back on their heads as they popped flashbulbs but now there were just the reporters no one yelled or pushed the ritual had turned polite he could see his father in his long herringbone coat drawing the pack with him as he moved down the street mr benjamin terrierlike hurrying to keep up his father never ignored the reporters nick could see him talkingbut what did he say and nodding his head once nick saw one of them laugh his father had said the whole thing was a goddam circus but from up here in the window watching the hats it seemed friendly a gang of boys heading for school it wasnt though at night alone in the study smoking in the light of the desk lamp his father looked worried his mother always left separately she would busy herself with nora arranging the day then stand in front of the hall mirror touching her hair smoothing out her wool skirt while a cigarette burned in the ashtray on the table where they put the mail when nick came downstairs she would look surprised as if she had forgotten he was in the house then nervously pick up her lipstick to get ready her new dress with its tight cinched waist and fitted top seemed designed to hold her upright every piece of her in place have they gone she said putting on the lipstick uhhuh dad made one of them laugh her hand stopped for a minute then the red tube continued along her lip did he she said blotting her lips but it wasnt a question well ill give them another five minutes they never wait for you you know nick said it was one of the things that puzzled him his mother walked to the hearings alone every day not even a single straggler from the pack of hats waiting behind to catch her how did they think she got there they will one day she said picking up her hat right now all they can think about is your father and his jokes she caught the edge in her voice and glanced at him embarrassed then went back to the hat there was only one nick said i know she said quietly i didnt mean check the window again would you and shouldnt you be getting ready for school i am ready he said going over to the window i dont see why i cant go to the trial not again nicky please and its not a trial for the hundredth time its a hearing thats all a congressional hearing whats the difference your fathers not a criminal thats the difference hes not on trial for anything everybody acts like he is what do you mean has anyone said anything to you at school nick shrugged have they they said hes on trial for being a communist his mother stopped fixing the hat and lowered her hands well hes not on trial and hes not a communist so much for what they know just dont listen okay it only makes it worse theyre looking for communists so they have to talk to a lot of people in the government thats all nick came back to the mirror studying them both as if the world reflected would be his mothers cheerful dream of before when all they had to worry about was school gossip they want to hear what he has to say thats why its called a hearing there she said pressing the hat like a protective shell how do i look nick smiled beautiful oh you always say that she said lightly glancing at the mirror again and leaning forward nick loved to watch her dress disappearing to the edge of her careful absorption it was the harmless vanity of a pretty girl whod been taught that how you looked mattered that appearance could somehow determine events she blotted her lips one last time then noticed his expression honeybun whats wrong why cant i hear him too im not a little kid anymore no she said softly touching the side of his head maybe just to me but ten isnt very old either is it you dont want to grow up too fast is he going to go to jail she knelt down to face him holding his shoulders no look i know all of this seems confusing but its not about you do you understand justgrownups your dads fine you dont want him to have to worry about you too do you itsits a bad time thats all a bad time nora for whom ireland was always just a memory away called it troubles before your fathers troubles started she would say as if everything that was happening to them was beyond their control like the weather but no one would tell him what it actually was you go he said stubbornly its different for me youre just a childit has nothing to do with you its not going to either im not going to let that happen she said holding his shoulders tightly do you understand he didnt but he nodded surprised at the force of her hands youll be late nora said coming into the hall his mother looked up distracted yes all right come on honeybun time for school itll be all right youll see this wont last much longer i promise then well go up to the cabin and forget all about it just us would you like that nick nodded you mean out of school well in the spring dont forget youve got father tim coming over later nora said youll want to be back last time he was halfway through the bottle before you were through the door nora his mother said pretending to scold but laughing in spite of herself listen to you hes not a drinker no the poor are drinkers the rich just dont mind if they do hes not rich anymore hes a priest for heavens sake she said putting on her coat the rich dont change someone elses bottle thats what they like maybe thats why theyre rich still its your bottle and if you dont mind im sure i nora stop babbling ill be back coast clear she nodded her head toward the window how about a kiss then she leaned down to let nick graze her cheek oh thats better im ready for anything now at the door she put on her gloves you remember what i said okay dont listen to the other kids if they start saying things they dont know what theyre talking about anyway it wasnt the other kids about dad it was miss smith oh his mother stopped flustered her shoulders sagging oh honeybun she said and then as if she had finally run out of answers she turned and went out the door after that he didnt go to school at least for a while his mother said still pretending that things were normal now after his parents left the house would grow still so quiet that he would tiptoe listening for the sharp whistle of noras kettle in the kitchen then the rustle of newspaper as she pored over his fathers troubles with one of her cups of tea he was supposed to be reading kidnapped his mother said he was the right age for it but after the wicked uncle and the broken stairs in the dark it all got confusingwhigs and jacobites and you didnt know whose side you were supposed to be on it made no more sense than the papers his father was a new dealer but not a communist and not a republican either according to nora then why was he on trial some terrible woman had said he was a spy but you only had to look at her all made up the way she was to know she was lying and a catholic too which made things worse it was the jews who loved russia not people like his father even though shed hate to think how long it had been since hed seen the inside of a church still and the things they said but when nick asked her to see the newspapers himself shed refuse his mother wouldnt like it so he sat in the deep club chair in the living room pretending to read but listening instead while nora had her tea there was no sound but the ticking of the ormolu clock soon however hed hear the scraping of a chair in the kitchen then the heavy steps in the hall as nora came to peek in before she began her chores nick would turn a page his head bent to the book he wasnt reading until he felt her slip out of the doorway and head upstairs after another few minutes the vacuum would start with a roar and he could go he would race down the back kitchen stairs careful not to hit the creaky fourth step and get the newspaper from behind the bread box where nora always hid it then one ear still alert to the vacuum he would read about the trial kotlar denies allegations committee threatens contempt mundt set to call acheson new kotlar testimony it always gave him an odd sensation to see his name in print his eye would flash down the column kotlar leaping out as if it were in boldface not just another word in a blur of type but it was kidnapped all over again whigs and jacobites the newspapers became part of the spy game the point at first was to see how many rooms he could visit without noras knowingfrom the kitchen up to his fathers study then past the bedroom where she was working this was the best part to his mothers dressing room then back down the stairs carefully now the vacuum having gone silent and into the club chair with the open book before she appeared again not that she would have cared if hed left the roomit was just the game stuck in the house cocooned against the cold outside that kept promising snow he learned its secrets the noisy parts the bad floorboards as if they were bits of braille he could even spy on nora watching through the crack in the door crouching halfway down the stairs until he felt he could roam the house at will invisible his father he knew could never have done this you always knew where he was clunking down the hall to the bathroom at night all his weight on his heels his mother said you could feel him a block away it was nick who knew how to spy he could stand absolutely still like one of those movie submarines with the motors off on sonar silence waiting to hear something then one day by accident he finally saw his father at the hearing nora had taken him downtown to the movies a my friend irma picture with martin and lewis she crossed herself when the newsreel began with the holy year in rome long lines of pilgrims forming at the churches some from germany some even from as far away as america a crowded openair mass a year of new hope for a century half old fireworks exploded over st peters then abruptly the newsreel shifted to washington and the announcers voice turned grim a different kind of fireworks on capitol hill as the house committee on unamerican activities and combative congressman kenneth welles continued the probe into communist subversion in our state department in the box again undersecretary walter kotlar named by soviet spy rosemary cochrane as one of the members of an alleged washington ring he felt nora move beside him and covered her hand to keep her still as the screen filled with his father walking down a corridor to the hearing room wearing the familiar hat and herringbone coat the reporters were more animated now battering him with questions as if they had finally thawed out from their morning vigil in the cold then he was seated at a polished table several microphones in front of him facing a long dais filled with men in suits who kept turning to whisper to aides who sat behind them like shadows away from the lights the man at the center surprisingly young was taller than the others with a thick football players neck bursting out of a suit that stretched across his wide shoulders like a padded uniform mr kotlar in you were a member of the american delegation that attended the yalta conference were you not yes in that capacity did you offer views on the political future of the countries of eastern europe no my views were not solicited but you are czechoslovakian are you not no sir i am an american well mr kotlar thats fine i meant by origin would you tell the committee where you were born i was born in what was then bohemia and is now part of czechoslovakia nicks father said but the carefulness of his answer had the odd effect of making him seem evasive i came to this country when i was four years old but you speak czechoslovakian nicks father allowed the trace of a smile czech no but this wasnt true nick remembered his grandmother talking in her kitchen his father nodding his head at the incomprehensible words i know a few words his father continued certainly not enough to use the language in any official capacity i know a little french too this seemed to annoy the congressman this committee isnt interested in your knowledge of french mr kotlar is it not true that as a member of the yalta delegation you had access to information the russians considered very valuable no i was there strictly as an adviser on lendlease and postwar aid programs my information wasnt classifiedit was available to everyone welles looked the way miss smith did when someone in class was being fresh that remains to be seen mr kotlar he said that remains to be seen he paused pretending to consult a paper but really nick knew just allowing his words to hang in the air lendlease weve all heard about your generosity during the war but after the war you went right on being generous didnt you isnt it true you wanted to give marshall plan aid to czechoslovakia the united states government offered the marshall plan to all european countries maybe it would be more accurate to say that certain officials of the united states government offered that aid officials like yourself or maybe you disagreed did you feel that such an offer was in the best interests of the united states it must have been they turned us down this time there was real laughter and congressman welles leaning into the microphone was forced to talk over it so that when it stopped he seemed to be shouting may i remind our visitors that this is a congressional hearing there were a few flashbulbs mr kotlar you may consider this a laughing matter i assure you the american people do not now this aid you were so eager to hand out a little money for the old countryeven if it was now a vassal state of the soviet empire i think you have your chronology slightly confused congressman at the time of the offer czechoslovakia was a democracy and president benes was eager to participate subsequently of course they declined nick lost his father halfway throughit was whigs and jacobites again too mixed up to sort outand he could tell the audience wasnt really following either they could hear only the rhythm of welless interrogation the slow build and rising pitch that seemed to hammer his father into his chair the momentum of it not the words became the accusation the congressman was so surehe must know it didnt really matter what he said so long as the voice rushed along gathering speed round two the voiceover said introducing another film clip and this time nobody was pulling any punches mr kotlar im sure weve all been grateful for the history lessons unfortunately anyone who changes positions as often as you do is bound to make things a little confusing for the rest of us so lets see if we can find out what you really think id like to talk again about your background if i may welles swiveled his head to the other men at the long table who nodded automatically absorbed in the drama of where he might be going you are i believe a graduate of the harvard law school for a minute nicks father didnt respond as if the question were so unexpected it must be a trick thats correct and can you tell us what you did next did you join a firm or hang out your own shingle or what i came to washington to work for the government that would be lets see is that correct yes of course jobs were tight then so i guess government work was pretty popular welles said suddenly folksy and reminiscent kinda the patriotic thing to do in yes sir they used to say the harvard law school ran a regular bus service down here right after graduation this play to the gallery had the expected effect and welles smiling slyly waited for the laughter to subside then he looked back at nicks father but you didnt come right away did you nicks father looked at him blankly saying nothing mr kotlar is it not a fact that after harvard law school you offered your services to the united mine workers union during their illegal strike it was not an illegal strike just answer the question welles shot back did you work for the umw yes and how much were you paid for this work it was unpaid unpaid free you mean well now im just a country lawyeri didnt go to the harvard law school they usually work for free up there or just the labor agitators he rushed on not waiting for nicks father to reply the party often ask you to do union work mr kotlar no his father said quietly no welles paused they had other plans for you washington plans seems a shame considering the strike went pretty well from their point of view wouldnt you say i wouldnt know i wasnt working for the communist party no just the miners out of the goodness of your heart what made them so special i wonder to work free of charge nicks father waited drawing the room to his side of the table then let his lips form the hint of a smile my father was a coal miner he asked me to help i didnt think i could refuse there was a slight pause and then the room buzzed welles visibly surprised and annoyed covered the microphone with his hand and turned to an aide the other members of the committee began to talk too as if by looking away welles had given them all a brief recess when he turned back to the mike the room grew still expectant im sure the members of the committee all appreciate a sons devotion mr kotlar he said reaching again for sarcasm but the momentum had gone nick wasnt sure what had happened but his father was sitting up straighter no longer letting his shoulders hunch in selfprotection perhaps theyd also appreciate hearing that you didnt confine yourself to legal services in that strike it says here that the picket line at the trousdale colliery got pretty violent you were arrested were you not no there was a scuffle with the company guards thats all no arrests mr kotlar were not talking about a speeding ticket here do you deny there was a violent incident in which you took part i dont deny there was a fight i deny i took part in it oh what were you doing i was trying to stay out of the way now there was real laughter a wave that passed through the room gathering force until it spilled onto welless table breaking as it hit his angry face mr kotlar he said loudly i think ive had enough ive had enough impertinence this committee is charged with the serious businessthe very serious business of investigating communist activities in this country ive had enough of your harvard law school evasions and i think the american people have had enough of highhanded boys who use their tax dollars while they sell this country down the river you go ahead and laugh but that was no scuffle and you are no loyal american when i look at your testimony start to finish i see nothing less than an attempt to deceive this committee and this great country well were not going to be deceived this committee is here to look at unamerican activities in your case i think the people of this country are going to be grateful we did congressman nicks father said his voice tight with scorn the only unamerican activity ive seen is taking place right here in this committee room i hope the people see that too another clip the announcers voice more excited now but the sparring match drew to a close as congressman welles zeroed in on the sensational cochrane testimony the clip must have been from another day because his father was wearing a different suit the gray doublebreasted one nicks mother said made him look heavier mr kotlar rosemary cochrane testified that on several occasions she received government documents from you in her role as a courier for a russian undercover operation the congressman paused do you recall that testimony vividly and you denied these charges in fact you denied ever having met her is that correct to the best of my knowledge i have never met her to the best of your knowledge i am trying to be precise i may have encountered her without my knowing it certainly i have no memory of having done so is that your way of saying no welles said do i have to remind you that youre under oath nicks father managed a wry smile no you dont have to remind me mr kotlar have you ever shopped at garfinkels department store for a moment nicks father looked blank im sorry what have you ever shopped at garfinkels department store the big store down on th street youre familiar with garfinkels yes i suppose so shirts ever buy shirts there i dont remember you dont remember now how could that be my wife usually does the shopping the camera moved to take in nicks mother sitting rigidly at the edge of the row behind her eyes blinking in the unfamiliar light nick felt nora squirm beside him thats it she whispered urgently were going no when its over nick said firmly not moving his head i want to see congressman welles was talking again but i suppose once in a while you find time in your busy schedule to shop for yourself yes and you never bought shirts from miss cochrane was she the salesgirl i dont remember she remembers you mr kotlar she remembers receiving envelopes from you during these little shopping trips does that refresh your memory she is mistaken she even remembers your size fifteen and a half thirtythree can you at least remember that for the committee that your size his father smiled i prefer a thirtyfive he said a longer sleeve a longer sleeve welles repeated sarcastically maybe youre still growing youd better watch your nose then they say it gets longer every time you tell a lie im watching yours too congressman more laughter and this time nick got the joke he remembered pinocchio the sick feeling in his stomach when the boy went to donkey island and couldnt get back he felt it now again that dread being scared while everyone around him was having a good time but his father didnt look scared his smooth lean face was calm as if he knew it was all just a movie and so this weeks round ends in a draw the announcer was saying as both sides retire to their corners to come back to fight another day but it wasnt a boxing match it was a trial and welles was the only fighter who came back in the last clip surrounded by handheld microphones on the windy capitol steps i dont think there can be a doubt in anyones mind that this country is under attack he said his face grave looking straight at the camera these people are using lies and tricks the same way their comrades overseas are using tanks and machine guns to undermine the free world we saw it in the hiss case and were seeing it again here walter kotlar is a communist and hes going to lose his shirtno matter what size he says it is then all at once the screen brightened flooded with florida sun as the newsreel switched to waterskiing formations in cypress gardens nick blinked in the light a man and woman in bathing suits were receiving crowns after a rooster crowed to end the newsreel the screen went dark nick watched the curtain close then open again to start the feature but he was no longer paying attention to any of it nora laughed at some of the movie but nick was thinking about the newsreel and missed the point of the jokes and then had to pretend to laugh when everyone else did he could still see welless wide linebackers face eyes peering out as if he thought he could make you squirm just by looking hard enough he was like one of those guys who kept poking you in the chest until you had to fight but every time nicks father hit back hed get madder hed never stop now the newsreel must be a few days old nick wondered what had happened since after the movie on the street nora was uneasy dont tell your mother she wouldnt like it i wont hes a wicked man the senator hes not a senator well whatever he is she sighed then brightened still ill say this for your father he gave as good as he got nick looked up at her no he didnt he said nick could see the capitol dome from his window if he craned his head to the left but when he lay in the bed facing straight ahead everything disappeared except the tree branches thin and brittle now in the cold in the faint light from the street they quivered when the wind shook them too stiff to bend downstairs the dinner party was still going on nick could hear the voices rising up through the floorboards his mothers occasional laugh earlier she had been nervous her red fingernails brushing over ashtrays as she rearranged things on tables moving the flower vase twice before it seemed right then the doorbell nick helping with the coats in the hall the cocktails and the clink of ice cubes his polite farewells as they finally went in to dinner his mothers promise to be up later as she touched his cheek goodnight the air around her warm with smoke and perfume he had listened on the stairs for a while straining to make out words in the familiar hum then come up to bed lying here watching the branches and waiting she always looked in while the coffee was being served but it was his father who came nick saw the shadow first against the window then turned to see him standing in the doorway taller than hed been in the newsreel nicku you still up uhhuh wheres mom his father came over and sat on the edge of the bed moving the covers up under nicks chin nick caught the faint whiff of aftershave she and father tim are going over old times again you know what thats like nick smiled theyre not even old well they used to be younger anyway your mother enjoys it father tims good for her that way does he hear her confession tim his father laughed i dont think tim has time for church business hes what we call a dinner priestheres a story and pass the port nora says you dont like priests she says youre anticlerical nick said trying out the word shed better watch out or ill get antinora so why does he come here if youre well he doesnt come for me he and your mother go back a long way since they were your age to tell you the truth i think he was sweet on her dad hes a priest lucky for us huh his father said gently brushing the hair off nicks forehead how about some sleep when grandma talks to you sometimes what language is that czech you know that like when you say nicku uhhuh if you put a u on the end of a name its a way of showing affection sort of a nickname dad why do you ask you told the man you didnt speak czech what man he said his hand stopping on nicks forehead the man at the hearing i saw you in a newsreel today you did huh but nick could tell his father was stalling not sure what to say what did you think do you speak it nicks father sat up not in the way he meant a few words half the time i dont know what grandmas saying why did you think i wasnt telling the truth nick shrugged no he paused why did he want to know that anyway he wanted to make people think i was foreign some people dont like foreigners theyre afraid i guess but lets not worry about it okay its just politics its his way of running for office thats all i hope he loses his father smiled so do i nick maybe well get father tim to send up a few prayers what do you say if we can get him out the door now how about some sleep but he stayed on the bed looking at nick does it bother you all this business why did that woman say she knew you if she didnt i dont know nick his father said slumping a little so the light caught the shiny waves of his hair i dont know maybe she thought she did maybe she met me someplace and decided she didnt like me for some reason maybe shes crazyyou know the way people make things up like when youre afraid of the darkyou think theres someone there even when there isnt well everybodys afraid of the dark now so they keep seeing things grownups arent afraid of the dark its an expression i mean afraid in general theyre afraid of all kinds of things so they keep seeing bogeymen everywhere i know it doesnt make a lot of sense nick maybe you cant explain a bogeymanhes just there communists you mean his father nodded thats who it is now maybe next week itll be something else nick said nothing thinking not much help is it his father said i dont have an explanation nick are they going to stop they cantnot yet his voice had begun to drift away from nick to some private conversation sometimes i think it was the war we got into the habit of having enemies thats a hard habit to break after a while you dont know any other way to think and one day its over and they turn on all the lights again and expect things to go back to the way they were but nobody knows how to stop theyre used to it they have to get new enemies its the way things make sense to them for always nick said his question brought his father back no he said things change thats why we need people like you he added his voice lighter now he pulled up the covers again who werent there who dont even remember it itll be different for you whats going on now his voice lifted like a verbal wave of the hand youll forget that too itll just be history he paused just a bad dream its not a dream now nick said quietly i saw it his father looked at him stalling again no he said not now then he tapped nicks forehead with his finger youre a pragmatist nick thats what you are whats that oh someone who keeps his eye on the ball feet on the ground you know not like someone else we know huh he said pointing to himself mom says im like you arent you a pragmatist nick said getting it right sure not as good as you though youll have to help me out okay keep me on my toes nick nodded but he knew with the same dread hed felt in the movies there was nothing he could do to help his father was just trying to make him feel bettera different land of lie like pretending he wasnt worried pretending it was all going to go away thats the thing about history anyway his father said you still have to live through it before you know how its going to come out so you keep me on my toes of course to do that you have to grow and to do that i know sleep but dad ssh no more well talk tomorrow its supposed to snow you know ill bet its already snowing up at the cabin wind blowing it all over the place swoosh his father leaned over and made a wind sound in his ear tickling him and making him burrow deeper under the covers it was their old game from when he was little here it comes down the chimney he made another wind sound but we dont care do we well just stay warm and cozy his father always said that snug as a bug in a rug nick said as he always did thats right his father said softly snug as a bug in a rug dad if it snows will you have to go to the hearing his father smiled i think mr welles would insist no snow days for him dont go nick said his voice suddenly urgent hes trying to get you i saw him ssh dont worry he wont hes only a bogeyman and they never get anybody we make them up remember he said playfully then seeing nicks solemn face he nodded i know ill be careful this ones really there he stood up smoothing the covers he made himself up i guess some world isnt it all he used to be was a dumb cluck from oklahoma walter his mother said from the doorway larrys here nick are you still up weve been going over my defense strategy nicks father said were hoping for a snow day walter his mother said shooting him a glance uncle larrys here nick said starting to get up where not tonight kiddo his father said its late larry wasnt really his uncle his father had met him in college over the serving line in the dining hall according to the family story when nicks father was dishing out food to work his way through penn and larry nursing a hangover tipped a tray onto his fathers white jacket without knowing it his father used to joke that they never changedhe kept working behind the line and larry kept getting things handed to him on a platter indifferent to spills in washington it had been the dining hall all over again his father worked long hours in the agencies larry moved his tray all the way to the white house where his father said he was one of the fairhaired policy boys his hair in fact was fair a bright ginger that reminded nick of van johnson and he had the same open face and easy smile when he took nick and his mother to see the white house one dayeven upstairs since the president was awayhe moved through the rooms as if they were his kidding with the secretaries who waited for his grin an effortless seduction its easy to be charming his father said when your family owns half of philadelphia but in fact he couldnt resist it either he was different with larryeasy and comfortable the way people were when their jokes are too old for anyone else to remember but larry hadnt been to the house for weeks and it was late to call nick wondered what was wrong hes in the study his mother said go ahead ill take care of the others the kittredges look as if theyre settling in for the night nick heard the laugh in her voice the way she used to be at parties so maybe it was all right night nick she said blowing him a kiss she pulled the door behind her but left it half open so that nick could see them starting down the stairs their heads together he didnt wait when he heard the click of her heels on the landing he slid out of bed and darted into the hall he peered over the banister watching his mothers skirt swish down the next flight of stairs then tiptoed down to the second floor he waited until his fathers back disappeared into the study before he crept along the wall angling himself at the open door to see through the crack uncle larry was still wearing his topcoat as if he didnt mean to stay long time no see larry sorry i couldnt get away larry said quickly were redoing the speech i didnt mean the dinner its been a while his father said moving out of nicks line of vision want a drink no i cant stay dont worry nobody saw you the reporters dont show up until morning for christs sake walter larry looked over toward his father then dropped his hat on the leather couch all right maybe a short one he said taking off his coat nick heard his father pour the drink at the sideboard good i thought maybe id reached the leper stage have i larry glanced up sharply no but youre not making any friends in there either walter youve got to stop fighting with him i cant help it his father said coming back into view and handing larry a glass hes a moron hes a moron whos getting headlines hes got nothing going for him but a district full of dust farms and a bunch of indians who dont vote and youre making him a national figure how smart is that come on walter you know how it works youre not exactly new in town the towns changed the town never changes larry said evenly never you just got on the wrong side of it that the view from the east lawn these days his father said okay withdrawn cheers he took a sip of his drink then paused you dont know what its like he said quietly im sorry i missed the party larry said hows livia i need your help larry his father said ignoring the question for a minute neither of them said anything i cant get involved with the case walter you know that we dont go near the hill these days christ we dont even cross the street everybodys too busy ducking under the table his father nodded with a small smile so i heard theyre starting to get lonely over at state states like sick bayeverybodys afraid theyll catch something anyway youve already got benjamin hes the best lawyer in town for this devoted as he is to lost causes his father said taking a drink youre not going to lose just stop fighting with welles hes on a fishing expedition and you keep biting he hasnt got anything so hes trying to nail you for contempt how do you know he hasnt got anything larry looked at him because he never does he said tossing back his drink because i know you the mine workers for christs sake whats next the fucking red cross he hasnt got a thing walter he paused if he did wed have heard about it he turned and started walking a courtroom pace one witness who doesnt even look stable you see the way she twists her handkerchief if this were a real trial benjamin would discredit her in two minutes two minutes then i guess i dont have a thing to worry about his father said easily he leaned against the edge of the desk looking down at his glass nick wonders why shes saying these things ill bet hes not the only one nick started at the sound of his name as if theyd caught him and were drawing him into the room who knows larry said maybe welles is screwing her she wouldnt be the first maybe shes doing it for love she looks the type the point is it doesnt matter all shes got is some cockamamie story about shirts shirts christ where do they get this stuff anyway forget her this is about welles not her welles doesnt know what to do with her either just keep your eye on him his father smiled still looking down thats what nick said too larry stopped disconcerted then walked over to the sideboard to put his glass down well do it then all youve got to do is keep your head walter its her word against yours and yours still counts for something in this town lets not kid ourselves larry his father said slowly im finished in this town thats why i need your help in the quiet nick could hear the sounds from downstairs the indistinct voices and clinks of coffee spoons walter i dont worry it wont cost you anything i dont want a lawyer just some advice advice used to be cheap he got up and walked over to the window out of nicks sight youre a behindthescenes guy its your specialty isnt it i need someone like that now to do what to make a deal with the committee you dont want to do that larry said carefully i have to its going to get worse the room was quiet again what do you mean larry finally said look walter if youre trying to tell me something dont im not your lawyer anything we sayits not privileged you know that his father came back into view his face slightly surprised you dont have to tell me that larry he said gently whats the matter do you think im a communist you too it doesnt matter i dont want to know i mean it not any of it i dont want to know what you joined or who your pals were larry larry held up his hand no listen to me i dont care if you organized the whole goddam dining hall or had a drink with uncle joe at yalta things were different then was it innocent there is no such thing now they can twist anything i cant know what if they call me too they could im an old friend i dont want to be used against you no his father said after a minute nodding to himself not to mention tarred with the same brush thats right larry said quickly embarrassed not to mention this isnt just happening to you his father looked up you dont have to tell me that either larry you dont have a wife who wonders why nobody calls her anymore or a kid who cant go to school without hearing his fathers a criminal i know its happening to all of us but im the one getting beaten up every day this isnt a trialim already guilty im a communist whether i am or not whats the point of going on with it how do i win you dont win you just dont lose it no they lose everybody who comes near me just by being around even old friends he said with a wave of his hand its enough i dont want to go on being a punching bag just to get welles elected you dont have a choice walter larry said slowly and if you handle this right he wont get elected he thinks hes nixon but hes not that good hes still looking for a pumpkin and hes not going to find one all you have to do is let it play itself out forget the politics for a minute will you this isnt about politics yes it is larry said calmly my god how you love all this his father said then turned away larry looked up to answer then seemed to change his mind and took out a cigarette nobody loves this not this its getting in the way of what business as usual nicks father said still sarcastic handing larry a lighter larry nodded nothing moves now were paralyzed until we get him to run out of steam maybe it stops with you walter who knows well that would be nice meanwhile im the one being run out of town a roar of laughter came up from the first floor a party sound and his father smiled involuntarily all evidence to the contrary aside larry smiled back and raised his glass appreciatively his father seeming agitated started pacing across the room look do you think i like asking for help im drowning thats what it feels like sometimes i think were all going to go under if it doesnt stop he paused im not asking you to lie for me or tell the truth for that matter i dont want you to testify i just want you to run a little interference thats all we dont make deals with the committee walter thats right i forgot everyones ducking under the table larry shrugged anyway what have you got to trade twenty names at state thats about the going price these days if you had them which you dont marked down from twenty pieces of silver his father said larry said nothing im going to resign thats what welles wantslets give it to him he can take credit for hounding another red out of the state department cleaning out the stables without having to go to the bother of proving anything since he cant that should put him ahead ill deny it but it wont matter even the people who dont believe it believe it a little we finish out the hearing in closed sessionno more cameras i dont want my kid seeing me in the movies again ever not a bad cover for the committee either people will think they really had something the republicll be safe and ill be out of this end of the drama outside the door nick stood still in disbelief his father always told him never to give up why would he walk away from a fight he wanted to push the door wide open tell him that he didnt mind the newsreel or what people said any of it instead there was only the prickling feeling of dread again where would they go for a minute larry was quiet youre out of your mind he said finally no im not its the way it makes sense do you think welles gives a rats ass whether youre a communist or not the only red hes ever seen had feathers coming out of his head no cameras thats what hes doing this for once they turn the lights off hes gone and right now all hes got is you no one else to call the girl didnt give them any names how they tricked her into naming you i dont know but it wont work again youve seen her up thereshe never expected any of this to happen shes not the bentley type youre the end of the road as far as welles is concerned hes not going to trade you for some musical chairs over at state youre all hes got do you know this larry shrugged nobody keeps a secret in this town believe me his inbox is empty shes not giving him anything she cant even prove what she said about herself at this point hed be lucky to make the charges stick against her she confessed if you believe her maybe she did judge crater too people confess to anythingthey like the spotlight that doesnt make it true even welles is nervous about her the louder he gets the less he has to say then he ought to jump at this he wont listen to me walter there is no deal here welles is too dumb to make one and youre too smart you dont have to give him anythingyou just have to stop fighting with him if he cant cite you for contempt hell walk away with nothing nick heard his father sigh whats the difference larry im going to have to resign anyway i keep waiting for the phone call no itll be a meeting i suppose achesons office just the two of us nothing personal better under the circumstanceschrist ive already been through it why not get something for it a little peace of mind at least if you do that now its as good as an admission walter we cant have that nicks father raised his eyebrows in surprise we youd be a political liability for a moment they stared at each other a silent conversation then nicks father leaned against the desk again i dont care larry im going to resign no its not going to happen that way larry said his voice low and steady as if he were explaining something to a child hes going to shout and youre going to be polite nothing will happen youll be the loyal american you always weremaybe a little foolish and idealistic but nothing worse one of the good guys shelets say she was confused maybe a nut case anyway confused larry moved toward the desk as if he were adjusting the sights of his words taking aim in the spring two three months from now you resign quietly all that time in the limelightwell it would make anyone shy you want the quiet life the administration regrets its a pity reckless accusations are driving talented men out of public life or maybe nothing has to be saidno one notices theyve moved on by the time the elections roll around in the fall youre not even a memory and welles is out on the stump with a different fight on his hands nobodys soft on communism nobodys been embarrassed again an awful stillness in the room its been decided then nicks father said softly its been discussed and then nick saw without knowing why that it was over like a tennis game they dont pay you enough larry his father said finally now slumped against the desk larry looked at him and let it pass this ones for free walter im on your side believe me i do larry thats the funny part well he said standing up and straightening the way he did when he walked over to the net to shake hands a good sport so i get to make a deal after all whats in this one for me youve got to think about your future walter what are you going to do after with my land of resume you mean it never hurts to have friends larry said quietly nicks father nodded thanks for explaining everything so clearly dont walter im not the bad guy im trying to help its a lousy time i know his father said his voice suddenly deflated i know he stood for a minute lost in thought maybe there arent any bad guys anymore yes there are theyre in that committee room he walked over to the couch and picked up his coat look ive got to go you all right nicks father nodded play it smart walter okay his father looked at him then broke the stare and went over and put a hand on larrys shoulder come say hello to livia i cant im late give her my love will you late for what his father said lightly you seeing somebody these days im seeing everybody nothing changes does it larry shrugged it doesnt mean anything you got the only one worth having his father dropped his hand luck youre still lucky larry said putting on his coat he stopped and looked at him just play it smart larry turned toward the door and nick took a step down the hall out of sight ill see myself out larry said youd better go break up the party before the neighbors start complaining dont be a stranger nick heard his father say larrys voice was cheerful again van johnson not me he said he opened the door suddenly before nick could race up the stairs and stood for a second with his hand on the knob looking at nick with surprise then he winked and pulled the door shut behind him he put a finger to his lips and motioned with his head for nick to follow him to the stairs as if they were hiding together at the landing he knelt down hi sport he whispered you okay nick nodded you know what happens to guys who listen at keyholes dont you he said smiling what nick whispered back playing along youll end up working for drew pearson thats what a legman nick said his fathers expression larry looked surprised again then grinned yeah a legman hear anything worth hearing nick shook his head well neither do they mostly he said still whispering come on up you go before they catch us both nick turned to go then looked back at larry dad asked you to help him he said a question larry stood up i cant nick not the way he wants then he smiled and ruffled nicks hair hell be all right dont worry well all help him they heard the sound of the door opening and larry made a face of mock alarm shooing nick with his hand up the stairs and turning away to start down the other flight nick darted up out of his fathers line of sight and watched larrys red hair bob down the stairs in a minute his father followed over the banister nick could see him stop at the foot of the stairs waiting until he heard the front door click shut then he turned straightened his shoulders and went in to join the party no one was going to help all the rest of it the confusing jumble of elections and deals and witnesses still came down to that no one not even uncle larry who had just been trying to make him feel better on the stairs hed heard them his father felt like he was drowning nick wondered what that was really like everything closing around you choking for air reaching up for any hand at all no one it wasnt smart anymore not even for his father to help himself the draft in the hall seeped through his thin pajamas making him shiver he felt like leaping into bed pulling the covers over his head and curling his body into a ball as warm as the cabin fire instead he went down the hall to his parents room the bedside lamps were on surrounded by piles of books and kleenex and alarm clocks he walked over to his fathers dressing area a mirror and a tall row of builtin drawers that pulled out on smooth quiet runners not like nicks which always stuck all the shirts were white stacked in two neat piles he took one out garfinkels all right but the tag under the laundry mark was just as hed said nick almost grinned in relief the next one was the same and suddenly he caught sight of his pajamas in the mirror and felt ashamed this wasnt playing the spy game with nora it was wrong like being a burglar what if his father noticed nick put back the shirts and evened out the edge of the pile but hed already startedwhy not know for sure carefully he flipped through the collars of the shirts looking for the size tags some werent even garfinkels then halfway down he found it a garfinkel label he stared at it not moving his finger barely touching the tag why had he kept it maybe it was a mistake a present from nicks mother but that wouldnt matter uncle larry said nothing was innocent now theyd find it just as nick had there was a laundry mark toohed worn it nick tried to think what that meant no fingerprints that woman any trace of her had been washed away and all the shirts looked alike but what if they had other ways as long as it was here he heard the front door slam voices downstairs saying goodbye and without thinking snatched the shirt closed the drawer quietly and ran back to his room he looked around for a hiding place but then the voices seemed to be coming up the stairs so he shoved it under his pillow and got into bed breathing fast outside the snow had finally begun blowing almost horizontally across the light from the street lamp when his mother peeked in through the door he shut his eyes pretending to be asleep he kept them closed as she crossed the room to tuck him in for a second he was afraid she would fluff his pillow but she only kissed his forehead and drifted away again in a faint trail of perfume tomorrow he would find someplace to get rid of ita trash can not too near the houseand then his father would be safe again then he thought of the laundry mark hed have to cut that out no trace he turned on his side and put one hand under the pillow anchoring the shirt he tried to imagine himself at the cabin again snug but the room stayed cold and awake as if someone had left a window open his grandmother once told him that people in europe thought the night air was poison so they sealed everything tight but now it came in anyway blowing through the cracks making his thoughts dart like flurries poisoning shelter his father was wrong about one thing welles did have to delay the hearing the next day a friday snow covered washington in a white silence trapping congressmen in chevy chase swirling around capitol hill until the dome looked like an igloo poking through the drifts in the streets nothing moved but the plows and a few impatient cars their heavy snow chains clanking like marleys ghost by midmorning everyone on nicks block began digging out a holiday party of scraping shovels and the grind of cars spinning wheels in deepening ruts nicks father helped the other men spread ashes around the tires then push from behind until the cars lurched into the street shuddering with exhaust at the curbs snow was piled into mounds perfect for jumping even mrs bryant next door came out tramping up and down the street in her galoshes and mink coat dispensing cups of chocolate mistress to the field hands afterward nick and his father knocked the heavy snow off the magnolias with brooms to save the branches and it fell on their heads seeping under their collars until they were finally forced inside to dry out they had soup beside the fire the way they did at the cabin and nick hoped the snow would never stop the shirt stuffed now behind a row of books could wait theyll cancel the dance his mother said glancing out the window poor old miriam her first year as chairwoman too she giggled what do they do with the flowers do you think god shell be furious itll be gone by tomorrow night his father said anyway a little snow wont stop her she can fly in on her broom this to nick who laughed walter it snowed last year too remember yes and half the people didnt show poor miriam nick leaned back against the club chair hassock warm from the fire and watched his parents it was the sort of easy conversation they used to have before the troubles her new dress where the united charities money went anyway whether the president would come this year when the phone rang it jolted him as if hed been half asleep his father had barely said hello before his expression changed he glanced up at nicks mother then seeing nick retreated to a series of noncommittal yes and i sees when the call was finished he went up to the study without saying a word nick could hear him dialing then the low tones of another conversation his mother nervous again followed him standing outside the study door with her hand against the frame braced for bad news then she went in closing the door behind her so their voices were no louder than the muffled sounds in the street nick knew they were not going to tell him whatever it was and he wondered in a kind of quiet panic whether hed waited too long to get rid of the shirt the storm had lulled him into thinking there was time but now it was starting again he got up from the floor and headed out into the hall grabbing his winter jacket from the closet before racing up to his room the shirt was still there folded behind the books and he stuffed it under his sweater then put on the jacket buckling the belt to keep the shirt from falling out his boots were in the back mud room drying out so hed have to go that way through the kitchen and where might you be going nora said when she saw him but he was prepared the hill with the sled mom said i could and your boots still wet i dont care everybodyll be there he said pulling them on in a rush whos everybody but nick was already opening the back door everybody and then he was free crossing the back alley courtyard where all the garages were the snow was deep hereno one had bothered to shovel in back yetand it took him a minute or two to reach the garage and find the sled crammed in a corner with rakes and shovels any moment now his mother might appear at the window calling him back but she didnt and after he turned the corner into the alley he knew it was going to be all right the problem was where to dump it the snow had covered the trash cans along with everything else he couldnt just bury it in the snow theyd find it after the melt like a body a mailbox would be ideal but his father had told him it was illegal to put things there somebody would report it pulling the sled behind him he walked as far as massachusetts avenue where the plows had been but it was crowded here store owners shoveling sidewalks people carrying paper bags of groceries so he turned onto a street back toward the capitol he had gone two more blocks before he saw ita storm drain at the curb that hadnt been blocked by snow he looked around then knelt down fishing the shirt out from under his jacket the label he took off his gloves and ripped off the black tag his fingers surprised by the cold then stuffed the shirt into the space behind the grate pushing it with his bare hands until it fell with a quiet thud into the drain he stood up and looked around to see if anyone had noticed but the street was still empty he remembered then that he hadnt cut out the laundry mark but it was too late and maybe it wouldnt matter the sun would melt the snow and the drains would run carrying the shirt along their underground tunnels until they emptied into the potomac or wherever they went miles from the committee room when he reached the capitol a few blocks later making a circle he felt happier than hed been in days somebody had finally helped there were more phone calls in the afternoon and mr benjamin the lawyer came to dinner so nick ate in the kitchen catching only bits of the talk in the dining room no one had to tell him however it was there in noras afternoon paper welles to recall cochrane new cochrane testimony monday hed overheard mr benjamin say that it was a typical welles tactic to tie up the weekend papers in speculation by the time monday rolled around people would think shed already testified and it would hardly matter what she actually said but it mattered to nick he hoped it would be about the shirt floating away when he went to bed that night his mother told him not to worry about anything and he nodded as if theyd both forgotten to pretend he didnt know a thing the reporters were out in front again the next morning even though it was saturday nicks father went out to tell them he had nothing to say but they lingered anyway drinking coffee and looking up at the house waiting for clues no one came nicks father was shut in the study on the phone while nora and his mother fitted her dress for the united charities that night because now his mother said they had to go so nick was invisible again it was easy to disappear when his father came out of the study his face pale and distracted he looked right past him not seeing anything the phone rang and like a sleepwalker he turned back into the room nick had the odd feeling of not having been there at all his mother told him to go outsidethey were building a snow fort across the streetbut he wanted to stay close to his father ready to help he knew he couldnt leave him now alone despite the phone calls someone had to be there he was sitting listlessly in the club chair after lunch when he heard his father in the hall putting on his boots where was he going he looked out the front window checking the street then went back down the hall to the kitchen obviously heading for the back door nick didnt hesitate he grabbed his jacket in the mud room and pulled on his boots without bothering to close the buckles when he stepped out into the snowy courtyard he could see his father already turning the alley corner he followed about a block behind not even worrying if his father turned around trusting his invisibility his father walked past the senate office building then turned down the hill toward union station he wasnt going out for milk or the afternoon papers no errand took you to the station nick watched the herringbone coat cross d street not stopping for the light then weaving through the moats of clear sidewalks between the banks of snow nick picked up his own pace there were always crowds at the station and he might lose him he darted past the line of taxis and into the great hall a roar of loudspeaker announcements and newsboys and shoes clicking on marble nick moved to the side of the rooma kid alone might be suspiciousand walked quickly past the waiting benches crammed with delayed passengers his father stopped and looked around but nick was lucky hidden by a swarm of people heading for the track gates besides you never saw what you didnt expect to see then his father went over to the row of telephone booths and taking off his hat sat down and closed the folding door nick waited by the newsstand trying to make sense of it why come to union station to make a phone call when that was all hed been doing at home but he hadnt bought a ticket that was the main thing he wasnt going anywhere nick stared blankly at the magazines warm with relief the trip home up the hill was longer and nick kept his distance letting the coat stay several blocks ahead he could probably spin off now avoiding any risk of being seen but he wanted to be sure it was only when his father turned into the alley back home that he felt safe again the sky was darkening for another snowfall but he couldnt go in yet not so soon instead he went around the block to the front and pretended to roll snow with the other kids for the big fort when they started throwing snow he was the first to get hit because he hadnt seen it coming he was looking over the reporters hats toward the house protective as a guard dog he ate dinner alone again then went upstairs to watch his parents dress for the ball his father in a tuxedo with jet cufflinks and shiny shoes his mother in a tight shoulderless top and a long skirt that swooped out with stiff petticoats the day was almost over and nothing had happened nick kept glancing at his father wondering if he knew hed been followed but he seemed unaware smoking and fixing his bow tie with some of his old spirit his mother was wearing her good necklace the one with the garnet pendant and she was smiling in the mirror so that nick thought maybe their good luck had come back again it had been like this a hundred times before the warm busyness before a party the air rich with powder and aftershave the telephone rang now what his mother said annoyed well be late his father answered the phone and listened for a minute without saying a word then he put the receiver back gently as if he were afraid of waking someone and looked up at them pale i have to talk to your mother nick he said simply and nick knew that it had come whatever it was he glanced at his mother but her eyes anxious now were fixed on his father ill be there in a minute honeybun his mother said absently and nick dismissed went out and closed the door at first he could hear nothing then a quiet undertone of voices a moan he had to know he crept back to his room then through the door of the connecting bathroom the way he did to fool nora watching her vacuum but now the spy game was real the door to his parents bedroom was open just a crack and at first he heard only conspiratorial whispers then their voices rose his mothers a kind of wail why didnt you tell me i couldnt his father said i couldnt now his mother said inexplicably i didnt know it would be tonight im sorry no i dont believe any of it his mother said and nick could hear a cry beginning in her voice what about us what about us walter im sorry his father said quietly then more audibly come with me are you crazy his mother said you must be crazy everything she broke off sobbing livia please his father said dont touch me she shouted and nick froze for a moment he heard nothing but he didnt dare push the door open then his father was talking so quietly that nick missed the next exchange he heard his mother take a quick few steps no you cant she said its allwalter this is crazy you cant livia i have to he said calmly come with me go to hell she said almost spitting the words livia please his father said nick heard a new sound then realized she was hitting his fathers chest go she said go believe me i never thought never thought she said her voice unfamiliar with scorn never i love you now his mother was crying ill call tomorrow the way i said i dont care his mother said faintly dont say that nick heard his father move toward the door then stop you are so beautiful he said softly for a moment there was absolute silence then i hope you die his mother said nick heard the door close he rushed into the room and saw his mother sink onto the bed her head drooping as if the crying had made her limp his stomach heaved once he had seen a man lying on the sidewalk downtown people surrounding him and calling for an ambulance and hed felt this same fear of life stopping before he could run away then he heard his father below and he bolted from the room clumping down the stairs and racing along the hall until breathless he caught him at the back door his coat already on nick his father said turning dismayed where are you going i have to go away nick he said bending down to face him im sorry i got rid of the shirt nick said you did he said not understanding fifteen and a half thirtythree like the lady said i got rid of it theyll never find it you dont have to go nicku his father said holding him by the shoulders nick watched his fathers eyes fill with tears my god i never meant any of this to happen to you not you do you believe me you dont have to go i cant explain not now i wouldnt know how his father got on one knee his face level with nicks ill never leave you not really he paused would you do something for me make sure your mothers all right nick nodded but what he heard was that his father was really going nothing would stop him now dont go nick said quietly could i have a hug would you do that nick put his arms around his fathers neck smelling the smoke and aftershave no a real one his father said clutching him drawing him tighter and tighter until nick felt that he was suspended without air holding on for dear life they stayed that way until nick felt his fathers arms drop when he finally let go he looked at nick and said okay like the handshake of a deal he got up and went to the door you need your rubbers nick said pointing to the shiny formal shoes his father gave him a weak halfsmile its all right it doesnt matter then he opened the door and started down the stairs leaving nick to close it behind him nick watched through the pane of the mud room door his father didnt go to the garage but headed across the courtyard to the alley his shoes made holes in the snow and even after he was out of sight pausing only once at the corner to look back nick stared at the footprints waiting for them to fill with new snow until finally every trace was gone upstairs his mother was still crying slumped over on the bed in her pretty dress like a stuffed doll when she saw nick she opened her arms wordlessly and held him where did he go nick said but his mother didnt answer just sat rocking him back and forth the way she did when he was hurt finally she wiped her eyes reached back to undo the clasp of the garnet necklace and let it fall slowly into her hand she sat looking at it for a moment then closed her hand over the bright red stone and got up to put it away with the rest of her things chapter the phone rang early the next morning but nick knew it wasnt his father because his mother said no im sorry hes not here and immediately hung up when a little later it rang again she didnt answer but let it go on and on shaking the quiet house until nick thought the entire street must have heard then it stopped and she picked up the receiver put it under her pillow and went down to make coffee nick found her in the kitchen holding a steaming mug and smoking staring at nothing he took out some cereal and poured milk what if he calls he said he wont afterward she built a fire and they sat in their bathrobes looking at it curled up on the couch pretending to be snowbound her face was drawn and tired and after a while the rhythm of the clock and the crackling of the fire made her drowsy and he saw her eyes droop released finally into sleep when he covered her with an afghan she smiled without waking up nick lay with her on the couch and drifted too worn out by the night the key in the lock startled them nora didnt come on sundays and for one wild moment nick thought it might be his father but it was nora on a draft of cold air a glimpse of the reporters outside behind her your phones out of order she said stamping her snowy boots on the hall carpet i took it off the hook nicks mother said half asleep sitting up wheres mr kotlar hes out nicks mother said simply well hes picked a fine time i just wanted some peace thats all his mother said still on the earlier thought dont they ever give up mother of god havent you heard nora said surprised what shes killed herself thats what that rosemary cochrane jumped she held out the newspaper nicks mother didnt move here see for yourself nora said putting the paper down and taking off her coat its a wicked end even for her well the burden on that conscience still i wont speak ill of the dead no his mother said absently reading the paper her face white i thought id better come therell be no peace today for sure the vultures youd better put the phone back or theyll be breaking down the door wheres mr kotlar gone out so early but nicks mother didnt answer oh god she said dropping the paper and walked out of the room well nora said now what she looked at nick still lying under his end of the afghan then puzzled she followed his mother down the hall nick stared at the photograph framed by blurred type she was lying face up on the roof of a car peaceful her legs crossed at the ankles as if she were taking a nap her shoes were gone and one nylon was visibly twisted but her dress high on her thighs seemed otherwise in place only the strand of pearls flung backward by the fall looked wrong tight at the neck dangling upside down in the dark hair spread out beneath her head she didnt look hurt there was no blood no torn clothing no grotesque bulging eyes instead the violence lay around her in the twisted metal of the car roof crumpled on impact enfolding her now like a hammock when you looked at it you could imagine the crash the loud crunch of bones as the body hit bending the metal until it finally stopped falling and came to rest the new shape of the roof its warped shine caught in the photographers flash was the most disturbing thing about the picture in some crazy way it looked as if she had killed the car nicks first thought was that his father could come back now the hearing would be over but that must be a sin even thinking it she was dead he couldnt stop looking at the picture the closed eyes the flung pearls was she dead before she hit the car her neck twisted by the fall she was dressed to go out had she looked at herself in the mirror before she opened the window then the rush of cold air but why would anyone do that the one unforgivable sin what if she changed her mind after it was too late not even the split second to repent damned forever and then his body suddenly warm with panic another thought was it somehow his fathers fault was she ashamed of lying or was it some kind of new attack theyd blame him for this too nick felt a line of sweat at the top of his forehead the hearing their troubles wouldnt endthey would get worse a dead body didnt go away it would start all over againnew questions new suspicions her jump from the world would only drag them down deeper now it was important to know his eyes scanned the surrounding blocks of type trying to reconstruct what had happened a room on the sixteenth floor of the mayflower hotel she had checked in that afternoon under a different name why go to a hotel her apartment was a few blocks away off dupont circle but a threestory housetoo low so she had planned it and the newspaper speculated that in the mayflower shed found more than just height all of washington was in the ballroom below for the united charities ball if she wanted a dramatic final appearance shed picked the right stage nick imagined her at the window the cabs and hired black packards pulling up under the awning watching all the people whod tormented her welles had been there everybody nick stopped for a moment his father was supposed to have been there too was that it a final strike against him in front of everybody larry had said she liked the spotlight there would even be photographers on the street to record the evening and its unexpected climax she was dressed to go out the other details were sketchy lost in long paragraphs of peoples responses welles still in black tie in his photo was shocked and saddened and reserved further comment pending an investigation she had jumped at according to the doorman whod heard the crash the ball had been in full swing she had fallen wide of the sidewalk hitting the roof of a waiting car and injuring the driver who had needed treatment according to the front desk there had been no visitors and according to the district police no signs of struggle in her roomthis was a new idea to nickbut she had ordered liquor from room service and it was assumed she had been drinking she had made no calls there was no note she was survived by a sister living in new york and that was all nick read through the reports again then went back to the picture of her body staring so hard that he saw the grains of ink what had she been like for an instant he hated her why had she done this to them drawn them into this personal mystery that spread touching everything like a spill it wasnt just politics anymore now someone was dead and his father wasnt here nick could hear the phone again what would happen when they found out he was gone larry said they could twist anything nick looked at the woman peaceful and inert theyd blame his father somehow shed only sold him a shirt and look what theyd made of that nick felt a pricking along his scalp she hadnt lied about the shirt his father had but only nick knew that had his father seen her at the hotel there would have been timehe had left the house before the ball started but no one knew that either no one would ever know if he came back nick thought over everything that had happened the night before remembering the words the desperate hug sifting for clues but none of it seemed to have anything to do with the woman at the mayflower nothing to connect his father with her unless she had been the call at union station nick looked up from the paper no one not even his mother could know about that then his father would be safe no connections at all it was only his being away that could make things worse now make people wonder why he was hiding he had to come back nick grabbed the newspaper and ran upstairs to dress through the bathroom door he could hear running water and knew his mother was soaking in the tub hiding in a cloud of steam they were all hiding but they couldnt now he threw on some clothes and went down to his fathers study closing the door behind him when he picked up the phone he heard noras voice polite and normal no hes out would you like to leave a message or try back later he waited for the click then pressed the receiver button again to get the operator to place a call to the cabin there were a few more clicks then the burring of the line ringing a hundred miles away it was a new line finally put in last year and it rang loudly enough to be heard outside nick imagined his father shoveling a path in the snow picking up his head at the sound then stamping his boots on the porch as he came in to answer its all right nick would tell him but the rings just continued until finally the operator came back and asked if he wanted her to keep trying he hung up and turned on the radio perhaps his father hadnt got there yet or the snow had blocked the road the radio was full of the suicide welles was asked if the loss of his witness would call a halt to the hearings no not even this sad tragedy would stop the american people from getting at the truth mr benjamin was saddened but not surprised the poor womans instability had been obvious from the beginning it had been irresponsible of welles to use her as a political tool and now with such tragic consequences the bellhop whod delivered the liquor wouldnt say that she seemed particularly depressed pleasant in fact a real lady shed given him a dollar tip but you never knew did you meanwhile walter kotlar was still unavailable for comment nick listened to it all and he realized that nobody knew it would still be all right if he could reach his father in time he tried the number again it was noras idea to take a tray up to his mother as if she were an invalid she got no sleep i could tell just by the look of her and whereve you been all morning reading so it was a ghost was it with the radio on i can do both your fathers picked a fine time not that i blame him that phone would drive anyone out of the house but her eyes were shiny with excitement and nick could tell she was enjoying it all playing nurse and secretary busy and important so his mother hadnt told her after lunch he sneaked back into the study and tried the cabin again he was listening to the rings willing his father to come to the phone when his mother walked in surprising him nick she said vaguely i thought i heard someone what are you doing she was dressed her skin pink from the bath but her eyes were dull and tired she moved across the room slowly still underwater im calling the cabin she looked at him her face softening hes not there honey nick hung up the phone and waited but his mother didnt say anything it scared him to see her withdrawn drifting somewhere else they needed to be awake now where is he he said as if the question itself finally asked would break the spell he went away she said you know that but where not to the cabin she said to herself her voice unexpectedly wry where did he say anything to you when you saw him nick shook his head no he wouldnt hed leave that for me to explain she took a cigarette out of the box on the desk and lit it nick waited im not sure i can nick she said not yet im not sure i understand it myself then she looked up but its nothing to do with you you know that dont you i know he wanted to stop the hearing thats all but now is that what he told you nick shook his head i just know he stared at her waiting again she leaned her hand on the desk unable to take the weight of his eyes not now nick okay i need some time so you can think what to say she looked at him a halfsmile thats right so i can think what to say there was a knock then nora flung the door open her eyes wide with drama there you are weve got the police now his mother met her eyes then glanced to the phone expecting it to jump no here nora said cocking her head toward the stairs nick saw his mothers face cloud over then retreat again she closed her eyes for a second waiting for this to go away too then opened them and looked at her wristwatch as if she were late for an appointment oh she said and left the room in a daze he and nora glanced at each other a question mark then unable to answer it they followed her down the stairs nick had expected uniforms but the two policemen were in suits holding their hats in their hands we understand your husbands not here one of them was saying yes im sorry can i help could you tell me when youre expecting him im not sure really he didnt say any idea where we might be able to reach him have you tried his office his mother said lightly not meeting nicks look we did that mrs kotlar oh well thats odd is something wrong no we just wanted to talk to him youve heard about miss cochrane his mother nodded then raised her chin my husband didnt know miss cochrane she said plainly the policemen looked at each other embarrassed well we have to talk to everybody you know in cases like this get some idea what may have been on her mind thats one thing weve never known in the awkward pause that followed nick looked at his mother surprised at her tone yes well we dont want to bother you just have your husband give us a call when he gets in would you the policeman handed her a card his mother took it do you want to talk to his lawyer mr benjamin no just have your husband give us a call she jumped when the phone rang involuntarily glancing at her watch again thats all right nora she said quickly ill get it excuse me she said to the policemen picking up the phone on the second ring hello yes nick couldnt see her face but her body leaned into the phone as if she were trying to make physical contact and nick knew it was his father a prearranged contact now he understood her distraction a chance to talk ruined now by the need to pretend her voice unnaturally brisk yes thats right yes she was listening no im afraid i cant would his father know the police were there nick wanted to push them out of the room grab the phone and tell his father to come back im sorry but hes not here just now hes out her voice was odd again so far from intimacy that nick knew it must be a message her own kind of warning yes yes i know now a faint crack or did only nick hear it hes fine she said almost softly and nicks heart skipped his father was asking about him a pause as the caller talked youll have to try later she said formal again her voice rising slightly at the end oh i see then finally her real voice me too she kept her back to them for a minute when she hung up composing herself nick thought and when she turned he saw that it was only partly successful she looked the way she had after the bath slightly drugged and confused she tried a small smile it seems everyone wants to talk to my husband she said apologetically we dont want to bother you the policeman said again getting ready to go what time did you say your husband left what time she echoed weakly nick looked up in alarm she was trying to think what to say again and the call had drained her about eight oclock nick said suddenly he made me cereal first the policeman turned to him not catching noras surprised expression eight oclock is that right mrs kotlar nick mom was still asleep he didnt want to wake her nick thought of the shirt floating down the drains now he had lied to the police too did he say where he was going nick shrugged a meeting i guess he took his briefcase that was stupid theyd find it upstairs the little one he added digging deeper i see eight oclock he get a taxi out front nick saw the trap theyd already asked the reporters a taxi he said pretending to be puzzled no he went out the back he always does that when he doesnt want to talk to the guys out front you know the policeman smiled no but i can imagine must be like living in a fishbowl here sometimes this as a kind of apology to nicks mother well we dont want to bother you he said again as if he really meant it oh mrs kotlar one last thing you didnt go to the united charities ball last night no you and your husband were in all evening then he saw his mother waver again we played scrabble nick said oh yeah the policeman said friendly i won nick said wondering if it was another trap who would believe that my dad lets me win and then they were gone in a small confusion of thankyous and promises to call swallowed up by the reporters hats outside that was dad nick said flatly when he heard the door close his mother looked at him nervously afraid to answer is he all right she nodded would someone like to tell me whats going on around here nora said making cereal she added scoffing but his mothers eyes were filling with tears do you think they knew his mother said to him i tried no just me nick said what nora said again shes worried about dad nick said answering for his mother he said hed be back for lunch nicks mother looked up helpless to correct him lunch nora said working at a puzzle the phone rang again and nicks mother slumped covering her eyes with one hand nick nodded to nora who raised her eyebrows and answered it he led his mother to the couch sat down beside her and put one arm around her shoulder when is he going to come back he said almost in a whisper so nora wouldnt hear his mother shook her head but he has to nick said hes not coming back nick his mother said wearily i wasnt sure until now nick looked at her in confusion the police will come again he has to be back before that theyll look for him his mother put her hand to the side of his face shaking her head its just you and me now you dont have to lie for him nick its not right but she still didnt understand her mind was somewhere away from the immediate danger he was here last night he said looking into her eyes you have to say that what are we doing to you his mother said in a halfwhisper still holding the side of his face call uncle larry nick said larry hell know what to say before they come back his mother shook her head it doesnt matter she said dropping her hand it does theyll blame him where is he i dont know nick im good at secrets ill never tell never so many secrets his mother said vaguely you dont understand i dont know but hes safe she nodded mr welles wont get him she looked at him and then as if she were starting to laugh her voice cracked and she sobbed out loud so that nora looked over from the phone table no she said her voice still in the inbetween place not now nobody will why not nick whispered his voice throaty and urgent why not then she did laugh the other side of the crying hes gone she said wispily moving her hand in the air hes fled the coop before nick could take this in nora loomed in front of them her face white and dismayed ill take her upstairs nick said quickly shes upset it was his fathers voice nora stared at him more startled by his selfpossession than by his mothers behavior when he took his mothers elbow to lead her out of the room nora moved aside stepping back out of their path he led her down the hall but at the stair railing she stopped slipping out of his hand ill be all right she said softly her voice coming back ill just lie down for a while but nick stopped her placing his hand over hers on the rail why wont they get him his mother turned her head looking for nora then lowered it hes not here she said finally hes left the country she took in his wide eyes then looked nervous again so that nick knew she hadnt meant to tell he felt lightheaded the same frightened giddiness as that time when their car had skidded on the ice coming down the hill from the cabin spinning them sideways steer into the slide his father had said aloud giving himself instructions gripping the wheel hard until finally they connected with the road again and he heard the solid crunching of snow there wasnt time to think just to steer mom he said looking into her frightened eyes dont tell anyone else by the next day his father was no longer unavailable for comment he was missing there were more men outside and nick saw that one was now watching the back too nora moved into the guest room bringing her things over in a small valise settling in for a siege the radio said his father had been distraught at the news of the cochrane suicide but how did they know mr benjamin came and uncle larry and the police again two men from the fbi the phone rang each day that week as the spill spread the headlines grew larger so that the mystery itself became the news begging for an answer welles appealed to his father to come out of hiding implying that he had become guilty simply by being absent still there was a new hesitancy in his voice as if having pushed one victim to a desperate act he did not want to be blamed for another walter kotlar had eluded him after all there was an article about the rot in the state department the pumpkin field again the china lobby the unaccountable disappearance proof of some larger conspiracy but the story refused to stay political the mystery seemed too complete for thatit frightened people nobody ran away from a hearing it seemed to belong instead to the tabloid world of personal scandal and wanted posters and cars speeding away in the night a more familiar fall from grace was he still alive sitting in some hotel room with his own open window one day the papers ran some old family pictures nick and his mother she squatting next to him proudly on the pavement as he showed off his new suit to the camera his father as a young man smiling the house on nd street the car still parked in the garage all the pictures of a crime story without any crime all week as the newspapers grew louder and louder until finally like a fire out of oxygen they choked and went out what struck nick was the quiet in the house with all the phones and visitors and black headlines that seemed to carry their own sounds hours went by when there was nothing to hear but the clock people spoke in low voices when they spoke at all and even nora walked softly not wanting to disturb the patient his mother was the patient she spent long stretches sitting on the couch smoking not saying a word her silence her intense concentration on nothing at all frightened him at night alone she drank until finally her eyes drooping she would curl up on the couch avoiding her bedroom and nick would wait until he heard her steady breathing before he tiptoed over and covered her with the afghan in the morning she never wondered where it had come from she seemed to forget everything even what had really happened she told the policea relief that his father had left sunday morning just as nick had said yes theyd played scrabble no he hadnt seemed upset when uncle larry suggested she get away for a few days until things died down she said to him in genuine surprise i cant larry i have to be here if he calls the secret at least was safe she had begun living in nicks story are you all right for money larry said i dont know walter took care of all that you have to know livia shall i go through his things would you mind she shrugged its all in the desk at least i suppose it is the fbi went through it yesterday i dont think they took anything away you shouldnt let them do that livia larry said a lawyer not without a warrant whats the difference larry we dont have anything to hide his mother said and meant it the fbi came often now in an unexpected seesaw of attention as the newspapers grew bored with the story the fbi became more interested they went through his fathers papers opened the wall safe asked the same questions and then went away as much in the dark as before his father had signed a power of attorney for her on saturday which seemed suspicious but his mother didnt know anything about it and what anyway did they suspect in the quiet study everything was in order nick grew quiet too he wanted to go over things with his mother plan what to do but she didnt want to talk so he sat listening to the sounds of the house he thought of everything that had happened every detail studying the cochrane photograph to jolt him into some idea for action but nothing came back but the creak of floorboards a windowpane shaking back at the wind until it seemed that the house was giving up too disintegrating with them he read the hardy boys books he had got for christmas with their speedboats and roadsters and mysteries that were always solved they rescued their father in one wily and resourceful one day after the snow melted he walked down a street to check on the drain but the shirt was gone and he barely paused at the corner before turning back it was his decision to go back to school stifled finally by the airless house when he opened the door that monday the reporters swarmed around expecting his mother then backed away to let him pass like the water of the red sea hi nick one of the regulars said and he gave a shy wave but they let him alone at school the lads backed away too nodding with sidelong glances deferential to his notoriety his teacher pretended hed been out sick and apologetically piled him with back homework she never called on him in class he sat quietly taking notes then went home and worked all evening while his mother sat smoking still drifting he finished all the makeup work in three days turning in assignments that were neater and more complete than before because now it was important to be good to be blameless in the weeks that followed nothing changed at home but outside the reporters dwindled and at school people began to forget that anything had happened when welles suspended the hearings the papers barely noticed as uncle larry had predicted things moved on and it was larry who brought his mother back you cant just sit in the house im taking you to new york for the weekend to do what go to a show go out to dinner get dressed up and show your pretty face all over town he said winking at nick van johnson again cheerful and takecharge i cant yes you can livia you cant sit here youve got to get on with things by going to new york with you larry looked at her and smiled for a start well take the train ill pick you up here at five five no later and no buts he said waving his forefinger surprisingly she went nora stayed the weekend and she and nick went to the movies treating themselves to tea at the willard in the long lobby of red carpets and potted palms no one noticed them on sunday when they went to meet his mother at union station he glanced at the telephone booth then averted his eyes as if he were being watched but his mother seemed better the quiet around her beginning to thaw like the melting snow it was only at night that it came back the dread it was the not knowing everyone acted as if his father were dead but nick knew he wasnt he was somewhere nick lay under the covers watching the tree branch and tried to play the cabin game over the years theyd thought of a lot of places where the wind was blowingthe cabin in the mountains a tent in the desert that big hotel at the grand canyon where theyd gone one summerbut nick couldnt picture any of them instead there was the committee room welles glowering and accusing a body falling in the cold the strange walk to the telephone booth and then always the back courtyard filling with snow i hope you die his mother had said but she hadnt meant that nick just wanted to know and then he could rest it seemed to him that their lives on nd street had ended without any explanation there had to be a reason the hearings were starting again they were looking for more communists so things went on was that all it had been politics a piece of history the trouble with history his father had said is that you have to live through it but he hadnt meant this halfliving in a mystery one day it will all seem like a dream but it wouldnt just the same mystery that was the dread he would never know his mother ended it that spring by selling the house they would start over in new york where nobody cared and nick would go to rhode island where father tim had arranged for a place at his old school tim was taking them there himself in the big desoto he drove like a carriage hands on either side of the wheel as if he were holding reins nick went with him for gas while his mother finished packingan excuse nick suspected for one of father tims chats but tim was bubbly as far away from homilies as a man on a picnic they drove around the mall a last tour youll like the priory he said of course people always say that about their schools i suppose theyre really remembering themselves when they were young nick looked over at him unable to imagine the ruddy face over the white collar as anything but grown up but this time of year he continued taking one hand away to gesture to the tree blossoms well you wont find a finer sight and then youve got newport down the road all the boats i used to love that hundreds of sails all across the bay he stopped aware of nicks silence youll like it he repeated youll see my father wouldnt like it nick said he didnt want me to go to a catholic school father tim didnt say anything to that nick watched him shift uncomfortably in his seat avoiding the subject his fathers name like a cloud over the bright day well give it a chance father tim said youll see but a fair chance mind you dont want to be a burden to your mother not now shes had worries enough to last a lifetime rose isnt as strong as she looks its been a difficult time for her you know what about me nick wanted to say but he was quiet then why do you call her rose father tim smiled well she was rose when i first knew her she hated livia in those days like a roman wife she said you know calpurnia names like that he smiled again glad to reminisce she was just rose quinn then the prettiest girl at sacred heart maybe you should have married her nick said curious to see if his fathers joke had been right well i married the church father tim said but hed misunderstood nick and looked at him troubled hes still your father nick no matter what this was so far from what nick had been thinking that he didnt know what to say instead he changed the subject is it a sin to wish somebody would die to say it i mean yes father tim said a great sin then misunderstanding again you dont wish that do you no matter what hes done no nick said i dont but he was disconcerted tim had opened a different door what did tim think his father had done they stopped for a red light and nick looked across at the smithsonian surrounded by flowering trees of course you dont father tim said anyway thats all past now youll both have a fresh start but not together nick thought he remembered the night his father went away his mother clinging to nick hed imagined going on like that just the two of them now it seemed shed be better on her own putting nick behind her with everything else maybe it was because he looked like his father a visual reminder of what they were all supposed to forget its not easy making a new life father tim said as if theyd already disposed of the old but shell have you to help her now this struck nick as unfair coming from the man whod arranged to send him away but he said nothing youll settle in before you know it father tim went on and its just a train ride from new york youll make new friends itll be a fresh start for you too theyll know nick said at school father tim paused framing an answer its not washington nick theyre a little out of the world up there thats one of the nice things about the old priory they dont hear much i dont care anyway nick said looking out the window at the mall they were climbing the hill now up toward the capitol you mustnt mind what people say nick father tim said gently were not responsible for what our parents do thered be no end to it then god only asks us to answer for ourselves nick said nothing staring up at the capitol where everything had started the flashbulbs and microphones maybe the committee was meeting now banging gavels on the broad table driving someone else away if you commit suicide do you go to hell father tim glanced at him visibly disturbed then nodded yes always yes always you know that nick its a sin against god what if you helped what if you made someone do it then what you mean that poor woman father tim said quietly we dont know why she did that nick you mustnt judge it may not have anything to do with your father no not him i was thinking about mr welles father tim looked at him in surprise mr welles they said in the papers he was pressuring her what if i dont think thats true nick and even if it were we mustnt judge hes only doing what he thinks is right no i saw him hes nick searched for a word but it eluded him bad he finally said knowing it was feeble and childish but his inadequacy seemed to relieve father tim not necessarily he said smoothly i know its hard for you to understand i dont condone his methods either but communists are godless people nick sometimes a man does the right thing the wrong way that doesnt make him bad nick looked at him stunned tim thought his father was godlessthats what hed done we mustnt judge but tim had judged and now he was going to save nick shipping him off to the priests and a world where people didnt hear much save him from his father now this wont do you know father tim said catching his look taking the world on your shoulders like this theyre still pretty young shoulders nick the right and wrong of thingsthats what we spend our whole lives trying to figure out when we grow up he smiled of course some people never do or id be out of business wouldnt i nick saw that he was expected to smile back and managed a nod there was nothing more to say and now he was frightened again even father tim was with the others what youve got to do now father tim said with a kind of forced cheer is get on with your own life never mind about your father and his politics and all the rest of it thats all over youve got to look after your mother now right nick nodded again pretending to agree you have to let go father tim said quietly his final point hes still my father nick said stubbornly father tim sighed yes he is nick and youre right to honor him just as i do mine thats what were asked to do your fathers dead but your fathers gone nick he said as if nick hadnt interrupted maybe forever his voice was hesitant struggling for the right tone he wanted it that way i dont know why you cant hold on to something that isnt there no good comes of that it just makes it harder hes gone im not telling you to forget him but you have to go on hes like my father now its an awful thing and you so young but it would be better if he floundered slowing the car at the light then turned to face nick his eyes earnest and reassuring you have to think of him as dead he reached over and placed his hand on nicks a gesture of comfort nick stared down at it feeling the rest of his body slip away skidding on ice nobody was going to help ever tim was waiting for him to agree his father was godless and he was gone better for everybody its what they all wanted all the others if he nodded father tim would pat his hand the end of the lesson and leave him alone youve got to stop fighting with him uncle larry had said in the study and his father had ill never do that nick said quietly sliding his hand out from under free father tim glanced at him disappointed and took his hand back he sighed again as he made the turn into nd street you will though you know he said wearily sure of the future things pass even this nothing is forever except god and suddenly nick knew what he would do he would remember everything every detail he looked at the street the pinkandwhite blossoms the bright marble of the supreme court building catching the sun and tried to fix them in his mind the curly iron railing in front of mrs bryants house lampposts the forsythia bush then he saw the moving van the big packing boxes scattered all over the sidewalk in front of his house like the mess their lives had become the prettiest girl at sacred heart was standing on the stoop her vacant eyes animated now giving directions to the movers crates for the china the end tables sitting on the patch of city yard spindly legs wrapped in protective brown paper two men in undershirts sweating as they heaved a couch into the van suitcases by the door ready they were really going in that instant as his mother saw the car and waved to them picking her way through the boxes to the curb with a fixed smile he thought finally that his heart would break he wondered if it could literally happen if sadness could fill the chambers like blood until finally they had to burst from it he wouldnt cry he would never let them see that and now his mother was there pretending to be happy and nora all blubbery hugs was handing them a thermos for the ride and father tim was saying theyd better be starting in a minute theyd be gone nick said he had to go to the bathroom and raced into the house leaving them standing at the car he walked through the empty rooms trying to fix them in his memory too but it felt like someone elses house maybe father tim was right things passed whether you wanted them to or not he went up to his fathers study and stood at the door his mother hadnt taken the desk and it still sat there just the desk and the blank walls the window was closed and in the stale air he thought he could still smell tobacco his chest hurt again why did it have to happen he stared at the desk he wouldnt cry and he wouldnt do what father tim had said he wouldnt forget anything his father was somewhere but not in the empty room there was nothing left but a trace of smoke he heard his mother calling and went down the stairs to the car nora cried but he got into the back seat determined not to crack he wouldnt even look back but when the car turned the corner he couldnt help himself and swiveled in his seat toward the back window it was then he realized trying to remember details that something was missing there were no reporters it was over there were just the boxes being loaded into a van three years later in the summer of after the death of stalin and the murder of beria walter kotlar at last gave a press conference in moscow in the chess game of the cold war the move was meant to dismay the west and it did another blow after the disappearance of burgess and maclean like them kotlar denounced western aggression as a threat to world peace but his remarks were limited and he made no reference to the circumstance of his defection his presence was the story nick had waited so long for his answer that when it came a grainy newsclip he felt a numb surprise that it didnt explain anything after all it solved a puzzle but not the one he wanted to solve his father looked well there was the expected storm in the papers the events of retold as news and for a day nick and his mother wondered if their lives would be exploded again but no one called the country had moved on and by that time nick had a new father and a new name and their troubles everything that happened to them had become just a part of history part ii the red menace chapter april vanessa redgraves supposed to show super where the two boys obviously students looked over the iron railings toward the tall houses lining one side of the square i dont know but shes supposed to show check out the cameras far out well be on tv eavesdropping nick smiled and looked toward the embassy steps where the camera crews were setting up the turnout was bigger than hed expected the day was raw and cold damp morning mist still hanging from the trees but the line snaked all around grosvenor square ringing the enclosed park and spilling out down brook street they couldnt all be american the streets were still open to traffic and the police polite and wary walked along the edge of the curb asking the crowd to stay on the pavement the rally like london itself was gentle and friendly in front of the embassy there were microphones for the demonstration speeches and americans against vietnam signs but no one broke out of line or heckled the secretaries going into the building a few faces stared out of the upperstory windows more curious than besieged but no one called out to them the confrontations and shouting belonged somewhere else they were here to listen to speeches and then one by one to read the names of the dead nick looked around for his lse group but theyd become separated earlier and were now swallowed up in the queue one of the organizers megaphone dangling from his neck was moving down the line handing out index cards when you get to the mike just read off the name and place and say dead and then drop the card in the coffin got it dont yellthe mikell pick it up and keep it moving okay no stunts nick took the card pvt richard sczeczynski nu phoc that would have been during tet when the body bags flooded the airport a hundred years ago the organizers looked like teenagers but then everyone in the crowd looked young to him earlier he had noticed a middleaged group in drab overcoatsacademics presumably or english radicals old enough to have tramped from aldermastonbut everyone else seemed to have stepped out of a dorm party smoothfaced and eager wrapped in capes and leather and old army greatcoats a few had peace signs painted on their foreheads underneath the bushy mustaches and lumberjack beards their cheeks were pink it was a thrift shop army castoff shawls and buckskin fringe and tight jeans with shiny studs planted along the seams none of them had been there excuse me a girl behind him said holding out her card do you have any idea how to pronounce this an american voice he looked at herlong blond hair held away from her face by an indian headband shoulders draped with a patterned gaucho capeand took the card hue he said automatically wondering why shed asked she was pretty but slightly drawn dressed to look younger than she was had she been standing there all this time no the name i mean hes deadawful if i couldnt pronounce it i mean nick looked again at the card trochazka he read chaw she said drawing out the flat a like that russian no its a czech name really do you know that nick shrugged its a common name smith jones like that common if youre czech she said are you nick shook his head grandmother you take it then ill never say it right swap okay do you mind nick smiled be my guest he said handing her his card he watched her face as she read it did a doubletake and then gave a wry smile okay you win i cant even start this one is this like jones too no chechinski he pronounced polish you can tell just like that well the ski is polish the rest i dont know im just guessing she looked at him and smiled im impressed she reached over and took back her card grazing his fingers forget the swap though i think i was better off the first time imagine two in a row maybe were the slavic section how do you say yours in czech zs and ys and all that warren oh she smiled sorry no he said studying her face her quick brown eyes meeting his without embarrassment theyre funny names but not to them i know mines chisholm by the way with an l imagine what the poles would do with that she smiled yes imagine he looked at her again wide mouth and pale skin a trace of freckles over the bridge of her nose where are you from she said the usual americanabroad question new york no i mean where here are you with a group lse nick said youre a student he laughed at her surprise too old well the tie he followed her eyes to the seniortutor wool jacket and plain tie hed forgotten he had on are you a teacher no im finishing a dissertation he said the allpurpose explanation for his time away the drift late start what about you oh imjust here she looked away for a second avoiding him and adjusted the heavy bag hanging from her shoulder a shapeless but good soft leadier that seemed at odds with the hippie cape when she turned back he was still staring at her what she said nothing he said catching himself i wasnever mind what she said a laugh now in her throat well i was going to say do you come here often and i realized how dumb it sounded what i meant was have you been to one of these before but what he really meant was why are you here he wondered if she was like the girls in hair floating in a haze of smoke between protest marches and concerts interchangeable parts of the same scene but she was looking at him again with the same frank scrutiny anything but mindless of course she said simply i dont understand people who dont even over here nick said his own doubt she shrugged it all counts somehow why do you same reason i guess he said letting it drop the line moved a little now people drawing nearer to the steps where the speakers had appeared and he began to move with it so do you always wear a tie she said trying to keep his attention he smiled was she flirting with him i have to meet somebody after he said thats all tie people she looked up at him and squinted her eyes tie people parents parents she said disconcerted am i too old for that too she looked at him oddly as if his answer had thrown her a piece from the wrong puzzle they live here she said unexpectedly he shook his head flying visit one meal one tie not too much to ask he glanced at his watch reminded of the time larry and his mother were expecting him in just under an hour whats the matter nothing i she seemed flustered again but now there was a movement in the crowd and before she could finish people began to surge politely around them looking down the street its her someone shouted she came nick glanced toward the corner where a black taxi idled as a tall woman leaned in to pay the fare two women with her greeted the organizers and collected their index cards then steered her away from the photographers who had begun to move in their direction miss redgrave over here she was dressed in a plain pea coat with a long muffler wrapped around her neck as camouflage but in her high boots she towered over the other marchers drawing attention like camera light now the rally had point she ignored the commotion at the steps and quietly joined the line not far from nick thanking the students who moved aside to make a place they nodded shyly pretending to be indifferent but it was a face they had seen twenty feet high and soon they were staring openly sprinkled with the same fairy dust that drew the press can you give us a statement one of the reporters shouted cockney and insistent no sorry she said turning away and staring straight ahead removing herself and will you be speaking today he asked quickly one of the women with her waved an arm to take in the crowd were all speaking today she said just by being here the students around her nodded flattered nick wondered who she was an actress he didnt recognize or a hangeron the willing mouthpiece what about charges that demos like these are actually undermining the progress of the paris peace talks what progress right he said smiling finally jotting something down film stars in politics come on davey not again the woman said surprising nick with the intimacy had they been around this dance floor before maybe she was famous part of the new culture that seemed to have sprung up overnight while he wasnt looking a music without history everyones in politics she said almost offhandedly whether they want to be or not even the dead eh these soldiers here he said nodding toward the index cards think theyd be pleased being part of this there was a question nick thought he wasnt even sure how he felt still alive we honor them as victims not soldiers the woman said then stopped aware that the reporter was writing thats all now please and surprisingly it was the reporter still scribbling nodded and started to back away apparently satisfied with an interview that hadnt really happened nick remembered the reporters in vietnam taking the handouts from the press office knowing they were lies printing them anyway daveys all right the woman now said busily to redgrave who seemed not to hear her valkyrie head still above the crowd the line continued to press from behind drawn to limelight and nick felt himself pushed against the girl at his side hey nick he turned to the yell and saw the crowd rearrange itself as henry from the lse group pushed through he came up to them clearly excited by the day hi he said to the girl i see you found him nick looked at her puzzled and saw her face color with embarrassment i thought hed be over here henry said to her still unaware of her discomfort description fit perfectly she said quietly howd you get lost anyway he said to nick old wiseman came he was asking for you but nick was still staring at the girl she met his eyes as frankly as before then shrugged found out hey is that vanessa redgrave henry said looking around wheres annie annie loves her he finally made eye contact with his girlfriend and jabbed his finger in the air toward the tall woman i just wanted to meet you thats all the girl said still looking at nick but smiling now is that so terrible nick didnt know how to respond was she trying to pick him up is that the way it worked now he looked at her trying to imagine what it would be like a few light exchanges the walk back to her flat the awkwardness until they finally touchedjust like that as easy as the music in spite of himself he grinned no so what do you think he said finally spreading his hands to present himself making a joke of it im not sure yet she said matching his tone i like the tie though look maybe id better explain but she was drowned by the megaphones starting the demonstration and settled for another helpless shrug of the shoulders and a smile that didnt explain anything the crowd grew quiet around them alert and solemn as the speaker welcomed them and asked them to begin the roll call of the dead they stepped forward one at a time to read the names the first few barely audible unsure of the microphones in the distance they could hear a buzz of traffic but the square itself had become a hushed theater and as one name followed another they took on the rhythm of a muffled drum roll corporal ronald stanton ben hoa dead private anthony moro hue dead on and on all the body bags the line shuffled forward holding index cards nick listened for names he might have known ashamed suddenly of flirting he could feel her next to him but she was looking straight ahead serious and it occurred to him that he had got it wrong somehow not a pickup why ask henry anyway none of it made sense except his wanting it to be true flattered by the attention as eager as a teenager splashing on aftershave before a dance lieutenant charles macomb mekong delta dead not even a town just a stretch of swamp at the demonstration in new york they had wanted nick to wear his uniform its important for moral authority the organizer had said a nice kid from columbia still spotted with acne but he had refused did it make him any better to have been there it seemed to nick that he had spent half his life in uniform being goodboy scouts with the proud sash of merit badges rotc always pressed the tropicalweight khakiand it had all come down to a drum roll of names there was no moral authority in a uniform not even this new one of beads and headbands he wondered how many of them had come to a funeral to read the names and were thinking instead about getting laid corporal leonard bauer lon sue dead nick looked up startled he had been to lon sue before hed been transferred back from the field a semicircle of huts and scratching chickens steaming in a hot clearing but who was bauer thered been a little boy killed when the bomb hed been hidingfor whom went off taking a few soldiers with him maybe bauer afterward they had shot the parents who never said a word grateful perhaps not to have to live through the grieving the huts were torched maybe bauer had been one of these shooting flames and yelling hit later by a sniper maybe they were honoring a monster and maybe he hadnt been there at all just a jungle casualty and someone in the office had looked at a map and picked a place of death for his tag now he was another piece of evidence a name for the fulbright scholars and draft evaders and movie stars to drop in a box as the line moved on who could sort it out larry was on his way to paris to negotiate which made him the enemy to miss redgraves friend and maybe he was you go first the girl said and he saw that they were coming up to the microphones a few steps above the young faces and careful policemen he must have been drifting again because she was looking at him curiously as if she were trying to read his thoughts odd the dark eyes in the blond face unless there were hints of green that only showed in the light he tilted his head a little to see and suddenly wished they could go for a walk in the park away from the confusion and mixed motives of a rally that wouldnt matter anyway a blanket on hampstead heath an afternoon of absolute nothing talking idly the image was so real that he wanted to laugh surprised to be thinking in song lyrics instead he nodded back in the raw damp morning and felt guilty he was here for the names he read his card and stepped away from the microphone private leonard prochazka hue dead she read the name perfectly so that he wondered whether she had needed his help at all or had that been playing up too the steady line of readers coming down the steps pushed him farther back into the formless crowd and for a minute he thought hed lost her then he saw her craning her head near the curb obviously looking for him and made his way over spoken like a native he said easily thanks pani prochazkova would be pleased he said testing her but her face was blank his mother he explained oh she looked around at the crowd now what happens speeches do you want to get some coffee i cant really im meeting somebody he fingered his tie remember one tie one meal she nodded look its not what you think she said suddenly hesitant its not she met his look debating then gave it up screw it she said as if youd believe me now anyway look i didnt do this right i just wanted to see she stopped one of my bright ideas not exactly the best place though was it she said extending her hand toward the steps where the names were still being read you probably thinkwell i know what you think take it easy he said smiling want to start this over she smiled i thought you had to go i do can i call you i dont want you to thinkoh whats the difference you probably wouldnt call otherwise anyway we cant talk here he watched her intrigued feeling that he was eavesdropping on a conversation she was having with herself so can i call you she looked at him again the same appraising onceover flaxman doubleoh two nine she said carefully better write it down ill say it three times then its mine for life but this seemed to throw her like the game he said you know for new vocabulary words does that really work she said genuinely curious usually flaxman doubleoh two nine he repeated chisholm with an l she smiled at him molly two ls she said extending her hand to shake his just introduced and im nick he held her hand for a moment ill call he said wondering if he would he watched her cape as she worked her way through the crowd when she turned to look back he felt caught and she laughed at his expression then wiggled her fingers in a wave and was gone what was that about he said to henry still staring after her i dont know she asked if you were around really by name nick said puzzled again henry grinned maybe you were recommended they talk you know he looked for the cape but it had disappeared taking the answer with it a girl at a rally he grinned back yeah right he said the lockerroom answer henry expected if he really wanted to know all he had to do was call i told you demonstrations are the best henry said nick listened to a few of the speeches wiseman the historian who had served churchill in the great days spoke of the folly of imperial adventures then an expatriate writer spoke on the criminality of the bombing the tear in the social fabric at home nobody talked about the lon sue boys parents bowing their heads to the inevitable but what was there to say to that nobody here had pulled the trigger they werent the problem they were the good guys even henry who only pretended to be frivolous and annie in her white makeup and twiggy eye shadow listening hard it was easy to dismiss them and their tiedyed politics but what about the others who used the dead soldiers to justify sending more because otherwise what had been the point private bauer had to be redeemed nick had the same sense of futile dislocation hed felt at the other rallies they were here to talk to themselves but the war had taken on a momentum of its own killing everything who cared why it was crazy if it couldnt be stopped as if he was doing anything about it either dropping a name in a box nick slipped away to the edge of the crowd not even bothering to say goodbye there was nothing worth hearing and he was already late he headed toward the brook street end of the square then turned right down past the bright flags on the connaught to mount street past the antique shops and the smart butcher where dressed fowl hung in the window like pieces of rare furniture the crowd had been yelling back responses to one of the speakers but even that had disappeared by the time he got to berkeley square drowned out by the traffic zipping around the auto showrooms and the old plane trees that had survived the blitz it was a different london here window boxes and polished brass gleaming with privilege with each block he felt he was leaving his own life for the smooth deep pile of his mothers world where every step was cushioned and even the light was soft filtered through trees in the park in new york her windows looked out over the reservoir and here he suspected she would be high over green park exchanging one eyrie for another without bothering to come down to earth when he reached the ritz he hesitated reluctant to go in and instead walked over to the park to have a cigarette theyd still be groggy from a jetlag nap grateful for the delay but larry never napped it was nick who wanted the few minutes to clear his head aside from a few dogwalkers he had the park to himself he sat looking at the canvas lawn chairs scattered on the grass hoping for sun then glanced toward the hotel windows of course theyd be up what did they talk about after all these years their life was still a mystery to him he knew he should be grateful larry had rescued his mother from the bad time when she sleepwalked through the days and had made her happy but shed become someone else there were moments still when she met nicks eyes and he felt they were back in their old life but then the phone would ring or the flowers would arrive and she would turn away literally facing forward as if like lots wife the past would kill turn her into a pillar of salt instead she seemed to spin in a circle of dinners and fittings and weekends and museum committees until exhausted she was too tired to think of anything else it was useless to pretend she didnt enjoy it larry adored her and she answered him with an affectionate attention that nick knew was more than simple gratitude some emotional payback for security they were a couple larry had given them a new life and his mother reveled in it drawing on the blank check of larrys wealth but she had paid something too her laugh was different or was it only age a settling in nick knew that finally it wasnt his concern that he had no right to be uneasy nothing stays the same but when she sat at her dressing table now in her perfect clothes her hair brushed into place he felt that only part of her came back through the mirror and that in all that soft luxury it had become something shiny and hard lacquered with money he stubbed out the cigarette and started back to the hotel in a way nick thought hed been luckier larry had offered the protection and anonymity of his name without asking anything in return his mother had been anxious about them in the beginning but larry had approached him as a kind of thorny government assignment and with his usual tact and steady whittling away had won this negotiation too hed brought him back from the priory he did not ask to be called dad and except for those sundays lugging gear to hockey practice at lasker hadnt tried to be one they got along it came probably as a surprise to them both they were careful and then they were attached in a family neither of them had expected and when nick had left home they found they missed each other the reluctant father and his accidental son larry always introduced him that waymy sonand it had been years since nick had felt guilty hearing it out of deference to his mother they never spoke of his real father because they were conspirators in this keeping his mother happy while she stared out of high windows and never looked back the ritz however had only managed a secondstory room facing piccadilly and as he padded down the corridor past the pink walls and faux louis xvi chairs he smiled to himself imagining their arrival scenehis mother frostily put out larry accommodating larry opened the door still in stockinged feet and suspenders and drew him in with the familiar broad smile and a hand on his shoulder nick come in come in good to see you just let me finish this he said pointing to the telephone lying on the desk the years had thickened him and the van johnson hair was gray but the face was still boyish as eager as a soldiers on leave the duchess is still in her parlor he said nodding toward the closed bathroom for a second nick wondered if it was an unkind joke for in his worst moments he had begun to think of her like the duchess of windsor idle and groomed but larry was incapable of that kind of crack it was just the winking camaraderie of men waiting for their women to dress ill only be a sec he said returning to the phone nick looked past the flowers and the messy coffee tray toward the bedroom piled with suitcases and went over to the window the room was quieter than hed expected the traffic on piccadilly barely audible through the double glazing the bed was still made so no one had napped coffee a wakeup shower the phone callstheir morning was laid out before him like a map already on schedule what time is it there seven try him at home larry was saying well then get him up im seeing david later and hell want to be briefed yes i know but its a courtesy lets not make this into a crisis jimmy theyre not going to walk away from the table its probably just another goddam buddhist holiday theyve got a million of them but find out nick listened to the wheels of power while the midday traffic floated by outside fine larry said signaling to nick that he was finishing and use the telex line will you ill be in and out right later he hung up nick he said fondly shifting gears hows the insider nick said a joke between them a newsweek cover story had labeled him mr insider the old democrat who served both parties and seemed beyond either the surprise nixon appointee to the negotiating team brought back by the wrong party from his banishment to the wilderness during the johnson years that had been the one transition he hadnt survived trickier than truman to eisenhower because kennedy had liked him and that for johnson had been that now he was in because hed been out his hands so clean in asia that hed become a statesman not a fixer outside looking in from the sound of it he said smiling seems im going to face an empty table in paris tomorrow theyre objecting to you nick said surprised theyll get over it they have to whats wrong with you this time old cold warrior something like that hardlinethats the actual phrase funny back then i wasnt supposed to be hardline enough still who was except stalin nick smiled at the play of his mind is it serious but larry was clearly enjoying himself no hos probably still away for the weekend but nobody wants to say the minute he gets back well be bowing and drinking tea and off we go good luck nick said looking at him seriously larry looked up not sure how to respond but before he could say anything nicks mother opened the bathroom door nick she said smiling i didnt hear you she was already dressed a chanel suit with a short skirt and had clearly been putting on fresh makeup so nick expected an airkiss but she rushed across the room to hug him with the old warmth her cheek tight against him youll smear he said laughing oh darling i dont care she said holding him here let me look at you she pulled back holding his upper arms gazing at him fondly and nick wondered again if she saw his father i think youve grown is that possible were supposed to stop but nick the hair she touched the back of his neck too long too scraggly just a trim im sure they have a barber downstairs it wouldnt take ten minutes mother oh i know i know but honestly nick you cant go to the bruces like that you really cant were going to the bruces she sighed oh i know darling im sorry we came to see you and now evangelines carrying on about dinner shes been on the phone half the morning i told her wed said drinks but apparently shes got half of london coming to some reception so now it has to be dinner after and anyway it cant be helped you know what shes like you dont mind really do you sasha will be there i suppose werent you at school together no shes younger oh well its my fault nick larry said i cant say no to david hes still the ambassador anyway we can talk at lunch nick smiled to himself one meal one tie fine he said dont worry about it this all right he touched the lapel of his jacket for tonight dont tease his mother said lightly enjoying herself a proper suit i know you have one funny isnt it men used to come to london just to buy suits and now look at everybody youll feel better at the bruces ill bet the rot hasnt spread there yet hoho his mother said waving her hand but you do see about the hair shell ask i suppose they still have barbers here this to larry a dig at the hotel left over from an earlier conversation i knew we should have stayed at the connaught she said as if somehow the barbershop had already let them down you wouldnt want to be there today anyway nick said skating over it its a little noisy his mother raised her eyebrows theres a demonstration right around the corner at the embassy you mean she said fixing the geography in her head then looking at him you were there nick nodded oh nick you didnt its not fair to larry it really isnt think how it looks i wasnt thinking about that he said glancing at larry darling you have to its just what the papers nobody was looking at me he said vanessa redgrave was there whats it got to do with her his mother said sharply nick shrugged whats it got to do with anybody his mother sighed im not talking about politics im talking about this family larrys in a sensitive position right now im going to be a lot more sensitive if i dont get something to eat larry said anybody else hungry ill just go get my tie he ducked into the bedroom nicks mother followed him with her eyes saying nothing then went over to the coffee table and lit a cigarette its justi dont want anything to go wrong hes so happy being back it might even do some good this war she said exasperated as if shed been given another inferior room then she paused hearing herself and lowered her voice you know what theyre like at the white house they dont trust anybody and they hate the protests they think its about them it is about them you know what i mean they take it all personally they should she glanced up at him stubbing out the cigarette oh i cant talk to you do you think youre the only one against the war everybodys against the war not everybody well larrys trying to do something about it she softened look im not trying to tell you what to do as if i ever could butwell larrys who he is hes public and that makes you public too theyll use you to embarrass him mother nobody even knows who i am there were thousands of people there today thousands but only one of them has a father going to the peace talks he stopped amused in spite of himself at the end run well i cant argue with you there she blushed taking the salute then said oh lets not argue at all i cant bear it nobody talks about anything else anymore i havent come all this way to argue about vietnam she stopped catching herself in the glint in nicks eyes almost laughing oh actually i have havent i well larry has no wonder he doesnt want me to stay i suppose i cramp his style or something anyway i just came to see you between fittings he grinned she smiled back and came over to him nick i am on your side you know how do you think i felt when you went there if anything had happened it didnt i was transferred out of the field remember he said a trial balloon because he had always suspected larry had arranged it but if so he could see from her expression that larry had kept it a secret from her too what difference did that make you dont stop worrying just because anyway never mind youre here and now it might happen to somebody else lots of them she took his point but ignored it following her own thought ive never been so scared in my life i never understood it everybody else got a deferment why didnt you if you feel the way you do i didnt know i felt it then no she said shaking her head something else proving yourself i suppose men and were the ones who end up worrying nick looked away seeing himself for a minute as he had been the blind desperation to be thought loyal beyond reproach like everyone else his friends who were safe without a past could afford to be different so hed gone not fighting for his country just asking for its good opinion not that that was any excuse he turned back you know why her eyes widened as if they had felt the crack that opened up in her and for a moment he thought the crack would widen that at least she could admit this but the lacquer worked she came back together sealed up he saw that he had frightened her and he retreated literally taking a step back she looked at him for a moment but didnt answer and then began her own retreat walking back over to the coffee table would you do something for me could we just not talk about any of this at lunch i dont think im up to it i really dont nick spread his hands no politics no religion oh god that reminds me did i tell you father tim had a heart attack you might send him a note serious well he thought it was indigestion larry said coming out of the bedroom smoothing his tie nick laughed youre both terrible his mother said indulgently i dont know why youre so mean about him she said to nick hes very fond of you he means well nick said tongueincheek well he does anyway at his age anythings serious it would be sweet if you did write i thought you were the same age nick said not quite his mother said but her eyes were happy again enjoying herself what gets me larry said is how anybody dares to confess anything to him mans the biggest gossip ive ever met thats because youre not a catholic you dont confess to a mana priest is someone else then tim takes that sort of thing very seriously you know whatever you might think come on larry said im starving you two solve all the problems of the world while i was in there we left a few for you nick said you go ahead his mother said i just want to fix my face should we start without you larry said implying the usual long wait dont be fresh five minutes not everybody slept all the way over i need a little armor dont do any damage go on off his mother said shooing them out the door they passed up the elevator for the thickcarpeted stairs nick quickening his step to keep up so how are things nick larry said putting a hand on his shoulder as they walked do you like it here it beats law school larry stopped you can always go back and finish you know he said seriously larry larry held up his hand withdrawn he said smiling and started down the hall again but what are you actually doing except having a good time you are i hope when i was your age you seeing anybody nick shook his head you know a girl tried to pick me up this morning at least i think she did larry grinned if you dont know then its time to get out of the library i guess nick said returning the grin it suits me though for now he added wondering if it did if the long afternoons in the stacks were anything more than an academic timeout well its your life sounds a little quiet to me what do you do all day larry said his voice filled with telephones and secretaries and agendas nick smiled to himself at the moment im doing some research for aaron wiseman so he said then catching nicks look he smiled i ran into him when he was in the states last month checking up just a little old habits he brushed it aside what exactly are you writing hes writing i look things up he says historys like a criminal investigation the documents are the clues and youre the detective nick heard it the tiny edge under the geniality instinctively he glanced over but larry was nodding to the bellman at the bottom of the stairs ignoring him so the students do the spade work larry said easily the old fox no wonder he keeps churning them out they turned into the long corridor of the lobby whats this one something about huac i gather he didnt tell you more nick said amused at larrys catandmouse one old fox to another you tell me jacobinism nick said flatly how the patterns never change huac the other committees hes got me on siss the senate committee mr mccarthy larry said after a pause as if hed been trying to place the reference you know he never really cared one way or the other he said his voice oddly reminiscent he did a lot of damage for not caring he didnt though i think he was surprised anybody took it seriously they had passed the palm court with its swirl of angels and gilded moldings when larry stopped and turned to him do you think this is a good idea nick he said still trying to be casual but nick was alert now you dont im not sure what it means to you thats all larry said softly in his voice nick heard the old protection transferring him back from the field again its a research assignment larry thats all there are four of us nothing personal he said he smiled at larry its okay larry looked at him but apparently decided not to press the point well you know your own mind i just dont want you picking at scabs he hesitated dont mention this to your mother nick nodded wondering for a second if that had been his real point all along you know when you live through it larry said suddenly talking to himself wiseman never knew them drunks opportunists little men who wanted to be somebody thats all it ever was he paused theyre not worth your time nick anyway theyre gone not all of them nick said looking straight at him your new boss is still there larry held his eyes for a minute then turned toward the dining room lets go in the maitre d recognized larry and took them across the pink room to a table near the tall windows facing green park the day was still gray and dreary but overhead clouds floated across the painted ceiling sky gold ran along the walls and hung in long swags between the bright chandeliers giving the room the summer luster of a giant jewel box as they opened their napkins waiters swarmed around them removing cover plates dishing out butter taking drink orders so that finally when they were gone nick smiled at the sudden peace imagine what its like at dinner he said apologizing by moving on but larry refused to be distracted i didnt elect him its none of my business yes it is i dont want you protesting me too you thinkwell what do you think i dont see how you can do it nick said simply nixon of all people yes of all people larry said slowly looking down at the table leader of the free world one of historys little jokes he paused as the waiter filled their wineglasses then looked up at nick and said quietly he isnt welles you know was he any better times change nick he said gently you think hes changed dick no he doesnt have an idea in his head never did he took a sip of wine he had instincts though i guess that was all he needed and now his instincts are telling him to end the war no the polls tell him that he just doesnt know how so youre going to help him im going to help him larry nodded my gray hair my years of experience he said sarcastically you can read about it in the papers im going to give him he searched credibility selfpreservations a powerful instinct you can work with somebody whos got that theyll do anything if you find them an out no matter what they said yesterday they dont remember yesterday theyre not stuck in the past nick took the point and looked away what if youre kidding yourself well what if i dont think we can wait another four years to find out this thingriots for christs sake its like watching somebody having convulsions sometimes it feels like another country to me his voice was almost wistful and nick saw suddenly that he was older propped up by the straight shoulders of his tailored suit you wonder where the other one went larry looked up nothings been happening in paris you know nothing they argue about where to sit and youre going to change that larry said nothing then leaned forward a gesture at once earnest and conspiratorial we have to save face nick we cant get out of this otherwise does it really matter if its nixons face thats being saved nick looked away why tell me larry what difference does it make larry kept his eyes fixed on him when you lie down with dogs you pick up a few fleas maybe i want you to know why im doing it before they start to bite youre my son nick he said the words drawing nick back i dont want to be one of your bad guys nick looked at him touched and disoriented as if someone had tried to embrace him in this public overdressed room id never think that he said larry leaned back in his seat drawing away i know what he is im not buying a car from him i just want him to make the peace you dont have to be honorable to do that not even a little not to make a deal you just need a good lawyer larry nodded with a faint smile you just need a good lawyer who knows his way around god how you love all this larry he said then stopped suddenly hearing another voice back at the study door but larry had heard only his thats how it gets done nick nothing ever got decided in the streets he paused letting the ball hit its court then shifted in his chair anyway i didnt bring you down here to argue about nixon i wanted to talk to you before your mother comes down she hates this sort of thingshe thinks were all immortal of course she may be he said smiling what do you mean immortal is something wrong no no nothing like that im in the pink twenty pounds too pink according to my doctor but what does he know he caught nicks look im fine nick its not that he motioned to the waiter to refill his wineglass but im not getting any younger either so we have to think about these things what things money he reached in his pocket and pulled out his wallet then seeing nicks face he laughed no im not trying to give you a fiver here he handed nick a card there are some papers you need to sign needles is sending them to that addressits the firm they use over here they may already be here for all i know anyway give a call and theyll set up a time okay its not very complicated but they can walk you through them of course you can still draw on the trust but this will be yours outright larry what is all this i dont need any money itll all be yours one day nick unless your mother runs through it first which shes capable of doing he said a verbal wink anyway its taxes needles says if i dont start signing some of it over now the government will get it later ive given uncle sam the best years of my life i dont have to give him all my money too so why wait nick looked at the card too surprised to respond larrys heir he ran his finger along the edge it was just a card a harmless token of this easy generosity yet he felt that merely putting it in his pocket would mark a turning make what had been provisional something permanent a formal acceptance you dont have to give me anything larry he said quietly i never expected who else what about your family who my sister i wouldnt give phyllis the time of day besides shes got her own money he leaned forward again nick youre my family legally youre my son im not likely to have another one he covered nicks hand with his own anyway im happy with the one ive got nick looked up from the card i dont know what to say well thank you is always appropriate nick nodded slowly thank you he said then pocketed the card feeling a lightheaded lettinggo he took in the jewelcase room and grinned does this mean im rich comfortable you dont have to vote republican yet nick smiled no strings no strings of course you have to take care of it if you want to keep it theres always that string but talk to needles when you get back he never loses a dime am i coming home when you do larry said maneuvering you dont want to stay away too long whats wrong with london nick said lightly im having a great time girls try to pick me up in the street people take me to lunch and give me money id be crazy to leave just dont let wiseman talk you into another year youre not getting any younger either and now i haveresponsibilities nick said toying with it all those money strings reeling me back in was that the idea he smiled youre an operator larry i have to hand it to you you havent got it yet larry said playing along it has the opposite effect on most people maybe youll go wild instead no you know me i was eagle scout remember look he said leaning forward i know what youre worrying about i havent gone awol this ishe waved his handi dont know r and r i guess ill finish the degree then after ill go home and put on a suit and everythingll work out just the way you want it to you dont have to buy my way back larry looked at him and smiled then theres nothing more i could ask he said and for an instant nick thought he would actually reach over and shake hands youll think of something nick said teasing well dont tell the ambassador where you were this morning ah heres your mother he glanced toward the entrance two maitre ds were leading her across the room a liner guided by tugboats and nick watched amused as heads bobbed up in the wake theyll take you at twothirty she said touching the back of nicks neck as she took her seat downstairs evangelines thrilled youre coming ill bet well she is you know how she loves a party sad really their having to leave shell miss all this she said waving her hand as if the room were an extension of the ambassadors residence have you ordered theyve got five hundred coming for drinks if you can believe it sort of a last hurrah i suppose i wonder who theyll send theyre talking about annenberg larry said who nicks mother said reaching for the menu tv guide larry said smiling campaign contributor generous its too bad his mother said they love david here which annenberg philadelphia larry nodded remember moses nailed before your time he said to nick for income tax evasion eight million penaltyin dollars makes you wonder what he really did now the sons on his way to the court of st jamess he shook his head its a wonderful country nobody remembers anything and for a moment in the pink watteau room it seemed nobody did water over the dam the merciful absolution of time larry grinning and casual was on his way to paris and nicks mother studying the menu hadnt heard a thing maybe hell be better than you think nick said ill tell you one thing his mother said the parties will never be the same never chapter the cars were backed up to the gate at winfield house so nick paid off the taxi and walked the length of the driveway behind the hundred lighted windows regents park stretched for miles as dark as the night sky so that the party seemed at first like a countryhouse ball with marine guards instead of livery men and daimlers and bentleys rolling up like coaches nick had come late to avoid the crush but there was still a line on the steps another for the coats then a final clot at the entrance to the big room where the bruces were receiving the guests nick worked his way around the edge sure that the bruces wouldnt recognize him anyway and grabbed a glass from a passing tray the room was pretty but so crowded that the walls and furniture receded into a flat backdrop blocked out by all the people onstage there was a room beyond and presumably another beyond that bright and noisy and waiters moved between them their plates of canapes emptying and reappearing with the magic of the loaves and the fishes nick passed one of the makeshift bars covered with flutes of champagne and kept moving there was nothing as anonymous as a big party so long as you pretended you were on your way to something and didnt stand against the wall the crowd was hard to read a hodgepodge of english and american voices and nick guessed that it was a general payback partyembassy workers fo civil servants transatlantic businessmen they talked shop and the weather polite and innocuous somebodys new posting a skiing holiday no one mentioned the demonstration in the next room he spied davey the journalist whod tried to interview redgrave but he had moved on too his hair was slicked back now part of the pinstriped crowd nick wondered if he was working finding an item for tomorrows chat columns or just enjoying a perk he was staring over his wineglass his eyes fixed and nick followed the gaze to see what had caught his attention she was standing at the edge of a small group her back to davey wrapped in a sleeveless red dress whose skirt hugging her ended somewhere on her upper thighs when the man behind her moved the full length of her legs sprang into view a jolt of flesh in the crowded room and nicks eyes followed them down to her high heels he glanced back at davey who had tilted his head for a better view and grinned in spite of himself only a crowd this polite or selfabsorbed would miss the only thing worth noticing davey all bad manners and frank appraisal had her to himself nick watched fascinated to see if he would make his move but the wonderful legs seemed wasted on him too he took another drink then looked away back on the job nick walked over to her it was an outrageous dress for a reception about six inches short of propriety a chelsea skirt she was probably one of the english secretaries at the embassy who had dressed for a real party and ended up here instead her hair was piled on top of her head swept up tightly in her one concession to formality but a few strands dangled to the side like loose promises when she turned toward him he stopped he saw the freckles across the bridge of her nose then the eyes as surprised as his flaxman doubleoh two nine he said smiling what are you doing here she said too surprised to stop the question he laughed what are you doing here oh i was brought she said waving her hand and the small silver purse that hung from her wrist but really what are you doing here i was brought too dont worry im not following you he said stepping closer you look different she said nodding at his suit so do you i like your dress she blushed i didnt know ive never been to an open house before i thought she stopped its not just the suit its the hair you cut your hair he shrugged part of the dress code itll grow back who brought you what oh nobody i meangod that sounds terrible a friend of mine at the observer he thought id like to see the other half well here they are youre a journalist just freelance i had some stuff in rolling stone last year though a few other places is that what you were doing this morning no that was me you know ive been wondering all daywhat happened there did we just meet or what she smiled they said at your flat that you were there i was going anyway so but look its no big mystery somebody told me to look you up and i thought id check it out first thats all and im still checking he held her eyes for a moment come to any decision yet about what about whether were going to go out is that what goes on at these parties if you wear a dress like that she looked away look let me ex nick there you are larry said coming up to them having a good time hi larry larry molly chisholm he said an old friend my father larry warren she looked rattled either at the introduction or at larrys appreciative look but managed to shake hands i told you youd find someone you knew larry said to nick still looking at her its a bruce specialty i dont suppose youve seen your mother anywhere nick shook his head then shes probably looking for me ill see you later nice to meet you he said to molly nodding youre joining us later i hope thats just what we were talking about nick said good good i look forward larry said moving off you will wont you nick said but she was watching larry slipping into another group his hand already on someones shoulder you remembered my name she said turning back to him seems only fair you already knew mine how did you by the way i told you a friend she stopped putting something together youre that warren i didnt know nick smiled that warren hes my father come and have dinner anyway you can see what its like in the enemy camp i had no idea she said suddenly nervous god this is all mixed up i never expected theyre friends of the bruces thats why were here you all right it just threw me for a loop thats all you throw me for a loop she glanced around her as if looking for an escape hatch is that good she looked back and then laughed i guess so im not making any sense am i oh this place she said then looked up at him with a grin hey what want to do a joint here he said the beatles did one at buckingham palace are you serious he said intrigued by the daring as if shed proposed having sex come on we can go out there she said gesturing toward the french windows youll freeze come on he followed her out onto the shallow terrace avoiding the look of a waiter who clearly thought they were ducking out to make love at one end of the terrace two men smoking cigars near a giant potted plant looked up then turned away discreetly she fished an already rolled joint from her silver bag and handed him the box of matches when he struck a match her face glowed in the tiny flare light a cigarette just in case she said drawing in deeply no one will know the difference the sweet pungent smoke a smell of vietnam hung in the damp air you like taking chances he said its not much of a chance i dont think anybody in there even knows what it is she took another drag thats nice clears the head sometimes he said exchanging the cigarette for the joint and drawing on it who are these people anyway this man i was talking toagricultural development in the third world what does that mean it means hes a spook really guaranteed he said smiling again the rooms full of them can you always tell agricultural development for sure otherwise you have to look for signs journalist is usually pretty good oh really she said playing you think im one are you she took the joint back were not supposed to tell what made you suspect you keep popping up in unlikely places he said spreading his hand toward the house you know i really didnt expect to see you here i dont believe it now i never thoughtits funny isnt it what you being here or my being here you maybe youre the spook she glanced up at him quickly no you sure id recognize you wouldnt i here she said handing him the joint finish it im on duty she laughed to herself i interviewed a hells angel once i asked him how they picked an angel and he said we dont pick em we recognize em so i guess id know nick smiled feeling a buzz where was this california a while ago the summer of love nick said idly well it was for the guys nick flicked the roach out into the night and lit a cigarette leaning against the building the tall shrubs had taken on some definition in the misty air in a few months it would be light all evening england wide awake in the late northern light what brought you over here he said i dont know last year after the assassinations i just thought enough you know i mean all you could do was watch the news so i thought well europe i had a friend in paris and of course just as i get there they start tearing up the streets so it was all the same anyway les evenements she said wryly her accent deliberately broad so i just kept going she turned so that her face came into the light from the windows nick watched her unaware that he was staring until she raised her eyebrows then she reached over and took his cigarette let me have one of these she said putting it in her mouth with a casual intimacy what youre a quicksilver girl nick said still watching her steve miller band she said placing the phrase i actually met a guy in that band she handed back the cigarette touching his fingers like a chameleon you mean no like quicksilver whenever i look you go somewhere else she met his gaze and then as if to demonstrate his point looked away and leaned back against a potted plant well im here now where is here anyway i thought this would be at the embassy like this morning its the residence used to belong to barbara mutton who nick smiled maybe larry was rightnobody remembered anything woolworth heiress she was married to gary grant this used to be her house she looked up and down the terrace then back through the windows at the party a realtors gaze do you think he used to come out here to smoke too i dont think they were here together later maybe she bought it to get over him instead of a good cry she said looking at the house again whats it like to be that rich then she glanced back at him are you rich i mean warren no its his money not mine he nodded at the house nobodys this rich anymore who owns it now you do taxpayers so thats where it goes she giggled makes me feel better about crashing come to dinner you paid for that too i cant yes you can she looked at him not saying anything reading his face whos the friend nick said its not that i just cant she paused maybe i can join you later she said a polite dodge where is it here here hmm as soon as the taxpayers clear out she laughed youre crazy i cant do that what would they think the braces theyre used to it all she has to do is rearrange the plates its her idea of a good time just like that nick nodded if i ask her i thought you wanted to see the other half not that close up look its nice of you stay nick said putting his hand on her arm id like you to she looked down at the hand then smiled dont you think its a little soon for a family dinner i may not keep running into you maybe i wont get another chance you could call and then what she grinned i guess youd ask me to dinner he spread his hands palms up resting a case god what am i going to tell brian tell him you have an interview with the ambassador why am i doing this she said laughing to herself then she looked up at him youre not what i expected she said what did you expect but she let it go making a joke of it i dont know somebody in agricultural development i guess i better find brian she held herself by the arms its cold no wonder barbara whatshername sold it youre sure she said looking up again nick nodded go find brian she took a step toward the french window hey he said stopping her because in the new light from the window her pale skin did suddenly begin to gleam shifting like mercury dont disappear okay promise she said and because the day had been lucky he took her at her word the intimate dinner sat twentyfour and she disappeared after all behind the floral centerpiece so that like davey he had to tilt his head to see her at this angle her hair bounced on top of the stems another flower and he watched her turn back and forth between her dinner partners two grayhaired diplomats who preened for her attention like rival suitors when she caught his look her eyes laughed in a private joke the dope had worn down to a familiar lull of wellbeing but his senses still seemed sharp catching the light off the crystal and the glow refracted in the soft red wine with larry near one end and his mother near the other he was marooned in the middle surrounded by people talking to each other free to watch her it was easier without words he thought this is what animals didlooks and body movements and smiles tapping a sexual morse code across the table its not polite to stare you know a womans voice next to him sorry was i he said turning to her embarrassed but she was smiling i wish someone looked at me that way shes very pretty are you together sort of he said taking her in she was still an attractive woman but her face was loose and round padded nick guessed by years of too many extra glasses of wine she seemed slightly drunk shiny and amused but not fuzzy sort of she laughed well you will be if you keep that up youth she said suggesting shed enjoyed hers i tell you what you just look and pretend to talk to me i dont mind a bit im doris kemper by the way jack kempers wife she spoke the name unknown to nick as if it guaranteed instant recognition nick warren ah larrys son nick nodded well that explains it your father always had an eye for the girls really did you know him not that way if thats what you mean but i must say i always wondered a little she said oddly flirtatious he was quite the man about town do they use that expression anymore of course this was all about a million years ago thank you she said to the waiter refilling her glass you cant imagine how different washington was then people had fun nick watched her take another drink trying to imagine her slim and eager for a night out it occurred to him that if he just smiled encouragingly he wouldnt have to talk at all well they did she said misinterpreting his look of course children dont believe their parents were ever young i know mine cant then i heard he got married we were overseas and i thought well thats that theyll be hanging crepe all over town if it lasts but here you are so i guess it did where overseas nick said making conversation oh everywhere athens rabat everywhere you had to boil the water she laughed to herself we were in delhi for four yearsthat was the longest stretch did you like it well jack did i had the children to raise you know the tropicsone little scratch and before you know it its infected you had to watch all the time and the snakes she waved her hand dismissing india and when he followed it he found himself looking across the table again molly was listening to one of her suitors fork poised in the air her bare arms pale in the candlelight he wondered if they would sleep together tonight shed stayed for dinner you do have an eye doris kemper said i suppose he passed it on she picked up her glass now tell me about yourself what are you doing in london are you a lawyer too no im finishing a degree at lse that sounds interesting she said clearly not believing it what in at the moment im doing research on the mccarthy period you know the witchhunts people study that now i do feel old my professors writing a book about it but its such an exaggeration witchhunts i suppose to young peoplebut really you know the whole thing has been blown all out of proportion i remember the loyalty oaths we all had to do that the army hearings but to hear people talk youd think thats all that was going on not any of the good things most people didnt even notice huac held over two hundred hearings then nick said calmly a statistician three thousand witnesses and that was just huac not mccarthy really she said too surprised to be offended but she was already moving away the lesson of a hundred dinner parties of course we were overseas most of the time she leaned back to let the waiter remove her plate and looked at nick as if the new angle had suddenly brought him into focus now i remember she said larrys wife she had a child thats right there was a boy she stopped oh nick could see in her slack face the rest of it coming back to her im so sorry i didnt she floundered in such obvious distress that nick almost as a reflex helped her thats all right he said quietly but it wasnt it happened so rarely now that he was unprepared for it that moment when someone knew he felt the sinking in his stomach always the same found out by the giant pointing finger he wished he werent still high unguarded because now it would all come back he knew the sequence the pictures that would flash through his mind and always end with the woman lying twisted on the roof of the car instead he turned to the bright table willing himself to be distracted by the opulent silver and the spray of flowers an imperial banquet doris kemper who misinterpreted the gesture and thought he was angry put her hand on his arm i didnt mean she said and because she was silly but still kind nick smiled back letting her off the hook i know he said how quickly it could happen he thought when you werent expecting it but that was his problem not hers she never meant a thing shed had a life of amahs and swimming pool parties and only remembered the snakes dreaming of maryland and now of course shed be curious he could already see the irresistible questions forming in her eyes they were both rescued by the tinkling of a knife against a glass as the ambassador rose to propose a toast not a speech he said genially just a word of welcome because it was always good to see old friends and particularly good when those friends were about to render a service to their country they were all aware of the importance of larrys mission and they were all grateful he was sure that the mission had been placed in such competent hands if there was progress to be made he would make it and he carried with him at the very least the hopes and good wishes of everyone at this table and countless other tables back home there was a little more and a few hear hears and they raised their glasses nick raised his too feeling more than ever the anomaly of his position the son of a traitor invited to sit at the high table but larry smiling modestly at the group seemed entirely at ease and his mother on the ambassadors right looked radiant no one in fact saw anything but a happy family not even doris kemper who thought he had an eye the table was breaking up now heading into the sitting room for coffee and when he looked over at molly towering over her diplomats who turned out to be short his mood changed the hell with them all tangled up in their money and pious hopes for paris their world not his he was going to spend an evening with a girl whod actually met someone in the steve miller band but when she returned his look she seemed nervous flustered by the toast as if the evening had been a high and they were coming down back where they started and he wondered if they would sleep together after all good luck with your project doris kemper said shaking hands ill try to look for the good things he said pleasantly you do that she smiled almost winking its still the greatest country in the world the informality of the coffee hour made it easier to slip out early and after paying his respects to the bruces he collected molly and headed for the door a hug and faint protest from his mother but no one else seemed to mind absorbed on their side of the generation gap shes a nice girl larry said when molly went to get her coat i thought you said you werent seeing anybody im not seeing her yet nick said first date quite a restaurant larry said nodding at the room men smoked near the fireplace ignoring the women who perched on the edges of the deep couches busy with each other a waiter was passing brandy it looked to be a long night quite an invitation nick said thanks good luck tomorrow larry nodded and shook his hand dont forget to call the lawyer i wont by the way whos jack kemper larry grinned what did he tell you he didnt tell me anything well he wouldnt hes cia in the hall molly was being helped into her gaucho cape a remnant of her morning self the servant stiff and correct held it as if it were mink and as she slid into it the two halves of her life seemed put together without matching shall i call you a taxi sir no thank you well find one the man raised a dubious eyebrow but nodded and opened the door mind how you go he said indicating the dark driveway dense now with night mist but it was the obscurity nick wanted he took her arm on the steps and they walked out of the range of the house lights over the canal toward prince albert road you okay he said ive never felt so out of place in my life no you were the hit of the party i kept thinking what if they knew knew what oh i dont know that i didnt belong there i guess she paused what was it like growing up like that i didnt grow up like that it was justnormal you know the usual stuff school sports they went to parties i did homework an allamerican boy mm eagle scout youre kidding on my honor he said holding up three fingers in the oath position she stopped looking at him youre not what i expected you said that before anyway im not a scout any more no theres something ive wanted to do all evening before she could say anything he put his hands on her shoulders and kissed her pressing her lips gently until she opened her mouth and he tasted the faint trace of wine but then she pulled back and put her hand between them dont you want to he said surprised she nodded thats the problem then later youd think he grinned im not oldfashioned id respect you in the morning promise scouts honor she bit her lower lip no you dont understand look i need to talk to you lets go somewhere no here whats wrong she looked to the side avoiding him then took a breath and turned back okay i was going to explain but i couldnt in there and then she stopped let me have a cigarette will you he fished one out of his pocket still looking at her he was amazed to see her hand trembling slightly as she took it whats this all about he said lighting it for her she inhaled as if drawing strength from it i told you someone asked me to look you up you never asked who who i was supposed to give you a message i never meant to who he said impatient now she looked up at him as if she were afraid of his reaction your father larry he said so that he wouldnt have to think anything else no your father walter kotlar i met him he asked me to she paused taking another drag on the cigarette he wants to see you chapter it was her idea to go to jules bar a pub would have been noisy her flat impossible and when they got into the taxi he seemed incapable of suggesting anything so she said the first thing that popped into her head he was quiet all the way to jermyn street not sure where to start or whether to start at all one thought canceling out the other until he felt empty staring at the meter she didnt try to talk either and for one crazy moment it seemed to him that theyd already entered the clandestine world afraid to be overheard in taxis he wants to see you why how when the taxi stopped she got out and paid and he just stood looking at the blue neon martini glass now a little wary of her because like a lover she knew the most intimate thing about him who are you he said when they sat down the bar was supposed to be like a new york cocktail lounge dark and cool little tables with flickering votive candles who i said i just met him thats all two vodkas he said to the waiter then turned back to her that seems appropriate doesnt it do you want to hear this or not i dont know yes of course i want to hear it christ he lit a cigarette what were you doing in moscow hes not in moscow hes in prague all right what were you doing in prague that doesnt matter we have to start somewhere tell me or are you with the cia too she looked at him blankly having had a different dinner partner well if you must know i went to see a guy i knew in paris hes from there there were lots of czechs in paris last year you know before the invasion but he went back she nodded i thought we werewell wrong again imagine my surprise he didnt even want to see me i suppose he thought it would get him in trouble so like an idiot i show up at his door and voila the new livein girl takes one look andanyway whats the difference satisfied she looked up at him and smiled im not a spy i just went to prague to make a fool of myself my father was a spy nick said simply i know who he was the waiter brought the drinks in juless widemouthed martini glasses and he gulped his managing half before it burned so how did you meet him after the girlfriend threw you out well thats the funny thing jiri let me stay there i think it was her idea actually to torture him or something but i really didnt have anywhere else and id already exchanged my money so i just hung out and saw prague they took me places to tell you the truth i think jiri liked the idea of people thinking he was with both of us you know that he had some menage a trois going did he no she glared at him then let it go anyway they took me to a party one night and thats where i met him your father at a party nick said when was this last month you took your time she shrugged i went back to paris i wasnt sure what to do but i kept thinking about it so so here we are he paused looking down at his glass how did you find me oh he knew where you were he knows all about you i guess he keeps tabs for a second his life seemed to tilt on its axis he kept tabs he never left how is he he said finally hes fine she said which told him nothing he wanted to know i mean i guess he is i only met him once well twice he looked up at her go ahead i met him at the party i knew who he was and i thought well maybe theres a story maybe hed talk to meyou know give me an interview hes never given one no never nick said so i thought thered be a piece in it for rolling stone nick said sarcastically for somebody they werent even born nick continued do you honestly think anyone cares are you kidding walter kotlar after all these years everybodyd want that piece she paused it would be a huge break for me anyway i thought it was worth a try so i asked him and he agreed to meet me you must have made some impression hes never talked to anyone before he didnt then either except about you we met on the charles bridge and then we went for a walk thats when he asked me to get in touch with you on a bridge just like in the movies in your trenchcoats well its like that there you have to talk outside and maybe somebody was putting you on how do you know it was him how do i know he said if you asked that to tell you he always remembered how you helped with the shirt whatever that means he said youd know he felt his stomach move again another tilt the snowy street the drain she looked at him it was him wasnt it nick nodded and then signaled to the waiter for another round now what im supposed to call him up and chat about old times no he wants to see you what makes you think i want to see him dont you no oh she said at a loss what did you expect id be so thrilled he wants to see me after twenty years that id catch the next plane i dont know what i expected i thought youd bei dont know curious curious is that how youd feel if you saw a ghost she looked at him for a minute studying his face no i guess id feel scared i dont feel scared he said taking a sip of his drink let me tell you about my father he walked out on us just left defected thats the word everybody prefers gives it a sort of ideological cast but what he really did was run and we had to clean up the mess my mother larry christ not to mention the country sometimes i think thats the worst thing he did that stupid fucking committeehe made them legitimate they got something right finally they just stepped right into it and after that there was no stopping them there were communists in the state department well one and they couldnt get him so then how many others and on and on thats another little gift he left us you cant blame him for that she said quietly but he did it he said placing his hand on hers for emphasis thats the point they were right before him they had nothing and then he caught himself pulled back his hand and took another drink we had to pretend he was dead and after a while he was dead i dont want to bring him back you saw a ghost thats all he stopped waiting for her reply but she said nothing you know what i did the day he gave his press conference that was the first time he came back from the dead i played baseball there was a game that afternoon and i saw him on television and i thought oh god its starting all over again everybody will know theyll throw me out of the game or look embarrassed or something theyll know but they didnt i went to the park and nobody said a thingthe kids the coaches nobody we just played ball as if nothing had happened because it hadnt thats when i realized it was over i wasnt his son anymore i was somebody else he looked at her im still somebody else if you say so whats that mean it means i dont believe you he felt the lurch again found out back at the table with doris kemper have it your way you delivered your message why did you anyway i mean why bother whats in it for you i told you he promised to talk to me and you believed him hes been known not to tell the truth you know in fact hes famous for it hes not like that really what is he like hes she searched for a word sad nick looked at her not quite sure how to take this am i supposed to feel sorry for him forget it oldsad she said thoughtfully hes old dont be angry he just wants to see you so why not pick up the phone they have phones there dont they why you i dont get it he wants me to bring you nick stared at her dumbfounded come again he said youd need a cover i guess thats me youd be with me he told me you had a different name i didnt realize it was that warren wait a minute let me get this straight he walks up to you at a party and says go get my son and ill give you an interview but dont tell anybody because im being watched and you agree to do it this doesnt strike you as a little crazy if youre that hard up for a story why not interview barbara hutton nobody remembers her either im just telling you what he said but why go through this hes not a prisoner you know hes allowed visitors i know i kept wondering about that too what i think is he doesnt want them to know who you are i dont know why he wants them to think youre somebody else your fiance look i thought it was crazy too all the cloakanddagger stuff why do you think it took me so long but i kept thinking about it first of all its like that there theyre all a little spooky jiri thought everybodys phone was tapped so maybe its crazy but they ought to know they live there theyre always arranging to meet in parks things like that so i thought well maybe he thinks that way hes used to it but the more i thought about it the more i thought there was something else not just being careful like he had it all worked out the problem was i couldnt figure out what then it occurred to me that maybe i wasnt supposed to know but you would that youd know what he meant she had been leaning forward her voice eager but now she sat back opening her hands so i thought id better tell you just in case nick shook his head staring at the glass what exactly did he say to you exactly he wants to see you dont tell anybody he said youd understand no about the shirt oh she frowned concentrating tell him i always remembered how he helped with the shirt hell know like that anyway i dont know exactly at the time i didnt thinkis it some kind of code the word made nick smile no and this isnt nancy drew either no codes no invisible ink there was a shirt so yes i know its him thats it but what do you think it means nick looked at the table for a minute so she would think he was trying to sort out his thoughts not push them away it was starting again secrets listening at doors but it didnt have to start all he had to do was push it away i think it means you met an old man at a party maybe hes sorry about what happened so am i but that doesnt mean i want to see him its a little late for apologies youre wrong theres something elseits not that simple look im sorry you came all this way i was coming anyway she said annoyed dont worry then she leaned forward again making a last effort what if im right how could you not want to know he looked at her then signaled for the bill it takes practice after a while it works everything goes away and the last thing you want to do is bring it back what do you think would happen if we went a few awkward days with someone i dont even know anymore all taped by you for some magazine thats not fair i never said i wanted to do that you dont have to take it out on me take what out whatever it is thats making you like this right sorry he pulled out some money to put on the plate with the bill so you wont she said gathering her purse you go tell him you saw me and i said he owes you the interview ask him why he defected ask him why that woman jumped out the window id buy a copy of that story myself she looked up why she forget it come on wed better go he shook his head its been a strange day he looked at her i thoughtwell never mind what i thought i didnt do this right no you were perfect how else its like telling someone hes got cancerits hard to warm up to it anyway i got the message but youre not going to see him look it isnt just me youve met my family how do you think theyd feel about this little weekend reunion i cant do that to them its impossible dont tell them they dont have to know nobody has to know just me and every photographer in moscow youre not listening thats the last thing he wants nobody would know its you anyway hes in prague its different what makes you think hes still there maybe hes gone back no he lives there now his wife is czech he had been about to stand up to leave but now he stopped amazed his wife it had the full shock of the unexpected he had imagined his father as he was that night back in the snow literally stopped in time now suddenly he too had become someone else nick sat back in his chair as if hed been winded christ his wife didnt you know i dont know anything about him he said and for the first time he saw that it was true what had his life been all these years it hadnt stopped at the press conference thered been jobs and apartments and wives a whole unknown life but molly took his surprise for disapproval your mother remarried she said gently after the divorce they werent divorced he said offhandedly it was annulled annulled but how you mean because of me oh that wouldnt stop the church it justnever happened theyre pros at that my mother had connections he said thinking of father tim and his puppet strings not that there was any problem a communist they dont think theres anything worse than that lets go he said standing up i never met her she said trying to hold him the wife i saw her at the party but i didnt meet her i dont want to know he said holding up his hand really he stopped are there children not that i know of she put the cape over her wonderful dress just you not me he said and led her out of the bar it was late but there was a taxi outside unexpected luck will you drop me she said an invitation no ill walk she looked at him well at least i got to meet the ambassador she hesitated at the taxis door listening to the motor turn over like a rickety machine for what its worth i think youre crazy hes worth ten of them those people at dinner i dont care what he did nick smiled slightly i know theyve probably done worse they just didnt do it to me neither did he i dont want to see him molly i cant you dont want to see me now either do you he leaned against the open door waiting for her to get in i wish i did no one ever wanted to meet me before no she smiled then shrugged well dont let it throw you i just turned up at the wrong door again thats all she got into the cab then almost immediately pulled down the window i hate to ask but do you have a fiver im flat ill pay you back he took out the note and handed it to her thats okay im feeling rich today he said thinking of larry thanks you know where to find me if you change your mind she tilted her head slightly by the way did anyone ever tell you you look like him he stared at her through the window who she rolled her eyes giving up and sat back in the seat as the taxi pulled away he walked all the way back to his flat cutting through soho and its halfhearted dingy lights then the quiet squares north of oxford street in the months after his father left when he knew he would hear he would listen for the phone check the mail even after they had moved always ready it was only a question of when the message would come if there were people in the room he was prepared to cover the way his mother had in front of the police code but the message didnt come and after a while he forgot what hed been waiting for no he always knew come with me join me and now that it had come delivered by this unlikely girl he felt ambushed standing at the phone too startled to reply why now this way a summons like an old longdistance connection scratchy and unclear barely audible over the thin wires what did his father want he could fly there in a few hoursvienna was farthernot the end of the world he wouldnt have to cross the barbed wires and guard dogs in the movies of his youth just show a passport with its harmless new name and join the line of german tourists waiting for the bus in and out see where kafka lived wenceslas square which wasnt a square but a long street he knew because hed seen the soviet tanks on television last year lined up against the students what would they say to each other where did you go that night how was it arranged why didnt but what was the point everything he wanted to know that drew him was further away than prague back irretrievably on nd street that was where they still lived in some dream of the past it was what he couldnt tell molly because he hadnt known it then himself he was afraid of ghosts they were too fragile if you disturbed them they vanished if he saw a nice old man living with a czech wife somewhere west of vienna his father would be gone for good the house was quiet even vigilant mrs caudhill in the groundfloor flat had gone to bed it was an ugly victorian redbrick one of four whose bay windows stuck out like prows in a row of modest regency terrace houses and hed been lucky to find it a room at the top back overlooking the garden which turned out to be a birdbath and a clump of rhododendrons that never bloomed when he opened his door and switched on the desk lamp still tiptoeing from the climb up the dim stairs he could see everything in a glance a bookcase of boards and bricks with a record player in the middle a daybed and a castoff easy chair a desk with typewriter and stacks of index cards an electric fire in front of the brickedup fireplace he flicked the fire on rubbing his hands it was always cold in england and they put the water pipes outside the houses where they could freeze he sat down still in his suit then got up to make some tea on the gas ring it was only when he went over to look out the window that he realized he was pacing jittery and caged he wouldnt sleep anxiety had sopped up the alcohol leaving his mind too sharp to rest he thought of rolling a joint but that would run the risk of an unwelcome thought floating in and he didnt want to think everyone smoked in vietnam because it was surreal and then you couldnt tell the difference now he needed to do something crossword puzzles or solitaire to keep his attention on the immediate the kettle whistle startled him and he hurried to make the tea why now he sat back down in front of the electric fire counted the orange bars and sipped from the mug he could will himself to be calm read something as long as he didnt think then he glanced out the window and saw the top branches of the leafless tree and nd street came flooding back racing through his body until he actually felt memory a tingle in his fingers on the cup everything hed pushed away at jules scene after scene had she thought he was indifferent that it wasnt still there just waiting welles and his stupid gavel rattling ashtrays for the cameras the swarm of hats outside the window drinking coffee his mother all dressed up for the charities benefit the pearls flung backward on the dented car roof he stopped that was the other thing shed left her apartment checked into the mayflower and jumped that was all a girl at garfinkels but before that what discussion groups about capitalism saving the world from fascism what had made her come forward unraveling her lethal thread what did the committee know anyway his fathers judges one of them it turned out had been a member of the klan convinced the communists were organizing negroes it was there in the index cards he glanced over at the desk indifferent then why the stacks of cards for wiseman the trail back larry had known instinctively that the research was a pose he was studying the mechanics of history to find out something else had his father gone there that night a last stop at the hotel and now the one person who could tell him had sent a message and he sat with a mug of tea too afraid to ask the room was warm enough for him to change now and he went over to the closet to put his jacket away he could read something until he fell asleep trollope maybe whod probably seen houses like this going up and thought they were handsome but his hand fell on an omnibus stevenson and there was memory again kidnapped in the club chair he took it out anyway a gesture of refusing to be intimidated and threw it on the bed hed never read dr jekyll and mr hyde just seen the movie and that seemed safe enough then he realized with a sighing irony that he wasnt going to escape it who was that after all but his father one person then another except that dr jekyll couldnt help himself once hed taken the medicine he folded his pants and put them on a hanger and started unbuttoning his shirt staring down at the pile of laundry on the closet floor hed have to go to the chinese tomorrow when it hit him he held on to the open front of his shirt literally dizzy the shirt his father hadnt been able to help himself then nick had helped him it was something only they knew that nick had tried to help in his childs mind he had even been willing to break the law anything he was asking for help that was the code nick stood for a minute arguing with himself but he knew beyond reason that he was right there had never been any point in making the message crypticwhy not just come see me hell know and he did know i need your help again dont tell anybody between us like before it couldnt mean anything else his father might have used a hundred references from nicks childhood but he used the shirt their secret molly could have thought it was an old family joke nothing more was that what his life was like now so cautious he didnt even trust his own messenger but he trusted nick nobody else had ever tried to help him and now there was another shirt nick walked over to the desk pulled by strings that stretched so far back he was afraid mere movement would make them snap what if he were wrong standing there in his socks and underwear in the middle of the night reading things into an innocuous hello or maybe just telling himself a story that would make him do what he wanted to do anyway what if he picked up the phone and started to dial surprised at the clunking sound in the quiet room flaxman nine a fulham number maybe he was still stoned but he had never felt more alert in his life hullo the phone was picked up on the first ring as if she didnt want anyone else to hear its nick do you know what time it is why hadnt he waited until morning but it had already been a month i know im sorry it couldnt wait what ive changed my mind you still willing to make the trip maybe wed better talk about this in the morning are you she paused what made you change your mind it doesnt matter you were right i have to go can you leave right away tomorrow are you crazy we have to get visas it takes a few days you cant just walk okay where do we go for the visas czech consulate she said suddenly practical its in notting hill gate will you meet me there first thing in the morning try noon they dont open till late and you just have to wait in line anyway but go early if you want no we have to go together youre my fiancee remember she laughed do i get a ring i hadnt thought of that i was kidding for gods sake are you all right okay noon where in notting hill meet me at the tube stop its about a block nick what are you sure i mean you seemed so i have his phone number you know i can just give it to you if you want no the way he says youll be the contact there was a silence i thought you didnt want to see him now i do chapter in the morning he saw larrys lawyer who droned on for half an hour about financial responsibility before he finally let nick sign the papers when can i draw on this this week if you like ill arrange a wire transfer are you planning to buy something a car the lawyer smiled thats usually the first thing isnt it ive seen it time and again a young man will have his car at cooks overflowing with brochures they were happy to arrange anything the whole world for a price bratislava was only fifty kilometers from vienna a tram ride in the old days there was a danube cruise highly recommended though of course it was early in the season prague was a bargain since tourists were still a bit skittish about the russians but budapest might surprise him they had several groups going to budapest by the time nick got to notting hill gate he had a plan and the beginnings of an itinerary he found molly waiting on the street looking at a czech phrasebook and she had changed herself againplaid skirt knee socks sweater and hair pulled back into a pony tail a conventional american girl passport officials would know the type in a second i thought id better start boning up she said holding out the book perfect nick said implying that it was a prop no well need it unless you speak german they hate it but they speak it come on lets go we need to hit the hungarian consulate later were going to hungary vienna and budapest the old empire i thought it would be better if prague was a side trip you know as long as were in vienna so close you couldnt resist showing it to me in case anyone checks when did you think all this up last night it has to be casuala quick looksee and were on our way before anyone notices with an itinerary to prove it why should we have to prove it i dont know why did my father send you are you trying to scare me he just wants to see you secretly he looked at her do you want to back out youre overreacting maybe ive never done this before he looked up at the modern building with the plaque of the czech lion rampant bolted into the brick as official as a jail its still a police state we have to be careful she shrugged tell you what then you do all the talking ill just think about my engagement trip budapest for gods sake nick smiled its nice lots of thermal baths they told me so at cooks you went to cooks i want it all on paper tickets reservations like an alibi yes he said looking at her like an alibi but in fact the process was no more sinister than getting a drivers license there were guards and applications to fill out and pamphlets about currency restrictions on the walls a portrait of a jowly man nick assumed to be husak a few old people in line arguing in a language as remote as chinese then forms were stamped and routed to out boxes an iron curtain of paper the visas would be good for three weeks and they were required to exchange dollars for the whole period but well only be there a few days nick said those are the currency regulations the woman said tonelessly you will perhaps find many things to buy an explanation from oz utterly without irony when will they be ready come back in three days its possible were anxious to start yes the woman said shuffling papers all the world wants to go to prague nick wondered if this was an office joke but her face was impassive already looking at the next person in line they paid the extra five pounds for the car and took the early hovercraft skimming across the channel to ostend they made good time through the flat sprouting landscape but by afternoon the mountains slowed them and it was late when they finally reached bern as neat and atmospheric as a stage set they found a pension on one of the arcaded streets not far from the bear pit and after some soup and alsatian wine in the empty dining room went up to bed molly had said little during the drive but now began to unwind turning playful from the wine so how do we do this she said pointing to the bed ive never been to bed with a man before to sleep i mean pick a side like brother and sister she threw a flannel nightgown on the bed and went into the bathroom to brush her teeth when she came back toothbrush still in her mouth nick had already stripped to his shorts briefs i knew it we used to take betsyou know in school briefs or boxers i knew youd be briefs she watched as he turned back the covers do you sleep in them tonight i do dont worry im too tired to look is that really what girls talk about he said getting into bed of course what do boys talk about other things ill bet she went into the bathroom to rinse then came back and put on the nightgown slipping the clothes off underneath nick sat in the bed blanket pulled up to his chest watching her how do you do that hooks trick of the trade she said pulling in her arms and struggling with her shirt tada the shirt fell to the floor then after a few minutes of wriggling the bra she held it up for him dancing a little see if you want to put on a show take my advice and dont wear flannel serves you right she said sinking into the chair propping her feet on the bed arent you coming to bed in a minute well he said snapping off his light but still sitting up looking at her this would be my mothers idea of a perfect honeymoon he watched her for a minute then said lets not complicate things she moved to the bed no turn off the light and go to sleep just like that try it he said rolling away from her on his side she got into bed quickly pulling the covers up want to hear something funny i feeli dont know embarrassed its like were married or something do you snore no he said still on his side how do you know will you go to sleep please we want to make vienna tomorrow its farther than you think then well have to start early go to sleep she turned out the light and was quiet for a minute then she said another day or two wont make any difference you know i mean hes waited this long nick turned over but there was no light to catch her face so that his words seemed spoken to the darkness so have i he turned away from her again convinced they would spend hours pretending to sleep but after a while he drifted off no longer aware of her it was the armys one gift you learned to sleep anywhere when the rain started he was back at the cabin listening to the steady drip on the roof safe in his room it got louder and he thought about the gutters his father cleaning out the clumps of leaves so the water would run down the drainpipe at the corner making a puddle near the porch a rattling noise woke him and disoriented he was startled by the figure at the open window until he realized it was her she was looking out smoking her head in profile against the dim light whats the matter she jumped as if he had tapped her on the shoulder nothing she said quietly i couldnt sleep thats all would it be better if we had separate rooms its not that go back to sleep she said her voice gentle again you all right just nerves middleofthenight stuff that ever happen to you he nodded in the dark what is it theres no it its just that feeling you get when you know youre going to make a mess of things i do that a lotmake a mess of things the rain blew in and she stepped back brushing the front of her nightgown and now im wet my mother always said i didnt have enough sense to come in out of the rain do you want to go back not now she stopped talking into the dark as if she could see him thats the thing about making a messyou cant help it even when you see it coming what are you worried about you i guess i mean i got you into this and now youre soi dont know up for it she paused you never know how things will turn out he sighed then let me worry about it i want to go molly you justcame along for the ride okay come on get into bed its late she stood still for a minute then started lifting the nightgown over her head i have to take this off its wet he heard the rustle of cloth then saw the pale white of her skin indistinct in the dark she slipped naked into bed curling up on her side in a protective ball nick she said dont expect too much okay i know i mean things never go the way you expect i know he said but lightly this time edging further away look at us the next day was bright and clear and she began to enjoy herself as if the rain had washed away the nighttime jitters with the clouds they drove past steep meadows dotted with cows and wide farmhouses with window boxes a calendar landscape without a smudge the road swung through the mountains in perfectly engineered switchbacks and tunnels encouraging speed and they seemed to fly through the high thin air not even pausing at the rest stops where tourists photographed each other against patches of glacier and the miles of valley just over the rail it all looked in fact the way nick had imagined it heidi meadows and bright wildflowers but more painted than lived in and by midmorning feeling guilty because it was beautiful he began to be bored he knew he was meant to admire itthink of america raging in its streetsbut after a while all he wanted to do was turn the radio on to disturb the peace what kind of people stay neutral molly said somehow reading his mind she was in jeans down in the seat with her feet up content to let him drive when youre traveling you never meet anyone who says hes swiss germans yes everywhere you go but never swiss imagine liking a place so much you never go anywhere she pulled out a cigarette lighting it away from the draft at the window it must be nice not taking sides everybody takes sides she looked at him for a second then waved her hand toward the landscape they didnt they just let everybody go to hell and theyre doing okay up here in cloudcuckooland you wouldnt last a day no maybe not anyway its probably just the air not enough oxygen to decide anything one way or the other how much more of this he said nodding toward the road miles austrias pretty much the same this part anyway you can hardly tell the difference she took a long pull on the cigarette blowing the smoke out in a steady stream suddenly moody of course they werent neutral there they were nazis so much for your theory he said about the air maybe they got talked into it she said quietly still looking ahead thats not the way i heard it she glanced at him surprised as if hed interrupted another thought then shrugged who knows maybe the airs heavier over there oddly enough it was as they crossed the border the sky grew dark with clouds so that the morning seemed more than ever like some bright alpine mirage floating above the gray the middle of europe was overcast too far from the sea for the winds to lift its gloomy cover even the buildings began to take on a leaden weight dreary with concrete and slate they had lunch on a terrace built for sun with a small cluster of middleaged ladies wearing overcoats and hats whats it mean anyway briefs or boxers nick said to break her mood she smiled well boxers are a little country club maybe she paused can i ask you something why did you change your mind he looked at her face open and curious i didnt change it he hedged you just took me by surprise of course i want to see him wouldnt you i dont know if i felt the way you did how do i feel i dont know from one day to the next i wont know until i see him i guess okay she said backing off he leaned over putting his hand on hers look i think i owe him this much thats all her eyes widened owe him remember before when i said people always take sides what if its the wrong one that ever happen to you he felt her hand start under his trapped and he realized hed been pressing down so he released it it happened to me i went to vietnam people change maybe he needs to tell somebody get it out she moved her hand away drawing it down into her lap hes been there a long time nick she said softly dont expect too muchi know so maybe he hasnt changed maybe he just wants to tell me his war stories are you nervous he glanced up feeling her eyes on him then covered the moment by pulling out some notes to put on the bill well this isnt getting us there she watched him put the money on the plate would you do something for me she said lets pretend were not going there until we do lets just be tourists all the world wants to go to prague he said she smiled but not today prague can wait a little they stayed the night in salzburg and the next day left the main highway for the old road through the valley storybook europe with monasteries perched on bluffs over the river the farther east they drove the more remote the landscape felt nick saw the chemically sprayed vineyards and mechanized farms but what he imagined were ox carts and peasant houses with superstitious chains of garlic at the window churches swirled in baroque curves and flared out on top in bulbs the german signs funny and indecipherable at the same time made the roads themselves seem unreal as if they were traveling away from their own time they decided to stop at durnstein where the ruined castle almost theatrically gloomy now at dusk was likely to guarantee a few tourist hotels and were amazed to find the town full they went from one inn to another in a light drizzle achy from the long days drive until finally the desk clerk at the golden hind sent them to frau berenblums a block away she had been slicing bread when they rang the bell and alarmingly answered the door with the knife still in her hand but she had rooms zwei zimmer she said to molly nick who understood this much said tell her we only need one zwei zimmer she repeated glowering at him and pointing at mollys ringless finger two rooms molly said shes worried about my virtue if she only knew cheer up though we get to share a bath and you never know where thats going to lead want to get the bags she already thinks youre a pig so try to be polite frau berenblum nodded through this evidently because she thought molly was asserting herself then knife still in hand she guided molly up the stairs leaving nick to play porter the rooms were spotless and plain down quilts rising high on the beds like powder puffs but the bathroom was wonderful with an old edwardian box tub with rows of colored bath salts along its shelf and after dinner molly claimed it soaking for what seemed hours when she finally appeared at his door her head wrapped in a towel turban nick was half asleep nodding over the map then it was his turn to sit in the tub listening to the sounds below the slap of dough on the wooden table as frau berenblum kneaded tomorrows bread the faint background of radio music he wondered if she were listening too cocking her ear for the telltale creak of springs it was absurd they werent tourists they were wasting time he could smell the dope as he passed mollys door and paused not believing it he tapped lightly more aware than ever of the lights downstairs and opened the door still hoping it was his imagination she was sitting on the bed painting her toenails small wads of cotton wedged between her toes and she looked toward the door in surprise the flannel had been replaced by silk held at the back by two thin straps and cut low in front and as she leaned over to apply the polish her breasts seemed on the verge of tipping out of the fabric she had hiked the skirt up to midthigh to keep it out of the way so that her entire leg was exposed in an arch of flesh he stopped for a moment taking her in it was the first time in all the flirting and awkward sleeping arrangements that he had really wanted her wondered what it would be like to run his hand along her inner thigh where she would be warm quick to the touch then he saw the ashtray on the bed the bulky homerolled joint a thin stream of sweet smoke still rising from the tip are you crazy he whispered she angled her head toward the open window its okay shell smell it i smelled it she grinned you think shes with the dea its not funny christ you brought it over the border she nodded a little surprised at his anger tampax they never look never its okay she swung around on the bed dropping her leg so that she faced him in the lowcut nightgown her skin white he looked at her an involuntary glance then moved over to the ashtray its not okay he said putting out the joint wheres the rest of it why because i want to get rid of it thats why when were you planning to dump it just before we hit the iron curtain iron curtain she said its just a border i dont believe this he said his voice rising if you want to spend some time in a communist jail save it for your next trip did you ever think what might happen if you got caught to both of us all right stop yelling at me she went over to the cosmetic bag took out a tampon and tossed it on the bed there is that all of it would you like to search me she said spreading her arms christ thats all we need to get nailed for drugs then what she walked over to the bedtable and lit a cigarette annoyed now i dont know youve got connections maybe your father would get us off thats not funny all right she said im sorry what do you want i thought it wouldnt matter its not legal in the states either you know were not in the states were in fucking austria with lisa koch downstairs and a trip to husaks workers paradise just down the road they put people in jail for reading playboy for christs sake no they dont you know what i mean you want to test them welcome to czechoslovakia youre busted christ molly what were you thinking all right you made your point go flush it down the toilet she walked over to the open window boy scout as she stood by the window he could see the length of her the filmy material of her nightgown outlining the lean body and he bounced between being aroused and irritated his senses made alert by contradiction as if the air around him were scratchy it always seemed to work this way with her feeling taunted and protective at the same time then becoming impatient with himself for being distracted he saw looking at her that it wasnt going to go away the static and that most of it was coming from somewhere outside them the larger interference of the trip and what he would find meanwhile they rubbed against each other not sure why they were nervous in the first place sorry he said quietly now i just dont want anything to go wrong he picked up the tampon and walked toward the door nick she came over to him a peace gesture and held out her palm ill do it what if frau berenblums out there she smiled how would you explain this he handed it to her i was looking at the map before if we backtrack to freistadt we can head straight up to dolni dvoriste tomorrow tomorrow she said quickly you cant why not he said puzzled at her reaction were supposed to be in vienna i thought we had to keep to a schedule you know anyway dont we have reservations well cancel change of plan he turned away from her i want to get this over with we can see vienna later but she paused are you angry about the dope is that what it is he shook his head forget it i just want to get there molly dont you whats so important about vienna she looked down at a loss nothing i guess it was the plan thats all a little more time we can be in prague tomorrow were so close a drive away i used to think it was impossibleto go thereand its just a drive away only from this direction she said they had their last salad in freistadt and drove to the border through gently sloping wooded country still and empty during the long rural lunch time he had expected the road to the border to be grim but the land was placid and rich neat farms and stretches of old forest promising mushrooms then the road curved and the woods fell away and they were looking across a long cleared tract to the checkpoint beyond it another empty stretch rose uphill to the czech crossing in these open fields it would be impossible to hide without thinking nick slowed down already intimidated he looked at the guardhouse the tall watchtower fences of barbed wire all the props but real to them if you ran out across the field you would be shot the austrian farms ran right up to the border like some jaunty declaration of freedom but on the czech side the land was empty just the fence there would be searchlights at night the guards playing by the rules wouldnt hesitate for a minute so you kept away behind the other side of the forest maybe nobody ever came this close to see the elaborate watchtower if you dont see the bars you can pretend youre not in a cage the austrian border police were bored and perfunctory stamping their passports and waving them through nick wondered how useful theyd be to any escapees he put the car in gear and moved slowly up the broad hill aware that they had now left austria and whatever protection it offered it was crazyhe had not expected to be frightened but the years of pictures and warnings flooded through him they had crossed just a plain field into enemy territory the czech guard waved them over to the side of the road a machine gun hung from his shoulder dobre odpoledne he said which nick understood as good afternoon and then a line of incomprehensible czech when they didnt respond he pointed the gun toward the guardhouse he wants us to go in molly said whats wrong nothing its like this relax she got out of the car smiling but the guard ignored her looking at the back of the car peeking in through the window inside they managed the essentials with mollys smattering of german but the uniformed officials seemed to be moving underwater drugged by their heavy lunch finally they were led into a plain roomnothing but husak on the wallthat reminded nick of interrogation rooms in movies but there were no questions just nods and papers being taken to another room visas being examined then passed on to someone else even the offer of tea from the gas ring in the corner then they were left alone nick stared out the window at the two guards going over the car they had placed their guns on the ground and seemed to be examining everything one of them lying underneath the other bent over to catch what seemed to be a running commentary earlier they had asked for the keys and now they opened doors and explored the trunk inexplicably they didnt touch the suitcases just poked their heads in for a look then continued to walk around the car for a second nick thought they might actually kick the tires like customers in a showroom theres something wrong i can feel it nick said jittery maybe molly said i dont know i flew in before its different at the airport one of the officials came in handed them their passports and spoke to molly in rapid german nick watched the exchange a verbal badminton waiting to be told its the currency form molly said her voice amused it says we changed sterling but weve got american passports so its a confusion what does he want he wants you to change money again got any dollars amazing what a dollar buys here i hope his wife comes in for a piece but do it would be my advice nick shrugged and pulled out a travelers check this any good as gold the exchange with its forms took a little longer they were allowed to wait outside now and nick stood by the car looking up at the watchtower and the soldier staring down at him gun ready how could his father want to live here russia would be even worse in the patchy sunshine nick began to sweat the barbed wire was higher than hed expectedyoud have to cut it to get through he took a cigarette pack from his pocket american a guard said walking up to him for a wild moment nick thought it might be contraband but the guards eyes were friendly and nick realized he was just trying to cadge one when he offered the pack the guard smiled and took two dekuji vam prosim nick replied trying it they stood side by side smoking staring down the road to austria nick wondered if guards ever made a run for it but they seemed sleepy and content as if the guns and fences were invisible parts of the landscape like power lines nick felt the guard straighten before he saw the smudge in the distance it grew into a bus and the guard alerted the soldier in the watchtower shouting up in czech the soldier answered then another came out of the guardhouse something was going on the guard next to nick noisily drew in the last of the american smoke stubbed it out with his boot and stood straighter the second guard joined him and nick had the feeling that the others inside were watching too the bus drew up at the austrian crossing and pulled to the side of the road the czech guards were talking back and forth people began filing out of the bus and even at this distance nick could see the tennis shoes and bright colors that meant a tour group he imagined them crowding the interrogation room exchanging money flooding the counters with passports the guards were imagining it too their conversation a mix of groans and anticipation the tourists stood to one side of the striped crossing gate taking out cameras and aiming them directly up the hill at the iron curtain nick and the guards stood there zoo animals then pictures taken the tourists got back on the bus in a few minutes it turned around and like a mirage was gone nick saw the disappointment on the guards faces and wanted to laugh out loud nothing was wrong an american passport an english carthey had been the only event of the day the tourist buses memories of the busy months last year when the border was porous passed them by now it wasnt about him and molly here in this cold war diorama dressed up with the old symbols the players had nothing to do at last they were allowed to pass beyond the czech frontier nick could tell the difference immediately the road a major one developed ragged shoulders asphalt crumbling away at the sides there were no houses no billboards few road signs of any kind and even the landscape itself began to look rundown dingy and ill kept around the edges in only a few miles they were in another world the road became the main street of villages the way roads did before they were highways passing mud puddles and ducks and women in babushkas the timeless eastern europe of the folk tales there were few cars the villages depressed nickpeeling plaster and old electric wires and a rim of dust extending up from the bottoms of the buildings as if the whole town had been in a bathtub that drained leaving a ring people looked up as the car passed the propaganda was true nobody smiled do you want me to drive what i said do you want me to drive you seem a little preoccupied im fine he said brushing it off how do we contact him he was staring straight ahead edging away from an oncoming truck we call him up she said smiling its a city phones garbage everything but he didnt want to play i thought you said all the phones were tapped he drove quietly for a minute what if hes not here i mean its been a month what if he left where would he go you cant just walk down to cooks and buy a ticket back to moscow he could go back to moscow will you stop she said rolling down the window look the suns coming out spring there were in fact blossoms now not just buds and the countryside was coming to life as if the border had been a poison leaching into the soil here and there nick saw an old manor house a steepled church left over from engravings of old bohemia but he found it impossible to imagine himself back in time the grim present was always around themthe housing blocks of damp concrete the dusty streets the pervading sense that he was somewhere foreign on the other side he knew this was sillyan american wouldnt be in any dangerbut he felt vulnerable and aware at the same time as if he were walking down a dark street at night things were different here as arbitrary and whimsical as a policemans goodwill he felt like a child maybe the czechs did too made wary and fretful by unpredictable authority even in the spring sunshine it seemed to him a country of shadows they were in prague before they realized they had entered it in america the skylines offered a sense of arrival but here there were simply more houses then street signs red with white lettering and tram rails everything getting denser as they moved toward the center they came down a long hill running along the wall of a park and found themselves circling a world war ii soviet tank at the bottom before the road shot off toward the river it was here finally that the city opened up to a vista kafkas castle high on the hill to their left yellow buildings with tile roofs the graceful bridges the sky spiked everywhere by steeples they drove toward the cobbled streets of the mala strana and nick could see that beneath the dust and the scaffolding the city was beautiful there was no colorno ads no splashy shopfronts not even the usual variety of cars in the streetso the buildings themselves became more vivid their baroque facades of light mustard and green and terra cotta dressed the town the architecture seemed to have been put down in layers one period after another until the unremarkable hills along the river had become an astonishing city one of those places where europe rises to its highwater mark rich and complicated mozart had introduced operas here in the afternoon light the city was a painting full of brushstrokes and perspectives and lovely forms it was also falling apart up close some of the wonderful houses were buckling the lemon plaster torn with cracks the scaffolding he saw seemed like a fingerinthedike attempt to shore up the years of neglect the buildings unmaintained were slowly dying how the russians must hate it nick thought the whole city was a beautiful reproach the gifts of centuries were wasting away in a system that could not even produce salad they crossed the vltava past the imperial national theater and the nineteenthcentury streets of the new town to the hotel on wenceslas square to nicks surprise there was a doorman and an old man to help with the luggage a service class he thought did not exist the room was heavy and ornate deep red that wouldnt show the dirt wardrobes instead of closets the old porter lingered pretending to adjust the drapes clearly expecting a tip their windows faced the street and nick could hear the tram bells outside did i give him enough nick said after the man left he looked disappointed he was hoping for dollars technically theyre not supposed to get anything so dont worry about it molly started walking around the room looking at it well here we are god im dead arent you all that driving nick shook his head now what its still early should we call my she put a finger to his lips then raised it and pointed around the room youre kidding he said i dont think so the alcron was popular with journalists they all stayed here last year so we have to assume nick stared at her not sure whether to laugh or be frightened the phone too that for sure how about a little air she said moving toward the window traffic sounds floated in with the spring air when he came over she leaned close to him ill call she said to his ear just be careful no names youll get used to it he felt her breath warm and smooth on the side of his face and it startled him as if she had just whispered an erotic secret he pulled back what she said he shook his head to make the feel of her go away nothing she went to her purse and took out a small address book then started toward the phone the tapping on the door surprised them both as if someone had been watching them but it was only a difficulty about the car a few minutes of pan warrens time if he would come down to the desk nick followed the old man feeling crazily that he was being taken away the difficulty turned out to be an extra fee for the garagehe could not park in the street nick was so relieved that he forgot to be annoyed im sorry for all these bothers the desk clerk said and nick found the english charming he paid and looked around the lobby imagining it buzzing with reporters just a few months ago now it was nearly deserted an elderly couple having tea and a man hidden behind a newspaper so obvious that nick thought he couldnt actually be a policeman outside some students were gathering in the street walking in a halfmarch toward the university he didnt care about any of it she was saying goodbye on the phone when he opened the door and he stood there for a moment waiting and apprehensive dinner he said finally she shook her head some other time theyre busy tonight nick looked at her in disbelief the tone of her voice social and pleasant making the moment unreal busy he said dumbly mm a concert she said evenly looking straight at him at the wallenstein we might think about that actually its pretty what about it are you too tired whats the wallenstein they were going to see him a palace in the mala strana they give concerts in the courtyard its nice what do you say can we get in this late she pointed to the phone try the concierge she raised her voice taunting the microphone you have dollars you can get anything you want with dollars chapter the students were lighting candles in the middle of wenceslas when they left the hotel the crowd was small a fraction of the old rallies but the police were out in force patrolling the long street and pretending to ignore the students no one wanted any trouble from the candles nick assumed it was a memorial service but the signs they held up in czech might have meant anything i wonder what it says he said idly looking at the quiet group behind them the street rose up to meet the giant columns of the national museum still scarred from the previous years shelling be with us we are with you she said you can read czech no it was the slogan you used to see it everywhere its their way of telling the police theyre all on the same side nick wondered what they expected the police to do drop their guns and walk off the job but it was all from the incomprehensible signs to the sad divided loyalties someone elses problem they walked down toward narodni street past the parky stalls then threaded their way through the narrow streets of the old town to the river this was the tourist route full of marvels and medieval towers but nick found himself hurrying oblivious the charles bridge with its ornate statues was full of couples looking down at the water arms around each other the girls all with bleachedblond hair that seemed to hang straight from poor chemicals on the other side the mala strana there were thick arcades and cobblestones lit by dull street lamps and the glow of passing trams the wallenstein was not far from the river and when they got there a crowd had already gathered on letenska street waiting to get in most of them wore coats against the spring chill and nick saw that they had dressed up men in ties women in cloth hats no one was young the street door led through the honeycolored stone wall directly into the formal gardens at one end of the central courtyard musicians sat in front of the high arches of a portico tuning instruments folding chairs had been set up on the pebbled ground and people claimed them first come first served then stood looking around for their friends waving and chatting just as they must have done when the palace was first built behind the walls away from the tanks and the lines for carrots prague still had its evenings nick found chairs toward the back so he could look out over the crowd and stood watching the people file in what would he look like was it possible he wouldnt recognize him he would be how old now in his sixties like most of the audience gray white dont crane its too obvious molly said maybe wed better sit down no one else is it was true people stood talking their voices rising over the violins and cellos being stretched into tune did they all know each other a few people near them stared frankly at their western clothes why so public a place why meet in front of an audience the lights were being lowered now people finally taking their places what are we supposed to do save seats nick said he just said he was coming to the concert dont worry hell find us a couple sat down next to them and the man nodded at nick but it was just a concertgoers greeting polite and vacant the music started a series of mozart divertimenti as formal and airy as the gardens only the portico was lighted now and nick looked around the dim courtyard at profiles and shapes of heads waiting for someone to turn in the dark how would his father find them it was nick who would have changed no longer a boy it occurred to hima new thoughtthat his father would know him only because he was sitting with molly at the intermission while people smoked and drank beer he stood near the bright stage impossible to miss but no one came up and only a few people looked toward him at all glancing at his shoes molly said nothing but he could tell from the way she bit her lower lip that she was worried that it should already have happened czech fluent and guttural surrounded them making him feel isolated not even free to eavesdrop when they sat down again he knew his father wasnt coming something had happened or maybe he had balked unable to go through with it after all nick stared at the baroque walls not hearing the music and realized that he felt a kind of relief it was better in so many ways to keep things as they were his body began to sag a little coming down to earth the past wasnt meant to come back except there it was again the walking away in the pretty courtyard listening now to brahms he was at the back door again being left ill be right back he whispered to molly and when she looked alarmed he smiled and said bathroom and slid out of his seat crouching as he slipped farther back into the dark garden trying not to crunch pebbles a long arcade led back to an ornamental pool and he stopped for a cigarette near one of the pillars away from the crowd phones were tapped maybe he had had to change plans at the last minute to keep the secret who knew what his life was like now maybe he would be idling on letenska street when they came out a chance meeting and maybe not nick went into the bathroom damn him anyway he wasnt going to do it twice molly said he lived here shed spoken to him what did it matter if nick called who cared who listened he was still taking precautions and in america nobody even remembered his name old politics all forgotten as dated as a hemline but his son was here how could he not want to see him nick came out into the soft light of the arcade and stopped the man near the other end was walking carefully as if he had forgotten his cane in his rush to get to the bathroom no not that old the waves were gone thinned to a dusting of hair across his scalp and his body had thinned too so that the suit hung loosely the sleeves too wide for his wrists he kept coming nick couldnt move there hadnt been years to watch the change just this one minute an awful mirror he was looking at himself old this is what he would be like bony almost bald shoulders slightly drooped and the face it was coming into the light now as inevitable as a ghost paler than before the skin still tight over the cheekbones then a little slack a gravity pull his own face but the eyes the shine of liquid full to brimming over catching all the light so full nick thought he might drown in them nicku the voice seemed to touch the back of his neck like a shiver drawing him nearer voices didnt change the same sound wrapping around him his earliest memory nicku my god and now the eyes did spill over a wetness at the corners as he raised his hands putting them on nicks arms nick thought of the day they had left washington when his heart had literally hurt in his chest a kind of practice death he felt it now take a breath he had wondered what it would feel like this moment and now he saw that it was like falling his stomach was light the ground had slid away but his father had taken him in his arms he could feel his cheek the head leaning into his shoulder the arms circling his back holding on to him for dear life they sat by the ornamental pool in the dark his father clutching nicks hand holding down a balloon that threatened to get away without the light of the arcade there was only his voice so that nick slipped back into it not distracted by having to see him so tall his father said his voice shaky so tall and then patting his leg he said simply you came i got your message so you knew i wanted you to be sure it was me i thought maybe thats why you didnt answer before you couldnt be sure answer nick said lightheaded again my letters his father paused i see you never got them you wrote to me of course in the beginning i should have known they would stop them he said his voice suddenly older but i thoughtnever mind youre here look at you touching him again nick wondered if he could see in the dark maybe just the shape of him was enough who stopped them nick said mother no no my friends an edge of sarcasm how is your mother the question itself seemed absurd as if everything that had happened to them could be reduced to a polite inquiry shes fine nick said at a loss shes married yes to larry you took his name nick glanced up at him trying to read his face in the faint light she thought it would be easier i guess you were famous famous he said almost pouncing on the word then he edged away conversational again but you didnt have to be yes i suppose i should be grateful to him hes been a good father to you yes he nodded then looked away to his own thought is she happy he said but when nick didnt answer he brought himself back and sighed well what a question how do we talk theres so much he put his hand on nicks knee you came you dont know what it means i thought what if he never wants to see me again no nick said but i had to try it was a chance why now and not before he stood up looking toward the music im not sure i suppose i thought you were better off maybe i was afraid you wouldnt answer like with the letters but then when i heard you were working with wisemanoh yes he said answering nicks expression i keep up i have your graduation picture what his father smiled so much information from america they still work overtime at it my friends like addicts i thought why not a little for me dont they owe me that much of course the newspapers i could see for myself at the institute but the rest he paused i didnt want to miss everything in your life wait a minute a sudden anger you had people spy on me his father shook his head no no nothing like that just what anyone would know the public record he stopped well once in the beginning i was so desperate i couldnt bear it so i asked someone at the institute you know its so easy to arrange that he brought me pictures hockey in central park you were still a boy then i saw how crazy it was how could i do that to you it was my fault all of it i had to let go so i made them stop he turned to him it was just that once nick stared up at him not knowing what to say in all the years he had not once imagined what his father had felt now he saw as in the science experiment that if you just took a few steps to the side the angle of the world was different what else he said curious his father shrugged it wasnt much nick a picture a few clippings i couldnt watch you grow remember the height marks nick nodded the notches on the side of the cabin door measuring him every six months it was like that just the marks so id know how you were doing his father was quiet for a minute and nick could hear the music rising in the background almost at an end so college and then the army and his father stopped took a breath all the time i thought he doesnt even know me anymore leave itits over and done with but then you went to london to work with wiseman unamerican activities and i thought its not over for him either its time for what nick said standing up why now his father looked around disconcerted as if the question had come too soon then turned to face him because im dying nick he said his voice almost a whisper nick stared at him seeing now that what he had taken for age was really illness no dont look like that his father said quickly concerned its all right i dont say it to upset you its justa fact he paused so it has to be now he looked away from nicks gaze please dont i know im a stranger to you i didnt ask you to come to why did you then nick asked unexpectedly bitter his voice unsteady to say goodbye no i wanted to see you its true selfish but theres something else he reached up putting his hands on nicks shoulders i want to put an end to that time for both of us i need you to help me but dont you see youre the only one i can trust nick looked at him amazed in the distance the applause began to do what his father looked up at the sound of the clapping the lights beginning to come on and patted nicks hand not here well talk its a long story we cant start it here then he held him by the arms again tomorrow but the lights seemed to bring with them a kind of urgency there would never be time to catch his breath sort out the noises that were a jumble in his mind he watched me grow hes dying somethings worrying him was any of it real he felt somehow that his father might rise up and float away like the applause nick he heard her voice from the other end of the arcade tentative obviously looking for him and he grabbed his fathers shoulder one thing he said i have to know his father looked at him surprised at the strength of his grasp what tell me the truth the truth just to me that night when you leftdid you go to the mayflower his father stared assessing then looked down almost with a smile so you think that too i thought i was the only one he looked back up no i didnt go there somebody else killed her there it was as simple as that nick felt empty with it gone the relief of an aching limb finally removed but you do think she was killed oh yes nick molly again closer now who its all the same crime you see his father said leaning toward him conspiratorial what happened to her what happened to me thats why i need your help i want to know while i still have time before nick could respond molly was with them his father glanced at him a flicker of the eye to signal an end to the conversation but why shouldnt she know secrecy became a reflex nick looked at her waiting to see if shed overheard but the words so loud to him evidently hadnt carried there you are she said then to his father hello again his father took her hand thank you for bringing him i owe you a great debt im glad someone does she said cheerfully refusing to be solemn youve had a visit a sighting his father said he looked around at the people milling toward the garden door tomorrow well visit youre going nick said its better but weve justill come back with you no no tomorrow the country he smiled at nicks urprise the weekend is sacred here to stay home would be noticed we leave our flat every saturday at eight like clockwork so we must keep the clock running youre going away nick said incredulous and you leave the hotel early with your camera theres a lot to see in prague i can pick you up by the tram stop we have a car his father smiled rich americans i forgot even better two cars you know the tank at the bottom of holechova this to molly who nodded eightten its quite safe they never follow us there his voice growing faint ended in a small cough then the coughing came again stronger until he was forced to give in to it partially doubling over to catch his breath he took a handkerchief out of his pocket to cover his mouth nick leaned forward peering at him whats wrong his father waved his hand dismissively still catching his breath then he managed a smile nothing overcome with emotion he tossed it out casually and in that second nick heard his father again young unable to resist an ironic turn but he looked drawn shaken by the cough it passes he said and fumbled in his pocket for a small tin box the kind used for pastille candies when he opened it the pills seemed enormous soviet medicine he said wryly not for the weak theres some water in the mens room nick said turning to get it to his surprise his father leaned on his arm and began walking with him just a moment his father said to molly attempting to be jaunty but his voice was raspy now and nick wondered if it really was just a coughing spell in the mens room people were lined up at the urinals nicks father went over to the washbasin taking his time with the pill he chased it down with water and stood quietly for a minute calming himself a few men left better nick said his father nodded what we talked about before its better i think not to say anything to molly you mean why a man at the urinal glanced in their direction surprised at the english but nick ignored him his father was nodding again stifling the beginning of another cough not yet not even her not until im sure ill explain you all right nick put his hand gently on his fathers back afraid that a stronger pat would set him off again you think its crazy dont you whispering in corners he said his voice now in fact a whisper youre not used to it nick looked around the room the overhead vents might be hiding mikes but why who would bother to bug the mens room at the wallenstein palace it occurred to him for the first time that his father this man he didnt know might really be paranoid common sense and skepticism worn down by the years to a membrane too thin to stop suspicion seeping through is it always like this nick said no sometimes they really are listening nick smiled relieved it was the kind of offhand joke his father would have made on nd street having a drink with his mother before they went out a throwaway not a story and shed be smiling just happy to be with him his father smiled now too pleased with himself but when he spoke his voice was serious i dont do it for myself he said looking straight at nick then another cough his face crinkling up a little in pain and he turned around to the basin so that nick had to look at him in the mirror whats wrong with you nick said alarmed frustrated at not knowing how to react in the mirror his father lowered his head eyes dropping out of sight and waved his hand again its all right you go please ill be fine tomorrow by the tank but nick wouldnt let go he took the back of his fathers shoulders turning him its not all right youre sick the man at the urinal had zipped and now came over saying something in czech his father answered quickly the sound of czech surprising nick he thinks youre molesting me his father said his head still down trying again for a wry joke youd better go tell me whats wrong nick still held him by the shoulders but when his father lifted his face nick let go stung by the look of dismay it doesnt matter just a side effect please his father said quietly i dont want you to see me like this nick looked down in confusion and saw the stain his father had wet himself when he looked back up his fathers eyes were moist with embarrassment its all right nick said words to a child but his father shook his head no now youll always think of me this way he looked up his eyes a kind of odd plea past all the jokes i cant make it up to you im not expecting he stopped his voice almost feverish but not this not some stranger with wet pants now it was nick who reached out to him bringing him close in the dingy mens room holding him whispering into his ear so that no one could hear youre not a stranger he said hes all right he wants us to leave separately he said to molly outside he doesnt look all right i know hes been sick you look a little shaky yourself she said studying him he led her toward the last of the crowd funneling through the garden door i cant stand it she said what did he say what did you talk about he looked at her unprepared why not tell her hes not just sick he thinks hes dying thats why he wanted to see me nick said surprised at how easily it came out it had begun already the convenient halftruths covering tracks oh she said deflated then an afterthought im sorry how do you feel ask me later right now im not sure the street was a small eddy of tatras and skodas loud motors and clunky headlights shining on the cobblestones in the square a large crowd bundled in coats waited for late trams instinctively nick headed away toward the bridge where couples were still loitering by the statues what else did he say molly said i mean why doesnt he want anyone to know youre here what difference would it make maybe he doesnt want anybody to know hes sick you summon the family its a land of tipoff i dont know she shook her head theres something else but when he stopped and looked down at the water she let it go sensing his reluctance this is the way cities used to look he said just enough light to see where youre going a delayed thought from the walk over when he had taken in the streets without ads and lighted shops just corner lights like sconces and recesses that were really dark nick what was it like seeing him do you mind my asking he turned to her it was easy it was him he looked back at the mist gathering along the surface of the river soon everything would be covered insubstantial he glanced over his shoulder as if he could catch a last glimpse of his father on the streets twisting up to hradcany a proof hed really been there all this time for years years i thought he was i dont know on the other side of the moon or something but hes been here in an apartment all you have to do is drive in spend a few dollars all this time she put her hand on his arm he hasnt always been here moscow then he said a little annoyed whats the difference the point is hes been somewhere i could have seen him they stamp a passport thats it what did i think it was some fucking checkpoint charlie i could have seen him not waited until he was sick so why didnt i she was quiet for a moment nick youre not the one who left nick nodded i know he reached into his pocket for a cigarette and handed her one he wrote to me wrote to you her face was caught in the glare of the match in the beginning he says anyway i never got them he lit his own and exhaled a long stream looking back at the water its like i missed a train and i dont know why she took his arm leading him away from the railing come on youre tired she said her voice familiar as if they were already a couple maybe this wasnt as easy as you thought karlova fed into the old town square where the clock was ringing to nearly deserted streets there were no cars the town had reverted to its medieval life he could hear the click of her heels like him the city was brooding and quiet slipping back into its own past they were on one of the side streets that led toward the lights of wenceslas when they heard the whistle an urgent shriek of authority and the clomp of boots the sounds of a dozen war movies two figures were racing toward them chased by a group of uniforms shouts indistinguishable words a gestapo bark and then the whistle again flying toward them like a pointed finger nick froze the sound of fear always directed at you so that even when it was merely overheard you felt caught too here in the foreign street it had the anxious confusion of a bad dreamit was coming to get you shoes cracked against the pavement before the men were halfway down the street he felt a yank molly pulling him into the dark shadow of a doorway she put her arms around his neck drawing him to her and the figures at his back became lost just a background sound rushing past while they pretended to be lovers no one stopped he heard the boots more shouts all of his senses alive now with the adrenalin release of the whistle her breath was on the side of his face and suddenly he smelled herskin not perfumeand felt her against him a touch as loud and surprising as the whistle he kissed her almost by reflex not thinking about it and the kiss was surprising too immediate and natural like the smell of her so that when he pulled back to look at her he seemed puzzled not sure how it had happened i thought youd never ask she said her voice low in her throat as if they were still hiding from the police he leaned into her again and this time the kiss was sexual her mouth opened to him and he could feel his body react another reflex unwilled he moved his hands behind her low and she let him pull the curve of her closer until she was pressed against him warm beneath her clothes she drew a breath a swimmers gulp before his mouth was on her again pressing now the kiss itself a kind of entry she gave in to it her mouth rubbing against his then pushed away putting her hands on his shoulders no dont she said a whisper still catching her breath i thought so did i she shook her head then looked up at him its different he said nothing the silence an open question you have other things on your mind not now i dont she smiled a little then put her hand on the side of his face yes you do no complications remember it doesnt have to be complicated he said moving closer but she held him away it will be though im not as easy as you think either he stared at her then dropped his hands come on she said moving into the street the police must be breaking up the demonstration we dont want to get caught in that sorry he said embarrassed to hear the sulk in his voice she turned no dont its not that its just not right not now is that a rain check i guess she looked up biting her lip but things never work that way do they they walked without touching keeping a space between them but when they reached the long sweep of wenceslas alive with lights and patrolling soldiers she took his hand again slipping them back into their roles the students with candles were bunched near the mounted statue surrounded by police who appeared to be moving them off one by one the chase in the alley must have started this way a sullen resistance that broke ranks an unexpected scuffle now things moved with a ritual formality no trouble several of the students were holding up an enlarged photograph on a poster jan palach she said nodding at the picture it must be a memorial service he looked at her quizzically reluctant to speak english now that there were people around she was moving them away from the top of the street skirting the crowd to skip across unnoticed he set himself on fire in january to protest the invasion nick stopped appalled like the buddhist monks he said seeing the image before him the shaved head and saffron robes in flames the black gasoline smoke but that was in another world tropical and alien not fairytale europe where people listened to mozart in gardens christ he said his voice a mixture of awe and scorn and it didnt change a thing there were shouts in the square as they reached the hotel and they ducked in quickly finally safe in the cocoon of art nouveau woodwork and faded chairs the usual newspaper readers had thinned out so that the few still there glanced up at once on the alert molly took his arm the clinging fiancee and there it was again the jarring feel of her pan warren the desk clerk said handing him the key you had a pleasant evening it was not too cold for the concert nick took the key feeling somehow watched but of course he had arranged for the tickets it was nothing more than the oily smoothness of a concierge with too few clients no the music was wonderful yes its good the wallenstein im sorry for the disturbance he said his eyes indicating the protest outside it is too bad perhaps a drink in the bar our pilsner beer is excellent it should not be too much longer he glanced at his watch as if the demonstration too had a closing time a halfhour at most there will be no problem with the sleeping he was smiling a weary familiarity with protests or some more practical arrangement with the police business went on jan palach had become an excuse for a nightcap i dont think so nick said its late oh ill need my car in the morning your car his question took nick by surprise he hadnt expected to explain himself but why couldnt it be just a bland inquiry we wanted to see karlovy vary molly said quickly leaning into him is it too far karlovy vary yes very beautiful far but you can do it he looked at them hesitantly then brought out a tourist map and marked it with his pen for the benzin he explained you can fill there its sometimes difficult in the countryside im sorry he said spreading his hands an apology for the country itself short of fuel molly was leaning over the map her body was still close to his and when she leaned back she brushed against him and he felt it again the heat on her skin if he reached down he could run his hand along the curve of her hip instead he saw them in bed her figure turned over onto itself away from him well maybe one drink he said nodding to the desk clerk and drawing her away to the bar what was that all about he said as they walked his brother probably owns the gas station no karlovy vary he said carefully trying to get it right whatever the hell that is karlsbad its a spa i couldnt think of anything else right on the spot youre good at this she glanced at him all women are she said lightly you learn to think fast its just part of the game like saying no when you mean yes like saying no when you mean no do you really want a drink no but if we go to bed now well start something she stopped and touched his shoulder smiling try the plum brandy thenyoull pass right out the bar was deserted except for a short grayhaired man at the end chainsmoking and nursing a beer nick had become used to the furtive glances of prague but this one stared openly frankly taking molly in a barroom appraisal they ordered pilsners i never know where i am with you nick said automatically lowering his voice so the words became a murmur in the room thats what you said you liked i did well you implied it at the bruces the bruces when was that anyway a year ago she smiled at least and you had that dress he took a sip of beer then put it back slowly on the coaster we didnt go to bed that night either you had a message to deliver yes but now were here end of message he reached over and ran his finger along hers barely touching but she moved it away lets not start this okay it was just a kiss no it wasnt oh how would you know she said suddenly has it occurred to you youve had kind of an emotional day youre alli dont know excited i want it to be me not like this when its just us he looked at her surprised her mood seemed to come out of nowhere a shift in the wind okay he said quietly he brought his hand back but she stopped it covering it with her own look she said when i started this i didnt know it was going to be you who you are i mean who i am he echoed not following her but now she backed away almost tossing her head to clear the air i want this to be over god i hate being here then hearing herself she turned to her beer everybody watching everybody not watching you cant breathe politics she said almost spitting the p nick said nothing waiting for the calm to return a cartoon husband lying low how about him he said finally trying to change the subject he doesnt look very political is he watching us she said not looking up well hes watching you nick said she turned and the man held her gaze studying her face as if he were trying to place her youre right she said moving back to nick thats not politics he doesnt even pretend not to look men i suppose it must work sometimes or they wouldnt keep doing it well you try she smiled the squall gone good luck she said taking in the empty bar she stood im going up no its all right she put her hand on his shoulder finish your beer id rather pass out with a good long soak she stopped hesitating look dont mind me im just nervous i guess about tomorrow why but she ignored the question and leaned over dont talk to strangers she said playfully glancing again at the grayhaired man you never know he turned on his stool watching her leave fight huh at first nick thought it was a foreign phrase a bar order but the voice was unmistakably new york and he turned back to see the grayhaired man smiling at him nick shrugged a universal nonanswer better give in the man said no matter what it is thats the way it works he got off his stool moving unsteadily and it occurred to nick that the man was drunk hazily eager for contact nick took another sip of beer anxious now to finish youre american the man said flatly taking the next stool nick raised his eyebrows a question the shoes the man said nodding toward nicks feet he extended his hand marty bielak where you from new york nick said and then because some kind of response seemed called for you im from here you live here i didnt know there were any americans here a few of course were not americans anymore he paused except we are they think we are he was drifting into his beer i came over in fiftythree long time ago you came here he smiled a little at nicks confusion im a communist nick looked at him more carefully his eyes were shiny but the words had been flat without belligerence youre too young you wouldnt know about that they were arresting everybody then i didnt want to go to jail so i came here he said something in czech to the bartender who brought him another beer what did you do do he said a kind of snort i voted for wallace you didnt have to do anything just have a card you know the summer they killed the rosenbergs i thought thats it he stared at nick you dont know what im talking about do you anyway it was all a long time ago you like it here the man shrugged same as anywhere what was it like living there you couldnt take a piss without somebody reporting it thats what it was like there you think im kidding my wife got fired shed go to work theyd have guys following her it got to the point he stopped taking another sip the hell with it youre too young my daughter she couldnt wait to see it last year when you could travel she goes to the bronx to the old building and its crawling with schwartzes and she says no wonder you came she thought we lived in a slum but it wasnt like that then thats not why so you never went back whats to go back for last yearwell she went i didnt have money for all of us maybe someday anyway its all different isnt it i mean they dont even have the giants anymore whats new york without the giants what do you do here nick said intrigued now radio i monitor the voa broadcasts well i did but now im american again you know after last year even the old reds but thatll change were going through an adjustment now you have to expect that a believers rationale still nick thought of the index cards in wisemans study all the facts of the witchhunt which had somehow overlooked marty bielak in a misplaced file this is where some of them had ended up perched on a barstool stranded like debris swept up on the beach by a storm can i ask you something nick said impulsively why did you in the first place what become a red he looked back at his beer you think we have horns let me tell you we didnt who else was there you think anybody cared about the working man antisemites playing golf thats what it was then antisemites playing golf he stared at the glass then caught himself its the beer talking he said trying an apologetic smile that stopped midway you ask me you know what id have to say who else was there thats it he picked up the glass anyway here i am talking its good you know the englishand youve got a pretty girl to go to what are you doing here anyway just seeing the sights nick said easily the man nodded not so many come now unless they have family you have family here no he shook his head my grandmother was polish though he said improvising molly was right you could learn to do it fast part of the other game and thats close enough bielak said laughing to himself youd have to be american theyre the only ones who think its the same thing he paused then looked up at nick let me ask you could you use a guide i know this town inside out i could use a little cash his voice the brash sound of the polo grounds had dropped an octave suddenly older nick caught the embarrassed pleading in his eyes still shiny with beer dollars if you have them my sister she still sends but these daysi have the time nick looked at him not an index card i dont think so were only here a little while thanks though just see the castle and on your way okay dont miss the jewish cemeteryits the best thing sounds crazy but it is well think about it he reached for a pen wrote a number on the coaster and handed it to nick if you change your mind i can show you the stuff the tourists dont see nick heard his voice begin to slur a special tour you want to see all the old reds that might be interesting he said his voice suddenly sarcastic nick stood up putting the coaster in his pocket night he said almost a mumble he threw some crowns on the bar not bothering to count them good luck luck marty bielak winked we dont need luck here we have socialism when he got to the room molly was still up reading by one of the two dim bedside lamps the flannel nightgown was back and her face glistened with cold cream an almost comic body armor the heavy drapes drawn tight by the maid still sealed the room and he crossed to open them hungry for air what happened to you she said i was about to give up she closed the book and snapped off her light leaving only the small glow by his side of the bed you were wrong about that guy nick said opening the windows hes an american he lives here it was your english he began unbuttoning his shirt looking down at the street lamps lives here you didnt tell him anything did you no why oh nick she said in mock exasperation who do you think hangs around the alcron bar talking to foreigners he stopped his hand still on the button you think he said quietly who else could afford it when he didnt answer she turned over goodnight he continued staring out the window not wanting to turn around what if she was right what was that like he saw marty bielak writing up reports on tourist conversations taking another step for the working man do you have family here did that make it easier maybe cadging dollars for a tour was worse a seduction without even the selfrespect of betrayal the protesters had gone just as the desk clerk had predicted leaving behind their candles now the police were clearing them away tipping over the lights until the space under the good king was empty again a patch of dark hed set himself on fire how many ways are there to take away your life a lost family as irretrievable as childhood a careless exile eavesdropping in bars at least jan palach had only done it to himself but you always take somebody with you there must have been parents left with a martyrdom and an empty house and sometimes somebody did it for you flinging you out the window before you had a chance to hold on molly moved in bed and the sound carried to him a disturbance in the air it pricked at him not letting him drift and as he raised his hand to draw on the cigarette he suddenly saw her at the window in bern a reverse image maybe she had felt it then the same disturbance something right here not some feint with ghosts now it was his turn he thought about her in durnstein then down in the bar and he saw that they kept colliding and moving on like electrons what if he made the same mistake as the others losing everything for an idea he stood still in the courtyard with his father he had felt that his life had come back to him but it was only a piece of the past that had come back it was the side street that had been alive with an adrenalin touch maybe there was no idea maybe it was as simple as a rustling of bedclothes that wouldnt leave you alone a disturbance no more than that so that if you didnt hear it came and then like the luck marty bielak didnt need slipped away for good chapter the day began with sun but by the time hed finished coffee the clouds of middle europe had rolled in a lead weight pressing down on the city turning everything gray they crossed the vltava over a different bridge downriver from the mala strana is this the right way nick said i dont remember this just keep going to the end soviet tank square they call it that mm namesti sovetskych tankistu she said the accurate pronunciation its own joke of course in those days they were liberating not invading how do you know all this all what its just tourist stuff i had a lot of time to get to know the city are you going to see him your friend maybe the split hadnt been as casual as she had said jiri she was looking out the window no not this trip one reunions enough dont you think there was no one near the tank and they drove around the traffic circle once then parked near the corner and pulled out a map pretending to plot the trip the place names brimming with consonants and accent marks might have been chinese lets hope he doesnt drive too fast nick said i could never follow this but his father had thought of everything when the skoda pulled alongside he got out to switch cars in the daylight he looked less drawn more like himself and nick felt a jolt again as if a photograph had come alive the woman in the passenger seat was handsome but fullfaced and when she stepped out to change sides he saw that her body was thick rounded by time and gravity to his surprise she was shy and nervous brushing a stray hair back in to place with the automatic gesture of a girl wanting to look her best and nick realized that she was apprehensive about meeting him she smiled hesitantly glancing into his eyes anicka this is my son his father said nick my wife anna so easy the whole tangled mess reduced to a simple introduction she held out her hand how do you do she said a formality from a phrasebook but her eyes were warm scanning his face now tracing her husbands features you are very like she said pleasantly miss chisholm would you go with anna then no one gets lost molly she said to anna shaking her hand too anna placed her hand on nicks fathers sleeve familiar and affectionate and said something in czech then she got in the car and started around the tank noisily shifting gears what did she say nick asked not to be too long i thought id show you the sights we dont want to travel in convoy he walked toward the passenger door why not do people follow you no he smiled force of habit thats all nick started the car where to just drive around head for the castle can i see where you live its just up here up holeckova well come round the other way we dont want to surprise anyone nick drove along the river then climbed the steep hill to hradcany his father said nothing glancing in the rearview mirror i suppose shes my stepmother nick said and then when his father didnt answer how did you meet at the institute in moscow she was an archivist when was this well when fifteen sixteen years ago nick counted backward no not right away a decent interval do you love her he said surprised at his own prurience but how else could he ask it his father looked at him then back at the street i married her weve had a good life i owe her this he motioned his hand to take in the city i never would have got out of moscow otherwise shes a czech national he paused i loved your mother its different nick looked straight ahead at a church with several towers green copper domes how long have you been here just a year she retired you see so they let us settle here kind of a gold watch ordinarily you have to stay put but i guess they knew i wasnt in any shape to worry about so why not whats wrong with you nick said quietly is it cancer no my heart ive had one operation but it doesnt seem to have done any good that reminds me he took out a plastic vial and opened it a different pill from the one last night thins the blood he explained of course if you cut yourself you have a hell of a time because it wont clot fix one thing and something else goes he swallowed the pill without water anyway he said steering away from the subject we came to prague my gold watch too i guess its beautiful hitler thought so too he made it an open city thats why its still beautifulno bombs imagine having hitler to thank for this whats moscow like its like brooklyn everyone there thinks its special and you cant imagine why nick smiled the same rhythm at first i couldnt get used to the quiet his father said its very quiet for a big city you never hear an ambulance or a fire truck i dont know why not much traffic and then in the winter the snow muffles everything sometimes i used to open the window and just listen to the quiet it was like being deaf you think you want quiet and then when you get it he paused but after a while you get used to it like everything else he took out a cigarette and rolled down the window the funny thing about that was in the bad old days they used to send the cars at night so no one would know but it was so quiet everyone did know youd hear a car in the streetyou couldnt miss itand youd know it was an arrest the whole block maybe they planned it that way you didnt go back to sleep after that youd just lie there waiting to hear the next car but that was before when stalin was alive turn here by the church well swing around the strahov nick said nothing imagining the nights now just an anecdote people talked about the knock on the door but it had been something else a car motor idling in a quiet street no screaming no people being dragged out just the faint sound of a car door being shut a deaf mans terror were you ever arrested no of course i was debriefed that took months i still dont know where but after there was a flat in the arbat two roomsa palace then and a job they gave me a medal nick heard the tone a hint of pride and was disconcerted was he supposed to congratulate him what kind of job he said not sure again how to ask did youwork for them as an agent you mean his father said almost amused no who would i spy on the diplomats the journalists they were already taken care of there wasnt anybody else just the defectors we kept to ourselvesmaybe we were kept to ourselves i dont know for a while i worked with maclean on international affairs the magazine he said to nicks unspoken query like your foreign affairs i think with the same level of accuracy a nice man a believer you know still but the others he let the phrase drift off not exactly people you want to spend the weekend with besides i was trying to learn russian not speak english i was never very good at languages i still cant speak czech not really i thought you could you did oh the committee no i never could i picked up a few words from your grandparents but they tried not to speak around me they wanted me to be he paused framing the words an allamerican boy nick said nothing letting the thought sit there i was too i had a paper route i still fold a paper like that like im going to throw it on a porch sixty subscribersa lot for then the things you remember nick heard the fade in his voice and resisted its pull too bad about the language it would have come in handy he said lightly indicating the street well anicka takes care of all that thats a little like being deaf too when you cant speak the language people talk to you and you just look you even get to like it not hearing things when i first got to moscow i would spend days not hearing anything it was quiet like the streets the sound nick thought after a door had closed they had made the circle and were coming back down holeckova slow down a little if you want to see it where i live third building there on the left the white one not too slow his father added automatically putting his elbow on the window to cover the side of his face it was a multistory apartment building with simple art moderne lines in a section of the street that must have been developed before the war when straight edges and glass were still a style the white was tired now but had escaped the cracks and watermarks of the newer buildings across the river put up on the cheap it was set back from the street reached by a flight of concrete steps set into the hill there was nothing remarkable about it at all except that his father lived there we were lucky to get it his father said the views are wonderful not the old town but then the plumbings better two bathrooms nick glanced quickly at him feeling again a peculiar sense of dislocation he was in prague with a ghost discussing real estate he noticed the hand at the side of the face does someone really watch the house or do i just imagine it his father said wryly no the czechs take a look from time to time the stb you see to them im a russian they want to know what im doing here nick took this in toying with it a russian they passed the soviet tank again and headed across the river what did they give you a medal for services to the state all of us got one mostly for going there once theyve brought you in they dont know what to do with you so they give you a medal its cheap and it gives you something to hold on to so you dont wonder why youre not doing anything anymore they dont trust foreignersthey cant help it its in the bone after the magazine i got the job at the institute so at least they thought i wasnt going to do any damage some of the othersenglish lessons makework what did you do policy analyst american policy of course by the time they trusted me to do that id been away from washington so long i didnt know any more about american policy than the next man they have a habit of defeating their own purpose but maybe thats what they wanted all along anyway they never listened to anything i had to say nick realized that the answer easy and smooth was what he wanted to hear and for the first time he wondered if his father could be lying had he really done so little for an instant he felt as if he were back at the hearing so plausible and persuasive and all the while nick stopped was he welles now the inquisitor to outflank who cared whether they listened to him or not and it might after all which was worse be the truth a glib answer to mask a marginal life seems a shamefor them i mean nick said not taking advantage of my wisdom who knows i was wrong about cuba i never thought wed go that far nick paused we who we americans his father said softly clearly thrown by the question there was nothing to say to that and nick drove quietly skirting the top of wenceslas to follow the streets behind the university the mood in the car was uneasy now as if improbably they had nothing more to say tell me about your mother his father said finally tell me about livia shesfine busy lots of parties you know yes she loved parties a beat does she ever talk about me no the word blunt and final hung between them and the instant nick heard it he wished he had lied another door closing louder this time the silence as leaden as the sky was its own response and there was nothing to break it but the sound of the car at a corner nick stopped and reached into a back pocket for his wallet he pulled out a photograph and handed it to his father then put the car back in gear and drove on allowing him to look in private shes cut her hair his father said quietly she used to wear it longer nick kept driving not wanting to intrude from the corner of his eye he saw his father holding the picture absorbed i may have this he said finally a foreign intonation nick nodded shes the same he put the picture in the breast pocket of his jacket dont tell anna he said and nick felt drawn against his will into some odd complicity why was even the simplest gesture tangled would she mind its better this way his father said not answering sometimes the way she looks at me nick said i think i remind her of you a small offering to soften the no but his father wanted to move on no just the eyes he was looking at nick now so tall were the same height his father smiled well you used to be smaller and now you still bite your nails involuntarily nick moved his hands on the wheel turning in his fingers always something going on inside you were going on inside nick wanted to shout instead he said do you have children you and anna no theres only you were not so young he paused shes nervous you know about you why his father shrugged she thinks youll change things he took out another cigarette but what is there to change are you supposed to smoke those things with your heart no of course not im not supposed to do anything no excitement if you listened to them youd be so careful youd go without knowing the difference is it bad for you my being here a new thought very bad he said teasing gently its the best thing in the world the housessmaller now with patches of gardenwere thinning out and they could see the country ahead is this right nick said yes keep going i want to show you something are you going to tell me what its not a mystery he said making it one everything in its time nick glanced at him there was an agenda everything planned and what was at the end the wallenstein the switch of cars the country step by step even their conversation now seemed to him a kind of testing his father leading him further into his life where nothing was open secrecy became a habit he saw now that his father wanted to be sure of him somehow and he felt unexpectedly wounded wasnt it enough that he had come in the woods there were still blossoms on the trees not the lush flowering of virginia but a thin sprinkling of white a bohemian lace remember the dogwood his father said seeing them too on nd street i wonder is it still there magnolia i dont know the neighborhoods changed but not the trees his father said not hearing the shift in nicks tone ive never been back we sold it right after ah what became of nora do you see her just christmas cards shes still there somewhere arlington i think i always wondered was she working for the fbi his father said easily old edgar had a real fondness for housekeepers the words like a trigger exploded something in nick this was crazy yet another descent through the rabbit hole even nora who cares its not important he felt things fall away until there was nothing but the gulf of all the years between them why were they talking about this the realtor view from holeckova two bathrooms moscow in the snow surreal all of it they gave me a medal talk to me i loved that house his father said dreamily it snapped again everything in its time now he felt his breath shortening and gripped the wheel bringing the car to a stop on the side of the road his foot on the brake he heard the motor his own breathing sensed his father turning in alarm why did you do it he said his voice wavering staring straight ahead pulling the words out of himself not enough breath for a wail why did you leave me then there was no sound at all a suspension even of air i didnt leave you his father said finally in a whisper i left myself a distress real enough to touch nick knew it was true and knew that if he reached out for it they would lose the moment put everything aside in some evasive forgetting no he said still looking at the wheel me you left me why did you his father said nothing nick kept his eyes ahead afraid to look what could there be on his face but loss i want to explain his father said weakly then stopped why did you ask me here what do you want from me at this his father stirred flustered if we could wait he said hoarsely the right time so i can explain now nick said angrily finally turning to him tell me now what do you want his father met his eyes the nervous fluttering gone giving in i want to go home nick started driving too stunned to do anything else please let me explain in my own way his father had said and then when he didnt nick didnt know how to press the outburst had unnerved them boththey were afraid of each other nowso that driving seemed a form of apology dont worry i wont do that again it was safer to concentrate on the road you know thats impossible nick said but it had been impossible for him to come and he had driven right in a twolane road through the wire his father said nothing determined to follow his own timetable and nick went back to the road the ragged asphalt and lacy trees had he actually worked out the logistics nicks imagination couldnt take it in passports and border crossings and newsmen at the end like the men in hats no not that it was a kind of metaphor a way of talking one of his fathers riddles turn up here nick saw the sign terezin in german theresienstadt the model camp where they took the red cross his father nodded thats right the model camp in the museum by the jewish cemetery in prague they have the childrens drawings they arewell youll see them they parked outside an old fortress the walls of a castle town why are we doing this nick said i dont want a history lesson i want to talk to you this is what were talking about i want to start at the beginning so youll understand there were no other cars and when a guard appeared grumbling in czech nick thought it must be closed but his father flashed some card in his wallet and the guard straightening himself nodded a salute and passed them through the air was utterly still not even moved by birds and it carried the crunch of their shoes on the dirt all the buildings were not just empty but abandoned like a western ghost town whose mine had played out there had been no attempt to turn it into a museum park no flower beds or lawns as if the ground itself had resisted any signs of new life just the graveyard stillness the buildings some of them old pieces of architecture had been left to rot exhausted by their own terrible history it was not the kind of concentration camp nick had seen in a thousand photographsthe railway tracks to the smokestacks the long barracks wrought iron twisted into messagesbut there was no mistaking the stillness they had left their dread behind and it still hung in the air as real as blood people have the idea that it wasnt so bad here his father said taking them farther into the compound you knowthe orchestra the childrens drawings like summer camp but sixty thousand died here the rest they sent to auschwitz the other camps everybody died you see the bunks he gestured toward an open door where nick could see bunk beds stacked to the ceiling nine in a bunk sometimes more you can imagine typhus dysentery well you cant imagine nobody can people think that because there were no ovensbut over sixty thousand here not shipped out they didnt need gas chambers they just shot them one by one or the gallows not very efficient but maybe more satisfying they could watch nick followed him down the dusty street saying nothing this happened in my lifetime he thought at the end there through that gate is where they shot them i dont want to see this nick said claustrophobic theres just one thing he stopped at a house near the end next to it was an empty swimming pool with bunches of old leaves stuck in rain puddles on the cracked concrete this was the commandants house he had a swimming pool for his daughters little girls the prisoners would march by here on their way to the firing range he pointed again to the open area through the gate they shot them over there so close the sharp crack of gunfire not once all day they would hear nick said picturing it yes while they were swimming the first time i saw thiswhat kind of people were these little girls swimming and all the time maybe there was a fence nick said dully so they couldnt see no no fence then the prisoners would see them too nick thought splashing the last thing they would see why are you showing me this he said turning away from the pool i want you to understand what they were nothing will make sense without that nick looked at him sensing where he was heading you dont have to explain yourself to me no i think i do the politics of another generation theyre never real are they what was the point thirty years from now theyll ask you what was so important but it was important nick thought of jan palach important enough to light a match in prague his father said you see all the statues hussites catholics what was that nobody remembers but at the time if you lived then nick looked down moving his shoe across the dirt like a visible thought you didnt know about this not then the swimming pool no but we knew what they were all you had to do was listen and and no one was stopping them no one america first itll all just go away or maybe its a good thing people thought that then you know we had our own nazis my god jim crow people with sheets over their heads that doesnt seem real anymore either does it father coughlin on the radio that prick nick glanced up oddly reassured by the familiarity of his fathers scorn still an anticleric but his father was racing now and you could see what the nazis were doing austriajust like that they werent going to stop then czechoslovakia the sudeten but we knew it meant the whole thing why not just hand it over the english he said waving his hand and nobody in washington lifted a finger couldnt it would have been bad politics nobody was trying to stop them except the communists nick said quietly following his logic thats when you became a communist yes after munich that was the last straw strange in a way i didnt have any special feeling for the czechs your grandparents had family herein the sudeten in fact but i never felt czech i dont feel czech now i think it was the helplessness the feeling that you had to do something he stopped then managed a shrug another generations politics how do you explain it maybe i was ready and then munich came along he glanced up at nick i wasnt the only one you know a lot of people joined in the thirties there were good reasons then well we thought there were nick looked at him they didnt become spies he said he turned back toward the entrance gate lets go his father followed him outside the walls near the car he touched nicks elbow lets walk for a bit involuntarily nick drew his elbow in not in there he said but he began to walk what made you ready i was impatient nick caught the tiny barb and slowed to his fathers pace the times his father said vaguely you cant imagine what things were like then you remember where grandma lived they had visited a few times when nick was a child collieries and slag heaps and cookiecutter company houses the big coal stove in the basement kitchen where his grandmother seemed to live held by the warmth a photograph of roosevelt on the wall the last supper draped with a frond from palm sunday upstairs the parlor with doilies where the priest visited once a year and no one sat people literally went hungry in those days i had friends children who worked in the breakers half the miners were on relief you picked up coal by the tracks the pieces that fell off the cars in a burlap bag you had to drag it home if it got too heavy but i was luckyi got out i was going to change all that she never believed you did it nick said grandma she wouldnt look at the papers she said it was a mistake his father stopped and took a breath as if hed been punched in the early days we did change things he continued refusing to be distracted washington was exciting the new deal he pronounced it for effect like a foreign phrase we were just out of law schoolwhat did we know we thought we could change anything nothing could stop us but they did i think we just knocked the wind out of them and then when they caught their breath there they were again the welleses the rankinsthey were always there you know we didnt invent them after the war defenders of the faith whatever it was themselves mostly he turned looking at nick you know when i first went to penn i remember i had a suitcase your grandmother bought it for me and i saw right away it was all wrong i hid it in the closet embarrassed you know and then i thought what the hell ill catch up this was my chance i had the scholarship and the job and sometimes i didnt even sleep there was so much i wanted to do but what i couldnt understandit was the first time id met people who thought they deserved their luck they didnt know they were lucky they didnt think at all about the ones who werent there how can people be like that not see theyre lucky not have some he searched compassion theyre afraid someone will take it away nick said simply yes his father nodded but what makes them think they should have it in the first place thats whats interesting what do they believe in what did welles believe in i still dont know of course he said a faint smile on his face theyre not very bright are they maybe thats all of it kenneth b welles i remember when he first came to town not even a lightbulb on upstairs he never did have anything except his amour propre and the right suitcase his father glanced at him appreciatively yes he had that his fathernatural gas of all things that certainly ran in the family he said a throwaway anyway things juststalled maybe we ran out of steam maybe welles and the rest of them learned how to block bills just sat in committee after a while all we were doing was fighting them not politics schoolyard stuff and meanwhile things kept going to hellthere wasnt time he stopped impatient you see so i was ready what did you do walk into some office and sign up like that nick said sounding more sarcastic than he intended no they come to you his father said ignoring the tone they fish first the bait then they play the lineit turns out thats what they did best in those days thats all they were doing but i didnt see that no change just recruiting who recruited you his father stopped and looked toward the fortress walls names well what difference does it make now hes dead richard schulman a teacher at penn he was never exposed youre the only one who knows this he said his voice suddenly conspiratorial nick looked at him it was thirty years ago he said no one cares his father finished he shook his head old battles still its not easy you know even now giving names anyway he kept in touch he came to washington now and then we had dinner i think he saw i was what discouraged ready for something else it was a long process a seduction literally his father smiled like the brits no he had four wives i think he changed them if they got suspicious none of them knew not even them i think thats what he liked the secrecy of course in my case it made sense being a secret member if you were in government you couldnt be public thats how it started we were secret for my protection so i could keep the job at least i didnt have to go to the meetings he said lightly selfcriticism that was the thing then you knowall that breastbeating i heard the stories later i dont think i would have made it through that so its just as well he glanced at nick expecting him to be amused but nick was still looking at the ground waiting so i was in place secret and in place what else could the next step have been it started with the trade agreement we were being stupid about thatstill trying to collect old war debts anyone could see the soviets didnt have that kind of money to spare they couldnt rearm against germany without hard currency but the talks just dragged on and on so you decided to give them a push yes a push a little one to move things along it was important for them to know how to speed up the negotiations were not talking about tank designs just position papers memos half the people involved had access to them they werent sensitive then what good were they well you have to understand the soviets they have a mania for information it comes i think from feeling so isolated during the war they took planeloads of documents out on the lendlease planesbags of them memos newspapers useless most of it paper but they always wanted more i dont want to know what you gave them nick said flustered what matters is you did no its important for you to know for what im going to tell you nick waited it was never anything military office paper like emptying a wastebasket things we should have told them in the first place why not we could tell england but not them they had to rely onpeople like me just to know but what could i tell them diplomatic reports what ambassador soandso thought assuming he thought anything what was the harm i never gave them anything that would hurt us i never had anything like that just my inbox your inbox nick said facing him is that why you sent for me to tell me how innocent it all was just a little private lendlease out of the goodness of your heart my god dont you think its a little late for this no his father said shaking his head i didnt mean that i knew what i was doing i thought they had a right to know it was neverinnocent the point is i never gave them anything important so so why bring me out do you think i was philby i wasnt what made me so important to them it was a new idea to nick unexpected but his fathers voice was even the patient tone of a teacher leading him through a theorem proof all that trouble for me why you got caught no i was accused i was never caught nick looked at him picking up the odd twisted pride in his voice what did they have a salesgirl who said she knew me her word my word we could have beat it he said a lawyer again still preparing the case the papers said she had more his father waved his hand an easy dismissal what more could she have she was the messenger that was welles grabbing a headline he did that you know on fridays by monday people would forget he hadnt actually told them anything he was just trying to turn up the pilot light make that poor girl think he had something shake her up a little and see if any more came out its been known to work anyway this time it went with her but he didnt have anything maybe shed already talked to him no wed have heard why would he keep it to himself it cost him that hearing smoke and no fire people get fed up he started looking like a bully she didnt tell him anything about me she couldnt havethere was nothing to tell she sold the shirt i left the papers thats all there was to it simple nothing to connect either of us of course one way or the other after the hearing id be out of business that kind of spotlight doesnt go away as far as they were concerned i was finished but welles was stuckhe didnt have enough to put me away so why not just retire me why bring me out nick stopped rattled i thought it was your idea no his father slowly shook his head i had no choice nick you believe that dont you he took nicks elbow a physical plea to leave everything no i thought we could sit it out he took his hand away dropping it with his voice we could have what are you trying to say that it was all a mistake somebody jumped the gun this was worse somehow their whole lives turned around in a careless haste i did think that at first his father said starting to walk again i tried to tell them but there were orders you didnt argue with that ever in the phone booth nick said quietly in union station his father turned amazed how did you know that i followed you you followed me he repeated when he looked at nick he softened as if he could see a childs face again why i knew something bad was happening i thought in case he stopped surprised to find himself embarrassed in case his father said still looking at him so i made you a spy too then he smiled a better one it seems i had no idea you werent looking were supposed to you know he said wryly nick shrugged people dont see kids you had things on your mind he saw him again in the herringbone coat walking slowly up the hill looking down at the snow preoccupied is that when you decided after the phone call as if the chronology mattered i didnt decide nick i did what i was told but if welles didnt have anything we didnt know that then only later i suppose i believed him too that there was something i didnt want to go to prison he stopped turning so i went without us nick said picking at it yes without you it was usual to have the families follow like donalds but we didnt no did i think your mother would come i dont know at first i hoped but i never heard and thenwell by that time i knew moscow better it was the terror all over again until stalin died no one was safe war heroes he snapped his fingers making them vanish as casually as the black cars in the night even molotov he denounced his wife the fool thought it would save his job she spent seventeen years in the camps soviet justice he turned to nick it was no place for you i didnt want you there can you understand that it would have killed your mother that life later when things got better he spread his hands you were already someone else they had made a circle through some trees and were heading back to the fortress to the stillness the guard had left his post and in their absence was inspecting the car running his hand along the smooth finish as if it were an exotic animal its clearing his father said looking up well have sun then lets finish yes he stopped touching nicks elbow again a moment the words sounded translated nick looked at him quickly wondering whether the walk had tired him or was he trying to keep a distance from the guard but his face lost in thought showed something else an old man trying to find his place in a prepared speech so why bring me out he said finally picking up the thread the propaganda that was part of it just being there they like to show us off like the africans they bring to the university living proof marx is everywhereeven in the jungle no color bar in the international of course the people think theyre savagesthey just stare at them in the metroso whos fooling whom he paused catching himself but they never used me that way they gave you a medal yes one press appearance then no more a lot of trouble to take dont you think for a minute on the stage they had to help you isnt that part of the deal for a russian yes they would do that but the rest of us it would depend on what we knew and what did i know so why take the chance if i was being watched for instance he said glancing slyly at nick someone had to get me out why put anyone at risk why not just leave me to the wolves okay why his father looked at him his eyes burning finally there to protect someone else for a moment nick was silent trying to take it in do you know that he said quietly his father nodded ive had a lot of time to think about it at first you flatter yourselfyou want to believe you are important but i wasnt it was never about me nick what happened it was always about someone else nick stared at him so carefully led to the point that now he felt pinned by its sinking inevitability the event of his life reduced to an accident not about them at all who he said his father began to walk again his voice slipping back to its instructor tone well who did i know the logical person was schulman it fit he recruited me he must have been valuable to them he would insist on being protected richard schulman i didnt know it was possible to hate someone that much during the bad times i had that to hang on to hed get caughtit would happen to him too it didnt though he took a breath which was just as well it wasnt him you see it was someone else who nick repeated thats what i want to find out for an instant nick wondered if his father was all right his anger finally curdled over the years into an old mans obsession find out how the woman is the key i was sent away and shedied so someone would be safe schulman no it should have been him but he died too he glanced at nick quite naturally later there was no question about that i saw the coroners report nick looked at him appalled how long had his father been working out his old puzzle playing detective while his life passed by then he saw himself in london arranging index cards like clues so his father said a blackboard pointer in his voice a new question who else did she know who recruited her they were almost at the car now and nick turned to him away from the guard does it matter anymore he said gently so many years maybe hes dead too his father shook his head no you dont understand it does matter hes still there the guard no longer shy called over to them in rapid czech and nick stepped aside when his father answered jarred by the sudden volley of foreign words even the familiar voice seemed different guttural and slurred he looked at him half expecting to see his face changed too broad and slavic he wants to know what it can do on the highway how fast his father said i dont know nick said his mind elsewhere what do you mean hes still there later his father said quietly then spoke in czech again affable now sharing a foreign joke nick watched the guard widen his eyes then shrug i told him ninety easy before it starts to rattle he says his tatra would fall apart the guard gave the car an admiring pat i think youve made a convert to the west stop it nick said annoyed at his tone just smile and get in the car his father said almost under his breath and then spoke czech to the guard again nick watched them chat for a minute idle car talk outside the old camp walls and felt again how surreal ordinary life was here the past wasnt forgotten just ignored down the road little girls had played in a pool never leave a bad impression his father said getting in the car people remember nick put the car in gear and pulled away how do you know hes still there his father lit a cigarette because ive been following him every agent has a pattern following how well at first by accident he said blowing smoke easing into it we always acted alone in washington burgess staying at philbys housethat kind of thing would have been impossible for us we never knew each other i had my contact my control at the russian embassy and that was it no one else then how do you know the code names they liked to group usits a convenience fish birds mythology whatever came to someones mind ive often wondered who did that who assigned the names theyre supposed to be completely at random but you know how it is someone cant help being clever san francisco was babylon washington carthage capitals of fallen empires some clerks idea of a joke what was yours coal i thought it was because of the union work but it turned out we were all minerals it had no significance at all schulman was gold panning for gold maybe he was just first of course i never had the crossfiles only the code names but it became a kind of game to figure it out to see whether i might have known any of them i was pretty sure iron was carlson over in commercethe reports had his tone just as dull as talking to him and sure enough when he died the reports stopped so it must have been copper was someone at the post but im still not sure who the others were mostly illegals soviets who were there without diplomatic immunity so i wouldnt have known them even if i had had the crossfiles not that it mattered it was just a game to help pass the time nick stared ahead amazed a boys game for grownups code names and passwords of course this was all later his father continued after josef my embassy control came home at first i didnt see anything they had me reading newspapers i was a sort of readers digest for moscow central then i got the traffic from the san francisco residency they had an office in san francisco what for originally to monitor the un conference in his father said easily afterward well some of the old gru contacts were still there it was useful to keep tabs on the soviet merchant marine sailors had a bad habit of jumping ship once they were in babylon defectors that kept the office busy what happened to them the sailors does it matter his father said quietly yes they were found and shipped back home not a game hunted down thrown into ships sent back to prison camps with your help nick said his father was quiet then sighed yes with my help what do you want me to say nick that i didnt know no nick said absorbing it go on so josef came backthis would be after they finally got rid of beria lots of changes thenand we got together he liked a drink im a political analyst i said isnt it time i had something to analyze im wasting my time here no one is going to waste time now he says were going to clean house youll see very important as if it were up to him its the drink talking i thought but no reports did start coming they threw out half the section berias goons and josef had everything his way for a while he liked me i dont know why i never liked him much but we dont pick our commissars do we i finally had some real work to do then one day a funny thing josef used to assign the reports but he was out so his secretary brought them straight over from cryptology she was the type who knew everythingshe came with the place no one could ever get rid of her not even josef i think maybe she had a protector anyway she handed me a report and said so silvers back now well really have something as if i knew all about it good i said its about time conspirators you see and she was rightwe did have something committee minutes house appropriations much better than the other stuff i was seeing so where did this come from i wondered not carlson not an illegalthe access was too good the next day i said to josef whos silver not that he would tell methat wasnt allowed but i thought he might say something a hint for the old network it only took a second that look of surprise he shouldnt have hesitated we live for seconds like that nick thought of the guard of his fathers seamless affability not even a seconds pause there is no silver he said what are you talking about but i knew it was that second i showed him the report oh this he said that idiot in cryptology he keeps getting the names wrong there is no silver so i went along with itwhat else could i do i waited for the next one of course it never came so one day i took a report back to the secretary and said casually you know this ones no silver whens he going to deliver again and the old cow smiled that little superior smile of hers oh josef ivanovich reads those himself so there it was but what why not let me see them i was reading everything else we used to crosscheck the reports to verify information when we could evidently these didnt need verification josef never said a word i would get him drunk talk about the old days but never a word the others yes how carlson used to bungle the meetings lots of stories then one night he said something interesting we were talking about the cochrane woman that was wrong he said which surprised me i thought he was talking about her being killed josef wasnt the squeamish type his hands were never then he said you cant run things that way the postman shouldnt know anyone she knew me i said thinking id catch him but he just shrugged it off from the newspapers he wagged his finger at me i remember i always said stay out of the newspapers scolding me a joke so we laughed but all i could think was she knew somebody else silver nick said yes it had to be no one else was that important maybe schulmanhe was a talent spotter he would have known names but he had a different contact not in washington she never knew him it had to be silver no one in the old network was worth protecting not that waykilling somebody josef wouldnt talk about him they were still protecting him even from me what made him so important his information they were rightit didnt need verification no guesswork no mistakes nick glanced over you got this from one report no i saw others i told you i followed him nothing lasts forever in the service including josef he was a good man too as far as that went his problem was he was from the old days all the way back to the comintern when people believed in things he didnt grasp what it had all become just smoke and mirrors and perks if you knew how to work them which he didnt what happened to him i dont know we never asked you never asked does that seem strange to you you see how long ive been here you have to live through the terror to understand youd hear the cars the next morning no one would say a thing even the neighbors it happened in my building once like a plagueno one wanted to touch the sick you went to work you went about your business after stalin died it was different but who knew for how long it was always better not to ask so we didnt people justwent away he paused and lit another cigarette coughing slightly once a whole hockey team the ws national heroes that was vasilys pet projectstalins son a drunk vasya ordered them to fly to kazan in a storm on a politburo plane no less it went down but there were no disasters in the soviet union not even natural ones so no publicity they just disappeared the whole team no one said a word he drew on the cigarette vasya he said scornfully his father was always cleaning up one mess or another he tortured people i heard for the practice but what could they expect given the father they had to wait until stalin died before they could send him away then he disappeared too his voice had begun to drift an old mans ramble away from nick and nick saw now that he would never know his fathers other life even the palace gossip was as chilling and remote as whispers from outer space we were talking about your boss he said yes josef another victim but in this case also an opportunity now we had alexei somebodys nephew a kid he didnt even know where the files were josefs secretary ran things when he let her he was suspicious of everybody well he was right to be suspiciousbut he trusted me an american defector id be the one person whod never have his job so i helped him among other things i told him that the silver reports were supposed to come to me no one else of course it was his department now and if he felt it would be better to change the procedures he didnt he brought me the first one himself like a puppy so i followed silver who was he his father shook his head you never figured it out neither did hoover but i knew where hoover showed me where hoover strange isnt it to end up on the same side we were both looking for him and he helped me a small smile a twist of history you see i thought it had to be somebody i knew the mind plays these funny tricks when you dont know where to look you turn things over and overyou suspect everybody everybody your best friend why not he took my wife or your housekeeper he nodded even nora imagine the best one was welles himself just the kind of elaborate bluff the comrades would like he stopped and shook his head so much time wasted then hoover showed me i got some of silvers early reports the ones josef had kept to himself and thats when everything began to fall into place after i left hoover went on another witchhunt this time internal right through the bureau now that was interesting he had never done this before at least that we knew so how did we know now i studied those reports over and over you see wed never been able to crack the bureau and now here it was details how he was turning the place inside out what he was thinking not lowlevel informationsomeone close to him and everything else began to make sense the access everywhere not just one department the personal informationwho else had files like that why he had to be protecteddzerzhinsky would have done anything to keep someone close to hoover a prize and that hunt for hoover to go after his owni know what thats like its always the worst fear in the service a renegade agent someone who knows now it made sense why it was so hard for me to track him the others theyd reveal themselves one way or the other you cant imagine the mistakes they dont follow their own rules sometimes by accident even their own names or their colleagues but silver was different he was a professional careful nothing to indicate where he was but when hoover knew then i knew too he was there our man in the bureau if it hadnt been for hoover i never would have known where to look but you said theres always a pattern to the reports yes a certain style but never how he knew the others they made regular reports even when they had nothing to report but with silver months would go by no unnecessary risks then when he had something thered be several in a row all complete then nothing again you had to wait when he stopped i didnt know it for months i kept waiting but he was gone what do you mean he stopped no reports no documents it got to be a year thats a long time i thought he was dead or hoover had finally got him and covered it up what else the others were all gone one way or another he had a long run longer than most people get caught or die schulman carlson now silver it was the logical thing you dont retire you know you did nick said i wasnt in the field his father said smoothly just an office worker with a pension in the field its different you keep going until something happens but he was never caught we would have heard that he had to be dead but he wasnt no i didnt know for years of course i wasnt in a position to know they reorganized the department again i had other things to do but i could still hear the gossip and i never heard anything then how do you know hes still there the secretary again what was her name youd think id remember pani knowitall she finally retired just before christmas they gave her a party he caught nicks surprise they have parties you know just like everyone else a big one this time toasts all night sturgeon for a secretary maybe they wanted to make sure she wouldnt come back anyway they invited all the old crowd those of us who were left this was here no in moscow i was there at the time why its not important nick he said impatient at the interruption anicka had to go im not in prison im allowed to travel thats right i forgot you have a medal yes he said quietly a medal all the privileges they gave the secretary one too not lenin he added quickly as if it mattered just a service medal she wore it all night pinned here he put his hand on his chest she was glad to see me sentimental you know how those things are the good old days my god the good old daysberia we saw the best of it she said nonsense like that tears even with the drink so what can you do you play along it wont be the same without you i said i wonder if she thought i meant it i suppose so what else did she have then a room somewhere out in sokol her medal you were the last and she nods the cow yes yes we were the last she takes my arm all tearsi thought she was going to kiss me now theres only silver she says he never stops i remember she had my arm and it jerkedi couldnt help it i thought he was dead i said him she just shook her head miss knowitall again not him hes too clever for them not like the ones they have now amateurs not like the old days as if it had been different then he said to nick what did she think we were i cant believe it i said all this time she patted my arm like a child yes just like before she said just like before they dont retire him and i knew then shed been forced outshe wanted to die at her desk i suppose in the saddle nina that was it her name he smiled to himself as if remembering it had been the point of the story and was he nick said still there oh yes i checked i still have some friends insidei saw one of the reports she was right it was the same same style same name so i knew he was operating again hes still there nick the one who sent me here and now i know how to get him not hoover me nick waited but his father seemed to have finished why are you telling me this so you would know its not just for me in case he hesitated i didnt know if you would do it for me nick felt the soft words like a slap in case do what i told you i need your help to come out you cant be serious yes its possible what am i supposed to do hide you in a trunk and drive across the border no his father said steadily i would never put you at risk never you believe that dont you i want you to take a message thats all thats all nick repeated dully something for your country his father said call it that you were a soldier you were willing tonow just take a message i can expose silver its important do it for that not for me nick was quiet following his fathers logic sort of a patriotic act he said finally his voice unexpectedly sarcastic one for our side yes one for your side and whose side are you on now he meant to provoke unable to stop himself but his father just shrugged sides we both lost this war what was it all aboutdoes anybody know like the statues hussites catholics no one remembers what war youre living behind barbed wire his father shook his head its over look at us here all those ideas panslavism only twenty years ago now look there are half a million troops in czechoslovakia were at war with ourselves no idea survives that and america communists in the state department now communists in asia they dont know its already over were fighting our children now thats how its ending for both of us nick said nothing surprised at the outburst what had he been like young before everything turned to disappointment then let it go make peace i cant his father said quiet again i cant let it go for me its personal his voice picked up ironic but for you a spoil of war for your side i owe that much nick lowered his voice sensible you cant go back you know its impossible no his father interrupted its possible i have it all worked out i can make it worth it to them is it worth it to you to go to prison theyre all still there welles all of themnixons the president for gods sake there was a communist in the state department you do you want to go through all that again i wont go to prison he said calmly im an old man aside from anything else theres the statute of limitations that ran out a long time ago anyway i was never charged with anything whos going to charge me now the witchhunts are over nobody wants that again yes they do you were a spy you said so in public and now theyll have a bigger one brandnew it can work nick im not asking them to roast a fatted calf just make a quiet deal they will it wont be quiet nick said seeing the flashbulbs maybe theyll like that who knows nobodys ever asked to come home nick felt the sinking sensation again the almost jaunty selfimportance the old game one for our side brass bands and bunting but that was now a country of the imagination as distant as an old grudge maybe it happened like that maybe after all the years of dingy streets and bad clothes america began to be a dream he didnt know hed been forgotten theyll never let you go here he turned to nick thats the risk but i can do it ill come see you nick said a last try its easy for me you dont have to risk anything we can start over his father was quiet i dont want to die here nick not here he placed his hand on nicks arm a reassurance not a plea all worked out well talk more he said patting him take that next turning by the plum tree the tree heavy with blossoms had scattered white markers over the onelane road nick thought of hansels pebbles leading deeper into the forest a mile later they forked onto a narrower dirt road dotted with mud puddles its almost time for lunch his father said glancing at his watch i didnt realize what kind of message nick asked still absorbed not now his father said quickly as if they could be overheard and nothing in front of anicka she doesnt know nick said no it could be dangerous for her why does she think im here i wanted to see you before its too late its natural yes nick said flatly a cover story shell be worried his father said she worries when im late chapter they were in the garden hammering in stakes for tomato vines anna wore rubber boots and workers overalls which had the effect of making her look even broader her hips ballooning out like churchills in his siren suit nick thought of his mother at the embassy party slim and glossy molly holding the stakes had rolled up her jeans and taken off her shoes playing peasant in the mud they had clearly been at it for some time their faces damp with perspiration in the humid air molly waved at the car and grinned and he felt her smile like a wakening hand at his shoulder something real again her hair piled on her head fell down in wisps around her face but the back of her neck was clear as white and vulnerable as a childs she seemed too fresh for the tired countryside with her freckles and american teeth anna wiped her hands and started over to them her face tentative and somehow relieved we started before the rain comes you had a good trip she said to walter glancing at nick yes perfect his father said easily not answering her real question here let me help you with that no no you sit ill start lunch she treats me like an invalid you are an invalid and you always expect rain he said smiling she looked up at the cloudy sky unimpressed by the patches of light breaking through then leaned against him to take off her boots holding on to his upper arm for support there are left a few she said to nick handing him a hammer you dont mind your father should rest sure nick said automatically staring down at her feet surprisingly small and pale is there beer his father said for you anicka he drawled a mock pout she giggled goodnaturedly and turned to the house it was small ordinary stucco with wooden shutters and sills but placed at the top of a rise so that the lawn in front looked out over the trees to a field beyond the landscape was unremarkable not the dramatic rolling hills of virginia but the trees enclosed them in privacy a rusty gas tank at the side a stack of firewood like the one at the cabin where they used to hide the spare key a tiny tool shed in the back a spigot with a green plastic garden hose attached curled in a pail beyond the muddy driveway woods to keep out the world they came every weekend having fun he said to molly as he reached the garden you cant imagine gidget goes to prague she said careful of the beans he sidestepped a row of tiny green seedlings you had a good trip annas question with the same edge nick hammered in the stake we went to theresienstadt the concentration camp my father seems to think its a tourist attraction the germans go molly said simply pretty amazing when you think of it she moved to the next stake how was it with your father i mean fine he said then i dont know one minute hes the same then the next i cant get a fix you know when youre adjusting binoculars its fuzzy then its clear then its all fuzzy again like that why what did he say she asked curious nick moved away from it its not what he says itsmaybe hes just getting old i never thought of him as old i dont know why of course hed be old whats she like not old she doesnt miss much her english is better than you think shes nervous about you why nick said quickly well why not here she is cozy in her garden and you drop in the longlost son she wants you to like herits natural natural his fathers word yes he said again so smile a little she said pretending to be airy you look like youve just seen a concentration camp she stepped back from the last tomato stake there thats done just in time looks like soups on she nodded toward the cottage door where anna was waving to them she had changed the overalls for a skirt and blouse and nick noticed that her hair was brushed back all tidied up i hate soup nick said absently youd better like hers molly said she sprayed her feet with the hose and stamped them dry on the ground taking down her hair and fingercombing it while she slipped into her loafers involuntarily nick smiled both kotlar women seemed determined to make a good impression and in fact lunch was pleasant the round dining table set near the window corner of the room was draped with a crocheted tablecloth anchored with a porcelain jug of fresh wildflowers across the table anna had spread plates of pickles and hardboiled eggs and salami arranged in pretty concentric circles nick glanced at the larder shelf just like the one in their old cabin but filled here with glass jars of cucumbers and tomatoes and beets a garden preserved all year in vinegar and dill he looked for the rainyday snacks of his youthpeanut butter and saltines and cans of tunabut this was a serious pantry with real food to last a season anna ladled some form of borscht beet red from a decorated tureen and poured tall glasses of beer did you do all this yourself nick said to her indicating the shelves she nodded in the winter its difficult for vegetables we are fortunate to have the garden difficult nonexistent his father said carrotsthats it of course the americans have lettuce once a week the car goes to germany the lettuce run sometimes they share with their friendsthe british the czech staff everyone in prague knows someone who can get a german cabbage from the americans but anicka doesnt like to do that she thinks its disloyal he said playfully not disloyal illegal ruzyne for a salad no ruzyne nick said the airport a prison his father explained nearby same name then smiling at anna where they put you for groceries in the summer its different anna said ignoring the tease we have cherries down below plums for jam jam nick said to his father remember the time mom tried with the blackberries it had slipped out before he could catch it and now it hung there an embarrassment but anna smiled your mother was a gardener too a figure of the past no she said it would ruin her nails a halftruth making her seem frivolous why had he said it to make one feel comfortable at the expense of the other but molly was rightanna didnt miss much and sensing his discomfort she examined her hands and sighed its a price yes she was right i think but look how we eat his father said pointing to the array of pickles anna can make anything grow a magician oh a magician with peasant hands thats the price for the planting thumb green molly said green thumb yes anna giggled green thumb englishwhy do you make it so difficult you should try czech molly said anna found this funny or chose to and laughed and nick suddenly saw her as she must have been bright and attractive before weight and time had drawn her face closed when had they met did they have jokes together nick thought of his parents laughing downstairs after the guests had gone he had been looking at anna as a kind of nurse dispensing pills and telling his father to rest now he sensed a different intimacy not a nurse a wife who broke her nails pulling weeds so improbably they talked about gardens about temperamental peas and what to do when the squash came in as if the morning with his father had never happened at all anna passed plates molly asked the names of things in czech small talk a conspiracy of cheerfulness he found himself slipping into the easy familiarity of a family lunch where nothing important was said because everything was already known he sat back listening to his fathers voice telling stories about the neighbors feeling oddly at home it was the last thing hed expected here maybe things really were the same everywhere fresh produce aside the room had been dim when theyd first come in but now he could see it clearly and his eyes moved lazily from the pantry shelf to the sitting area the usual heap of books next to the couch the side table with the order of lenin in its velvet box the shelves on either side of the fireplaceno not a fireplace a wood stove but framed by the same kind of shelves he glanced toward the record player in the corner then back to the couch facing the easy chairs each glance like a snapshot he stopped it felt the same because it was the same the desk under the window with its portable typewriter the table behind the couch for lamps and messy piles of books even the radio on the windowsillall the same for a moment the slipcovers and crocheted doilies annas touches disappeared arranged exactly the same all of it his father had recreated the cabin nick stared at the room half hoping to see the fishing poles near the door and sank back into the old photograph did his father know or was it a longing so unconscious that even furniture fell into place just part of the natural order of things hed never left and what about anna did she fall into place too curled up on the sofa with a book in his mothers spot maybe she liked it maybe she didnt know she was living in someone elses house did you have a place in russia nick said clearly a question out of the blue because they all looked at him surprised he hadnt been following their conversation in the country anna said yes a dacha small like this we had to bring everything with us you can see the condition so old but new furniturewho can get it of course your father didnt mind men she said to molly they like everything the same hmm molly said like dogs anna laughed again covering her mouth with her hand a girl afterward nick helped with the dishes while molly and his father sat out in the sun in fading canvas chairs like the ones in green park his father had taken another beer from the tiny fridge hiding it from anna and winking at him they worked at an old pedestal sink anna slipping wet plates into the drying rack nick wiping and stacking she seemed preoccupied uneasy now that they were alone as if the others had taken the high spirits of the lunch table with them how did you meet nick asked to break the silence meet she said surprised at work she brushed it away like a fly she took a second then turned to him her hands still in the water hes very ill did you know yes he told me its not good for him to be excited he doesnt look very excited nick nodded toward the lawn chairs trying to be light he is she said flatly to see you she hesitated when he told me i was afraid that you would quarrel so many years but its all right isnt it she looked at him more than a question yes its all right he smiled no quarrels you think im foolish to worry like the mother hen but i know him all this month hes waiting what if he doesnt come but i did yes she turned back to the sink your mothershe didnt object he glanced at her i didnt tell her he said cautiously not offering any more ah anna said you thought it would upset her still i dont know she never talks about it she nodded to herself like valter she said translating his fathers name making him foreign hers never of her only you then unexpectedly shes a woman of fashion it was another trick of language the archaic phrase wrapping his mother in gowns and powdered wigs a figure in a fragonard swing nick smiled i suppose she thinks so anyway there it was again the easy disloyalty yes i saw photographs beautiful i was maybe a little jealous she said shyly jealous anna laughed when we get old we become invisible to our children but we still see he was in love with her i think that was a long time ago nick said embarrassed did she want to be reassured this thickwaisted woman with her hands in the sink sometimes its easier to love a memory in life things change what would zdenek be like now i wonder sometimes who excuse me my first husband it was a long time ago she smiled echoing nicks words he was killed in the war no when the germans first came they arrested him they arrested all the communists another life closed to him more than his fathers wife why had he thought she had no history so to me hes always young like then now what would he be an old man at the cafe slavia arguing politics well who knows we change she turned and dried her hands on the towel her eyes soft and concerned even your father sometimes you know when a memory comes to life its not what we expect you dont have to worry nick said i dont expect him to be the same she shook her head no him what does he expect all these years he sees you as you werenot a man not different and then she reached over and touched his arm youll be careful you wontexcite him nick looked down at her hand you didnt want me to come he said simply she sighed the wicked stepmother no its good for you to see each other but perhaps valters right i am always looking for the rain why now what does he want nick moved his arm away afraid of the question but she had her own answer i think hes getting ready to die so this meeting but im not ready for that we have a life here not rich notfashion she said almost spitting the word quiet but you dont know what it means to have this what it was like before she shopped turned back to the draining board picked up a kettle and held it under the faucet for a minute the only sound was running water im not trying to upset anything nick said lamely no she said quickly excuse me such foolishness how happy he isyou can see it in his eyes so maybe its good there was a popping sound as she lit the gas ring two days thats all nick said as if they were bargaining for time she nodded go talk to him ill bring the tea she glanced out the window a caretaker again its too much beerhell fall asleep but he was animated talking with molly in a patch of sunlight in the lowslung canvas chairs they looked like a bloomsbury photograph droopy sun hats and cigarettes waiting for tea nick kp finished he said youll make someone a good husband what do you think molly she looked up at nick hmm a catch i was telling molly about when they took down stalins statue here in petrin park crowds kept comingcheering you know so they had to do it at night but you could hear the dynamite way over holeckova all those years and he still wouldnt go quietly chair molly offered but nick sat down next to them on the grass whats down there he pointed to the clump of trees below where the mist is water what we used to call a crick his father said smiling at the word theres always mist here all over this part of europe its the cloud cover i think no wind unless the fohn comes up from vienna then everybody gets headaches maybe it explains the politics molly giggled and freud his father shot her an appreciative glance yes and freud maybe it was the weather all along he lit a cigarette so nick what will you do now a fathers question innocent after lse molly turned to him frankly curious larry wants me to go back to law school well he would and you nick shrugged well see all the time in the world his father said well why not of course someday youll have to earn a living the tone so unexpectedly paternal annoyed nick maybe anna was righthed always be as he had been a child larry settled some money on me he said bluntly his father was quiet for a second did he that was generous i told you he was a catch molly said but this time his father ignored her what do you want to do work with wiseman he leaned back smoking of course its the great subject to know what happened you know when i was your age i thought history waswhat sweeping forces he said his voice ironic we were all swept along playthings a dialectic yes like that the clash of forces something almost abstract and then then i suppose biography i saw the effect of one man what if there hadnt been a stalin would things have been the same no utterly different what if hed never existed who anna said coming out to them with a tray stalin she hesitated then handed his father a mug and two pills here she said as if nothing had been said the great man theory nick said great man anna said she passed out the mugs such talk she said to his father the words a kind of clicking of the tongue then she put the empty beer bottle on the tray looked at them worriedly and turned back to the house shes offended nick said no his father said she thinks the trees have ears like all good czechs someones always listening he sipped the tea at stalins funeral several thousand people died trampled in the crowd to say goodbye to the man who tried to murder them theres no one like that now molly said quietly now no petty crooks bureaucrats so much for the theory i was wrong they were aberrations the stalins great forces great mensuch melodrama and all along what was it a crime story nick looked up at him of course its interesting his father said gazing back to nick to solve the crime thats what wiseman says yes well he should know he smiled slightly maybe its a hazard of the profession he worked for the british you know sis he caught nicks look no not now during the war everybody did he must have seen plenty of crimes all in a good cause of course theyre always in a good cause even stalins who knows people thought that sometimes even the victims thought thatit gave them a reason why it was happening to them he shrugged history the air was still not even a rustle of leaves a crime story but what if you were in it when molly stirred in her chair it felt like an interruption well she said pushing herself up ill let you two figure out who done it im just a farm girl she looked toward the garden where anna was digging then up at the clouds id say about an hour if were lucky they watched her move across the grass waving to anna shes a nice girl your molly my molly she likes you his father said simply a matchmakers tease that caught nick off guard in spite of himself he flushed dont complicate things a girl like that is never a complication your mother had it that spirit she doesnt have it now he looked down anna had been right they were quarreling but his father sidestepped it saving nothing he put his hand on nicks shoulder stroking it lightly the way he used to when they sat together on the dock waiting for fish do you still go to the cabin he asked idly no it was sold his father nodded so every trace then the hand stopped just a weight now will she see me do you think why hadnt he thought of this before yes he said theyd all see him his mother staring out of windows larry whod patched up their lives all the carefully constructed years where would they meet in the apartment nick tried to picture it the tentative first words but nothing came and he realized shocked at himself that he didnt want it to happen he didnt want him to come back splintering things again the old dream and now that it might be real like the weight of his fathers hand he wanted to shake it off walk away but the hand was there pulling him his father leaned back and sighed id like that he said dreamily what will i say a conversation with himself where do you start i dont know how to start with you what do you like for breakfast what do you read it seems silly doesnt it not to know these things nick didnt say anything his father too seemed to retreat from the day closing his eyes against the weak sunlight nick could hear anna and molly talking in the garden a faint insect buzzing anna doesnt know nick said what we talked about this morning no i told you no one its too dangerous for her why dangerous if they thought she helped he let the thought hang what about molly molly theres no danger to her what does she know that i wanted to see you thats all he said drowsily its good she likes you it looks better you took a chance with her no i checked what there are not so many americans in prague we know who they arethe embassy staff the journalists we watch to see if they recruit czechs so theres a list i checked shes not working for them a love affair he smiled his eyes still closed at that age theres always a love affair she was safe you were the chanceif you would come but you did i knew it doesnt matter you see all the rest of itwhat you like for breakfast i knew you would come nick looked over to the garden at mollys face fresh and guileless a security check just in case in his fathers world suspicion hung over everyone like the permanent cloud cover then a new thought who keeps a list nick indulgent to a child we have our people too thats the way it works but how exactly nick thought maids in the embassy repairmen going through desks somebody nursing a drink at a bar all ears like marty bielak his father frowned who an american he lives here he was at the bar in the alcron bielak his father said evidently remembering you talked to him no he talked to me dont worryi didnt say anything just a tourist is he one of yours well a winchell his father said dismissively a legman he collects itemsdo they still call them that items he worked for the radio then his wife left last year when people could go out so now hes a legman to rehabilitate himself i suppose i met him once hes a believer for him still the workers paradise then why does he need to rehabilitate himself nick said slipping into the language they wont trust him now unless she comes back of course anyway better avoid himyou dont want to become an item but is it useful what he does it gives them something to read what else is there rude pravo nick said nothing and in the stillness that followed he could hear his fathers faint breathing he looked over at the closed eyes the lined face smoothing out with sleep he had drifted off with a cigarette still in his hand and nick leaned over and gently slipped it from his fingers taking a puff himself familiar like sharing a toothbrush a lazy afternoon but nothing was peaceful here not even the torpid landscape tense with rain he looked toward the garden where anna was planting why bother soon it would be overgrown abandoned but she didnt know if they thought she had helped he felt the cigarette hot on his finger as the thought swept through him stiffening him with dread she didnt know because she wasnt going his father was going to leave her walk away from this life the way hed walked away from theirs leaving everything behind only this time it would be nick on the other end in the phone booth thats what he was being asked to do he let the cigarette fall staring ahead not trusting himself to look at his sleeping father the same crime all over again he saw his mother weeping on the sofa but anna wouldnt be rescued by a rich man shed need to be rehabilitatedto denounce him make them trust her he watched her work bending and straightening unaware and he could feel the heat in his face we have a life here but it would go too the dim cottage and the jars of food whatever peace theyd managed to scrape together how could he do it but how could he have done it the first time nick got up and moved away from the chairs the lawn sloped west into the sun and for an instant he wondered if he could keep going all the way through the barbed wire until he was home in prague they kept reminding you they were west of vienna molly had told him as if their history had violated a logic of geography it was forty fifty miles to the border not far he could simply walk through but his father needed someone to help a small favor a message and then it would never stop one step after another until everyone was swept up in the turmoil again not history just his fathers endless mistake as he reached the trees he could hear the sky begin to rumble a sound effect he followed the path down to the water pushing past bushes until the house was hidden behind him out of sight he stopped what if the message were never delivered a small betrayal for everyones sake he started down again with something like relief it was that easy stop it finally his father would never know but hed wait expecting a call some signal thats how it would end waiting wondering why nobody came the way nick had waited could he do that to him i dont want to die here nick the water was a crick just as he had said channeled by a low bank nick picked up a few small stones and began throwing them into the stream listening for the familiar plops hed have to tell him not let him waste what life was left here dont excite him anna had said but which was worse you cant expect me to do this but his father had expected it sure of him so hed sent for him finally that had been the point all along not to see him to get an accomplice he threw another stone staring at the ripples just a boy at heart molly said behind him he turned surprised her voice bringing him back you never see little girls throwing rocks but boys can do it for hours now why is that he smiled i dont know we used to pretend they were grenades here try it she took a stone from his hand and pitched it then shrugged nothing it must be one of those throwback things you know from the caves when you were out there hunting and we were home stitching hides she paused anything wrong he shook his head my father fell asleep pretty exciting isnt it life behind the iron curtain i dont know my father used to spend the weekend watching golf on tv compared to that its a hoot he threw another stone hows the garden shes starting dinner it takes hours apparently whatever it is i suppose i should help boil nettles or something god knows what little treat shes cooking up this time she stopped now why am i being like this shes nice its justi dont know a little strange different anyway i feel like im meeting the inlaws and i havent even been asked out yet he smiled at her will you go out with me oh she glanced up at him soon she said light again then she turned to the water and in the silence that followed he felt her mood shift like a faint stirring in the heavy air want to tell me whats going on the two of you were thick as thieves he wants me to do something for him i dont think i can then dont she said quickly trying to be casual what is it smuggle something out its usually that letters and things they call it the tourist post no he but she swung around suddenly holding up her hand no dont tell me really i dont want to know its better just dont do it the urgency in her voice caught him by surprise dont do anything he nodded still surprised waiting for her to go on but she turned away god i wish we could go she said go his own idea thrown back at him a lifeline drive through the fence before anything happens like what i dont know nothings going to happen we could you know she said just leave tomorrow we could do that stupid danube boat if you want anything she turned we could start over the words made him look at her an unexpected twirl of the binoculars he saw her freckles suddenly clear not complicated she raised her head and held his eyes for a moment couldnt we he touched her arm an almost involuntary movement and nodded would you like that she said her eyes still on him there was a streak of dirt on her forehead left over from the garden he nodded again but not on the danube no she leaned closer where she said her voice low they stood for an instant not moving and then it was too late the rain came all at once no first drops just the sudden burst of a punctured water balloon shocking them into place they looked at each other startled at being wet then molly catching the water on her face started to laugh nick took her hand and pulled her under a large tree they stamped their feet shaking themselves christ nick said he picked at his shirt sticking coldly to his back molly shook her hair then leaned against the tree her breasts showing through her blouse she smiled not here i guess they were both gulping air as if theyd been running and he stared at her for a second watching the rise and fall of her chest then moved nearer to the tree isnt that what they do in the army she said cold showers he leaned down rubbing his hand along her face slick with rain its what they advise he said his mouth almost touching hers but the rain had broken the mood she pulled back well whats got into you she said but pleased still holding him we dont have to start over before dinner the grounds dry he bent forward again she reached up putting her hand to his face were a little old for this rolling around in the mud she moved aside shaking her blouse is that what you used to do he said watching her what in my hippie days she said airily no i like it better in a room whats so special about a room you will too promise she grinned i guarantee it then she looked up at him serious theres plenty of time now that youve asked me out okay ill get us a room he said she rubbed her hair between her hands mm with hidden microphones her eyes widened a glint of mischief i hadnt thought of that whats that like do they listen you know if we make noise she stepped over to the edge of the dry area facing the rain should we make a run for it theyll be worried beyond the first few feet the woods had become a blur a few drops were coming through the leaves overhead now but the leaky tent held shutting everything else out not yet stay a little she glanced at him a little time out she said softly she walked over to him got a cigarette he took out the pack half dry and lit one then handed it to her isnt this what were supposed to do after she looked away everythings backward isnt it maybe were ahead of ourselves she shook her head a weak smile now too were ahead of ourselves molly its all right hes why youre here ii just came along for the ride thats all he said she looked up at him her eyes caught i thought so she took a drag on the cigarette anyway its too late now lets just get through it two days but no tourist post okay no letters they look for that you dont want to end up in a czech jail its not that oh i thought she stopped short waiting now he looked at her they had started together a bar in london he wants to go home what as if she hadnt heard had missed a joke what are you talking about he wants me to arrange itto get him out are you crazy maybe he is but thats what he wants he cant be serious you think theyre going to let him out its not the kind of trip you make twice he thinks he can she took a breath nick listen to me dont get involved with this i mean it you dont knowits different here i dont have to do anything here just deliver a message she looked up at him to whom then she looked away as if she had overstepped tell him to deliver his own message go to the embassy or something he cant you know that why not maybe they have forms for defectors i wouldnt be surprised she stopped im sorry its just too crazy why would he want to hes sick molly he wants to go home to jail he wont not now home free she said with a hint of sarcasm what makes him think anybody wants him back he looked away maybe nobody does she said nothing for a minute watching him you do its what youve always wanted isnt it she shook her head i dont believe this hes my father i cant just leave him here he doesnt belong here nobody belongs here the czechs are stuck thats all so is he she walked back toward the rain folding her arms over her chest how is it supposed to work anyway swap him for one of theirs i dont know yet i dont think he wants me to know he seems to have it all planned hes crazy you dont go back you just dont its a oneway thing and what if he could and i didnt help he said almost to himself so youre going to i dont know i do i can tell look i dont want any part of this it doesnt involve you thats right she said sharply i just came along for the ride she looked up at the leaves dripping now with rain closing in on them well youre full of little surprises today no wonder youre all excited nick to the rescue god he still thinks he can get away with it he didnt get away with anything its a long time twenty years to live like this for something you didnt do she glared at him a sudden inexplicable anger is that what he said hes not a traitornot the way you think really how many ways are there he looked at her surprised at her tone whats wrong him everything i cant believe hes doing this hes sick i know hes sick she said quickly why do you think i came i thought thats what he wantedto tell you about her you know a little confession so good for the soul id finally get to hear it from him she looked at him all right from you why not i wanted to know how it happened how what happened ask him before you start all this im asking you he cant go back nick he killed her he thinks they dont know but they do theyve always known he didnt kill her she nodded he did though he was there in the hotel room its in the police report you can see it for yourself he was there hes lying to you nick she turned to him still want to get him out then she stepped out into the rain and started up the hill without looking back the storm went on all afternoon trapping them indoors and nick retreated into a kind of hangover wariness afraid that the smallest gesture might give him away while he waited for his head to clear around him they busied themselves with the usual motion of a rainy day a fuss was made about their wet clothes exchanged for dry upstairs annas old slacks and sweater hanging loosely on molly a child playing dressup his fathers fitting him comfortably uncannily like his own he watched his father make a fire in the wood stove poking at the kindling and then they were in their usual cabin places his father in his rocker sitting opposite molly curled up in the corner of the couch with a mug of tea nick looked at the coffee table half expecting to see the sunday paper folded open to the puzzle a pencil lying across the filledin blocks what did they used to do play hearts read now they talked not free to withdraw moving words like pieces in a board game to fill the time molly avoided him chatting lazily with anna afraid to meet his eyes what police report but the presence of the others the makeshift family made it impossible to talk about anything he wanted to know they picked at conversation strained like old army friends who think they want to see each other but have only the past in common what they should see in prague what it was like last august when the tanks rolled in everyones trace memory the almost comic surprise of the soviet soldiers expecting to be welcomed dodging stones finally anna got up to start dinner leaving an empty moment of silence where did you go that night nick said suddenly the night you left his father looked at him surprised by the shift that night he sat back as if he needed to refresh his memory to canada there was a ship i went to detroit its easy to cross there we had to go all the way to philadelphia to catch the plane in case i was recognized at national so unnecessary that long driveit took hours i remember because of the snow the roads were still slippery there had been a lot of snow yes nick said remembering footprints hours we almost missed the plane i remember i was dying for a cigarette id forgotten my lighter and the driver didnt have any matches can you imagine a russian who didnt smoke finally i made him stop at a gas station outside baltimore he went inhe wouldnt let me id be recognized by someone pumping gas in baltimore he shook his head it never changes nick could feel molly stir beside him on the couch sitting erect watching his father i mean in washington where did you go in washington in washington his father said puzzled new york avenue i suppose we took the baltimore pike he picked me up out back and we took the pike so it must have been new york does it matter you didnt stop anywhere no he said easily of course not we were in a hurry he knew the roads would be bad we could have had an accident the way he drove how different everything would have been but he didntwe made it does it matter to you he said again all these details yes but his father eluded him lost now in other details telling stories beside the fire i remember the ship my bunk anyway i couldnt go on deck the crew wasnt supposed to know i was there they locked me in nothing to read no air a cell i never knew what they were carrying grain pig iron maybe who knows nick leaned back listening then i got seasick so they let me out for the air it was freezing you had to hang on to something or the wind would knock you over but at least it was outside the crew pretended i wasnt thereit was dangerous to ask questions in those days i dont know who they thought i was i ate by myself the captain had a little english but nobody else i dont think i said ten words the whole trip he paused i had a lot of time to think about what you your mother what would happen i still thought i could work things out that youd join me i suppose i thought it would be like yalta not so bad pleasant when it got calmer not so rough i began to enjoy it a little something new the way you feel on any trip id never been on the ocean before at night the sky he broke off anyway none of that happened it was just the first cell but i didnt know that then they put you in a cell he smiled faintly house arrest first for the debriefing then for my protection it was worse than the ship in a way that town i could walk around like on a deck but the air wasnt as good and of course now i wasnt going anywhere i was already there why did they wait so long before they let you appear the news conference it was like the ship they didnt know what to do with me nobody knew what stalin wanted he never trusted foreign operatives never to him they were something from the old trotsky daysinternationalists real communists were russian he was a peasant people thought he was some kind of statesman because they saw his pictures at the conferences but he had a local mind a little like welles in fact he said smiling slightly amused at the comparison never trust a foreigner and i think he liked the game let the americans wonderwas i there was i dead why give anything away if it might come in handy later he could afford to wait i wasnt going anywhere if he hadnt died his father paused but that changed everything now they wanted to show us off me the english they wanted you to think spies were everywhere and of course it worked how many of us were there three four not so many and welles had everybody looking under beds but the only one he ever found got away at least i had that satisfaction he found two molly said nicks father looked at her as if noticing her for the first time yes two he said quietly and nodded and she got away too molly said just in time nick felt it the edgy disturbance in the air but his father seemed not to notice i saw the paper on the ship the captain got it before we left canada to give me something to read i dont think he had any idea who she was why i kept looking at it so you had that satisfaction too this time his father caught it unmistakable a piece being moved into place he looked at her for a second unsure why he was being attacked and his voice when he answered was patient calming a willful child no i never wanted that never is that what you think none of it would have happened she said evenly if she hadnt started it another piece she didnt start it welles did do you think i blamed her didnt you no he paused at first yes of course but i never wanted her dead somebody did molly said in the silence nick saw his father hold her eyes debating yes he said finally somebody did the answer rattled her not an admission an invitation to join sides in the open but not you she pressed why would i his father said calmly by that time it didnt matter what she said i was gone why would i want such a thing a terrible death like that but so convenient not for me he said checking her for everyone molly said no more names it must have been a relief for everyone i guess except welles she was his only witness not so convenient for him he stared at her waiting then moved unless she was going to change her testimony his voice so reasonable stopped her she looked at him surprised as if he had turned the board around why would she do that its possible it would have been the easiest thing to do its what i would have advised if id been handling it his father said a lawyer walking her through it she thought shed recognized me but now she wasnt sure it might have been somebody else she couldnt swear under oath she wouldnt want to do that make a mistake shed been so nervous when they first talked to her he broke off looking at molly who had sat back letting him lead she was young you know younger than you are now they were already worried about her communists werent supposed to be young and pretty not real ones she was just an impressionable girlthey took advantage of people like that she didnt know what she was doing and when the committee first talked to her she panicked but now anyway she could have done it of course hed still have her but what was that worth you didnt get elected by locking up salesgirls not when you promised a conspiracy if he could lock her up he knew about her but how much enough to convict im not sure she might have walked away and that would have ruined everything made him lookunreliable no conspiracy so maybe it was convenient for him with her gone the smear would standid always be guilty at least in the press which is what mattered the court of public opinion always his favorite you dont have to prove anything there you can build a career on it but then i got away so he ended up with nothing he glanced pointedly at molly that was the only satisfaction molly said nothing turning it over and nick saw that his father had shifted things again that the story just the possibility of it was a kind of reproach of course well never know what she intended to do his father said molly looked at him steadily still examining the brief but why do thatto save you no herself then why go to welles in the first place she was his witness he looked at her curiously but she didnt go to him he went to her she wasnt an informer you know did you think that he said then shook his head she wasnt the type it was welles he hounded her until he got a name yours yes mine one if shed been a friendly witness shed have told him everything she knew why volunteer if you werent going to talk look at bentley orwho was the other one coplon they couldnt stop she never wanted any of ityou could see it in her face she was afraid of him she made a bargain and then she saw it wasnt a bargain hed never let her alone with that press she was all he had he had to keep squeezing once he knew about her how did he if she didnt tell him nick asked his father nodded as if theyd finally arrived well thats the great question how did they know about anything hearing after hearing where did it all come from if you throw enough mud some of it sticks molly said but how do you know where to throw where did welles get his information he turned to nick what does wiseman say fbi files usually yes usually hoover our own dzerzhinsky helpful to a fault as long as someone else took the credit which of course they were eager to do welles the great inquisitor or mccarthy when he was sober where would either of them have been without those files there was plenty of mud there to go around and hoover supplied it molly said skeptically i said usually there were other sources subscriber lists donations sometimes they got luckythe mud would stick but the bureau was the best it was all there its not easy to set up a police state which is what they were trying to do it takes time files secretaries field agents legmen he said glancing at nick a whole organization i know a little about thisits the one thing the comrades are good at the committees didnt have those resources who were they lawyers football players another glance at nick politicians not detectives you have to remember the scope of all this the hearings were only a part of it most of the time huac was operating as a personnel agency giving information to employers a vetting service to make sure you had the right people god knows how many they ran checks on about sixty thousand nick said roughly roughly his father repeated taking it in he looked at nick i see wiseman think what it means the work involved and that was just huac not the senate committees the state committees all of them looking for information so they could run their own circus people didnt ask where it came from maybe they thought welles dug it up all by himself but where else only the fbi had that much those were hoovers committees mccarthys especially but welless too hoover fed them and then when it suited him he cut them off the trouble was they didnt know what to do with the stuff mccarthy for gods sake welles always shooting from the hip and never hitting anything disappointing the horses edgar picked he paused but it came from him how molly said fascinated now the usual ways hoover had to be careful the leaks were illegal for one thing a small point but there was his reputationnot a small point he couldnt be seen to be leaking information sometimes the field offices would help the local police then they could pass it off as their detective work sometimes a journalist would be tipped one of the friendly ones with the committees it was usually more directthat was helping the government after all but in this case i think it might have come directly from himhe was close to welles and this was sensitive the sort of thing he liked to handle himself he might not have wanted anyone else to know even in the bureau but does it matter the fact is they did know about her but how did you ever wonder why it started with her thats always been the strangest part of the whole business she was the last person in the chain whod be under suspicion she wasnt in the government no access no history you didnt have to pass a security check to work at garfinkels why investigate her she should have been at the end of the trail the small fry you round up with the others but there werent any others they never connected her to anybody except me so what led them to her how did they know to go after her molly said nothing so nicks father answered for her somebody told them thats how it all started all of it thats what i thought about on the ship he said looking at her then he sighed finished i still think about it dinner was roast pork and dumplings whose lightness anna demonstrated by slicing them with a string stretched taut between her forefingers czech style but which then sunk back heavily in the thick gravy molly picked at her food quiet and withdrawn no longer interested in playing cat and mouse with his father instead she talked to anna complimenting her on the elaborate table setting old china swirling with painted flowers spread across a stiff white tablecloth embroidered with gold thread its all i kept from the house in bubenec my mother had three closets just for the linens and dishesshe prided herself on her china all the women did of course they had maids so different then you know i never cared about these things when i was a girl it was just the way we lived now it seems so beautifulit reminds me i suppose of that life we had a large house a villa a music room even a greenhouse in the backwe always had flowers but that was before the war is the house still there oh yes but my father was killed so we had to leave the germans took it my mother lost everythingall those closets but she kept these they were still talking about the world before munich all parties and piano lessons when they heard the car in the driveway the rain had gone leaving only the sound of water dripping off leaves and in the quiet the engine seemed a roar sputtering then stopping unmistakably there to stay anna raised her eyes her fork stalled in midair and nick saw that she was looking at him in alarm he would have to be explained the day so placid and ordinary had become a guilty secret even here safe in the country she was always expecting a knock on the door his father seeing nicks face smiled dont worry berias dead he got up and went over to the window peering through the curtain frantisek he said then to nick a friend its all right what does he want anna said still uneasy a drink what else his father said lightly opening the door but frantisek had already had one he was a bear of a man tall and bearded and when he entered the cottage stooping to get through the door his eyes had the wild shiny look of drink he stopped for a minute weaving slightly disoriented by the unexpected strangers and the formal table then spoke to nicks father in rapid czech without language nick watched them as a silent movie forced to follow the story through gestures he didnt mean to break up the party no no it was all right come sit was something wrong more czech annas hand flew to her mouth in dismay like lillian gish no his father said then more czech placing his hand on frantiseks shoulder at this the tall man leaned into him a sentimental embrace anna got up then went over and led him to her chair as if he were too upset to find it by himself he looked at nick and molly and nick saw his father introduce them friends from america he said in english at once a courtesy and a signal to nick the man nodded too preoccupied to be curious and the czech began again a volley of questions anna shaking her head his father slumped into his chair placing his hand on frantiseks anna brought out a bottle some kind of brandy and put it before him with a glass then noticing nick and molly she said im sorry his brother has died no telephone the man said to them in accented english waving his hand to take in the cottage apparently apologizing for having come nicks father poured him a glass then some for himself a suicide he explained to nick but the man understood the word and covered his forehead with his hand and nick saw his eyes moisten when he spoke in czech his voice was deliberate almost without inflection so that again only the gestures meant anything molly got up and began to clear motioning to anna to sit down and nick excluded from the low murmur of czech retreated into the solemn politeness of funerals his eyes fixed on the emptying table the painted china removed piece by piece until there was nothing between them but white cloth and the amber bottle the drink made frantisek moody and finally silent until he sat staring at the table too ill make some coffee anna said frantisek answered but nicks father said to him in english nodding toward nick english yes excuse me you dont speak czech nick shook his head its better czech for bad news very expressive the eskimos have the words for ice but we he poured two more glasses what do you say valter we have the words for bad news yes a look of disgust he took a drink his father turned to nick his brother was a writer a writer under dubcek a writer then poof a tram driver for husak he was fired from the writers union his father explained so he had to work on the trams thats the kind of job they give you an embarrassment so people see they make you eat their shit frantisek said to fill your mouth no more words he glanced at his glass then youre quiet so there is his brotherhood of slavs you remember that he believed in that were slavs theyre slavs who else is there the germans now look at him a writers movement his father said to nick a text gloss you like prague frantisek said suddenly the opening hopeless question its beautiful nick said the expected answer yes beautiful for tourists the germans used to come not so many now but what was he supposed to answer that it was sad and dingy that the crabbed suspicious life inside the lovely architecture depressed him a judgment no guest was allowed to make america frantisek took another drink and looked up at nick you were in vietnam yes nick said embarrassed expecting the usual arguments the usual averted eyes silent accusations arent you ashamed yes good frantisek said slamming down the glass kill the bastards all the communists nick said nothing too surprised to answer was that really how they saw the war here a world away from america turned now on itself maybe their suffering had brought them finally a simple myopia there were no other politics but theirs franku please anna said anxiously putting down a coffee cup here drink but he had already turned from nick back in his grief they took miloss book he said to nicks father the notes everything do you know what they said it must have affected his mind now hes a suicide too just like masaryk the pigs thats what they said to me there must be a copy his father said how something like that on film his father said simply its easy to hide on film nick looked at him curious but his father misinterpreted his interest he was writing a book on jan masaryk he explained his death its still a controversy here how he died yes masaryk frantisek said you know about masaryk in america yes nick said to be polite but in fact who did anymore a forgotten name twenty years ago a famous leap from the czernin palace that was the end of the republic a national heros funeral pictures in life in the west a murder no one could prove and everyone forgot but here evidently still an open wound a reminder of the world before like annas china he couldnt hide the book frantisek said everyone knew what he was doing last year when they opened the case even the police wanted to help him everyone wanted the truth about masaryk last year now they wont even let you go to lany no flowers his grave his father said to nick the family grave not far from lidice were a country of symbols here its a way to talk to each other last year people started taking flowers there a shrine now that would be an embarrassment to the government too czech so they put an end to it people remember frantisek said vaguely his words a little slurred what did he mean when they opened the case whos they the governmentthe old government dubcek one of the first things he did was order an investigation into masaryks death its time to know the truth he said of course the russians werent pleased they knew what it meant another symbol you see its twenty years ago his father looked at him yes but a crime like thatto know the truth can be a political act nick looked back reading the code here he said like masaryk frantisek said again lost now in drink is that how he did it molly stood behind him a dishtowel in her hand like masaryk out the window no pills his father said then to frantisek he felt no pain you just go to sleep its the best way frantisek nodded the best way such talk anna said nick looked at his father had he ever thought about it those years now were a story a walk around the boat deck but what had they really been like bad enough to wonder a glass of water before bedtime you just go to sleep masaryk said the window was the housemaids way out his father said a servants death hah thats good the housemaids frantisek said those fools did they think we would believe it that hed go like that he took another drink he thought he could work with them like milos our clothes must be dry molly said excusing herself the two men kept staring at their glasses nick listened to the sound of molly on the stairs anna rattling the dishes in the sink ach frantisek said finally out of words tired of it all he poured again from the bottle clearly determined to pass out now nick could hear the clock neither of them seemed to notice when he got up and left the room upstairs a low room under the pitched roof molly was brushing her hair already changed finally alone we should go she said casually nodding toward his clothes hes here for the night look at me whats going on nothing a sharp tug of the brush everythings lovely a perfect weekend stop it he said angrily then lowered his voice why are you hounding him what police report she glanced at him then picked up her bag not now lets just go she said softly ill help anna finish up nick sat on the bed for a minute frustrated looking around the room a heavy crocheted bedspread like a giant doily a few books he picked up the picture frame on the night table his father and anna younger smiling shyly he still had all his hair they were dressed for snow bundled up standing in an empty city square moscow he wondered what the occasion was who had taken the picture then put it back their lifestill a blank to him when he went back down frantisek was laid out on the couch not yet really sleeping but no longer there his father was covering him with a blanket youre leaving he said seeing the changed clothes so soon we have to get back no no hell sleep now one more drink he moved unsteadily a little tipsy nick glanced toward the kitchen where the women were working then shrugged and joined him at the table no more anna said from the sink his father winked and poured out a glass when had the drinking started na zdravi he said raising the glass slightly and nick drank trying not to cough as the rough liquid hit his throat his father said nothing just looked at him his eyes gentle a little clouded then he reached over and patted nicks hand his touch as hot as the drink i knew you would come he said his voice low nick nodded a few hours ago hed wanted to walk away right through the woods but he saw in the face so like his own that he could never do it upstairs a stranger in a picture and now suddenly a touch hed known all his life you see what its like here his color had begun to drain a sickly pale what would he become another frantisek sleeping it off on the couch what i see is that youve had too much anna said coming over with some water and his pills she put a hand to his forehead shiny now with sweat how do you feel his father placed the pills in his mouth the movement deliberate and slow perhaps a little tired he said quietly its late nick said standing eager now to get away you should get some rest ill help you upstairs anna moved toward him no ill take him im all right his father waved his hand a mild protest but allowed himself to be lifted up and led by the elbow across the room nick followed him up the stairs then turned down the bed as his father began to undress his body was bony frail and nick looked away you see what its like his father said again i cant stay here nick faced him it may not be possible you know that dont you but his father grabbed his arm clutching him no it is you think i dont know what they want i know something valuable i can pay nick looked at him dismayed there was no talking to him okay but now lets get some sleep he said a nurse well meet tomorrowill come back early the narodni gallery he began to cough go around noon he gasped trying to hold down another cough so that it came out a desperate wheeze he took off his shorts and moved to the bed naked his thin legs and ropy behind as white and vulnerable as a childs nick turned away hanging things in the wardrobe to avoid the sight of his body and when he finally looked back his father was under the covers his eyes closed his hands folded over his chest in that instant nick saw him as he would be lying in a coffin and his own breath went out of him an unexpected panic he stood holding the hanger utterly alone in the room as if hed been abandoned it was only when he saw the blanket stir a faint rise that he could move to the bed and lean over to arrange the covers his father opened his eyes and smiled nicku he whispered he reached up to smooth nicks hair back from his forehead the old gesture now you tuck me in nick nodded feeling his fathers hand slip back are you all right now he said his father smiled closing his eyes as snug as a bug in a rug chapter the drive back was long slowed by patches of lowlying fog and wet mist that condensed on the windshield forcing him to lean forward to make out the road occasionally tiny lights appeared in the darkness like fireflies coming out of the woods then joined the halting stream of cars inching toward prague he hadnt expected traffic in town the streets had been almost empty conduits for trams but here in the country he saw that the cars had only been in hiding parked in secret pockets of free weekend air molly was restless fiddling with the heater then turning the radio knob to scratchy bursts of czech that faded in and out until fed up she snapped it off and stared out the window he could feel her next to him bottled up wanting to talk but not knowing how to start he fixed his eyes on the road where there were only red taillights not old men with stories a frail arm reaching up to him from the bed now she was rummaging through her bag pulling things out as she dug deeper crinkling paper then finally extracting a thin misshapen cigarette dont say a word she said lighting it just dont she drew on it deeply and the smell of dope filled the car i thought you left that in austria i lied she rolled down the window letting the smell escape into the air shivering a little at the sudden chill dont worry i just kept one for a rainy day he glanced in the rearview mirror half expecting to see police lights but there was only the dark he rolled down his window a little creating a draft what report he said finally she sighed the dc police report from the night she died i asked to see it nick looked at her just a reporter doing her job he said still angry is that the story youre writing you want to make him a killer too great he did kill her she said quickly then looked away her voice apologetic now im not writing anything i just said that then why she took another drag stalling then exhaled slowly okay she was my aunt rosemary cochrane my mothers sister thats how i knew who he was youre not the only one who she stopped looking over at him i know i should have told you i was going to and then things changed and i thought let it go whats the good shes dead why upset everything let him take it with him and all the time here he is packing his bags nick said nothing too stunned to reply im not writing anything she said again it was personal thats all for a minute there was no sound but the swish of the tires then she reached over and handed him the joint a peace offering want a hit she said and suddenly he did a piece of the world theyd left at the border he extended his right hand eyes still on the road and felt her place the joint in the v of his fingers he drew on it aware of the quick glare at the tip then held the smoke in his lungs they passed it back and forth still not saying anything until he felt it grow hot in his fingers keep it he said im driving he saw her place the end between the tips of her fingers and finish it with sharp intakes of breath there clean she said flicking it out the window feel better no but i will she said give it a few minutes but he could feel it already moving through him with his blood relaxing and buoyant at the same time he eased into it letting his mind drift with the mist on the road god molly said leaning back in her seat that dinner he said nothing listening to another conversation inside his head its interesting the way he does it she said slowly does what tells the story its all there isnt it all the way to canada everything but the first stop nick let a minute pass watching the road were you close no i never knew her i mean i must have known her but i dont remember we never talked about it you know the one unforgivable sin but what was she like well lets see also born bronxville she wanted to be a singer really an opera singer a band singer you know nightclubs and things she had this pictureone of those professional pictures they put in delis best wishes to mel like that shes got this big smile and a flower in her hair all set you know i never heard that she actually sang anywhere though she probably just did it to freak out my grandparents nightclubs i mean pretty radical it was in a way she was always doing that of course it wasnt hard with them my grandfather got on a train in the morning and walked through the door at sixtwenty every day of his life they wanted her to go to manhattanville where else and when she went to nyu there was this big fight and the next thing you know shes waiting tables for money anddo you really want to hear this nick nodded of course i got most of this from my grandmother so consider the source she still blamed nyu right to the end all those undesirable influencesthat was the phrase anyway there was aunt rosemary waiting tables and being influenced funny isnt it in a way my grandmother was right i mean that must have been when shebecame political became a communist you mean nick said saying it if she was an actual communist in the party they never said that she stopped talk about splitting hairs then what happened then she dropped out of school and went to washington she was a secretary for a while i think during the war and thenwell the rest you know except we dont no she said thoughtfully i used to think about it the way kids do we had this box in the attic you know with the mel picture in it and id go through it making up stories about her then i put the picture up in my room and my mother had a fit i suppose she thought id turn out the same way what a communist no mancrazy she always thought that was the start of all the trouble what made her think that oh theres always a man she waved her hand she had to tell herself something the more she didnt talk about what happened the more it was there you know when she told me when they sent the suitcase back the one she had in the hotel i guess the police took it as evidence and then months later out of the blue they delivered it and my mother had to explain it to me she just sat there crying and i guess that must have upset me her crying because thats when she told me what was in it nothing you know just overnight stuffcosmetics a nightgown nothing it was the fact of it and because theyd torn it all up the lining was slicedi guess they were looking for secret messages or somethingand they never even apologized she just sat on the couch with this beatup bag and that was her sister what was left of her and a nightgown nick thought planning to spend the night a bag packed to meet someone anyway that was rosemary molly said public enemy part of the communist conspiracy remember that in school i thought they were talking about her and i used to think i know one but you dont have to worry about her she turned herself in except she didnt according to him but why would she nick said brooding the others who talked they were all tied up in the politics of it you know you lose one faith and you replace it with the opposite and then the opposite has to destroy the first they really did believe a conspiracy was threatening the country because they used to believe in it themselves so in some crazy way it was their duty to expose it now that they were on the other side but that doesnt sound like her at all not from your description how many nightclub singers have a problem with apostasy she looked at him the helpless beginning of a smile you know ive never heard that word used before in speech only in print is that how its pronounced you dont want to talk about this she shrugged i dont know what to say maybe she had political convictions i dont know what are they anyway what would you do to stop the war besides rallies and things suppose there was a way what would you do name names maybe it wouldnt seem like much if you really thought they were the enemy maybe youre rightmaybe she didnt care about any of that i dont know maybe she just wanted a little attention anyway she got it she paused while he was on his way to canada you still think hes lying she said nothing as if she had to think about it then sat up and reached for a cigarette yes he watched her light it her movements stretched in time by the dope now i know it how remember that drive in the snow all the little details how he was dying for a smoke but he left his lighter behind so so they found it in the hotel room thats where he left itits in the report he still doesnt know i was watching he probably still thinks he left it at home she turned to him he was there nick how do they know it was his they didnt use these she said indicating the disposable plastic lighter in her hand they had real lighters with initials wk and ok he said softly she looked at him puzzled my mother it was from her she was always giving him stuff like that he stared at the road that still doesnt mean he was there have it your way how else would it get there somebody could have planted it do you really think thats likely she said quietly no he remembered it in his fathers hand shiny always with him like the wave in his hair he was there she said an end to it that still doesnt mean he killed her i dont believe it you mean you dont want to do you want to no but that doesnt change things she paused biting her lip in thought ill give you this though i sat there and i thought could he really do that it doesnt feel right how is it supposed to feel i dont know threatening but hes not no whatever thats worth maybe thats how they get away with it they stop believing it themselves so theres nothing to pick up on killer vibes i know it sounds stupid but there should be something a little radar blip you know a little ping a little ping she looked at him then tossed her cigarette out the window and slumped down in her seat burrowing in youre right its stupid i mean he was there we know that its just what she shook her head her lover i cant see them together nick was quiet following his own thought a blip across the screen they werent together he said finally sure he was devoted to my mother yeah so was mine every time he came back anyway i dont mean him i mean her he wasnt her type not i dont knowflashy enough nick thought of him changing upstairs the pale slack skin no hes not flashy still people change no they dont by the time they got to town they were alone again the other cars had melted away into the dark edges of the city as mysteriously as they had come the streets were deserted wet cobblestones cut by the bumpy tram rails whose metal caught their headlights and gleamed back at them through the mist dim pools of yellow light from the street lamps it was finally the prague of his imagination kafkas maze of alleys and looming towers spires poking suddenly through the fog they drove along the river hradcany somewhere off to the right then turned into streets where nothing was visible beyond the reach of the cars lights and still lulled by the dope nick felt that he had begun driving through his own mind one confusing turn after another going in circles how could anyone live here when they reached wenceslas the empty lighted tram that appeared clanging in front of them seemed to come out of a dream the parky stalls were closed but the alcron was still awake the doorman leaping from the bright door as if hed been waiting for them the lobby was empty nick saw the bellhop and desk clerk glance up the drug was wearing off leaving only a pleasant tiredness and now the familiar sensation that everyone was watching them for an instant he stopped then smiled to himself they were being watched it was what people did here did they notice he was walking slowly then the bellhop yawned and he saw that his cover would be exhaustion it was only eleven but everyone seemed ready for bed a long day pan warren the clerk said handing him the key not so nice for karlovy vary the weather was he checking up or only being polite you took the waters nick looked at him blankly but molly said why do the glasses have those pipestems pipestems ah like a pipe yes to drink in for the minerals you see to get past the teeth otherwise they would stain ah molly said well goodnight the desk clerk smiled and bowed at them satisfied that was good nick said as they crossed to the elevator its the only thing i remembered about the place those funny little glasses thank god now he can put it in his report our day at karlsbad nick stopped but it wouldnt be true i mean just because somethings in a report there it is in black and white but we were never there molly looked at him for an instant then lowered her eyes but the lighter was how can we be sure ask him their room was stifling the heavy drapes drawn tight and while molly ran her bath he opened the windows then lay on the bed in his underwear feeling the cool night air move over him his body was tired but alert and when he closed his eyes he could hear the sounds around him with a sharp clarity water splashing in the tub the bells of the late trams below carried in by the mist disconnected like the sounds of ships at night he went over the day putting it in order as if the chronology would tell him something in the report what if all of it was true none of it why would he lie or was it the usual mix the halftruths of things left out or just forgotten but which then he was in the cottage bedroom his arm gripped caught snug as a bug there was a shaft of light from the bathroom when she opened the door and he squinted at her wrapped in her thin robe toweling her hair her movements were languid almost swaying are you asleep thinking about what she said idly moving toward the window when he didnt answer she said okay a penny a czech crown about what its like for you when you see him i mean if you really think he he trailed off not able to say it whats it like for you i dont see what you see he paused i cant leave him like this whatever hes done i thought i could but i cant but thats me you dont have to go on with this not anymore she stopped still holding the towel to her hair you want me to leave dont you you must hate him all of it i didnt know why keep it a secret no wonder you didnt want to she looked at him is that what you think you can see what its going to be like youll just get more involved with someone you think she stared at him for a second youre a real jerk sometimes you know she said softly he looked up at her im not involved with him im involved with you a beat are you he watched her drop the towel then heard the faint rustling silk of her robe as she came toward the bed she ran her hand along his bare leg stopping at the knee dont think so much okay she said moving it up to his thigh stroking why dont we finish what we started before you started thinking she looked toward the stirring in his briefs and smiled what are you doing he said unable to move paralyzed by the hand making slow circles on his thigh im seducing you before you throw me out she leaned close to him and shook her head slowly no more secrets okay he closed his eyes as her fingers moved across his pouch lightly grazing his balls to the inside of his other thigh then both hands were stroking him moving up along his waist she took the elastic band of the shorts and with elaborate slowness started pulling them down want to help he raised himself slightly from the bed a reflex and felt the shorts slipping out from under him his erection springing free look at you she said then ran her fingertips under his scrotum he could feel the delicate scraping then his penis swelling harder as her fingers moved up along the shaft wrapped around the base in a slow pumping motion still want me to go she said gripping it gently so that the tip seemed to get even harder full to bursting not with that in your hand she moved up onto the bed straddling him then leaned over and her robe opened filling the air with the smell of soap and bath oil he reached up to touch her breasts warm and smooth and then her open mouth covered his and he could feel her hair around him still damp from the bath as if they were back in the rain she drew a breath kissing him lightly and he moved his hands behind her rubbing the silk then pulling it up in folds until he could feel bare flesh she arched back resting on his hands and drew the robe off tossing it on the floor her breasts swaying heavily as she moved molly sshh she put a finger to her lips then pointed it up at the ceiling corner she leaned down and whispered big brother remember to his surprise he felt himself grow harder an unexpected erotic kink he could hear their breathing the faint ringing of the trams outside and he imagined someone cupping headphones straining aroused then she bent down to kiss him and he lost the room again moving his hands over her skin wanting to touch her everywhere still on her knees she lowered her pelvis to him and he felt the scratch of her hair along his prick it brushed over him slowly back and forth wiry and delicate until every part of him was waiting for it sensitive so that he thought he might come just from the touch of the hair then a little lower he felt the wetness start beneath the hairs the moist skin moving over him slippery as quicksilver until his penis was slick with it ready to explode before hed even entered her too soon he rolled over pinning her under him her eyes caught the faint light shining and when he looked into them they stopped for a minute no longer playful and grew wider as if her whole body were opening up just us she whispered grave and trembling then took his head in her hands drawing him down he kissed her then moved his lips down along her throat to her breasts sucking them gently making it last feeling the nipples grow hard in his mouth before continuing down wanting all of her his feet sliding off the bed as his head went lower along her belly when he heard her gasp in anticipation the sound itself was exciting make noise drown out the trams the static in the headphones everything he was there he kissed her inner thighs gently barely touching the skin moving steadily toward the crease between her legs then rubbed his face lightly across the hair breathing her in she shivered a kind of physical noise then moaned out loud when he started licking the edges of her crotch long upward strokes wetting the hair his tongue moved toward the top of her slit teasing it then using his hands to part the outer lips he touched her clitoris with the tip a series of light flicks until he felt her move under him drawing him closer he lowered his head and placed his tongue between her lips parting them with one long stroke then back again resting for a second at the top then back until they were both moving in a rhythm her body rising to meet him moving against him her cunt was wet now as wet as his mouth and he licked deeper sucking rolling her clitoris between his lips then burying his face in her as she seemed to stretch wider no longer secret the wonderful pink skin all open to him when he stopped then began the slow long strokes of a new cycle she moaned again and grasped his head trying to stop him and move with him at the same time soft she whispered but when he licked more lightly a wet kiss she didnt want that either and pulled him harder into her until he was buried again and her body squirmed around him her breathing had become a kind of ragged pant and he felt she was close now and moved up again covering the top of her slit and tonguing it from below a constant stroke come with me she said out loud gasping come with me but when he moved up onto the bed and slid into her his mouth still wet with her he could feel her walls clutching him a tremor and before he could move she was already there coming around him with a cry her body heaving he lay still for a second feeling her the moist inside now just part of his own body permanently attached then slowly began to move drawing himself almost to the edge of her lips before sliding in again her vagina already sensitive continued to ripple against him like aftershocks urging him and he began to go faster adjusting his rhythm to her she gasped out loud a gift to the microphones and he could hear the squeak of the bedsprings now drowned out when his head had been down inside her and their breathing even louder keeping pace their strokes audible a slapping of wet skin the room alive with noise as if the sounds themselves were racing about to come she clutched him and he felt her spasm again but now he couldnt stop thrusting on top of her orgasm trying to keep it alive so that when finally he spurted into her they were both shuddering afterward they lay curled up quiet his prick soft against her bottom his arm flung over her protecting her from the night air that crept along their bodies drying the sweat neither of them moved and he lay surprised by the stillness wondering what had happened there was none of the odd embarrassment he usually felt after sex the impulse to cover himself find his clothes and go now there was only an easy familiarity as if they had finally run out of secrets and could lie here naked forever everything known an old couple she turned and traced a finger along his face reading it like braille wiping the wet from his mouth look at you she said softly he reached over and brushed the hair back from her face smoothing it taking her in i like your freckles he said lazily i used to have more you did uhhuh you lose them as you get older like hair she said touching his bare temple careful she smiled her eyes catching the dim light i was right wasnt i she kissed him lightly then snuggled closer she reached down to pull up the covers but he stopped her no i want to look at you then close the window im getting goosebumps where he said running his hand along her hip but he got up and went over to the window closing the pane but keeping the curtains open to the street light i love the way it jiggles she said from the bed looking at him how does it feel when it bobs around like that little he said he stood by the bed for a moment his eyes moving along her body oh she said turning away slightly from his gaze dont i feel soexposed no secrets he bent over and kissed her breasts feeling her shiver when he opened his mouth on her she was already dressed putting on lipstick at the mirror he felt the air on his behind jutting out of the tangled sheets and covered himself well its alive she said what time is it he glanced at the bedside clock christ sleep well she said it must have been the she raised her eyes to the ceiling then put two fingers to her mouth pretending to draw in smoke you know what oh thats what it was what else she came over to the bed and sat on the edge touching his chest morning skin like a babys he took her wrist drawing her to him but she shook her head youll muss anyway im off where see the sights he wanted to meet you alone didnt he narodni gallery better get cracking he got up holding the sheet you always this cheerful where is it anyway by the castle take a number tram you cant miss it god look at the bed what will the maid think he grinned she picked up her raincoat then stopped nick he looked up waiting but she shook her head never mind then hesitantly its going to be all right isnt it he nodded still smiling as she closed the door in the lobby he wondered if everyone could tell read his mood like a permanent flush on his skin his face felt loose ready to break into a loopy grin but he came down outside deflated by another dreary prague sky the rain had left the city damp and grimy as if nothing could wash away its essential grayness for the first time the thought of seeing his father depressed him on the tram bottle blondes and grim faces no one talked had this conductor been someone else once they creaked through the old streets the passengers heads nodding with stolid patience dazed with routine no one had spent the night in someone elses body alive with sex when they crossed the river even the baroque stucco of the mala strana pale yellow in the sun that first day had turned dark a dirty mustard the gallery seemed to be arranged chronologically so that the rooms began in the middle ages static allegories with pudgy slavic babies and soldiers holding lances and spiked shields christ rising from his coffin his feet still dripping blood from the crucifixion nails artists painted what they saw here theyd seen atrocities a culture of occupation he looked around for his father but the rooms were empty a guard bored stared at his feet nick thought he should wait near the entrance but the room was oppressive and he moved along to the nextitalian flesh pink with light bowls of fruit what would he say today another theory of history nick found him in the room beyond staring at a picture he smiled when he saw nick and lifted his hand to touch him then withdrew it they stood there awkwardly a chance meeting in public nick glanced at the painting the fatted calf his father said following his eyes a lot to expect dont you think after all that the prodigal nick said automatically you see how happy everyone is even the jealous brother his father smiled shyly maybe thats why we have stories so things come out better he paused it means wasteful you know not wandering he wasted his inheritance his gifts well he turned to nick so you got back all right anna was worried we dont have much time he said looking at his watch im sorry theres a service for frantiseks brother i have to go it would be noticed do you want me to come a tourist that wouldnt be appropriate he said gently theyll all be there watching to write about masaryk after all these yearseverything about him is still political even a funeral then why go wont you be i have to go for frantisek he and anna were children together if we dont go its political it would mean that we knew what he was doing not just writing stories i thought everyone knew he said his father nodded now we pretend we didnt welcome to oz walk with me to the loreto its worth seeingall the tourists go the service isnt far from there itll give us a few minutes nick followed him out of the room then past the walls of impaled martyrs but we have to talk we will later they were out on the cobblestoned square dont worry ill tell you exactly what to say he reached into his breast pocket and drew out an envelope i cant carry anything out nick said flustered physically drawing away from it his father looked at him then smiled holding out the envelope no these are tickets for tonight oh benny goodman theyre hard to get everyone wants to see benny nothing changes you see nick said nothing feeling teased an evening out i didnt know he was still alive he said finally they were crossing the square toward the czernin palace there were no cars oh yes hes very popular herewere a little behind his goodwill tour youll enjoy it we can eat afterward nick stopped annoyed look i need to talk to you i know his father said putting a hand on his arm youre worried theres no need youll see he continued walking this is where masaryk was killed by the way he indicated the high palace walls in the interior courtyard they found the lighter nick said suddenly what lighter his father said still walking yours the one mom gave you now he stopped his face bewildered what are you talking about they found it in the hotel room that night its in the police report his father frowned as if hed misunderstood then looked away thinking to himself nick watched him as he stared at the ground apparently at a loss was he thinking of what to say thats interesting he said finally but not to nick working instead on some interior puzzle is that all you can say nick said thrown by his response but how is that possible his father said again to himself thats what im asking you a police report but its a mistake the fbi handled the case not the police he paused still thinking of course they would have been called first at the hotel but the fbi took it over it was a bureau case always theres nothing like that in their file how do you know his father looked up at him because ive seen it dont you think i would have remembered that why would they leave it out he shook his head its a mistake no nick said but what made him so sure its in the police report dont you understand what im saying you cant go back they know know what he looked at him again oh i see i left it there after i he paused a new idea is that what you think you tell me nick how could i have left it i already told you you dont tell me anything except what you want me to hear ill tell you again his father said quietly i wasnt there then how do you explain this i cant he looked down i dont know what it means i have to think let me know what you come up with but maybe you should think twice about traveling they think you were there the statute of limitations doesnt run out on this his father touched nicks elbow you know who was there well find him trust me the cord again pulled tighter no questions asked nick said im not supposed to know whats going on you said last night you had something valuable what or am i not supposed to know that either it would be better no i need to know what youre doing what im doing you need to trust me im not just a messenger no his father said youre the key to everything nick stared at him listen to me nick theyre not going to accuse me of anything not some old crime he glanced up which i didnt commit theyre going to ask for me theyre what how else do you think this can work a rescue mission to smuggle me out im not worth an international incident the americans would never do that it has to be a trade a quiet trade i cant escapethink what that would mean for anna i have to go legally a plane from ruzyne with the comrades waving whats the trade they can offer pentiakowsky a prize catch for one brokendown defector do you think moscow would resist such a deal why would they do that nick said trying to follow the thread why would they ask for you in the first place because you asked you and your mother a humanitarian request you came to see mei know all this secrecy but thats only for now until were ready once the arrangements start its in their interest to protect me theyll have to know you were here so the story makes sense theres always the personal element even in politics you were shocked by what you saw my health i need an operation thats true by the way i do they know that i cant get it here so the trip would have a certain appeal even to a dedicated old socialist how we cling to life so you appealed to your father the other one a man close to the president what yes to larry no one else he can make the deal arrange things ill tell you what to say the surprise of it made nick feel giddy as if a missed step were pitching him farther down larry he said trying to catch himself why larry because he can do it arrange things and hell believe you hell know its not a trick no nick said quickly not wanting to hear the rest you dont know what youre asking he cant isnt it enough to involve me he saw the mad plan spreading like a stain touching everybody i know what im asking do you think i would ask him if i didnt have to he took my family an edge finally in his calm voice a bitterness not quite put away but now thats an advantage he owes me this much one favor hell do it he paused hell do it for you and ill do it for you a link snapping shut in a chain every link already assigned its the right story his father continued not seeing nicks face fall pentiakowsky for an old spy never but im not just an old spy i have friends in high places he stopped a son in high places lucky for me but even luckier for moscow to get pentiakowsky back for a political favor a stupid tradebut americans can be stupid that way sentimental he looked at nick theyll believe you not just a messenger you see there is no story without you nick looked at the ground feeling his chest tighten his breath grow short you have it all worked out he said thinking all of us hell use all of us what makes you think larry will do it he wouldnt hes not sentimental or his boss its only the story nick for moscow the truth is that i have to give them something something valuable his father nodded more valuable than pentiakowsky then theyll do it its the only way then why would moscow let you go they dont know i have it theyll be suspiciousthats their naturebut they wont know theres no traceive been careful no one knows only you not yet no not yet nick waited his silence an unspoken demand his father looked back toward the open square then wet his lips an old mans nervous gesture im going to give them what they always wanted names in america i have a list and documents he saw the dismay in nicks face i have to pay nick you dont get a fatted calf not in real life what else do i have and what happens to them the people on your list his father shrugged theyll be replaced then it begins all over again but meanwhile you get silver nick finished his father shook his head not yet but they can lead me to him one of them theres a pattern you see people dont change theres always a pattern if you can find it and you did i think so his father looked at him carefully then said you disapprove theyre your people my people he said almost scornfully yes agents expect it you know sooner or later somebody always gives it away what do you want me to say nick that its not a dirty business he looked away it never seems so in the beginning you just think youre doing the right thing like a soldier but in the end his voice drifted and nick followed it down the gray street unable to look at him so you do want me to take something he said quietly the documents no of course not i would never put you at risk i told you that anyway theyre a passport for me i take them then how will larry know that all this is for real his father looked at him curiously as if nick hadnt been listening because its you hell believe you nicks chest already tight seemed to clench further not just a messenger you see how importantthat no one know just the fact of it that such a list exists is dangerous for me his father paused now you are you trying to frighten me no protect you ill tell you what to say when you leave not before just in case who larry should contact no one else just the principals he must understand this everyone talks on both sides but if we move quickly before your names can run for cover you mean nick said your chips no he said cut by the edge in nicks voice before the leaks there are always leaks before he knows i wouldnt be safe here you wont be safe there either theyll know it was you that depends sometimes its better to let people stay in place for a while to watch them his father nodded or turn them its been known to happen come play on our side nick said evenly your choice nick do you know them the people youre going to sell no that must make it easier yes it does he looked at nick steadily your scruples are misplaced he said his voice cool a kind of reprimand then backing down nick its the only way he turned wanting to bring it to an end walk with me ill be late nick stared at his back the familiar hunch of his shoulders then took a step pulled along and what if they dont leave them in place then what happens what youd expect the usual scurrying i mean what happens to you your life wouldnt be worth like the old comintern days send someone out to deal with me not anymore ill be all right once im there and if youre wrong he smiled a little never bet against yourself nick nick glanced up recognizing it his old rule of thumb when they played cards at the cabin that sort of things a little oldfashioned even for the comrades ill be all right if we move quickly how quickly larrys in paris you know at the peace talks he wont be able to just drop everything to negotiate for me yes he will nobody wants peace but theyll want this i dont want it nick thought so clearly that for a second it seemed hed said it out loud but his fathers face eager full of plans registered nothing and nick looked away before it could show on his own the one betrayal his father did not expect and was it true maybe it would be different later when it was over maybe it was this he didnt want the plotting and covered tracks looking over his shoulder the tired city gray expecting the worst then why wait he said suddenly an escape hatch i could go this afternoon this afternoon his father turned to him so soon whats the difference nobody knows im here anyway but they will later theyll check visa dates the hotel it has to look right it wouldnt make sense your coming for a day thats not a visit he stopped besides i dont want you to leave but the sooner we just in case in case what in case dont bet against yourself nick said no but sometimes he paused again in case it goes wrong he finished at least we have this time he put his hand on nicks shoulder its not so long for a visit ill show you things a weekend parent offering treats nick nodded embarrassed how could he go but before he could say anything else make an excuse that would play he saw his father look past him he withdrew his hand alert v alter jak se mate nick turned anna his father said but it was another anna broader and short slightly out of breath from climbing the hill she said something in czech but his father answered in english no we have ten minutes ill walk with you an american he said nodding toward nick an explanation for the english i was showing him the way to the loreto dobre odpoledne nick said offering his hand nick warren how do you do anna masaryk masaryk my uncle she said automatically smiling a little at his surprise for a second he was jarred as if she had stepped out of history straight from the death scene in the czernin courtyard over the wall but she was no older than his father someone you could meet in the street you heard they took miloss book she said to his father now it begins all over again how many years this time all that work maybe he kept a copy what difference theyll never allow it now they dont want us to know you know his father said consoling me i always knew but to prove ittheyll never allow it theyre afraid of the truth she caught nicks glance and said excuse me youre visiting prague then nick saw her look quickly at his father and back again as if there were something she didnt understand had she noticed the resemblance hes just been to the narodni gallery his father said before he could answer now the loreto a tourist ah yes theres a very good goya i hope you saw it nick nodded hoping he wouldnt have to describe it what goya were they going to talk about art of course the best are in the prado but this is very good its lucky that we have one perhaps one day youll see the others nick said in madrid the woman looked at him wryly i doubt it its not allowed to go there oh nick said stumbling well perhaps when things are looser again it was never allowed not since czechoslovakia doesnt recognize spain his father said helping its still considered a fascist state oh said nick feeling awkward another wrong turning in the maze the old categories still current like masaryks death everything was yesterday here no one had moved on im sorry so am i anna said for the goyas youre staying in prague long no only a few days perhaps you would come to tea if you have time a casual invitation to a stranger in the street yes if i can nick said vaguely ducking it valter you bring him i never see you anymore well have a salon was she trying to find out if they knew each other its good to speak english she said to nick you can tell me about the new books i like to keep up but its so difficult now well well be late tomorrow then if you can valentinska street its in the book but of course valter knows she took his fathers arm goodbye his father said shaking nicks hand acquaintances i hope you enjoy the loreto nick looked at him waiting for some sign but his father avoided eye contact and moved off with her an old couple on their way to a funeral they reached the corner and then his father stopped and walked back i told her i forgot to ask your hotel he said quickly theres somethingthe police report how did you see it well how a friend got it for me nick said his father nodded to himself thinking was it a copy you know a carbon i dont remember why they turned everything over to the bureau but if they kept a copy that would explain it why they have it does it matter its there but not in the bureau file it doesnt make sense he shook his head if they found the lighter what happened to it it would have been evidence something like that so why didnt they use it you were gone nick looked at him maybe they will they still have it did they i dont know all i know is they found it or said they did in the hotel room his father said to himself my lighter yes the one with your initials but how did it get there he said frustrated like someone searching for his glasses well thats the question yes his father said slowly preoccupied again if i could remember his eyes narrowed in concentration lost in his puzzle over his shoulder nick saw anna masaryk still waiting on the corner im staying at the alcron he said his father glanced up then nodded and turned without a word the way old people hang up the phone without saying goodbye their part of the conversation finished nick watched him go his head bent in thought until anna called something to hurry him and he was back in his czech life offering her his arm almost courtly then they turned the corner and nick was alone now what unexpectedly he had the afternoon but he didnt want to see anything not the loreto and its famous chimes he wanted it to be over he stared down the empty street when he heard the footsteps behind him he froze had someone been watching the steps grew nearer then passeda man in a long winter coat glancing at nick out of the corner of his eye he stopped a little farther along and turned and nick waited for him to speak but instead he whistled and then nick felt the dog sniffing at his feet the man said something presumably apologizing for the dog then called and began to walk again looking back once over his shoulder suspicious nick smiled to himself relieved what if everything were just as it seemed a man with a dog a friendly invitation to tea maybe she did like to talk about books ordinary after all just a dumpy woman with a magical name maybe they were all what they seemed here except his father he turned down the hill toward the mala strana replaying the conversation in his head easier not to know them was he any different he remembered them shooting blindly into the jungle everyone in his platoon ten minutes of random fire and then the odd stillness afterward no sound at all his ears still ringing you couldnt trust yourself there either all of your senses on alert a twig snapping was enough to set them off they were lucky that day no snipers when they located the bodies one had been shot in the face his jaw blown open hanging slack with blood and pieces of bone and nick had stared at him wondering if he had done it there was supposed to be a connection the thud of your bullet hitting a body maybe a scream but he hadnt heard anything over the noise of the fire some actually claimed victims like pilots after a dogfight but they were lying no one knew it was easier later in his safe job at the base he walked around the airstrip with a clipboard taking inventory on the shipments and he would see the body bags lined up for the flight home plastic like garbage bags held together with tape he checked his list then handed in the manifest and went for a beer that easy if you didnt know them he stopped for a minute on the street near some scaffolding where workmen were replastering an old meloncolored facade and he realized he was sweating when you started thinking about it all of it came back even the heat he followed the streets downhill zigzagging as if he were shaking off a tail a real spy game so that when he reached the river he saw that he had overshot the charles bridge it was warmer near the water the trees in late bloom and he stood for a few minutes looking at the city couples huddled on benches trams everything ordinary he started walking downstream toward the next bridge could a voice be the same if it lied what did you trust a muddled story full of loose ends or an old mans hand the same touch unmistakable he stopped to light a cigarette leaning against a tree it was when he looked up blowing smoke that he saw her on the bridge she was standing with a man talking down at the water and nick startled moved further behind the tree who did she know here his anger surprised him a jealousy that went through him like a quick flash of light jiri whom she wasnt going to see again when had she arranged it this morning while he was still asleep drunk with sex nick leaned forward to see what he looked like but he was ordinary too his body hidden in a raincoat his face down a head full of brown hair anybody but theyd been to bed making private sounds holding each other afterward until hed moved on feckless why see him again now they seemed to be arguing molly shaking her head he put his hand on her and she brushed it away he took her by the arms turning her toward him saying something but she broke away stepping backward and nick realized suddenly that he had got it wrong not a meeting shed wanted she shook her head again and nick could imagine her refusal no theres someone else he felt a flush possessive there was someone else now was she as surprised as he had been maybe she was tying up her own loose ends sure now that it had happened the one thing you could trust eyes deceived not bodies when he had been inside her he had felt it a different touch just as unmistakable jiri was talking again and nick saw her nodding not looking at him then he leaned over and kissed her on the cheek a goodbye and this time she didnt resist it letting his mouth stay next to her until he was finished and turned away nick saw him reach the end of the bridge and dodge across the street not even a wave back and felt in spite of himself a last prick of jealousy just an old boyfriend but still a part of her he would never know he had moved away from the tree but she continued staring at the river absorbed and even when she looked up her eyes went past him not seeing what she didnt expect was she thinking about what to say to him later i saw jiri he imagined her voice breezy and matteroffact i mean i was curious wouldnt you be but hes just the same her face however was somber not jaunty at all and in a minute she looked at her watch and walked away should he follow her there was still the afternoon but by the time he reached the bridge she was already gone getting on a tram her secret safe she was gone for hours he lay on the bed waiting listening to the maids pushing their carts in the hall gossiping in czech youre back she said when she opened the door surprised what happened he had to go to a funeral oh i wish id known she said easily we could have spent the day together he looked at her she wasnt going to say a word why not where did you go the usual old town square the clocktower not a word she held up a tuzex bag shopping i got something for your father remy no less not cheap either even with dollars thats the last thing he needs i know but its what hell want that was nice we didnt take anything yesterday you know for a house present so i figured she smiled at him im a wellbroughtup girl you could have fooled me she grinned yeah well so youve been busy a little bee what about you have you been here all day no i took a walk down by the river he watched expecting to see her hesitate but she was fishing for something in her bag not a nicker look what else i got she held up tickets laterna magika the hit of the czech pavilion the czech what you know at expo in montreal dont be dense everybodys heard of them we cant go without seeing laterna magika yes we can no really theyre good i promise you dont you like mimes i didnt mean that he reached into his shirt pocket for the other tickets benny goodman my father got them youre kidding hes very big here so im told she sat next to him on the bed taking the tickets what time maybe we can go after anna looks like the earlytobed type she slipped the tickets onto the bed okay no magic lantern hes full of little surprises isnt he all the time what happened today nothing that was the surprise we didnt even get to talk so do you want to go out do something no nothing she leaned over him we have the afternoon let me think about it i only do it once you know what seduce you after that you have to ask he looked at her what had she really said on the bridge so ask she said bending to him when he reached up to her he was sure again the feel of her skin as familiar now as his own chapter it was late when they woke up the bed tangled again from lovemaking and they had to hurry to dress the concert hall was nearby in the new town and it seemed his father was rightthe bright doorways were crammed with people a mix of middleaged suits and young people in jeans everybody loved benny prague usually so reserved almost sullen had turned noisy and eager inside people shouted to each other over the crush passing beers along from the lobby bar and nick wondered if the high spirits themselves were a kind of defiance if simply listening to american jazz even thirtyyearold jazz had become a political act but the mood whatever its source was contagious and for the first time he began to look forward to the evening ready for a good time his father and anna were already in their seats looking slightly frumpy in the younger crowd why such a public meeting where everyone could see or was this part of the plan too something that could be verified later anna was friendly pleased to see them but his father seemed preoccupied as if he already regretted having come bothered by the noise when the lights blinked on and off no one paid any attention still talking in the aisles then the curtains opened on the band playing lets dance and there was a roar of recognition applause and a scrambling for seats an emcee appeared at the mike speaking czech then benny in english saying how happy he was to be here then the opening notes of dont be that way more applause and the evening in this unlikely place began to swing the music was wonderful it was the standard programnext the king porter stompbut the audience made it seem fresh their enthusiasm flowing up to the band with such force that nick saw some of the sidemen grin bending into their instruments to send it back you turned the tables on me with its funny innocent lyrics how many of them knew what the words meant but the music just as they always said was its own language and the audience was answering it some actually tapping their feet squirming in their seats to the beat nick thought they might leap up to dance and he saw that in the back of the hall where the bar was some of them had upstairs in the ring of boxes there were men in bulky suits party bureaucrats their wives fat and shining with costume jewelry but the crowd on the floor ignored them there were no uniforms anywhere just the music an official timeout elmers tune where the gander meandered american music the happiness of it as much a part of him as childhood stories he smiled at molly who was drumming her fingers when goodman started the clarinet lick of when its sleepy time down south the notes jetting out like liquid he turned to his father nick expected to see his face soft with nostalgia but it was cramped white and he realized that his father hadnt been preoccupied but worried even the music couldnt reach him wherever he was nick looked at him for a second wondering what was wrong then made himself turn back dont ruin it hed find out later now they were here not in some troubled past not even anymore in prague there was an intermission after avalon and he went with molly to the bar his father staying behind sitting it out the lobby was filled with smoke and spilled beer and the crowd was even more energetic than before loud with drink it took a while to get the beers then a few more minutes to find molly she was standing near the door her back to him talking to someone for a moment nick hesitated jiri again then she moved slightly and he saw that it was marty bielak why not it was his music too hello bielak said enjoying it i was nick wanted to say but just nodded handing molly her glass of course i remember the meadowbrook bielak said before your time helen ward was the vocalist then and the long island casino that was something nick tried to imagine him young skinny with a date by the bandstand raring to go the good old days nick said bielak glanced at him well the music was good maybe not the days and then wanting to be pleasant it was another time everybody danced it was always dance music you know not for sitting to think id be here in a concert hall in prague nick finished yes in prague but the music doesnt change the lights flashed the signal to return well its good you could come bielak said a taste of home eh did he really think this is what they still danced to an exiles memory stopped in time nick saw his father suddenly walking down streets he thought he knew amazed at buildings that shouldnt be there they seem to like it nick said nodding to the crowd whats not to like well its that time he tossed back his drink he seemed to be waiting for them but when nick said well just finish these he nodded and said enjoy id better get back upstairs i dont want to miss anything youre in a box nick said involuntarily with the party men a birdseye view to look over the crowd bielak smiled weakly no higher the cheap seats he moved toward the stairs cmon molly said theyre starting no i dont want him to see us a legman wait a minute the crowd had started yelling and clapping and nick heard the opening drums of sing sing sing whats the matter dont you think its funny his running into us like that maybe anyway he has seen us so whats the difference come on but he held back were their seats visible from the balcony not yet give it a minute okay so whats our cover she said mischievously want to dance can you can you in this crowd she laughed and nick took in the couples around them exuberant but awkward as if they had picked up the steps from old movies chicken she said leaning into him on the stage the brass section stood up horns blaring infectious say that again chicken she said putting her hand in his to start the movement and then suddenly he didnt care who was there and he swung her out and they were dancing his arm reaching over to turn her around then lead her back laughing at the surprise in her face how many years had it been youll never know when it will come in handy his mother had said mrs pritchards class an agony on tuesday nights the girls tall in flats to mitigate their growth spurts the boys resentful shirts never quite tucked in when am i ever going to have to know the rumba on boats darling shed said they dance on boats and the lindy another generations dance learned step by step but now like riding a bicycle all familiar and fluid so that he could do it fast molly trying to follow arm over then back finally come in handy here of all places he felt the heat in his face when the drum solo began but molly was smiling at him excited and they kept up with each other now the pleasure of the movement like a kind of foreplay that made everything else disappear he noticed vaguely that people had made space around them watching and stamping their feet but he kept his eyes fixed on her the song started its false diminuendo everything running down and building at the same time and they danced close keeping pace waiting for the break sweating wow she said laughing panting a little no you he said meaning it because he didnt dance not like this then it came the sudden loud blast of the finale irresistible and they were dancing wildly grasping hands to hold on their circle of movement spinning wider to fit the music until the dramatic uptempo crash the real climax and they hung on to each other winded while the entire hall shook with applause goodmans crowdpleaser the same frenzy the applause was for the band not for them but he heard it like an alarm clock bringing him back they were supposed to be inconspicuous not drawing a crowd he dragged molly outside the circle of people and stood for a minute against the wall catching his breath who would have thought she said smiling hanging on to him she reached up and wiped his temple smoothing back the damp hair wed better get back he said but when he looked up he saw that his father had come to find them and was standing there watching he felt embarrassed as if theyd been caught necking molly followed his gaze and turned did you see she said to his father still smiling a killerdiller his father said wryly we were wondering what had happened to you my fault molly said lightly i couldnt resist his father looked around how about a cigarette he said then to molly tell anna well be right there molly looked surprised at her dismissal but he took nicks arm before either of them could say anything and led him out the door nick felt the night air on his sweat and shivered outside yes his father said still leading him sorry we shouldnt have done that his father waved it aside a matter of no importance here he said lighting him a cigarette listen to me nick carefully please we dont have much time nick leaned against the building still sweating and took a gulp of air now what we have to make a change whats wrong he said alert now his father shook his head just listen i need you to do something for me tomorrow morning go to the train station and buy a ticket for viennayoull need your passport the berlin train at eightten you shouldnt have any trouble an american even at the last minute what are you talking about he put his hand up just listen if it comes up which it shouldnt you had a quarrel with mollythese things happen take a bag with you what youd take if you were leaving after you buy the ticket go to the mens room the one near the platform first stall on the right as you enter you leave the ticket therean accident but you dont realize it you dont miss it until the train is about to leave so you retrace your steps but you cant find it too late you dont report it but missing the trainmaybe its a sign you should make up so you go back to the hotel you do make upno need to take the train after all but leave that afternoon drive to vienna dont stay in prague any longer he paused as if hed forgotten a detail in the rush dont talk to anybody at the station thats important you dont see me not even if were alone there do you understand nick stared at him trying to catch up was he crazy you cant do this do you understand he repeated you cant just get on a train yes its the ticket thats difficult a czech would get it early with the visa no one goes to vienna at the last minute but for you its easy no one goes to vienna at all russian jews his father said they have exit visas this is the train that connects to vienna its how they leave dont worry i have papers yours someones they wont bother me once i have the ticket im all right no risk at all his father looked up at him but didnt answer when you get to vienna stay at the imperial ill contact you and dont tell anyone youre thereanyone nick dropped his cigarette and took him by the arms whats going on you cant do this he said again what if it doesnt work it has to its not what i planned nick but now we do it this way but why this morning when his father didnt answer it occurred to nick a chill like the night air that it had always been the plan not the elaborate exchange but an escape clandestine like the rest of his life drawing nick in deeper one story into another until he was on a train platform buying a ticket an accomplice no risk at all unless he was caught what about your list he said your documents had he made that up too there isnt time now but theyre also here he said tapping his head it should be enough if they exist at all nick thought now there were other papers good enough to use on a train insurance policies how long had he had them but when he looked into his fathers face he saw that the smooth confidence of the morning was gone now there was the worry hed noticed earlier something hasty and makeshift a new plan while nick had gone dancing whats happened are you in some kind of danger his father shook his head not yet i just have to do it differently not like this let me go to paris and no he said abruptly go to vienna its important nick please do this one thing for me theres no danger to you a lost ticketyou cant be blamed for that i wasnt thinking about me no his father said his eyes softening as if hed received an unexpected compliment so you understand how long do i wait in vienna if you dont show up in that case you wont have to wait at all he said almost wry again but lets hope for the best its simple nick just keep your head well be all right he paused and looked around well we cant stay here you dont want to be seen with me tell anna to come out say im not feeling well nick raised his head to speak but his fathers eyes were steady pragmatic there was nothing more to be said nick looked away ill get them just anna you stay here a little smile have another dance when nick moved from the wall his father stopped him nick he said his voice anxious then reached for him a bear hug no longer caring if anyone could see the platform goodbye they werent supposed to have he held nick for a minutethe same clutch unmistakable then pulled away what was that for nick said to cover his embarrassment for luck you always brought me luck remember sitting at his side while his father played poker with the other men watching the cards happy to be up late not always he said yes you did inside the band was still playing the hall light and warm as if nothing had happened memories of you a romantic lowregister solo calming the crowd down after the raucous opening number anna left even before hed finished his message snatching her coat an attentive nurse molly raised her eyes tired nick whispered were on our own she smiled obviously pleased and put her hand on his he drifted with the music relieved that they couldnt talk what could have happened something at the funeral this morning there had been a plan this was more like flight the bag ready at the door what had spooked him goody goody a speakeasy song fleshed out for the big band you okay molly said looking at him he nodded forcing himself to smile why was happiness so hard to fake everybody else was beaming a kind of collective euphoria this was the way his father had sat not even hearing the music he grinned in case they could be seen from the balcony the band was brought back twice and even when the curtain was down people kept clapping reluctant to leave the party they followed the crowd back to wenceslas where it spilled down the long street clumping at tram stops and the few bars still open for a late drink molly wanted to go on to laterna magikawe can still catch the endand because they wouldnt have to talk there either he went along his arm around her shoulder not giving anything away it was in a cafe at the bottom of the square off narodni street and the minute he walked in he knew it was a mistake the dark room smoky filled with shadows was the part of him hed been trying to push away they couldnt take a table without interrupting the show so they stood at the bar in the dark and nick found himself scanning the room looking at faces to see if any of them were looking back the mimes worked in front of a bright spot forming shadows against a screen like children making rabbit ears on the wall with their fingers held up to a lamp the play between the actors and their own larger shadows caused a trick of the eye a clever chiaroscuro but all nick saw were the shadows dancing then elusive sliding toward the edge until you could no longer see where they ended and the real dark began the customers sitting at cabaret tables gave off the same effect sometimes visible in the light then vanishing into the recesses no wonder the czechs liked goodman the bright lights and the simple bouncy music this was the native product all shadows a city practised at fading into doorways he went into the mens room grateful for the light a man cigarette dangling stood at the urinal so he went into the stall what if there was someone in the stall tomorrow what did he do keep going back until it was empty he pulled the chain looking up at the flush box mounted on the wall hed imagined a toilet with a back a convenient shelf where did you leave the ticket on the paper dispenser why had his father changed his mind the man at the urinal said something in czech over the plywood wall hearty maybe a joke about the effects of beer on the bladder but it could have been anything what if someone spoke to him nick just nodded to him blandly when he came out not even stopping to wash his hands afraid of being caught out by language he pushed open the door to a round of applause arent they wonderful molly said brightly theres one more set want to sit no do you really want to stay you dont like mimes here finish this she handed him a brandy ten minutes okay he took a long pull on the drink to burn away his mood when he looked up over the glass a shadow had come out of the wall we meet again marty bielak said you seem to be everywhere tonight that makes two of us well a nightcap he held up his glass where else had he been the alcron the cafe slavia the legman making his rounds items for tomorrows column just like the old days the stork the blue angel another iron curtain joke cafe society was still alive here lounge lizards and all theyre terrific arent they bielak said nodding toward the mime troupe i never get tired of them youve seen them a lot well there arent so many clubs here he took a drink standing closer i see you met one of our local celebrities prodding at the concert he didnt introduce himself insistent now close nick wasnt sure what to answer how would it be reported but bielak was waiting his lips wet with drink yes nick said finally i thought he was in moscow bielak nodded his air confiding he married a czech a bourgeoise the term threw nick some bizarre leftover from the old party meetings those hours of dialectic and selfdiscipline but bielak didnt hear it as an anachronism and when he saw nicks look he said of course not now i didnt know nick said vaguely what did he say id be curious he had leaned even closer his whole body a kind of insinuation not much how i liked the concert nick said but this wasnt going to be enough i think he was a little disappointed that i didnt recognize him too much but bielak seemed pleased yes he used to be famous you see he shook his head nobody remembers do they delighted somehow a press agent watching a falling star we have to go nick said signaling to molly so soon theyre not finished no but i am we have to be up early why had he said that bielak however was smiling amused young people he said in my day we could dance all night so he had watched was still watching one more drink was it possible he just didnt want to go home the empty apartment thanks some other time molly bielak nodded and raised his fingers from the glass in a kind of wave ill see you around he said his voice pleasant not sinister at all back in the street nick was rattled a chance meeting what if he was around tomorrow in the lobby at the station itself as they walked along the street he found himself looking to the side expecting shadows to move its simple his father had said but it wasnt a quarrel with molly who would believe it not bielak making his rounds nobody just got on a train not here why risk it all of a sudden he started picking the story apart uneasy later it was worse when molly fell asleep curled next to him he stared at the street light on the ceiling looking for microphones that might not be there you always brought me luck something was wrong and what would vienna be like more cat and mouse he wanted to turn his mind off sleep but instead he lay still with dread awake with night fears the ones that didnt even have names he shaved without running the water careful not to wake her and dressed quietly in the dim light he put a few things in the small canvas bag then crossed over to the desk and took her passport out of her purse both of them were leaving a better story no quarrel shed be late when the floorboards creaked he stopped but she didnt move a mound under the covers he turned the knob slowly so that when he finally closed the door behind him there was only a soft click in the hall a maid stared at him as if shed caught him coming out of someone elses room but he nodded and whispered dobre rano when he passed just an early bird he went down the stairs the lobby was empty but just in case he paused and took out his street map a tourist plotting his walk his head still down as he passed through the revolving door it was early just a few people on their way to work but he turned off wenceslas at the first corner and took a series of side streets to circle back to the bottom of the square nobody was following near the powder tower he caught a tram and watched out the window as it traveled back across wenceslas past the hotel the doorman yawning he walked to the university and headed left toward the station the back streets oddly seemed less safe without a crowd to hide in but he kept going one more deliberate wrong turn then a glance at the map another street and he was there the creamy art nouveau facade vaulting shed behind wilsonova street half filled now with sleepy commuters policemen stood near the doorways looking bored guns at their sides no one looked at him the woman at the ticket booth said something in czech and repeated it until nick tried his little bit of german zwei nach wien she took the passports and examined them checking against sheets in a looseleaf binder then leaned forward to look to his side evidently expecting to see molly when she spoke czech again he gestured with his hands to indicate that she was following the woman said something again then seeing his blank expression gave it up shrugging and stamping the tickets life was too short even here she took the money grumbling at having to make change pet he stared and she repeated it then grudgingly took a slip of paper and wrote pointing toward the platforms he nodded thanking her in german and moved away putting the tickets in his pocket that was it as easy as he had said he walked across the hall toward the platforms glancing around coffee stalls newspapers any station he found the mens room was there another one a man stumbled out obviously drunk still zipping his fly inside was a row of stalls and sinks urinals against the wall he stood for a minute too nervous to pee then opened the door to the first stall he couldnt leave the ticket yet not for an hour but there was a shelf easy he made a halfcircle through the hall to make sure it was the nearest toilet then bought a coffee wishing he hadnt come so early would the teller keep an eye on him the newspapers were czech rude pravo red truth he walked out onto the empty platform feeling conspicuous then sat on one of the benches near the gate where he could see both platform and waiting hall where would his father be there was nowhere to hide here hed walk straight to the mens room nick would follow in an hour hed be gone he had nothing to read and in any case english might be noticed so there was nothing to do but smoke and look at his watch a pantomime of waiting a soldier came up machine gun pointing down and spoke nick froze was he asking to see his papers then the soldier repeated it and made the sign for a match and nick grateful handed him the disposable lighter he looked at it curiously before he passed it back an artifact from the west then moved on to the next platform but whom was he guarding the hall was deserted except for the grim commuters and nick wondered what it had been like before loudspeakers announcing the overnight expresses wagonslits connecting europe now nobody went anywhere a man in a hat and a boxy suit carrying a satchel walked out on the platform one passenger at least nick followed his shoes not western maybe a businessman heading back to brno did the train stop before vienna there must be a border check a customs search rifling through the bags of the anxious russian jews too busy to bother his father a cleaning man in a blue smock swept his way nearer looking over at him interested nick got up and went to the mens room again this time he could pee he was alone he could leave it now but what if someone else found it why hadnt they set an exact time he washed his hands and went back to the bench a suburban train had pulled into the next platform and people were moving off as if they were still asleep otherwise it was the same as before the soldier circling the man in the suit waiting another man was on the platform now pacing nick sat looking from one to the other they all moved in silence almost orchestrated like the laterna magika a train attendant checking a pocket watch walked out to the end of the platform any one of them could be someone else waiting for his father two older women and a young man one suitcase who was leaving the boxy suit moved back toward nicks bench glancing over at him then circled back would they know his father by sight he used to be famous molly would be up now wondering where hed gone but he couldnt leave a note hed get a taxi back when he saw the train coming in he began to panic this was cutting it close a tenminute layover but maybe that was right a sleight of hand quick where was he there was a slow screech as the train stopped doors banging open a few people getting off handing a suitcase down through the window the people waiting on the platform began to move toward the train he couldnt just stand there had he missed him somehow he went back to the mens room maybe he was waiting the first stall was closed feet visible underneath he stood at the sink it would have to be now the whistle would go any minute if he came now nick would have to hand it to him tell him to run he turned off the tap come on and then it occurred to him that the feet were his fathers holding the stall of course hed been waiting all this time and now was late nicks fault nick darted over and pushed open the door ready to hand him the ticket a curse in czech a man his pants down around his ankles glared in surprise then yelled sorry nick said yanking the door closed he ran out of the room and stood at the head of the platform hed have to pass this way see nick not bother with the mens room just take the ticket and go nick looked around frantic then down at his watch not this close it was stupid theyd notice the boxy suit and the pacer were gone settled in the car only the attendant was now on the empty platform looking at him nick turned to the waiting hall hed be running across the room now late accidentally bumping into nick snatching the ticket before anyone could see the soldier was coming back smoking again then nick heard the whistle and jumped swiveling his head between the train and the hall the soldier looked at him the train was beginning to move there was no one near no one running nick looked at his watchwhat else did you do when someone was late when the soldier came up to him and said something nick turned his palms up and shrugged she had missed it then he turned and saw the train sliding out the attendant waving as it passed him faster now on its way to vienna he stood for a minute not sure what to do the soldier was still looking at him play it out the story was everything now hed wait for her he arranged his face concerned and annoyed as if he still expected to see someone walk through the hall he stood against the wall giving it a few minutes waiting for the soldier to move away then he picked up the canvas bag and headed toward the door away from the ticket windows his father would never be late something had happened again for a second nick was angrywhy put him through this was he supposed to go back to the hotel wait for the next plan but all this was just pushing away the dread he saw his fathers face outside the concert hall tense with worry outside he got into a taxi if something was wrong he should avoid him wait for the right time but he couldnt namesti sovetskych tankistu he said almost blurting it out the driver looked at himhad he mispronounced it or was it too unlikely a destination but put the car in gear nick lit a cigarette trying to calm his shakiness and watched the streets as they started down the hill red street nameplates on building corners indecipherable bouncing across the embedded tram rails fast as if the driver felt nicks urgency the river finally the tank at the foot of holeckova the empty traffic circle he paid the driver and got out unfolding his map and pretending to read it part of the story then the taxi was gone and he was running up the long hill no one ran in prague a workman coming down the hill scuttled to the side avoiding him flattening himself against the park wall but nick was running from his own demons now not caring the sound of ragged breathing in his ears the hill was steep and he stopped once gulping then started again out of time the apartment buildings appeared now rising up against the park slope set back from the sidewalk behind patches of banked lawns white concrete balconies with their city views hed been lucky to get one there was a black metal gate in the wall and nick hung on it jiggling the latch then sprinted up the row of concrete steps leading to the building hell in the winter slippery for old people the entrance was in the back at the end of the pavement he raced up another series of steps past some shrubs the steep apron of lawn a clump of pale blue shrub on the grass he stopped not a shrub pajamas he walked across the lawn in slow motion his chest heaving the legs were twisted probably broken by the fall the face lying on its side blood underneath a dried streak at the corner of his mouth nick sank to his knees staring he reached out to feel for a pulse in the neck but the skin was already cold then without thinking he moved his hand up brushing back the thin hair stroking the side of his head smoothing away the lines of his skin so that the face seemed to him again the one hed always known not old the same high forehead and wavy hair with his other hand he lifted the head into his lap still stroking it rocking back and forth a little in a silent wail his eyes swam how could it hurt this much he looked up everything quiet was there no one to help the balcony above them had no one heard or had there only been a thud a dull thump onto the grass cushion he rocked harder cradling the head heavy in his lap oblivious to the dampness of the blood when he glanced at the pajamas and saw the dark stain on the pants where his father had soiled himself a final embarrassment he held the head closer comforting a child telling him it didnt matter the quiet was unbearable death itself and he saw why people keened made any sound to break the stillness so they werent swallowed up in it too but a part of you went anyway seeping out like blood he stared down again at the face smooth irretrievable somewhere else the only thing he had ever wanted he didnt know how long he knelt there out of the world but when he came back all his senses were there at once the sound of a car passing in the street the stickiness on his pants the tingling surge of adrenalin fear he should call somebody werent there neighbors gently he moved his fathers head laying it back on the grass and stood up maybe he shouldnt be seen at all but now what did it matter he walked over to the sidewalk and followed it around the building to the door a jumble of nameplates two apartments to a floor kotlar on the top he ignored the small elevator afraid of being enclosed and climbed the stairs the landings bright through a wall of glass brick moderne instinctively he raised his hand to knock on the door but who would be there then he saw that it was already ajar as if someone hadnt closed it properly who he pushed it quietly and stepped into the chilly apartment anna he called out hearing nothing but the sound of a clock he looked around the roomlow scandinavian furniture bookcases everything in order the sliding door to the balcony was closed he opened it stepped out and looked down the body was still there slightly to the right he saw then that the balcony extended along to the next room and that the door there was open he moved toward it stopping when he saw the marks on the painted rail here but his father had been barefoot in pajamas nothing to scrape against the bedroom was a mess covers flung back pillows scattered as if hed got up in a hurry the night table was upright but at an angle some pill vials and a book knocked to the floor the lamp pushed near the edge the desk chair was pulled back out of place where someone would bump into it in the dark the desk wasnt ransacked the drawers still in place but somehow disheveled at odds with the neat living room he stood for a minute imagining how it might have been the sudden impulse in bed knocking against the night table as he got up staggering drunk bumping against the desk yanking the chair out of the way the rush to the balcony and over soiling himself in the terror of the plunge none of that happened it would have been deliberate planned out like everything else a note nick looked on the desk moving some of the papers aside and then stopped you werent supposed to disturb the scene of the crime the phrase struck him another adrenalin surge thats what it was wasnt it he looked at the room again another phrase signs of struggle someone pulling him off the bed dragging him knocking against the furniture had he screamed nick leaned against the desk lightheaded had he begged them to stop fought back one final swing knowing his luck had run out but no one had heard the body was still lying there unreported nick imagined instead a hand clamped over his mouth muffling him his arms thrashing as they forced him out an old man so terrified that he went in his pants no note the papers were bills scattered now from what must have been a neat pile making sure everything was paid before he got on the train nick opened a drawer was there really a list there seemed to have been no effort to find it no search the inside of the desk was untouched folders of letters and bills and what seemed to be official documents with his name the paper trail of socialist life nick heard a noise in the hall the whirring of the elevator one of the neighbors would see the body now glance across the lawn as he went out curious then cry out and run back for the telephone should he do it first but the idea of calling the police in czech defeated him let someone else do it maybe instead he should slip down the stairs go back to the hotel and his own life call anna later what more could he do here all this paper receipts and letters some in russian the desk of a foreigner only on the grass strangely young again had he been his father in the top drawer he brushed aside pens and paper clips a passport russian his fathers he drew out a manila envelope dark with age newspaper clippings in english his disappearance his press conference a loose scrapbook of disinformation why had he saved them then nick saw that each of the clippings had family photographsthe three of them in front of the house on nd street the old wedding picture blurred on newsprint his parents shaking trumans hand at a reception their tabloid life at the bottom of the pile were two real photographs worn at the edges his mother young maybe during the war shoulder pads and short skirt a vivid lipstick smile her mouth open with the beginning of a laugh the other was a boy in hockey gear at lasker rink a wintry central park in the background the boy unaware that he was being photographed by a spy nick looked at himself he wished now that he had been smiling that every time his father had looked at it hed seen what he wanted to see his happy boy not somebody caught from behind a tree too late his eyes filled and he wanted to make a noise again the photographs were like the stillness of death if you gave in to them you drifted away to another place nothing ever came back he was still looking at the pictures when he heard the sound in the next room he raised his head two policemen faced him guns drawn the small machine guns they held with two hands more menacing than revolvers one of them shouted in czech looking at the blood on his pants im sorry i didnt hear another shout he pointed nick toward the wall with the gun and said something in czech brisk now the gun was being jerked up a signal to raise his hands when he did staring at the gun the other frisked him patting up and down his sides i was going to call then a storm of czech perhaps to each other their voices rising in frustration when he didnt answer i dont understand but then he did when they snapped on the handcuffs and pushed him out of the room the gun poking at his back he understood dazed that he was being arrested chapter there were people on the lawn now huddled over the body some in uniform one old lady standing behind clutching at her winter coatthe neighbor finally but they wouldnt let him stop pushing him with the guns down the path he bumped his head against the car when they shoved him in the sharp crack of pain the only thing real in what seemed to be a cartoon his wrists clamped behind him were caught in the metal cuffs one of the policemen in the front seat swiveled around pointing the gun at him and he watched the barrel bounce against the seat as the car took off down the rough road a pothole could set it off he closed his eyes no siren just the racing car rumbling now over cobbles taking a corner too fast the speed itself official he was pitched forward when they stopped almost into the gun then doors slammed and a hand pulled roughly at his arm the building was a blur bulletin boards and clicking typewriters heads looking up theyd take him to a desk now to someone who spoke english so he could explain instead he was thrown into a chair and photographed the flash blinding him then yanked down the hall to a bare room not a cell a plain table two chairs a picture of husak on the wall they pushed him down into one of the chairs hands still behind his back delivered another volley of incomprehensible czech then left the door slammed no one came what should he dokick the door demand to see someone to have his one telephone call but there were no rights here he was a foreigner with blood on his clothes maybe they were watching him he looked around no mirror just blank walls husak looking down the bump on his head throbbed they couldnt leave him here throw away the keya childs fear an interior room one small window facing a wall the light always the same no way to tell the time until it was dark the story was the important thing now what to say the truth would start another web catching him sticking to him like his pants he looked down would it never dry he felt his eyes fill again you always brought me luck but he hadnt dancing careless while his father made a new plan an emergency exit that hadnt opened why the change he sat back still dazed and waited to see what would happen it was at least an hour before they came or had waiting distorted his sense of time his hands were numb the two policemen again with another not in uniform his fat neck spilling over his collar he gave an order the cuffs were taken off and while nick rubbed his wrists the new man leaned over the table glaring and talking into his face when nick didnt answer signaling that he didnt understand he said ach a sound of disgust and sent one of the policemen out now they all waited the big man in the suit pacing eventually there was a knock on the door and another man in a suit came in this one was slight with a moustache and his eyes took nick in like a jeweler then he listened to the big man grumble in czech he turned to nick this is chief novotny he said pointing to the big man criminal investigation department am i under arrest hed like to ask you a few questions he said formally sidestepping it i will translate my name is zimmerman he caught nicks glance sudeten he explained but czech an unexpected courtesy almost social novotny snapped at him evidently telling him to get on with it he nodded good cop bad cop novotny handed him nicks passport what had happened to mollys you are nicholas warren yes and how do you come to be in holeckova this morning in pan kotlars flat you were acquainted we met at a concert last night concert yes benny goodman the sound of it absurd even to him novotny grunted he invited me to come for coffee a kaffeeklatsch zimmerman said why he used to be an american nick said used to be i think he wanted news from home zimmerman finished something like that so early in the morning not the afternoon coffee im leaving prague today it was the only time so i went but he wasi found him on the grass he was dead hed been dead for a while zimmerman looked at him sharply how do you know his skin was cold i see you examined him to see if he was alive thats why the blood novotny interrupted in czech the other answered him annoyed but polite then he turned back to nick but you went into his flat to call the police but you didnt nick pointed to the policeman he got there before i had the chance someone else must have called yes you were there long a few minutes look whats this all about he was dead do you think i killed him i dont know mr warren i dont know that anyone killed him he said carefully do you have reason to believe someone did i didnt mean that no last night at the concert how did he seem to you was he upset in any way desperate nick wanted to say but had he been or did it just seem that way now i dont know i dont know what he was usually like he seemed all right to me so you were surprised this morning of course it washorrible there was another exchange of czech then novotny went to the door said something and came back with nicks canvas bag by the body why had he forgotten novotny handed zimmerman mollys passport and the tickets you were going on from coffee to the station caught yes later he opened nicks passport your visa includes an entry permit for a car you are aware that it is illegal for you to sell a car to a czech citizen i didnt sell it a present then perhaps you were not by any chance leaving it for pan kotlar a hopeless tangle now no why would i do that if you had just met yes i agree but you were traveling by train think it was acting up i was going to have it fixed and come back for it youre very trusting mr warren to leave a car the hotel would take care of it but you couldnt wait no i had to be in vienna what is your business mr warren youre a journalist no im at the london school of economics a student a research assistant with business in vienna im traveling with someone she had to be there he fingered mollys passport miss chisholm he said pronouncing it correctly your friend yes she was not invited for coffee she had other things to do its a pity you did not join her mr warren he turned to novotny and reported in czech a brief summary you had better think of a better explanation for the car mr warren he said almost confiding hes interested in the car by the way the next vienna train doesnt leave until late afternoon i thought you should be aware of that nick stared at him now quickly please what did you see in the flat had anyone been there i think so furniture was pushed around as if there had been some kind of fight chair moved out of the way i suppose he might have done it himself but why anything else scrape marks on the railing but there was nothing on him to make a scrape with so i assume it was someone else zimmerman nodded approvingly if it was made then how long did you say hed been dead i dont know i cant tell he wasnt stiff just cold all right thank you he stood up talking again to novotny think about the car can i go now go mr warren im afraid you are in difficulties unless of course pan kotlar seemedagitated to you last night it might have been otherwise the police will be interested in you i dont understand arent you the police he smiled actually i was chief of police until last year a year can make a great difference here you see today chief novotny hes more comfortable with the regime or perhaps they with himit depends how you look at it now i help him another tram driver a research assistant he said his voice ironic but im glad of the work its hard you know to break the habit they brought molly in sometime after noon nick thank god she said her face drawn and nervous whats going on ive been frantic she moved toward him then looked at the police and stopped novotny watched them blankly shut out by language but zimmerman followed her with interest i dont know theres some kind of mistake the man we met last night at the concerti found him this morning dead they didnt tell you dead she said stunned not taking in the rest of it her face softened oh nick mr warren was with you this morning zimmerman said molly nodded what time did he leave molly looked to nick for help i dont know i was asleep the maid said very early zimmerman said you dont know exactly when i didnt want to wake her nick interrupted then to molly i went to get the tickets for the train this afternoon you know i didnt want to wait till the last minute evidently zimmerman said dryly still watching molly who simply stared following a game and yet you waited there he said to nick so theyd already checked i had a coffee it was too early to go to his place so much coffee zimmerman said you have business in vienna he said to molly but she seemed not to have heard him dead she said to nick he was dead how that is what were trying to determine miss chisholm a fall from the balcony an accident perhaps zimmerman said blandly but mr warrens presence there naturally raises some questions for us you understand you have business in vienna he said again molly looked at him unsure then gave a nod faint enough to be retrieved he took up her passport thumbing through it youve been to prague before may i ask what brings you back i wanted to show nick not on business then this time you did not apply for a journalists visa i see no it was a personal trip to see prague zimmerman said again he put down the passports so you cannot tell me when mr warren left this morning sometime after six he was still in bed then i saw the clock had she he left around six later i dont know when exactly i fell back to sleep why its useful to know these things chief novotny will want it for his report novotny looked up at his name or perhaps not perhaps he has his own idea dont be alarmed miss chisholm if you were under suspicion we would have questioned you separately before you could talk to mr warren here thats the usual procedure of course chief novotny may not know that he is new zimmerman sighed but its useful these details for instance you have not yet packed for your trip the disheveled room noticed molly leaves everything to the last minute nick said zimmerman looked at him now she will have more time but she has to leave today nick said evenly facing her i think chief novotny would prefer her to stay zimmerman said easily until we finish dont worry the tickets will still be good unless of course your car is fixed in time molly raised her eyebrows finally thrown but before nick could say anything there was a knock and another policeman handed novotny a folder he pulled out a report sheet and grunted as he read only handing it to zimmerman when he had finished zimmerman went through it quickly nodding and speaking to novotny as he read a small explosion of czech back then more talk not quite an argument novotny bristling clearly irritated by an inconvenience nick watched them then looked over at molly and saw that she was frightened when he placed his hand on hers it was cool to the touch there was no blood in the flat zimmerman said not a question tell me again about the blood he nodded to nicks pants when i was checking to see if he was alive is that why you went back to the flat to wash it off nick looked at him i didnt go back id never been there i found him and then i went in to call you but not right away first you went through his desk he glanced down again at the report pani havlicekthats the neighborsaid she saw you holding his head molly took her hand away as if the blood were there drawing her in but her eyes were soft upset now the death real not a story is that usually the way you check a pulse someone watching even then i dont know i didnt know what i was doing you know i didnt expect what mr warren to see a body there pani havlicek didnt expect to see you there either she said you stayed for some time holding him he glanced over at novotny who bored was now stretching his tight collar and looking out the window of course it might have seemed long to her its often the case she also said she heard noises in the apartment just before dawn another light sleeper he glanced at molly a little commotion of course it may have seemed louder to her than it was its possible at that hour he was walking around the table talking to himself a noise when you dont expect it pan kotlar himself perhaps there was alcohol in his blood if he was unsteady its difficult to be precise about these things nick looked up at him what time is dawn zimmerman paused a sliding look toward novorny before six he said to nick there were pills he continued walking again for illness no marks on the balcony of course these may have been missed if no one was looking for them they were there so you said what caused them do you think i dont know a belt buckle buttonssomething metal and what could that mean zimmerman said almost playing that someone scraped against it when he pushed him over nick said flatly for a minute no one said anything zimmerman looked down at the folder as if he were thinking it over not just playing for effect it was when nick saw him glance at the window that he realized zimmerman was just waiting to see if novotny had understood i see he said finally that is your idea yes oh god molly said quietly i dont know if chief novotny would agree with you as i said he has his own idea and you know sometimes the obvious solution is the right one ive seen this many times he didnt kill himself youre sure if i may say so mr warren the obvious solution would be more convenient for you directly to nick almost an instruction an older man sick its a common thing even the method its a disease with us czechs you know im not sure why all through our history defenestration so many have chosen it a courtyard in the czernin palace what had masaryk said the housemaids way out nick said zimmermans eyes widened in appreciation i see you know our history he wouldnt have taken it either you know that after so little acquaintance nick lowered his head quiet no mr warren it would all be very simple a sick man a little drink our chief would sign the papers everybody goes home except of course for you a foreigner at the death scene now its not so simple he took one of the chairs and sat down facing nick what are you doing here mr warren why did you come to prague nick looked away to see it a tourist who drives in and takes the train out who meets a stranger and the next morning hes dead mr warren this is a charade im not like our good chief i like to know the truth its a habit so why not hadnt he been telling nick all along that he knew it was someone else the wrong time the blood then why press at all simple curiosity or a final trick question before hed have to let him go there was no one to trust here nick said nothing zimmerman looked down opened the folder and shuffled through papers newsclippings yellow of course theyd gone through the apartment now he was fingering the hockey picture a remarkable resemblance zimmerman said quietly still shuffling indifferent for novotnys benefit he didnt want him to know a relative nick said nothing its unusual mr warren to hold the head of a dead man you didnt know he paused tell me please why you already know i would rather you told me its better for the report he continued looking down as if they were talking about something else he was my father nick said and yet you have different names zimmerman looked up a detail my mother remarried i took my stepfathers name i see thank you and now will you tell me why you didnt say this before what are you doing here mr warren i came to see him i didnt want anyone to know why it would hurt them if they knew my family no why did you come i wanted to see him after so many years before it was too late you knew he was dying no old zimmerman closed the folder you got here just in time im sorry this must be difficult for you may i offer you a piece of advice do not create more difficulties he didnt kill himself how can we know that mr warren from a few scrape marks somebody killed him why nick looked down i dont know then let us confine ourselves to what we do know for the moment i understand that pan kotlar was much affected by the death of his friend milos brokov there was a discussion about suicide you were there i believe thats not nick stopped how do you know that a flicker of embarrassment pan kotlars wife returned this morning from visiting relatives he looked up she was by the wayvisiting relatives had his father suggested it knowing or had he just wanted to make it easier to get on the train had he said goodbye chief novotny was busy so i took the opportunity to interview her separately our usual procedure she told you about me zimmerman nodded and touched the folder i confess i am not so clever even with the resemblance he paused was there any reason for her not to mention this no she hadnt known any of it so you remember this discussion she said pan kotlar was depressed is that so building another case away from the truth no he was drunk zimmerman started surprised by the bluntness an emotional time he said calmly a friends death and of course seeing you your presence is that what she said she said he was not himself the denunciations already begun the way his father said it would be the standard procedure was that your impression also i dont know what hes usually like but he was upset by his friends news yes a pinprick of disloyalty so easy anybody would be your visit it was a pleasant one yes no quarrels sometimes i know these things dont always go smoothly so many years and of course the events of his life that was a long time ago yes but often there are feelingsyou think its over and then they come up he was happy to see me and you were you happy to see him had he been yes very yet you were leaving today a short visit this time a kind of trial run zimmerman said pleased with himself for knowing the idiom yes your father knew you were planning to return yes but would you say he was distraught at your leaving with his health no i would not say that you would what are you trying to prove im trying to understand mr warren how it was no you just want me to say he killed himself i dont want any part of this you dont need meyou already know can we go now zimmerman looked at him carefully im afraid you dont understand the situation miss chisholm may go if she likes he said turning toward her though i must ask you to cancel your business in vienna it would not be advisable for you to leave prague just now you mr warren are another matter it is not of course my decisionim only assisting chief novotny but i suspect he would wish you to stay here am i under arrest what for no you are being detained for questioning whatever that means it means you are being detained for questioning you see mr warren you are a spanner what a spanner in the works its not correct a monkey wrench nick said ah its a britishism spanner zimmerman nodded a wrench it gets stuck in the machinery a cause of industrial accidents this is what has happened to chief novotny everything runs smoothly and then you fall in now he must decide what to do with you to fix it how does he explain you just the fact of you raises questions what if his idea is wrong it is then he must find another i have been trying to suggest to youi hope you understandthat you should not make this difficult for him he mightthis can happenhe might find the wrong idea he might find it in you nick stared at him you dont think i did it it doesnt matter what i think im only an assistant now you want him to believe this was a crime then it becomes a problem for him given the victim perhaps a political problem that would be serious me i dont interest myself in politics but i am interested in you im a policeman a man is dead and i want to know why i cant help it he paused i would like you to help me but chief novotny has other concerns not why what to do you must understand that difference for him the wrong solution any solution might become the right one unless of course i can explain you he cant prove anything proof can be a small thing mr warren if you want to believe it a telephone call that isnt made a presence in someones flat stained with blood he touched the folder again perhaps a resentment that explodesjust like that a kind of accident he looked up a car that isnt broken many things which are important which do you believe its difficult to know until they fit help me mr warren and not novotny unless they were really one person not separate at all like the mimes shadows at laterna magika nick let me call your father molly said anxious no he said quickly the last thing he wanted the wounded surprise on larrys face then the mess that would follow with everyone in on the act we can work it out here how this is ridiculous he turned to zimmerman do i get a lawyer if you are officially charged lets hope that wont be necessary we can inform your embassy if you like that you have been detained though i should warn you that that might take some time i dont want you to think its a lack of interest on their part but there are procedures to follow he lowered his voice and of course it makes difficulties for the chief questions asked paperwork i speak from experience i can recommend that you be allowed to return to your hotel tonight if we need to continue tomorrow but you cant guarantee it no not if you are charged nick molly said its all right you go back to the hotel and wait he turned to zimmerman can i call her later as you wish ill stay with you molly said no he looked at zimmerman may i talk with her privately zimmerman shook his head its not allowed can i go to the bathroom then zimmerman held his eyes for a second then nodded a faint smile with an escort after an exchange with novotny in czech one of the policemen led them out in the hallway nick hugged her goodbye nick stop arguing with him her voice was low worried it doesnt do any good he stood still larrys advice to his father years ago in the study youre not doing yourself any favors in there were they so alike somebody killed him molly but he thinks you did youve got to call your father no nick youve got to get out of here youre only going to get in deeper how are you going to explain ssh ill think of something look go to the embassy they wont keep me here if someone makes a stink novotny doesnt want to charge me with anythingit would be a real pain its zimmerman who cant get enough by the way i told him there was something wrong with the carthats why we were taking the train you heard the noise in the motor when we came back from the country okay i dont understand any of this i hate it what train what happened later the guard came over to nudge them apart just go to the embassy the embassy nervous her face dismayed yes tell them to get me out of here they cant keep me without a formal charge and what if they do charge you then they were going to do it anyway what if hes right that it takes them forever to molly he said stopping her but what if it did an inbox of tourist problems hed have to flash their attention a flare someone theyd know tell them im working for jack kemper in the london embassy theyll move i guarantee it who just do it please ill explain it all later he kissed her do it nick what are you doing kemper he said dont forget his wifes name is doris doris she said flailing but before he could say anything else the guard led him away later he said over his shoulder watching her fold her arms across her chest as if she were cold the guard stood at the door while he washed his hands flakes of dried blood forgotten came off in the water turning it rustcolored he stared at the drain suddenly weak then washed again and again until the water ran clear on the way back passing a long row of cubicles he spotted anna over a waisthigh partition she was bent over a desk her arm moving and for a moment he thought she was washing her hands too then he saw that she was writing signing a paper he imagined the statementhis fathers depression the upheaval of the weekend his state of mind all signed away now more blood down the drain when she looked up her face blotchy from crying she was startled to see him as if nick had died too then she took in the guard leading him by the arm and looked away refusing to meet his eyes anna he said forcing her to turn back im sorry they said you found him she said her voice distant with grief yes he wanted me to go to my sisters after the concert i thought he wanted to be with you was that it the troubling detail no she nodded piecing it together then turned away again cutting him out i wish you had never come she said zimmerman was waiting with a pot of coffee talking to novotny who sat on the windowsill eating a salami sandwich tell me about your trip to the country zimmerman began it rained nick said dully yet you told the hotel you were going to karlovy vary why deeper zimmermans voice droned on elaborately polite refusing to be discouraged by nicks vague replies there was always another question he had all the time in the world his patience as relentless as a light in the face wasnt that the way they were supposed to do it the bright lamp hurting your eyes no sleep shouts beatings but nothing here was what hed expected he thought of the watchtowers at the border his first sensation of fear a movie iron curtain bristling with menace but the countryside had been placid the pokey guard interested only in his car now zimmerman talked patiently lulling him but what did he really want there was no way of knowing the polite questions might be as deceptive as the placid landscape still after all lined with barbed wire so nick stalled repeating himself giving away nothing that mattered and after a while it was easier the story became real to him there was something wrong with the car molly did have business in vienna why not he saw that zimmerman recognized it too the tipping point after which nothing would be revealed because the lies were now true his eyes shrewd witnesses to a hundred interrogations began to anticipate nicks answers the cards fell where he expected them why go on unless this was part of the weakening process they took a break zimmerman sighed and lit another cigarette his manner easy and intimate he reminded nick in factan odd thoughtof his father the resigned irony the personal reaching out trust me hed watched his father the same way trying to guess how much was true behind the words sorting through his conversations as if they were index cards except his father was dead what if everything hed said had been true all of it no hidden meanings or little deceptions just what hed said the story hed proved by dying while nick had wasted time wondering if he could trust him he looked up at zimmerman but not him only the dead could be trusted here had anna really been with relatives wouldnt it have been easy to improbable but then everything was improbable a list theyll want this hed said what did zimmerman want can i ask you a question nick said suddenly yes certainly did they find anything when they searched his desk zimmerman stared at him trying to figure out what he meant so they hadnt what did you expect them to find mr warren i dont know a note no zimmerman said quietly no note a beat you dont think a note would have been left out where it could easily be found then where was it if the list didnt exist then none of it was true and it had to be true because he was dead but zimmerman was waiting is that your experience zimmerman shrugged every case is different more questions the afternoon passing only faint light now against the wall outside the window they were alone novotny having left giving up any pretense of following their talk when he came back it was with a burst of czech agitated zimmerman raised his eyebrows and followed him out the quiet was worse the interrogation at least was a distraction his whole mind was forced to pay attention now it was released skittering back to his father on the lawn cradling him well mr warren zimmerman said as he came back in you interest me more and more he cocked his head toward the door your rescue party is here molly no your embassy remarkably efficient they find it objectionable for us to detain you any longer i didnt know you were so important im not we dont detain people in america no doubt that explains why you have so much crime so can i go for now i have persuaded chief novotny that youre not such a dangerous character it is as i predicted an official protest would upset him but i wish you had followed my advice now he will have to take an interest so much work for everyone well he opened his hand a followme gesture i must ask however that you do not go far we are not so accommodating as that so you will stay in prague until when until we have no more questions he stepped aside to let nick pass of course you have my personal sympathies it is a difficult thing a parents death thank you he was almost at the door oh one last question i forgot

glowering next to him a man in a raincoat extending his hand mr warren jeff foster american embassy nick froze for a minute his hand stuck in midair then he took fosters aware of zimmerman watching him not wanting him to catch the look on his face as he recognized the coat the sandy hair the man on the bridge with molly chapter you want to tell me what the hells going on foster said outside we

him some stunt then he smiled you dont know what you started theyve even got the ambassador jumping around well make my apologies youll have to do that one yourself he looked at him again assessing okay tomorrow hes got a dinner tonight anyway youre out thats the main thing we dont want the czechs thinking its anything serious that would really start something come on ill give you a lift ill walk that makes it harder for them foster said sliding his eyes toward a parked car two men theyll have to go slow and it messes up traffic easier to follow a car ill never be alone again huh not in prague nicholas he heard a voice at his side anna how long had she been there everything is all right he nodded she glanced at foster then handed nick a piece of paper its the address for the funeral the funeral already arranged yes tomorrow if you would come he looked down at the paper a meaningless street name tomorrow arent they going to do an autopsy she shook her head no one said theres no need he grabbed her arms anna he didnt kill himself they should but she shrank from him looking around to see if anyone was watching please she turned her back to foster who felt awkward enough to step toward the car you dont understand she said to nick almost a whisper how it is here its better not to wait better for whom the police i wont let them do this you wont im his family im his family here nicholas me she glared at him then lowered her head its not for you to decide but dont you want to know what i know hes dead its enough she moved back what i said beforei know you meant well but now leave prague theres nothing more for you to do here she nodded at the paper in his hand ten oclock she said and walked away nick got into the back seat with foster behind the driver who had a marines shaved head what was that all about i thought you said he killed himself shes his wife what would you say he looked away feeling in his pocket for a cigarette let her think it was an accident an accident with an autopsy foster leaned forward to the driver the alcron over on wenceslas the car swung into the street you dont want to get involved in anything he said to nick not here theres only so much we can do you know we can make a little noise if they haul you in for no reason but if theres anything wrong im on my own i know he lit the cigarette dont worry nothings wrong not that way they think he killed himself everybody does but not you nick looked at him he must have im sorry they said you found him thats rough yes after all these years you know who he was well after i heard the name hes the one that got away foster paused must be a hell of a thing to live with the car was quiet with the tension of someone not rising to the bait you guys keep tabs on him keep the files up to date we dont have the manpower for that foster said flatly by the way before you get any other ideas i dont work for the agency you just work at the embassy thats right doing what trade relations mostly what had kemper been in agricultural development really what do we import glass nick took another pull on the cigarette id like to know did you keep tabs on him tail him that kind of thing yesterday for instance why yesterday nick shrugged i just wondered something was bothering him i thought maybe you i wouldnt know i was in meetings all day he turned to nick nobody was tailing him i told you we dont have the people for that i dont think the intelligence guys he looked at nick we have some i never heard they were interested is there any reason why they should have been no good reason no anyway it would fit wouldnt it something bothering him perfectly yeah well foster turned away embarrassed hell of a thing to live with that im sorry here we go the hotel doorman came to meet them foster put his hand on nicks shoulder a coachs gesture do us a favor okay keep your nose clean we dont want to run interference with the police the czechs dont like it they have to watch themselves too since the russians came in you dont want to start anything nick took in the friendly hand the open face an american kind of menace what had he said on the bridge no i just want to get out of here you and me both i used to be in paris now thats a place here you have to watch your back all the time nick nodded ill remember he got out and saw the skoda two car lengths behind in the hotel lobby he could feel the change immediately the desk clerks eyes followed him across the room a disturbance someone the police had asked about when molly opened the door and hugged himthe same smell the same smooth skinhe felt they were onstage with one part of him out front watching it was easy to do being someone else his fathers son she sat on a chair a few feet away curled into herself while he told her about the morning at holeckova the body on the grass feeding her only what he wanted her to hear watching measuring the distress in her face they ate in the hotel dining room old starched napkins and pork with sludgy gravy sleepwalking through the meal she took his distance for grief picking at her food waiting for him to speak then they sat drinking wine almost alone in the faded room you havent told me about the train yes i did i mean why i dont understand something happened yesterday yesterday what i dont know he was all right at noon then at the concert all of a sudden he has to leave something happened but how many possibilities were there the gallery the walk to the loreto the bridge he looked at her did anna know she said about the train im not sure i dont think so is it possible that she stopped what please dont be angry that he did kill himself no she waited for more why would he have gone to all the bother about the train the whole plan making me get tickets would he have done that to me she shook her head he was murdered she flinched but why because someone didnt want him to leave there cant be any other reason he looked straight at her so who else knew he was planning to go she didnt meet his eyes but looked down at her glass somewhere else then she folded her arms across her chest shivering as if there were a draft in the stuffy room what he said im sorry its the wine its not the wine tell me no its everything its my fault isnt it starting this we never should have come not what hed expected stop you blame me i dont blame you but why did you lie it never would have happened stop it molly somebody killed him not you this isnt helping anything he put his napkin on the table come on were both tired lets go up play everything through sorry she said stung by his tone this is just making it worse isnt it and upstairs it was no better they got into bed an acting kiss then turned away from each other lying on their sides he looked at the light on the ceiling thinking of the other night the tram bells outside drowning in her now he was alert but absolutely still as if he were afraid moving would wake her even though he knew the reason he could not sleep was that she was awake too they took a taxi to the funeral address a street out past the station near the outskirts of town the room a kind of chapel with pews was plain and functional stripped down to a lectern a czech flag one vase of flowers and the wooden coffin on a platform in front an undertaker in a black suit hovered near the door an anxious maitre d waiting for the room to fill but after a few early arrivals no one came and finally he had to start anna sat in front with anna masaryk behind her like two squat matrioshka dolls zimmerman in a suit sat near the back his curious eyes darting frankly around the room there were four people nick did not know scattered off to the side and frantisek sober now who went to the lectern to speak no one else where were the others would there have been more people in moscow old friends or was this the extent of his fathers life a pareddown circle and a son he and molly sat across from anna and he kept his eyes fixed on the closed coffin the eulogy was in czech so he had no idea what was being said probably the usual empty phrases as comfortless as medals in moscow they would have mentioned the order of lenin but not here no socialist heroes not since the invasion his father had somehow become nobody at all the loneliness of the room was oppressive and nick shifted in his seat causing a creak were they watching him he had seen it in their faces that he had a new role to play now the cause of his fathers despair the unbearable reminder of everything hed lost his fault and for a moment he gave in to it became what they wanted what if none of it was true the whole story a pretense his father could no longer keep up no silver no plan just a story whose plot had run out easier for everybody what had he actually seen in the flat but the disorder of a final night then molly squirmed beside him and he was alert again he turned people were nodding at the speech their heads down only zimmerman was looking at him his eyes bright interested who knew it hadnt been suicide only that people wanted it to be the czech went on frantisek dropping to a guttural rumble then chopping the air with his hand making some point anna was crying quietly a hurried funeral her decision did she think it was nicks fault too or had she discovered that his father was going to leave even helped him out of the way visiting relatives but she must have been with him that afternoon when something had happened nick looked at the wooden box his mind freed by the droning language to sift through the last few days everything that had happened except for molly sitting next to him pale who couldnt be explained the words ended abruptly and frantisek sat down next to anna and patted her hand no one moved nick waited for music some formal signal but there was just the quiet the undertaker and a helper came forward said something in czech and pushed a button behind the platform doors opened in the wall and nick saw that the coffin was on a kind of ramp maneuvered now by the two men so that it began sliding toward what must be the crematorium shuddering a little until the angle took it and it fell away like a ship being launched into the water then the doors closed and his father was gone the room emptied quickly a few polite condolences to anna then a shuffling toward the door no one talked to nick im sorry anna he said when the others had gone thank you for coming she said formally then softly he would have wanted that he felt his insides lurch i wish i had known him better i think you knew him better than anyone she said sadly you knew what he was like before im sorry he said again at a loss can we take you home no no i have to stay here for the arrangements goodbye she said to molly holding out her hand he liked you oh molly said struck she reached over and embraced anna surprising her is there anything no she said stiffly its all arranged goodbye nick looked at her not knowing what else to do his stepmother a stranger but she was already turning away from him back to her life anna would you tell me something what did he do that last day before the concert she looked up at him he took a nap you were with him i mean did he see anybody no she said sterner now he took a nap he was thinking he would do that lie on the sofa thinking and then fall asleep he didnt go out no i told you leave me alone now she looked up her eyes fierce leave prague then she turned her back to him and walked over to the undertaker outside the street was empty except for the skoda parked in front where he would see it maybe theyll give us a ride nick said dont molly said nervous its not funny theres a tram stop down there at the next street they walked to the corner mr warren a voice from a car window rolled down miss masaryk he said surprised you remember good please come to lunch she handed him an address thats very kind of you but no its not kind i want to talk to you alone she glanced at molly excuse me why about your father its important youll come when an hour dont ring the bell its broken the top floor theres a good view she said irrelevantly then rolled up the window and started the car who was that a friend of his he said not wanting to give her a name she probably wants to talk old times it didnt sound that way i wont be long let me know if if what youre going to be late ill be worried a narrow street in the old town near the river the downstairs bell in fact was broken the panel taped over and the lobby itself heavy stone cool as a monastery was in disrepair a pail sat in one corner to catch drips and the broad stairs were worn down by the years crumbling near the edges when he began to climb he could hear the echo of his steps in the stairwell she opened the door immediately as if she had been listening for him and motioned him in good good i was afraid you would miss it the door its confusing come in some coffee maybe a brandy nick shook his head looking around the room followed the curve of the eaves vaulting near the windows dipping lower toward the back there were books everywhere stacked to the ceiling on their sides too many for shelves yellowing cream french spines shinier english jackets what wall space had escaped the stacks was crammed with picture frames next to each other a collage of old photographs and prints the dining table near the window already laid with openfaced sandwiches and pickles was set for three a pack of marlboros had been placed in the center like an extra course he looked at the third plate but she misinterpreted following his eyes farther to the window yes come and see its why i stay my little nest its too small but the view makes up for that a romantic view the charles bridge and the hill rising behind it to hradcany castle spires everywhere i saw the tanks from here a friend telephoned so early who calls at such an hour go to your window he said the russians are here and there they were coming over the bridge i was standing right here all morning watching them the bridge was shaking i thought if one of the statues comes down bastards she waved her hand dismissively is someone else coming nick asked yes he heard a kettle whistle sit sit ill make the coffee fluttering not wanting to talk how did you know my father through anna we were at school of course thats a long time ago but she came back so i met him he used to come here to talk about books many times she stopped im so sorry for you then obviously relieved she heard the knock ah hes here nick stood waiting as she opened the door zimmerman still in his mourning suit they exchanged greetings in czech a social kiss mr warren you dont mind anna was so kind to arrange its easier to talk here ive told you everything i know he held up his hand you misunderstand its not the interrogation i want to talk to you in a different way no questions well perhaps one sit sit anna said busying herself with the coffee settling them in nick sat down slowly feeling ambushed there was an awkward silence while anna poured neither of them saying anything zimmerman took one of the marlboros what question nick said zimmerman nodded to anna who went over to a stack of books and brought back an envelope your father asked anna to hold this for him he was going to collect it yesterday morning im always up early anna said as if that explained it i took the liberty of opening it under the circumstances miss masaryk of course had no idea what it was then why did she tell you about it nick said looking at her she was concerned when she heard the news of his death she thought it might be important you understand we are very old friends its karl who started the investigation into uncle jans death she explained its he who was helping frantiseks brother with the manuscript you can trust him nick opened the envelope and drew out a russian passport his fathers picture cyrillic type your father was not jewish zimmerman pointed to the cyrillic letters not called pechorvsky either but that is his picture yes can you think why he would need such a thing a russian jews passport no but nicks heart was racing all of it was true his fathers papers for the trainnot at the flat but ready everything just as he had said that page is an exit visa zimmerman said but its not his no pechorvskys who died of kidney failure he picked up the passport running his finger along the edge of the picture the raised seal not the best but it would pass the visas good for two more weeks i dont understand i think you do well i dont was that your question no he slipped the passport back into the envelope mr warren a man with someone elses exit visa can only mean one thing he was planning to leave perhaps by train he said looking away casual but not i think to israel like poor comrade pechorvsky my question is why why everybody wants to leave not everybody a man with the order of lenin who betrayed his countrywould such a man be welcome in the west what made him think they would want him back i dont know nick said hammering each word in no but its a question dont you agree hes dead the question is who killed him why dont you ask that because i know who killed him mr warren nick stared at him almost afraid to go on who he said quietly that is i know who must have killed him its not difficult what interests me is why who nick said again so direct mr warren sometimes an answer is indirect please listen more coffee anna nick sat silently of course every case is different zimmerman said its the similarities that intrigue what are you talking about please i said i had only one question but i also have a story that is why i wanted to see you will you listen to it it will interest you i promise you are familiar with our history i saw that at the station the housemaids solution how much do you know about the masaryk case hardly anything look then listen carefully i know a great deal about it almost everything its as anna says last year under dubcek there was an investigation so we would know once and for all its a national obsession that case our great mystery does it matter after so many years a littleyoull forgive melike your president kennedy to know exactly what happened so with jan masaryk everybody knows the russians did it but to know mr warren to prove it its not easy so many people have diedthe night watchman the doctor who signed the death certificate some natural some not so natural just last year a bodyguard who talked to me was shot on the highway by thieves karl himself was in danger anna said touching nicks arm a conspirator he was threatened they dont want the truth to come out even now but we learn things so the case nineteen fortyeight the communists are in masaryk is still in the cabinet but not one of them to the whole world he represents the old republic his fathers country and every day in the cabinet a new compromise the deathhow do you say it the death of a thousand bites the russians are taking over so perhaps he feels despair a way to end it all the housemaids solution but there is also the possibility that he was planning to leave he looked at nick an embarrassment for the communists maybe even a government in exile like during the war his mistress had already gonean american so for them the jump was a convenient death a public funeral the end of the republic but was he murdered from the beginning there were inconsistencies a more complicated case let me say than your own the position of the body in the courtyard a very wide jump violence in his roomeven in the bathroom bottles broken bedpillows on the floor even in the tub why for sleeping the window there had a high sillnot convenient scrapes and his pajamas were soiled he looked again at nick so many inconsistencies a car was heard pulling away in the night was someone there well never know you see mr warren the mistake i made was thinking that a criminal investigation would tell us everything but this was a political crime we can reconstruct the evidencewhat must have happened but what i want to know is was he planning to leave nick looked at him quiet you cant ignore the passport anna said what must have happened nick said zimmerman rolled his cigarette against the ashtray methodically tapping the ash masaryk had had a full day a meeting with benes the president his fathers old friend very depressing ive no doubt benes may have told masaryk he was going to resign but that would work either way as the last straw or an incentive to go either way he had a meeting the next day with a polish delegation a speech to write so he goes to bed early to work on the speech he frequently did that worked in bed a bottle of beer and a sandwich these details we know the servants retired very heavy sleepers unfortunately of course the czernin palace is a large building and their quarters were not close no one heard the lift being used the guard at the front door reported no visitors there is a side door for deliveries unguarded this much we know as fact go on nick said had they used the elevator at holeckova he thought of the milky light through the glass brick on the landing enough to see by even at dawn masaryk was a big man there must have been two perhaps more a team the side door the stairs quiet perhaps they were surprised to find him still up working so late there must have been fighting the room is knocked about papers all over in the bathroom more smashes they must have been angry at his resistance but hes fighting for his life and hes strong he must have knocked against the medicine chest causing the bottles to fall on the floor then he is pushed or falls into the bathtub and there someone must have held him down with a pillow over his face he must have kicked trying to get out while they held him down until he stopped kicking zimmerman looked up from the ashtray his voice dropping almost husky now of course he was a vigorous man had he been older it would have been easier not such a struggle nick turned away sick then they must have pulled him outhe would have been heavyand dragged him over to the window perhaps stepping on the bottles kicking them out of the way a high sill the men grunting propping him up from the angle of the fall they must have pushed him out back first that was the first inconsistency no one jumps backward in its own way its a brave thing suicide his fingers scrape the sill as they push him out its possible that the scraping happened earlierthat they tried to force him out the window and he resisted holding on while he kicked them away then the same fight no matter he went out that is the criminal evidence that is what must have happened for a moment no one spoke how do you know it was a pillow nick said quietly there were no signs of strangulation were there marks on your fathers neck zimmerman said no longer pretending to be in the past no but he soiled himself thats very rare in someone who jumps if he was frightened nick began so rare as to be almost nonexistent it is however a common occurrence in cases of suffocation it happens most frequently when people are hangedthats why we have connected losing control of the bowels to fear but jumpers dont do that they are not afraid but it would happen if he were smothered during the struggle clearly as if in slow motion nick saw his father on the bed gasping his feet moving then giving in his papers ready nick touched the envelope nothing else no list who nick said finally who mr warren do you blame the gun for going off these men are tools they are nobody im not going to know who entered the czernin palace im not going to know who went to your fathers flat on holeckova i accept that then why are you telling me this so you will accept it too so you are not tempted to play the detective my father wasnt masaryk he wasnt going to set up a government in exile then why was he killed you see i accept the limitations how far we can take a criminal investigationweve had to learn that but its still important to know to protect ourselves one day you know the russians will leave yes i believe that we can be policemen again solve real cases but meanwhile we have to know what theyre doing to hide to play the fool if its better to survive them this is what we do soldier schweik if you like a man is killed if i know why then i know how far i can go contain the situation by pretending it didnt happen if thats necessary why do you want to protect them mr warren i want to protect you me has it occurred to you how dangerous this might be for you i came here to talk to you as a friend i think you did not at the station understand how things are and how are they they must protect the lie theyll do anything to do that look at masaryka crime twenty years old yet still the lie its a curious thing to care so much what people think when you have all the power anyway maybe they need to believe it themselves so they stage a simple case of suicide who would doubt it but you are there something unexpected now there are questions accusations the americans calling if they feel the lie is threatened they will have to protect it so now a crime but the most obvious person to have done it mr warren is you you know i didnt the evidence can be made to fit its not a criminal case mr warren thats what im trying to tell you a political crime all that matters is what they want people to believe you were there you had the motive he paused and you cannot explain yourself but you know if you are charged theres nothing i can do you must see that of course its a complication to arrest you it becomes an incident so many people involved but they will do it if they have to protect themselves and you will be convicted all proper and legal he lowered his voice you will be your fathers murderer nick raised his head yes they can do it the question is is it worth it to them thats what i dont know yet and i cant know that until i know why he was planning to leave why he was stopped i cant help you if i dont know that if you dont tell me nick shaken said nothing will they accuse you is it that important to them i dont know zimmerman sighed and reached for another cigarette taking his time of course there is another possibility the easiest way to avoid everythingno incident no trial what do you know mr warren they were willing to kill him why stop they killed people in the masaryk caseoh yes even years later if they thought you knew the reason it would be easy to make a new lie a family tragedy you found the body who can say how people react to such a terrible thing sometimes they blame themselves it would be easy if they thought you knew nick stared at the precise glowing ash of zimmermans cigarette maybe they sent you to find out zimmerman looked at him for a second then nodded slowly yes maybe in that case i seem to have failed you decide he stood up scraping the chair but i see i have accomplished one thingto make you suspicious even of me good you need to be careful like you yes like everyone here but were still alive nick didnt move all of it true but did they know about him had his father told them before the pillows made him quiet do you really think theyd i have no way of knowing mr warren perhaps its my imagination only you would know that if what you know is dangerous but i would be careful in fact i would leave prague youre the one who ordered me to stay he nodded yes its a difficulty you understand that was an official request not mine then what under the circumstances go with the suicide make a statement about his despair be innocent zimmerman stared at him serious nick looked away an end to it what everybody wanted he thought of annas arm moving on the other side of the cubicle wall then i can leave he asked finally ill see i dont know how far this has gone incidentally has anyone talked yet to miss chisholm no then perhaps you would advise her he paused my concern for youif you know what you say you dontwould extend to anyone its one thing to put yourself at risk she doesnt know anything zimmerman smiled but then neither do you be careful mr warren thank you for the story a reconstruction what might have happened you said must zimmerman shrugged it suggests itself its not the first time he looked down at nick but you have to be satisfied with that with what must have happened you understand that you can stop playing detective and thats why you told me so id stop go away so you would not live with a mystery it can be a poison yes nick said quietly his eyes fixed on the ashtray you were thinking of another nick looked up at him how he got here zimmerman opened his mouth to say something then gave it up turning away you will not solve that in prague no nick stood do i have to sign something at your convenience i will call you he gave nick a wry glance if your embassy permits they dont care they want me to go too nick picked up the passport and held it out to him no that would only confuse chief novotny he turned to anna sometimes things are not found its a pity anna nodded and took the passport not even by good czechs who might need them he said to her you understand not this one she nodded again you havent eaten anything she said another time anicka thank you mr warren they said goodbye to her shaking hands leaving her to her full table and wonderful view on the stairs there were no sounds but their shoes against the worn stone ill leave first zimmerman said when they reached the ground floor wait a few minutes here please go left to the corner so they can see you arent they your own men he smiled weakly but im careful like you he took nicks hand peering closely at him i wonder what you know mr warren i dont know anything then that is what ill say will they believe you oh i think so i was a good interrogator when we were just police nick waited in the dark stairwell listening to the drips in the pail then he went out turning toward the old town square the streets like everything else a maze chapter molly was sitting by the window waiting for him what happened a condolence call he said crossing the room avoiding her she waited then looked down disappointed anna called she wants to see you at your fathers she say why no just that she has something for you he stopped attentive now not in the desk anna had found it somewhere else okay ill be back as soon as i can ill come she said getting up you dont have to yes i do im going crazy here i keep thinking theyre picking you up again they wont i called zimmerman i told him id sign a statement saying my father was depressed i was worried about him thats why i went to see him that morning but i thought thats how you remember it too isnt it he said partly to the walls he left the concert early after that little fight we had if they ask she stopped in front of him nick whats going on just say it if thats what you want she said trying to read his face thats what i want he turned away ill go see him after anna and get it over with i wont be long he went over to the window and drew back the edge of the curtain our friends are still here where she came over and looked out not very subtle are they not the ones we know about she shivered stop she picked up her shoulder bag from the chair im not staying here im just not they walked down wenceslas past the parky stalls and halfempty shops heading inevitably toward the narodni street bridge where had anna found it did she know what it meant molly wary said nothing glancing over her shoulder one of the men followed on foot the skoda lagging behind they passed the corner where she had caught the tram and started across the bridge he waited until they were halfway across before he stopped looking over at the tree where hed stood whats wrong i dont want them to lose us i like having a bodyguard why whats going on my father was killed molly not depressed killed i dont want to end up the same way you the guy from the embassy said i should watch my back did he she said her face blank why would he say that maybe hes paranoid they get like that over here maybe he knows knows what but instead of answering he said molly i want you to do something get out of prague today the tickets still good take the car if you want why maybe im paranoid too but do it theres nothing you can do here at least youll be safe she shook her head knows what she said again tell me he turned to her angry now you tell me what he grabbed her arm whos foster molly tell me why are you acting like this she said pulling away im watching my back he didnt have to tell me we learned that in the war you get like that when people shoot at you you start seeing things you for instance standing right here having a little talk not shopping definitely not alone i was over there he indicated the tree but maybe i was seeing things was i tell me she took her arm away subdued what did he tell you him nothing not a word a real gentleman if you like the type which i guess you do so why dont you tell me she looked down hes a friend was a bed friend what difference does it make a bed friend all right yes we had a thing so what in paris he used to work there but not anymore no so you came here a czech filmmakerchrist was that his idea or yours mine what else did you make up why i didnt think youd come if you knew and it was important to get me here that was the idea it was important for him he wanted it not me but you made it happen you arranged everything a little family reunion with the cia sitting right there beside me hes not with the cia so he said what about you who do you work for nobody i did it for him why if it was over i thought it would get him back did it thingschanged she looked up at him you know that i dont know anything molly remember im not supposed to is that why we went to bed was that part of the plan too so i wouldnt suspect anything no no you just couldnt help yourself christ and i was worrying about the czechs bugging us not our side stop it it wasnt like that you tell him about it was that part of the report she shook her head that wasnt supposed to happen it just did what was supposed to happen you dont want to hear this yes i do im dying to hear it how stupid i was fucking an agent she flinched and turned away from him facing the water im not an agent i told you hes not cia he hates the cia as a matter of fact its like a sports thing theyre these big rivals who she bit her lip the bureau there so you know okay you got it out of me happy he works for the fbi nick stared at her his fathers voice i know where in paris he said sarcastically at the embassy theyre not supposed to operate overseas its against the law like they care anyway they get around it by putting people in the embassies legatsthats what they call them legal attaches the cia knows but theres nothing they can do about it so they make each other crazy she stopped hes not an agent and thats supposed to make it all right i didnt say that some difference so you get together in paris im amazed an old rock groupie like yourself i didnt think hed be your type how was it dont do this she said quietly how was it she glared at him fine if you want to know it was fine look im not proud of this what do you want me to say what about you are you proud of everyone youve been to bed with she turned to face the river we had a thing okay i was attracted to himi dont know why kind of like sleeping with the enemy its so wrong itsinteresting you know whats that like i mean god the bureau the last thing i would have imagined i thought they were like nazis but he wasnt he was niceat least he was then so i was wrong i thought it would just be that one time but it wasnt it went on and then when he left i didnt know what to do maybe i wanted him to miss me but i didnt want it to be over so you followed him here she nodded but things were different i thought it was the placeeverythings different here but what was really happening was that it wasnt important to him anymore just his stupid job who wants to admit that so i didnt then i met your father and he got interested again i had him back for a while why was he interested he knew the bureau would be your father was the one who got away they never closed the file because of hoover its never over for him jeff says he lives in the past i guess when he isnt spying on the panthers and whatever else they do but that period your fathers timethat was it for him so hed be interested if anything turned up jeff just wanted to do himself some good get out of prague and back home pragues a dead end but if he could get the directors attention she paused i dont know maybe he thought he could get something out of him that your father might tell you things he could use hes like that ambitious so he used me and i used you is that what you wanted to hear every detail i already told you i was at a party with jin there was a jiri somebody i met here i didnt make him up just what happened your father was there and i was amazed i thought he was in moscow or dead or something it was like meeting a ghost so i told jeff id met him what hed said and he got interested i dont think they even knew he was in prague so what was he up to and you told him my father wanted to see me why not as far as i was concerned he was i know a murderer so you decided to catch him no i never thought id see him again i went back to paris then jeff came and said hed been thinking about it and why did your father want to see you and maybe i should do it do what he asked and it might be important and wouldnt i do it for him but not tell me would you have come no so i thought why not i didnt even know you jeff really wanted it and it was interesting i wanted to know narodni i figured i owed it to her to find out once and for all and then when it started i thought i cant do this its like working for the fbi not jeff thats when i realized what he was really one of them and by that time i knew you i was going to call it off in viennai was supposed to check in with him there before we crossed the border but you changed the plan remember you didnt want to wait and ii went with it i couldnt tell you i thought what if nothing happens just a visit nobody had to know your father never suspected no he had you checked out nick said he believed you a love affair his father had said young people always had love affairs some plausible young man at the embassy not cia nobody to worry about everybody believed you yes so you wanted to call it off but you saw foster here anyway i had to i couldnt just leave i had to put an end to it tell him to stop i was afraid if i didnt what that hed talk to you that youd find out from him oh instead of from you just when were you planning to tell me she turned to look at him never never not even after we were home why not because i knew youd look at me the way youre looking now her eyes were moist filling so no one would be the wiser he said angry at the tears not wanting to be disarmed especially me but it didnt work out that way no what did you tell foster there was nothing to tell we went to the country no dark secrets from the past nothing that would interest anybody at home just a visit end of story she hesitated i told him i didnt want you to know about me that it would ruin things i made him promise dont worry he kept it your secrets safe with him he took out a handkerchief and held it out to her but that wasnt exactly the end you told foster he was planning to leave didnt you she blew her nose nodding at the same time why i never thought he was serious it was just some crazy idea and jeff kept hounding me what did they talk about what did they talk about he wanted to know who his contacts were who he saw in prague as if id know so i said it wasnt like that he was out of it retired he even had this idea about going back and he wanted you to help thats how out of it he wasin some dream world she looked up at him her face still covered by the handkerchief i didnt want jeff to think it was real get all excited maybe try to contact him i didnt think it was real i didnt a thin wail nick turned away not wanting to face her waiting as she caught her breath tell me something else you were never going to tell me he said quietly he wasnt going to leave it alone was he not after that he wanted you to find out more from me stay close to me let him know he made you promise to keep going didnt he then hed keep his he waited hoping hed overshot his stomach turning when he saw her nod again into the handkerchief but i wasnt going to she said i just said it to make him stop i wasnt going to god molly he leaned back against the bridge feeling hemmed in his czech watchdog down the road was staring at the river the american was closer stifling a sniffle tell me something what did that feel like in bed spying on me i wasnt spying on you what do you call it i thought we were making love she said quietly thats what it felt like to me spare me she raised her head stung then shrugged and gave him the handkerchief its true for what its worth anyway how would you know did you even know i was there not both of you maybe you cant she said ignoring him you dont care about anything unless it happened twenty years ago i hate what he did to you making you think you could get it back who could compete with that you dont have room for anybody else just him he stood saying nothing only vaguely aware of the traffic sounds as if someone had sliced him with a knife and he had to hold his insides close so they wouldnt slip out then it worked hed held himself in and was able to breathe again well now hes dead somebody else didnt want him around either thats unfair i didnt mean i know then why say it to make me feel worse you dont have to i can do that myself she shook her head oh whats the use youre too hurt to see anything but what happened with jeffit didnt matter to me nick it didnt matter but it did matter my fathers dead because someone knew because i told jeff but how could it do you think ive thought about anything else for two days what if i did it me killed him just by but how jeff didnt kill him he may be a shit but he didnt do that but who else knew me you foster unless he told somebody did he i dont know he hesitated but you could find out how use your wiles they worked on me dont its not much to ask considering nick not for me do it for my father hes entitled to one favor she looked down for a moment there was nothing just the sound of a truck going by do what go see foster tell him i still dont suspect anything and youd like to keep it that way just between you and old jeff has he talked to anyone else in the embassy or even back home find out if he signaled the bureau about this if anyone in washington has any idea why washington and when if he said anything before nick whats the point what does this have to do with anything the bureau didnt kill him maybe my father wasnt as careful as he thought maybe his friends already knew but maybe he was careful maybe he got tripped up because somebody wanted a new job and thought he was the ticket i just want to find out who knew its important maybe it stops with foster at least we eliminate possibilities molly stared up at him if it stops with him she said slowly that leaves me do you think i did it no really why not me why not anna its usually the wife isnt it why not the bureau who didnt even know where he was except in some old file nobody cares about anymore who else do you see what this is doing to you its crazy nick nodded but hes dead and whoever killed him knew he was going to leave its the only way it makes sense well it doesnt make sense to me why not just lock him up they lock up everyone else what made him so special i dont know she raised her head scanning his face you do though thats it thats why youre so sure he was killed why youre worried signing things i thought it was just an idea he had but you didnt you knew he could do it you even bought him a ticket theres something else thats why you want to know who jeff told she glanced up her eyes narrowing in washington thats what you want to know who in washington nick said nothing still not looking at her leaving was only part of it theres always been something else that you wouldnt tell me he turned back to her well that makes two of us he saw the flush rise in her face a kind of blood wince she lowered her eyes not anymore now theres just you i cant you mean you dont trust me i mean i cant its not safe she shook her head you think im going to tell jeff you still think that they killed him molly it doesnt matter whether i trust you or not its not safe but why he hesitated then said just ask him who knew im surprised you trust me to do that what is it a kind of test its important then ask him yourself im tired of playing mata hari first him now you if i dont know what youre doing i dont want any part of it you are a part of it thats the other thing find out if he told them about you if anyone in washington knows about you me lets hope he took all the credit he looks the type old matchmaker jeff what would he tell them that you arranged it that youve been sleeping with me so what somebody might get the idea that i confided in you that you know why too he stopped letting it sink in ask him and tell him we both think its suicide can you make him believe that she nodded slowly her eyes wide then she reached out and touched his arm lightly tentative we have to talk about things there isnt time now an echo somewhere in the back of his head there isnt time i never meant she looked up a new thought nick whatever it iswhat he told you do they know not yet nobody does not even you do you understand but its true youre sure it has to be hes dead he left molly at the corner and turned left toward the tank square his mind buzzing what if foster hadnt told anyone after all what if anna didnt have the list hed have to leave prague with nothing but a history lesson from zimmerman a halfanswer eating away at everything silver safe and sound still sending his useful reports the woman is the key his father had said but that trail had ended in the mayflower hotel as cold now as the snow on the car where shed fallen now there was only the list with the name that could lead him to silver when he got to holeckova he looked back to see if one of the shadows had split off to follow molly but they were both there only interested in him the same hill steep then the gate the concrete steps leading up to the apartment building he stopped when he reached the lawn his eyes drawn to the spot in helpless fascination like a car accident no bloodstains everything cleared away just grass surprised at how much it had hurt you dont have room for anybody else but it wasnt true that elation opening out to her and then the ice pick stabbing at him on the bridge betrayed the way he had felt that night looking at footprints he had thought no one could make him feel that again and here it was the same surprised bleeding now there were two who had done it touched that part of him and oddly some twisted joke they were the only two he still trusted he knew it now looking at the lawn his anger gone you could trust a touch despite everything it came back again and again a heartbeat making room he took the lift avoiding the stairs where the killers had crept past the brick glass or had they clunked their way up heedless not caring if the neighbors heard just following orders anna opened the door at the first touch of the buzzer nicholas come in you got the message he nodded you have something for me he looked around at the bland scandinavian furniture everything was clean almost antiseptic as if it had been scrubbed down come she said leading him to the bedroom where did you find it she looked at him confused then continued into the room he stopped at the door everything the samebed deskbut tidy now no signs of disturbance he looked at the neat pillows feeling queasy did she sleep on them she went over to the desk and brought back a small urn shaped like a squat loving cup the ashes she said simply here i want you to have them he took the urn stupefied it was cool to the touch anna i no its better she looked down at the urn you have them the urn was surprisingly heavy he stared at it not knowing what to say his eyes wandered over to the desk not the list nothing hidden here i cant yes take him home thats what he wanted did he say that did he tell you she shook her head i knew i was his wife he was never happy here only a little take him home so small the tall body reduced to a bowl of ash he could hold it in his hands perhaps you would bury it somewhere he liked at the country house it was sold nick said numbly but no list in a minute he would have to go turn his back on the flat for good leaving the list behind but was it here what had his father said the echo again there isnt time now but why wouldnt there be time if it had been here in the flat with him he was careful the passport had been safe with anna masaryk not at the flat nicholas do you hear me yes im sorry i was thinking if its not possible in the country then wherever you think best she handed him a slip of paper this is the document youll need it for customs so they wont open it its sealed why tell him that was she afraid theyd violate the remains spilling ashes in a clumsy search through the luggage i cant take this you must her eyes on him an order she nodded for him unless it wasnt just ashes he stared at her his father had sent her away that night visiting relatives or a last errand now that she had it shed be careful too speaking in code for the listening walls he looked down at the urn again his hands clammy on the cool metal sealed was it possible his father would carry it out after all thank you nick said finally be careful with it the seal is easy to break i understand another glance so he told you she looked hard at him her face as closed as it had been at the police station nothing she said she led him out of the room at the door when he leaned to embrace her she stepped back awkwardly extending her hand instead na shledanou she said using czech to move away no longer connected to him he carried the urn all the way back to the hotel covering it with his raincoat not risking a tram the room was empty and he locked the door before he sat down at the writing desk he looked at the urn for an edge of wax or plastic but there was nothing but the lid maybe the seal was only a tightly fitted groove like the top of a jam jar he took the urn and tried to twist the cover his hand slipping on the smooth metal a handkerchief he gripped it and tried to unscrew the top what did you do with jars run the top under hot water tap it with a knife he squeezed again straining putting his weight into it then a tiny jerk a loosening and the lid began to turn slowly he followed it around then turned again easier now coming off he lifted the cover and looked in not the blackandwhite ash of a fireplace different an unexpected brown mixed with gray he stared at the urn queasy again human ash he touched it gently as if it might still be warm but it was cool so fine that it left a smudge like cigarette ash he pulled back his hand he took a pen from the writing pad poked it in and stirred it wouldnt be paper film his father had said you could copy things on film even a whole manuscript like frantiseks brothers he pushed the pen through the browngray ash as light as powder but dense as if the pen were moving through fine sand better to think of it as anything except what it was a clink something hard he worked the pen around and hit it again impossible to bring it up like this he reached in with two fingers and pushed the ash aside searching for the round cylinder then he felt it smooth he drew it out careful of the ash and looked at it a piece of bone he dropped it back in the ash his stomach jumping then took the pen again and poked more frantically another piece of bone once more through the ash knowing now that it wasnt there but unable to stop no film his father hadnt told her its here hed said tapping his head nick took the pen out covered with ash feeling sick then he looked at his fingers covered the same way dirty with it and ran to the bathroom and held his hand under the running tap until the smudges washed away coloring the water like faint gray blood he stood against the basin for a moment breathing hard ashamed his hands in it digging like a grave robber but the list had to be somewhere his father hadnt intended to rely on memory he knew theyd want more there just hadnt been time to get it nick went to the desk again staring at the urn as he screwed the top back on bury it somewhere he liked the country house a formal name for a simple cabin reproduced here a private place away from the prying world of course not with another anna masaryk around the corner but there wouldnt have been time for a run to the country hed have to leave without it so it must still be there waiting to be found where nick felt the pricking at the back of his head simple if you knew him people dont change and if he was wrong a wild goose chase but with no other options it was worth at least a try he left molly a noteback later dont worryand rushed out of the room hed have to hurry to get back before dark he ran down the stairs making a plancould he lose the watchdogs in the back streets so that he missed the expression on the desk clerks face when he asked him to call the garage but the police have the keys pan warren there is some problem with repairs i think were you planning to leave prague nick imagined for a second the clerks hand on the phone ready to send out the alarm no no he said quickly its just the trams i suppose i can take a taxi of course shall i call for you ill find one nick said vaguely why had he thought theyd let him go he stood in the middle of the lobby knowing the desk clerk was watching him but unable to move there had to be a way in america there would be fleets of rental cars and drivers for hire but movement was a luxury here the great privilege in a country under house arrest he thought of jeff tearing easily through prague with his closeshaven marine who else his eyes scanned the room and stopped at the entrance to the bar where marty bielak was already perched on his stool who would want to stay closer his legman tempted with a scoop i need to ask a favor shoot its just that i dont know anyone else to ask what can i do for you i need to borrow a car just for a few hours ill pay for the gas mines in for repairs bielak looked at him waiting for more i need to get something you know walter kotlar was my father bielak said nothing too interested to pretend he hadnt known he wanted me to have something you know a memento but its in the country and i dont have any way to get there would you mind id really appreciate it ill take you bielak said almost eagerly you dont have to do that no i do see over hereyoure a foreigner we cant lend he paused apologetic you wouldnt mind im just taking up space here let me get this he put some money on the bar sorry to hear about it by the way to go that way sad must be hard for you yes well im sorry at least i got to see him again thats something anyway why didnt you want anybody to know if you dont mind my asking he said collecting the change he didnt want it he was afraidyou know if the press got hold of it he wanted it to be just family i heard he was sick bielak hesitated is that why he did it a trial balloon for the party line nick nodded i suppose i dont know no we never do do we when they go like that not really no not really bielak got up from the stool what did he leave you anyway that were going to pick up if you dont mind my asking what what would he have left the order of lenin nick said leaving bielak for once with no reply outside he saw the tails come to attention their faces registering surprise at bielaks appearance listen i think you should know that the police have been following me since he died i mean i dont want to get you in any trouble dont worry about it bielak said easily he looked at nick seriously your father was a hero what do they know traffic cops nick caught the tone rival agencies then not colleagues like the squabbling offices in the embassy who did bielak work for it occurred to him a grisly irony that he had inadvertently picked the perfect chauffeur the only way he could ever have left prague without an escort how far is it bielak asked out past theresienstadt oh nice bielak said the country i mean what nick hadnt counted on was that bielak would want to talk using the long drive as a pretext for a fishing expedition casting for information nicks life his fathers health and after a while nick began to welcome the distraction so preoccupied with shaping his answers the careful feints that he had no time to think about what really concerned him what he would do if the list wasnt there a wasted trip but it had to be all of it had to be true everything hed said the questions told him something elsebielak hadnt known about him before which meant his superiors hadnt known either the connection had come out with the death surprising them as much as the police the unexpected son his father had been careful right up to the end the order to kill had come from somewhere else they fell behind a convoy of trucks back flaps open to reveal sitting rows of soldiers when the road opened out to a long stretch bielak beeped his horn and passed waving to them as he pulled in front russians nick said and poles some hungarians theyre here for the warsaw pact maneuvers did he really believe it you never see them in town i thought theyd be everywhere you know since the invasion marty said almost playful thats what they call it in the west some invasion see for yourself you notice they never say nato troops have invaded germany theyre guests only the russians are occupiers but the americans stay and the russians go home when the maneuvers are over so wheres the occupation germany or here its always the same dont believe everything you read in the papers no so when do they go home when the government asks them to right now its useful we could use a little order things go too far these kidsthey play right into the hands of the capitalists and they dont even know it your father understood thats why he came last year to help out nick froze help out how he asked quietly well the czechs wouldnt look at a russian crosseyed but a czechamerican with a czech wife he could talk to anybody and report back selling them the way he had sold sailors who jumped ship in san francisco still in the game not retired not everything true what had he been buying this time the flat with a view a way to bring anna home or the chance to get in the files again get something worth a few dissidents how do you know this did you work with him nick said remembering his fathers easy dismissal bielak squirmed in his seat no no but you hear things he paused he wasnt wrong you know things were going off the rails here they see the flashy cars but they forget what the west is really like he paused but maybe you dont agree nick glanced at him the unlikely defender who still believed in the great dialectic without his wife thousands of miles from the old glen island casino a capacity for selfdeception as limitless as faith what are your own politics bielak said if you dont mind my asking i dont have any nick said my father had enough for one family bielak was quiet you know he said finally when you get to be my age you dont point so many fingers it takes a lot of guts to do something for what you believe in i mean the order of lenin that has to count for something if youre a communist it still has to mean something to you isnt that why you want it it meant something to him its a shame you didnt get to know him better how he thought maybe you have more in common than you think the voice was no longer casual but insinuating nick looked at him amazed was bielak recruiting him was this the way it workedthe awkward fumbling looking for the right spot promising something else like teenage sex i never cared about politics nick said trying to be light i dont think id make a very good spy either i dont even know if the police are still following us no we lost them just outside the city bielak said sure not inept a professional after all the driveway was still muddy ill only be a minute nick said but bielak got out too looking curiously at the cottage now hed have an audience he went toward the woodpile at the side of the house where his father always hid the key but before he could reach down and scoop it out bielak said here we go taking a key from under the terracotta planter near the door nick stopped disconcerted people dont change but maybe the planter was annas idea better than fumbling under logs i figured bielak said if its not the mat its always the flowerpot isnt it youd think people would know better wherere you going i have to take a leak nick said improvising i dont know if the waters turned on go on in well me too bielak said moving away from the house that last halfhour so they peed together at the side of the house backs to each other while nick looked toward the woodpile wondering where else inside he switched on the lamp the same room so familiar to him that he could have moved through it in the dark the table by the window where theyd had lunch gloomy now in the fading light everything spotless still but not his he walked quietly to the desk feeling like a burglar bielak had stopped by the door looking around not much is it no i mean a man in his position youd think theyd he seemed genuinely surprised a little shaken what had he imagined a heros dacha he said they never really trusted americans nick said then seeing the wounded expression on bielaks face instantly regretted it why not leave him his faith when it was all he had left the medal wasnt on the side table now there were two things out of place nick opened the desk drawer and pushed papers aside the list wasnt at holeckova it had to be here somewhere bielak subdued now was looking at the bookshelves nick sorted through clipped articles from russian magazines papers it could be anywhere wedged behind a book think he went upstairs leaving bielak to the shelves and turned into the bedroom the nightstand drawer nothing then annas face creams and tissues he found it on the bureau a flat box next to their picture out in plain sight he opened it to find the medal and its piece of ribbon lying on a square of velvet but what about the other somewhere personal where she wouldnt have looked he went to the bathroom and opened the medicine chest pill bottles about the size of a roll of film he started opening them twisting off caps his fingers clumsy how we doing up there bielak called got it nick shouted down two more bottles nothing he took a last glance at the room where hed helped his father to bed and went downstairs he handed bielak the box a few more minutes okay he said take your time bielak opened the box this is something isnt it he fingered the medal fascinated nick went over to the shelves english books anna never would have bothered with them he ran his hands over the titles pulling a few out squatting to reach the lowest shelf half expecting to find one hollowed out a jewel cache but they were neat and dusted part of annas house too looking for anything in particular no not really he stood and looked around the room hed have to come back alone go through everything but how i guess wed better go he said feeling helpless its getting late it was dark outside and they had to follow the faint shine of metal to the car somewhere she wouldnt have looked bielak got in the car i cant believe it nick said dropping the medal on the car seat i have to go again be right back he went toward the end of the woodpile pretending to fumble with his clothes bielak started the car the headlights were facing away from nick could he be seen from this angle he stooped quickly not caring and felt along the bottom logs for an opening yes where the key would have been as always he shoved his hand through scratching the top and felt around the dirt rummaging again through ashes remembering the moment when he had felt the bone nothing he reached farther groping his arm pressed now against the wood it had to be a place shed never look he heard bielak call you all right over there and then he touched it something cool his fingertips grazed plastic and he pushed a little more until he covered it with his palm the size of a pill container he pulled his hand back feeling slivers biting his skin and put it in his pocket then he stood up and hurried back to the car exhilarated all of it true you left your fly open bielak said im not in that much of a hurry nick yanked his zipper up then put his hand back in his pocket afraid to let go and got into the car ill put the heater on bielak said thinking he was chilled nick drew his hand out and rubbed it against the other playing along but it wasnt the heater that made his face warm as they drove toward the main road he could feel the film in his pocket heavy as a gun the excitement of finding it curdling into a new kind of dread now he wasnt innocent if they caught him they would never let him go he felt the warm lump against his leg all the way back to prague while bielaks onesided conversation drifted in and out like a weak radio signal how would he get it out maybe like this in his pocket where not even a legman would think to look molly and her tampons why not the embassy car on its weekly lettuce run immune to prying then he remembered what it was not a joint something only he could carry he was back in the snow with no one to help when they reached wenceslas nick offered to pay for the trip but bielak shook his head buy me a drink sometime then when nicks hand was already on the door handle bielak held out the medal and said tell me something your father he knew he was sick yes i mean it was that knowing he was sick convincing himself then unexpectedly do you think he ever had any regrets nick looked at him dismayed all that was left no he said firmly never bielak sat back well thats something to think about it isnt it he found zimmerman waiting in the lobby his usual calm betrayed by an impatiently jiggling foot when he stood up nick panicked sure that he was looking at the pocket so youre back a pleasant trip zimmermans voice was angry no where were you at my fathers house you were told not to leave prague i went to get this he opened the box showing the medal and this has a special significance for you you surprise me zimmerman nodded toward the door do you know who he is nick shrugged i met him in the bar you have my car remember again with the charades is it possible you dont know zimmerman shook his head no i dont think so who is he its possible you dont take me seriously that would be a mistake have i not made myself clear to you your position you mean hes one of yours stop it listen to me carefully dont make yourself too interesting a man is questioned his embassy immediately protests he is ordered to stay in prague so he goes for a ride withwith someone who is known to do odd jobs for the security police please dont look surprised there isnt time is that why your men didnt follow us their jurisdiction ends with prague mr warren naturally they thought i would alert the other department but you didnt zimmerman looked away such a call would take things out of my hands entirely the security police have much to do these daysso many dangers to the state its unwise to burden them with false alarms luckily you returned he paused dont do it again you did not i trust confide in mr bielak no nick smiled in fact i think he wanted to recruit me maybe he thinks it runs in the family zimmerman looked at him maybe it does mr warren but that is not my concern i brought your statement he pulled some papers out of his breast pocket sign it please its in czech nick said a lawyers son zimmerman sighed the second sheet is the english sign the copy but am i responsible for all of it the czech too zimmerman handed him the pen sign it mr warren nick read it through a bureaucrats account his fathers distress at his illness in this version the depression had been deepened by nicks visit a new twist he raised his eyes then took the pen does this mean i can go that will depend on the stb but it would be useful i think for them to have my police report before they begin their own speculation that much i can do he gestured toward the medal thats a nice touch theyll like that i hope mr bielak mentions it he will nothing else happened assuming they believe him i wonder mr warren has it occurred to you that you might have compromised him he nodded at nicks surprised look sometimes you know theres nothing so dangerous as an innocent man everyone has to explain him why you picked him of all people he took a breath why your embassy was so eager to help why the policewell the police are so often inept losing people not understanding the implications for the stb there is nothing but implications i hope they dont find you too interesting i hope for example they dont find that you are involved with your intelligence group nothing would interest them more than that not even other czechs nick stared at him chilled was foster right had they monitored the call to kemper how long before they knew about it he stood there feeling the film in his pocket you see zimmerman finished nothing so dangerous well at least you think im innocent nick said trying to be light only of murder mr warren zimmerman said for the rest he took back the paper thank you for the statement dont leave again dont do anything do you understand he turned oh by the way your car is fine what did you say was wrong a knock in the engine yes that can happen a knock for no reason its often the case with a new car molly had doublelocked the door thank god she said where have you been getting this he said handing her the medal box she opened it so thats what anna wanted he didnt correct her did you see jeff she nodded and come for a walk she said raising her eyes toward the ceiling she picked up her jacket then went over to put the box on the desk whats this she said touching the urn my father his ashes she pulled her finger away staring at it god what are you going to do with it take him home she kept staring its so small outside it had begun to drizzle so instead of walking they crossed the street to the broad island in the middle where the trams ran out of the corner of his eye he could see one of zimmermans men leave his car and follow them the evening rush was over only a few people were waiting for the clanging bell of the approaching tram what did he say what you thought he couldnt wait to get back to washington with the news he called them right after i talked to him everything in place who did he tell his boss somebody called ellis who else i couldnt exactly get a personnel chart nick she said wearily he hopes it might have gone up to the director in other words its around people know the agencies were like a sieve his father had said secrets dripping through a hundred holes anybody but i dont have to worry molly said her voice a parody of fosters youll never suspect a thing the bureau keeps things to itself the tram doors opened and they waited for people to get off she turned to him i can keep on going be your playmate nick said nothing they sat at the back of the nearly empty tram zimmermans shadow was in front pretending to read a newspaper did he tell them before nick said his voice low he leaned into her making them a couple out for an evenings ride trying to find some privacy in the brightly lit car she shook her head just that he had made contact the tail turned a page looking in their direction nick put his arm over the back of the seat when she felt it she looked at him surprised as if he were making a pass the man in front is watching us he whispered but she kept her eyes on him not bothering to turn her head he didnt mention you he said i dont think so she said throaty so close now that he could feel the heat of her breath you were right about that too he wanted it to be his show good not for him what happened ellis thought it was a jokethat jeff was being taken for a ride to embarrass the bureau now its not so funny especially since you called kemper to rescue you everybody wants to know whats going on how he died whether he meant it about coming back all of it so theyre all over jeff he wants to call you in when nick said aware again of the film in his pocket how much time did he have the tram lurched to a sudden stop throwing their heads together with a sharp bump she raised her fingers to his forehead touching it gently as if she were soothing away a bruise she left them there a surprise of skin nick she said then the tram started again and he saw an old woman coming toward them with string bags glowering she plopped down in front of them as disapproving and unmovable as a duenna he lowered his head to mollys neck when he said again in her ear molly was shaking her head her face grazing his i said i could handle it handle what she looked at him her fingers now at the side of his head you she said in a murmur intimate isnt that what you want he could smell her now everything close as if the film and her body were part of the same thing the same unexpected excitement i dont want you to do anything its not safe i will though ill do it her eyes on him like a double agent she said softly the phrase itself suddenly erotic ask me no ask me she said in his ear her hair brushing his skin so close he could not tell which of them moved but her mouth was on his the same touch and then her hand was at the back of his neck keeping him close as if afraid hed pull away ill do it i dont care she said her breath on his mouth you believe me dont you she lifted her mouth to him again a yielding when he broke off and nodded his head next to hers he could feel her shake a tremor of release and she began kissing his face moving over him im sorry she whispered im sorry i never meant ssh he kissed her again almost involuntarily caught by the smell of her remembering her opening to him she gave a faint moan and the old woman turned glaring but her eyes were like the hotel microphones making everything illicit more exciting improbably he felt himself growing hard his prick rising to bump against the film its all right now isnt it molly was saying in a rush i dont want to lose you i keep losing people ssh ive been so worried no dont with a burst of czech the old woman made a show of gathering her bags and moving across the aisle molly ignoring her held him closer her face next to his necking ill help you she said kissing him again you dont know what youre asking he whispered out of breath he felt her moving against him the rocking of the tram in a kind of haze yes i do she said nuzzling his ear ive got you back i dont care about the rest he raised his head a little catching sight of their tail in front staring frankly at the unexpected blue movie we have to talk he said trying to bring himself back but molly wouldnt listen her hands on his face not now she put a finger to his lips dont say anything but just keep doing that she smiled leaning her neck into his hand keep doing that putting herself literally in his hands he looked down at her so sure of him and in that second he knew that what he did next would decide everything life could change without even thinking a hairtrigger response everything changed by a second a phone call in union station an accidental bump on the head make room lets go back he whispered his face on hers giving in letting the rest go she nodded absently letting him kiss her and then she looked up at him a glint well make out a backseat phrase his skin jumped like drops of water on a skillet ready for her the windows of the tram were shiny with condensation catching the light of the bare bulbs that lined the warm car outside the city slid by drizzly unseen do you have any idea where this goes he said his face still close itll turn around she said they always go back where they started when they got back to the hotel he only left her for a moment taking the urn into the bathroom shoving the film down into the ashes then closing the door behind him so that nothing else was with them in the room chapter he watched the ceiling turn milky gray and realized it wasnt going to get any lighter another prague morning it was time hed been up half the night dozing fitfully then wide awake listening to her breathe beside him making plans it had become a simple question of mathematics how long if jeffs message had spread through the embassy it was just a matter of time before the talk in the corridors leaked out into prague itself he wouldnt have to wait for silver to act again but how much time did they have people inside and once the czech security police knew they would have to act real interrogations the embassy powerless to help him if they found the film he would be guilty of espionage kept like his father a prisoner here forever all that protected him now was a little time and a discredited policeman unless of course zimmerman wasnt discredited the bad cop after all one of them quietly tightening a noose nick moved his body carefully toward the edge of the bed if he waited he would lose his time finally run out except now there were two of them he looked over at molly sleeping hair tangled her face smooth and unaware in his hands he shaved and showered knowing the sound of water would wake her in the mirror his face seemed drawn and apprehensive and he took a breath pushing his cheeks back to wipe away any trace of fear it had to work she was lying on her elbow the sheet drawn up modestly over her breasts smiling drowsily where do you get the energy she said her voice lazy unconcerned i dont think i can move i told zimmerman id see him in the morning to sign the statement he said dressing not looking at her hmm wake me when youre back it might take awhile he looked at the canvas bag no no things not even the order of lenin still lying on the desk then ill order room service have breakfast in bed like a capitalist maybe ill spend the day in bed what do you think no youd better get dressed where are we going she said sitting up pulling the sheet around her nick walked over to the bed and sat next to her lowering his voice do you really want to help me she nodded no longer playing then listen i want you to go see foster as soon as youre dressed she looked away disappointed you dont waste any time listen to me molly please tell him to get you out of prague in one of the embassy cars they can make a lettuce run tell him youre scared whatever you think would work but get him to do it right away this morning he owes you that much but stay at the embassy until you leave youll be safe there technically youre on american soil they probably wont even know youre theretheyre not following you what about you just you ill come later he wont want me to go tell him to talk to me himself youve had it ill wait for you no this morning as soon as you can he reached up putting his hand against her head dont worry ill come i think i can make this work with zimmerman they wont have any reason to hold me maybe even today tomorrow at the latest wait for me in waldsassen at the hotel ill find you dont leave me she said softly im not leaving you he took her face in both hands help me ive got to settle this i dont want to have to worry about you they dont want me they will its dangerous if they find out about you and foster he stopped her lips with his finger its dangerous for me a beat youd be a liability she stared at him then turned away are you telling me the truth promise me he said bringing her eyes back what if it doesnt work with zimmerman then ill call foster for help i promise he leaned over and kissed her ill be there itll be all right but you have to leave now do you understand she nodded slowly good she leaned over and took a cigarette from the night table i dont want to be a liability she said an edge in her voice youre not he said knowing he should say more but there wasnt time he got up and put on his jacket but it was because of me she said brooding that he wasyou know no not because of you dont think that but jeff called washington its the same thing isnt it your father knew nick stopped no i dont see how he could have then why did he change his plans a wrinkle something that didnt fit i dont know nick said slowly standing still molly looked up watching him youd better go if youre going a small smile youve mussed your hair he picked up the raincoat and went into the bathroom slipped the urn into the folds of the coat and ran a comb through his hair no time when he came back she was still sitting there looking at nothing he leaned over and kissed her forehead the coat awkward under his arm promise me he said and when she nodded again he whispered okay ill see you in germany at the door he turned and for a moment he wondered if this was how his father had felt leaving the small lie sure he could make things right later she looked back at him smiling ironically auf wiedersehen she said he went down the back stairs passing a chambermaid on her way up the lobby was impossiblezimmermans men would stick to him nowbut there seemed to be no back door just a long corridor leading to the kitchen breakfast trolleys lined up outside waiting to be delivered a whitejacketed boy with a tray came out looking at him curiously so he went into the wc locking the door behind him the window was high but large enough if he climbed onto the sink he could reach it then slither out to the back street he stopped he saw himself feet dangling dropping onto the pavement amazing everyone in the street a comic scene from a silent movie keep calm the easiest way to be invisible was to be ordinary he went into the kitchen all steam and banging pots pretending to be lost vychod he said to a girl folding napkins on a tray a word hed seen on exit signs hoping he was pronouncing it properly she giggled either at his czech or his hapless sense of direction and cocked her head toward the end of the steam table a fire door half open to let in some air then he was on the street behind the hotel just another morning walker not even worth a glance he walked up the hill toward the university not bothering to switch back on side streets invisible because he had nothing to hide at the station there was the same rush of commuters pouring out of the art nouveau arch the same uniformed policemen standing guard part of the scene no more threatening than mailboxes he bought a copy of rude pravo and went into the station cafe when he handed over the czech crowns for coffee he wondered if there was a currency form for leaving the country a mirror of the exchange document coming in some small thing to trip him up but crowns were worthless in the west why would they care still a detail he hadnt considered how many others czechs walked literally through a minefield to the wire why did he think he could ride out with a ticket and a visa and a western face as if it were another stroll through the alcrons kitchen he took a table near the far end of the cafe window and tried to imagine everything that might happen his face bent to the newspaper from his angle at the window he could see part of the big hall and the long row of platforms the same ticket window and news kiosk people hurrying across the floor no one loitered the same platform marked berlinprahawien still empty next to it a short train had pulled up but the doors opened only on the right to another platform as if the boxysuited commuters couldnt be trusted to mix with international passengers then nick saw that they were handing in ticket stubs to a conductor at the gate not a plot simple crowd control to ease the morning rush he sipped his coffee and looked at his watch molly would be at the embassy now safe a maid would be making up their room maybe sneaking a look at the lenin medal on the desk everything still there as if they were just out for the morning he was on his second cup of coffee when he saw the men there were two of them not in uniform but with the unmistakable swagger of policemen ready to take charge they spoke briefly to one of the attendants then placed themselves at the entrance to the vienna platform waiting for a moment nick thought they were meeting someone but when the first passengers arrived a family with innumerable suitcases he saw that they were acting as a checkpoint they examined the fathers papers then waved him onto the empty platform this was something new the other morning no one had stood guard at the gate were they looking for him he told himself not to panic in a police state everybody was guilty of something there could be a hundred reasons for a passport check they couldnt know yet that he was leaving he watched them pass another man through with a bored wave then a third maybe it was a routine security check a morning assignment no one wanted their bad luck to come up on the duty roster but it wasnt a routine morning nick was unaccounted for even if they were looking for someone else they would notice him remember him later an unexpected risk how long before the train got to the border if they were looking for him it wouldnt matter he thought of the other train pulling out leaving his father behind his eyes darted around the platform which was beginning to fill up there had to be a way nick when he turned startled he saw only thighs barely covered by a miniskirt then the blouse and her worried face zimmerman came to the hotel to see you she said explaining herself she sat down what did you say i said youd gone to see him to sign the statement she took a sip of coffee but you didnt a reproach no why didnt you tell me does he know im here she shook her head i said hed probably just missed you or you went to see anna first good but how much time did that buy then he looked up at her how did you know you took the urn so she let it go shrugging her shoulders ill meet you in waldsassen she said sarcastic i will i told you you tell me lots of things molly there isnt time for this i will meet you there go to the embassy and bum a ride from jeff ive already got one she said tapping her shoulder bag the tickets still good isnt it you dont understand its serious the security police may be looking for me then wed better get started a promise well meant unaware that it would complicate things i wont be a liability she said reading him take a look over there he nodded toward the platform see those guys theyve been checking passports they may be looking for me im not sure if youre with me theyll arrest you too theyd have to molly looked at the men nervously and nick thought he had finally frightened her but when she turned back her eyes were calm in control then ill go first if they stop me youll know i cant let but she stood up ignoring him then bent down and kissed his forehead if they dont meet me on the train she hitched her bag onto her shoulder wish me luck molly but there was nothing to say that she didnt already know its not a game if i dont make it stay on the train dont come back she looked at him a tiny flicker of alarm then said ill save you a seat she put her hand to her hair how do i look i left in kind of a hurry dont take any chances now you tell me she said softly he watched her walk across the hall bag swinging and onto the platform area if they did stop her what would he do the men looked at her carefully as she dug into the bag for her ticket and passport exchanging glances nick sat up in his chair ready to bolt they were talking to her not the indifferent wave theyd given the others could foster really help if they took her then there was a nod the papers were handed back and she was through it was when they turned to watch her walk down the platform that nick realized another comic moment that what had interested them was not her passport but her wonderful legs but what did that prove they were obviously looking for someone why not him he looked at his watch the berlin train hadnt pulled in yet how long would he have once it did he tried to remember the other morning ten minutes maybe he should go now not make a dramatic lastminute sprint but if they stopped him molly would see and try to help he sat paralyzed trying to think of a way the cafe was busier now a few workmen were ordering morning beers talking sullenly glancing over at him with curiosity an american reading rude pravo he couldnt stay here much longer without attracting suspicion where was the train he lit a cigarette an ordinary gesture and when he looked up from the flame saw zimmerman through the glass walking across the waiting room he was alone without his watchdogs but his eyes were scanning the hall on the lookout nick sat back away from the window and watched him head straight for the berlin platform his movements as lithe and full of purpose as a dancers he went up to the two men who acknowledged him with a nod and huddled with him familiar the conversation seemed to go on forever beyond a courtesy chat as if they were comparing notes zimmerman turned and looked once more at the station floor ticket office to newsstand when his eyes stopped at the cafe nick wondered if he could see through the glare of the glass a policemans radar but he turned back touched one of the men on the arm and walked out onto the platform hed see molly thered be no missing her maybe lead her back to the gate it was the weak link hed overlooked before for an instant nick thought of leaving a quick dash for the station doors a taxi to foster but if he went there now thered be no chance of getting out no friendly hitch on the lettuce run theyd want to know everything and nicks safety would pass through the sieve the same leaks that had killed his father and maybe zimmerman wouldnt stop her after all hadnt he advised nick to go nick put out the cigarette he couldnt stay here in the open he left the cafe and crossed to the right out of the line of sight of the gate and went into the mens room one man washing his hands nick went past him to the end entered the last stall and slipped the bolt on the door he sat on the toilet and took a breath finally hidden like an animal gone to ground but now he couldnt see the view of the platform his eye on the checkpoint waiting for the right moment all gone he was blind the train would arrive without his knowing it he wouldnt know when zimmerman left or whether he was alone his hiding place had left him only sound magnified the sensitive noises of the blind when someone entered the mens room the steps came out of an echo chamber the zipper the splash against porcelain then steps again it went on like this for a few minutes then there was silence he thought he could hear the hiss and clunk of a train pulling in but it might be his imagination he checked his watch now every minute would count but what had happened outside he imagined opening the door and facing a circle of guns trapped the way hed been at holeckova the slam of the door made him sit up steps but no peeing no water from the taps the steps continued not hurrying perhaps searching when they stopped outside his door he could see the neat shiny shoes underneath mr warren nick made no sound drawing further into his hole mr warren open there isnt time but how could he know nicks american shoes as obvious as a billboard nick unlatched the door caught why did you leave the cafe zimmerman said we dont have time for hide and seek molly told you i was there a silly betrayal it would have been so easy to lie miss chisholm trusts me i thought you did too evidently not what do you want nick said standing up i came to warn you those men outside zimmerman nodded stb direct orders from the interior ministry i found out this morning thats why i went to your hotel but you had flown the coop he mispronounced the word like the french coup are you arresting me they want to arrest you i have come in here to relieve myself thats all i saw no one now listen to me for once wait a minute after ive gone then leave here and go straight to the taxis dont even look back maybe youll be lucky then go to your embassy and stay there i cant do that zimmerman looked at him curiously maybe one day you will tell me why it would be interesting but now just go you cannot get on that train theyre looking for you everywhere they smell blood i dont want it to be yours what about molly miss chisholm is getting on a train no one asked me to look for her youre taking a risk with all this no i dont take risks im a czech like the good soldier schweik a worm a worm wriggles he can move the earth without getting stepped on we cant do that but we can move a little dirt he looked into nicks eyes i know who killed your father mr warren we both know theres nothing i can do about that we live under that boot so a wriggle only i wont give them an innocent man what will they do a show trial another masaryk case somebody else to blame we have to live with them let them live with themselves he stopped you must hurry help me i cant do that zimmerman said surprised i just came to relieve myself my friends want me on the platform you see i know what you look like i cant let you get on the train i can do it you just have to distract them you said yourself theyre looking everywhere no one expects me to leavehow could i you have my car i dont even know theyre looking for me do those men really expect to find me here zimmerman looked at him thoughtfully intrigued no not really its a point the car even the stb could not imagine leaving a new car behind he smiled even one with a knock i only need a few hours call in marty bielak maybe ive gone to the country again somehow that would be enough time yes zimmerman said considering they wont stop the train at the border if i never got on in the first place their own men will know i didnt zimmerman sighed you have the adventurous spirit mr warren but you cant do it you know they have orders to check everyone if you get on that train youll endanger miss chisholm go to your embassy what makes you think theyre not watching there if i were the stb its the first place id stake out i wouldnt even have time to pay the taxi before theyd nail me zimmerman acknowledged this by not saying anything help me nick said closing it a wriggle zimmerman looked at the door an evasive spotcheck then back at nick what do you want me to do just distract them he glanced at his watch the train must be there i only need a minute pretend you see me somewhere else in the station someone who looks like me he added just get them away from the gate and if i cant try no if i cant i want you to go to the phone and call your embassy have someone pick you up outside is that understood i dont want you on my hands mr warren and i dont want you on my conscience either ill never forget this i hope you will for my sake zimmerman turned to go oh one more thing dont sit with miss chisholm my friends are thorough they may search the train nick looked at him distraught hed never escape a search you have a fondness for lavatories zimmerman said stay in the wc ill try to check those myself and then a courteous nod and he was out the door nick looked at his watch could zimmerman manage it in a minute a sighting near the ticket windowsomething the door opened and nick recognized one of the cafe beer drinkers he glanced at nick then turned to the porcelain trough mumbling in czech nick washed his hands and dried them slowly on the grimy towel roll a minute now if he waited the man might want to talk he picked up his coat still covering the urn and walked out he went out to the track area on the right as if he were heading for another train at the entrance he bent to tie his shoe hidden by one of the pillars zimmerman was leading one of the men away toward the newsstand but only one the other stood as before unmovable of course what could zimmerman have said to make them both move away the berlin train was there a long row of open doors waiting for straggling passengers everyone else was already on no time nick stood up shielded by a group of passengers heading for the short commuter train the policeman never turned focusing only on the berlin platform nick moved with the others onto the commuter ramp passing a signboard of indecipherable czech names it was more crowded than hed expected but no one else was carrying luggage either so no one seemed to find him unusual except for one woman who stared at his shoes he walked to the end of the train about two thirds the length of the berlin train and got on the nexttolast car open seats not compartments a few people reading newspapers and eating rolls he didnt turn into the seating area but crossed to the opposite door pulled down the window and looked out just getting some air the berlin train was a few yards away across the empty platform its passengers visible through the windows so simple if they didnt see he stuck his head carefully out the window no zimmerman just the lone watchdog looking toward the station hall now there was a rustling behind him someone getting on a woman with a heavy shopping bag he pulled his head back until she passed into the car then looked again still clear he turned the door handle slowly and pushed nothing he looked down at the handle amazed he had only a minute he jiggled the handle and pushed hard trying not to feel frantic he saw himself trapped carried away to some unknown czech town his chance gone he slammed the handle was it stuck no locked sealed from the international platform he felt around it afraid to bend down and really look if it needed a conductors master keybut there it was the oblong deadbolt he turned it his hand slippery with sweat heard the loud click and swung open the door free he glanced toward the station as he closed the door behind him alone on the platform vulnerable three of them now but only zimmerman facing in his direction he caught zimmermans quick look then saw him draw the others into a small circle holding one on the shoulder to keep their attention seconds nick stepped across the platform when he heard the shrill whistle his heart stopped then instead of shouts the yells of pursuit he heard the thunk of a closing door and saw one of the attendants walking down the platform bored and poky slamming shut the open doors getting ready to leave nick jumped into the car out of breath as if hed been racing to make the train the same open seating arrangement like an american train no class compartments he turned left into the car and started down the aisle looking for molly but what if she were in frontcould he risk backtracking pretending to look for a seat when there were so many available a small family looking harried with piles of suitcases russian jews businessmen no tourists everyone looked up as he walked by frankly curious where was she shed never leave without him despite the promises if he didnt appear shed get off the train then get stuck with the mess his leaving would cause why had she gone to the front but there she was staring out the window anxious when she saw him she smiled and began to remove her jacket from the seat but he lowered his eyes shaking his head as he passed her he went into the next car to put distance between them and found the wc at the end almost there he turned the handle another lock a womans voice behind the door he saw the besetzt notice above the handle occupied why now but maybe it wouldnt matter maybe zimmerman had taken them away for a beer he peeked out the stillopen door onto the platform they were getting on the train all three of them as the conductor methodically shut the doors he wanted to bang on the wc door tell the woman to hurry up he couldnt wait here theyd spot him down the long connecting corridor he knew because he could see them far off beginning to move through the cars coming toward him he slipped across the car to the opposite door the same kind of bolt he turned it with a heavy click and swung the door open on this side there was no platform just tracks two sets of them no train waiting at the next platform he looked down too far he could jump down wait it out but then he wouldnt be able to reach the handle to get back in he looked at the side of the train smooth only a narrow runner of metal trim but maybe just wide enough if you were desperate he put on the raincoat wedging the bulky urn into the deep inside pocket what if the runner didnt hold his weight but it was a german train solid workmanship he was about to risk his life on a national cliche he reached along the car to grab the windowsill then swung one of his feet onto the trim and found a toehold with his free hand he closed the door behind him then crouching moved his other foot onto the runner his feet slipped a little but he held the windowsill tightly his whole weight supported now by his fingers then his shoe caught and he flattened himself against the car like a barnacle hanging on with fingers and toes how long could he keep it up already his fingers felt the pressure it occurred to him that everything he had done up until this moment could be explained away somehow now hed run out of answers hanging on to the railway car where anyone outside might see him he had become visibly absurdly a fugitive only sounds again like the mens room the conductor slamming the platform side door another door closing with any luck the woman leaving the wc but too late now a loudspeaker in the station scratchy the engine humming if the train started moving hed never make it the jolt would throw him from the car then voices indistinct finally zimmermans loud as if he were announcing their presence as they moved through the cars nick felt sweat running down the side of his face worse his fingers were getting numb come on then the voices were nearer a door opened no he heard zimmerman saythe check on the wc and they were moving into the next car now he couldnt wait any longer his breathing was ragged as if his fingers were gasping for help gripping even tighter with his right hand he slid his left toward the handle straining terrified hed slip it turned smoothly without a sound and then he had the door open and was moving his foot inch by inch until finally it was there and shifting his weight to the supporting handle he dragged himself back inside he was panting how much farther along were they he glanced toward the wc door frei he had to risk it he couldnt stand in the open back of the car waiting for conductors and attendants to look at him in surprise dont slouch act normal he took a breath straightened and quickly crossed over to the door he jerked it open and went in waiting for a cry of discovery instead there was another whistle on the platform a louder throb of the impatient engine he clicked the lock behind him besetzt another few minutes and the train had still not moved how much longer would they be a cursory second check just to make sure he took a rough paper towel and wiped his face his shirt he saw had begun to soak through his fingertips were red then he heard them doubling back through the car presumably on their way out zimmermans voice was disgruntled fed up his time wasted steps in front of the wc a burst of czech ano ano zimmerman said bored a knock on the door he had to open it a refusal would be the end but what if they were all standing there looking in he turned the lock and opened the door a crack zimmerman stuck his head in meeting nicks eyes his colleagues inches away i dont take risks a worm nick closed his eyes waiting ne zimmerman shouted to them and then to nick apologetically trominte pani he bowed his head and closed the door when the train started with a jolt nick was pitched to the side of the narrow cabin the window painted over for privacy had no view he could hear the slow moving of the wheels then the clicks as they passed over the points in the yard switching left gathering speed until the car was rocking steadily on its way they would be passing through the dormitory towns now drab concrete towers with washing hanging from the balconies he opened the door and started toward molly balancing himself in the center of the swaying car you all right she said when he took his seat next to her still breathing heavily youre sweating through the window the country was racing by in a blur he took her hand and held it then an uncontrollable nervous reaction broke into a grin almost laughing out loud how did you get past them but all he said was we made it still grinning in a private haze of wellbeing were not out yet she said but she smiled back catching his mood i thought i was going to throw up you she nodded we just learn to put a good face on it girls in case you havent noticed he looked at her then down at her legs they did i told you i could help she said then looked at him seriously i did didnt i telling zimmerman i didnt know what to do i thought what if ive given you away but he seemed so worried you were right then on the train he never said a word didnt even look at me i didnt know what was happening except that they hadnt got you yet he didnt want them to know about you theyd have taken you off he touched her arm it doesnt matter now we made it he leaned back and reached for a cigarette looking out the window content just to breathe no more buildings just trees what happens now molly said after a while we stop at brno i think then the border no i meant after he lit the cigarette we finish it we find out who killed her oh nick i dont care about that its the same person who killed him in washington she said slowly thats what this is all about she turned to him whatever it is a question when were out of the country he said answering it for my own protection dont you think its a little late for that no i dont want you sticking your neck out for me you still dont get it do you she said stick my neck out im in love with you he stopped out of nowhere like the whistle on the platform a rush of adrenalin dont say that why not he looked at her helpless i dont know what to say back she smiled you dont have to say anything back i just thought youd like to know he leaned over and kissed her just brushing her lips tentative as if he were looking for words stick my neck out she said her face close my god but if something happens she put her mouth on his they were still kissing oblivious when the conductor came into the car trailed by the customs inspector nick sat up embarrassed then saw instantly that shed brought him luck again the men were amused raising eyebrows at each other glad of a break in the routine up ahead tickets were taken bags hauled down from the overhead rack the luggage still not over in a panic nick tried to think of the right excuse our things were sent ahead were just going to vienna for the day none of it was logical theyd notice someone without luggage but in the end they didnt even ask american the conductor said smiling as he flipped the passport i have brother in america detroit you know detroit nick shook his head new york ah new york you have good time in prague for a second nick wanted to laugh hysterical a wonderful time but the man was addressing molly flirting his eyes on her legs its very beautiful she said the standard answer how many times could they hear it like yourself the conductor said courtly handing the passports back they had begun to move along when the customs officer noticed the urn on nicks folded coat and said something in czech what is the conductor asked evidently translating nick felt his palms grow slick ashes he said then pointed to the end of the cigarette ashes my father the conductor frowned something that didnt make sense open please nick picked up the urn unscrewed the top and held it out ashes he said again ah ashes the conductor said pretending to understand he rested his finger on top preparing to go through it what did he expect to find drugs jewelry there had to be a word krematorium molly said suddenly giving it a german pronunciation catching the man just as he was about to poke inside he stopped and made a face squeamish looking at a corpse and handed the urn back to nick he spoke a line of czech to the other threw an odd look at nick then gave it upamericans were inexplicableand moved down the car to harass traveling czechs nick screwed back the top relieved and put the urn under his coat his father had made it out youre shaking molly said watching him what was that all about have you got something in there nick nodded i dont think i can go through this again that was like the station what are you doing youve got to tell me nick looked at her the worried eyes in his hands willing to walk through a gate sick to her stomach yes he said everything he sank back against the seat and began to talk his voice low almost a murmur so that the other passengers thought they were simply a couple making plans molly said nothing afraid he would stop if she interrupted but her eyes talked back wide and interested then grave finally intimate part of it now outside they were passing through a schweik landscape passive gentle hills wriggling across the countryside once they paralleled a road passing a car and nick thought of zimmerman driving his colleagues through the same rolling country to the empty cottage giving nick time shrugging his shoulders when they got there mistaken again another glance at his watch how much time it would only take a phone call to the border but who would leave a car after brno even molly became fidgety maybe we shouldnt sit together nick said in case you leave and ill scream you dont have to go on with this now that you know its dangerous will you stop she glanced up a hint of her old spirit at least youre not boring god imagine spending the rest of your life with jeff foster im serious so am i cant you see im just nervous how much longer anyway but the border when they got there was empty and placid as quiet as the crossing where theyd driven in the train screeched to a halt then idled while czech guards in gray uniforms boarded and did another passport run to make sure everyone was stamped for vienna the conductor following beamed at nick and said american as if it were a kind of secret handshake minutes passed nick watched the guards move through the cars examining papers everything in slow motion one phone call maybe this is how the russian jews felt waiting for the cage door to open molly sat rigidly not saying anything he was sweating again out the window the conductor was talking to one of the border guards on the tracks this one in blue what did the uniforms mean nick looked toward the control shed at the crossing its roof laced with wires where the call would come in more minutes then the clump of boots the guards getting off the train a whistle and the barrier gate began to rise the engine grew louder revving up but the train stayed in place as if it needed a push then the car began to slide forward slowly into the nomansland between the barriers another crossing gate going up another group of uniforms waiting and they were across shuddering to a second stop as the austrians got on nick looked behind the czech gate was going down were they technically in austria beyond recall the new guards speaking german were perfunctory but correct somehow more sinister than the shaggy czechs like movie nazis they stamped passports and moved on efficient nick kept looking back toward the czech sector expecting to see someone running out of the signal house waving his hands but it had to be all right now and a few minutes later it was the train picked up speed leaving the border behind streaming into the woods molly took his hand and squeezed it but he was too drained to respond he had been so focused on the crossing a pinpoint of space that everything beyond seemed a blank vienna what if the embassy knew had people waiting for them he moved his hand feeling the urn just as deadly as before but what did the film actually say they were out but the air wasnt free full of questions everythings going to be different now molly said squeezing his hand again but it wasnt the landscape was the same unassuming hills and fields it still wasnt finished theyd want him if they knew but they didnt not even silver they might watch but they didnt know if he was careful nothing was different even the fear was the same not left behind barbed wires it stayed with you like a new sense there was no geographical alchemy you took prague with you part iii naming names chapter larry was furious and wounded they had lunch in the quiet dining room of the knickerbocker overlooking fifth avenue because he wanted to avoid the communal table at the brook but even here so private that business papers were not allowed at table people came over to say hello a hand on the shoulder and an innocuous comment about uncle hos keeping him busy and who was the fine young fellow with him larry put on his van johnson smile but nick could see his irritation each interruption wasting precious time it was a typical larry meeting caught on the run with a return plane to paris waiting a phone call expected so that nick became marginal someone hed managed to fit in but nick hadnt wanted it either molly had taken the film to a photographer friend downtown and nick had watched it drop into her purse with dismay afraid to let it out of his hands for even a minute outside with its swarms of bright yellow taxis new york was rich and busy and filled with sunshine everything prague was not but all he could think about was molly being followed or the photographerhow good a friend amazed at the pictures appearing in the fixing tray but larry had insisted he had only the afternoon so they both sat there prickly like pieces of tinder ready to ignite when larry said chicken salad and iced tea two nick wanted to jump on him i can order myself a kid again why didnt you say anything to me thats what i want to know what the hell did you think you were doing i told you he didnt want anyone to know well thats typical isnt it i suppose you know your mothers a wreck for christs sake traipsing around behind the iron curtain without telling anyone now of all times what do you think im doing in paris going to the louvre did you ever think how this would look for me no larry i never thought about that well thanks very much it had nothing to do with you of course it did youre my son i was his too im surprised you wanted to see him after everything why didnt you ask me to arrange it if it was so important to you do it the right way not sneak around like this like some he hesitated spy he said unable to resist nick looked at the man his father had thought would help mistaken about everyone to the end except nick whats the right way what would you have said larry looked away id have tried to talk you out of it i suppose what was the point nick all these years the point was he wanted to see me before he died i couldnt say no to that before he died i think he knew larry looked away disconcerted what did he want to tell you he was sorry more or less christ so off you go not a word and the next thing i hear youre in a communist jail i was never in jail and now ive got the fbi all over me did you know your son is in czechoslovakia oh really fucking hoover on the phone now im supposed to owe him one god knows what that favor will be your sons been arrested but we got him out well thanks edgar i appreciate it do you have any idea what its been like they didnt get me out you dont owe him anything well they still want to see you is there something else i should know before they start calling me again whats all this business about him coming back what did he tell you he said he wanted to come home thats all maybe the fbi thought he meant it i dont know why they dont know what theyre talking about well it wouldnt be the first time larry paused he said that about coming back christ what did you say i didnt say anything it wasnt real larry just some dream he had and here with the sun flashing on the yellow taxis was it anything more how could he think come home he must have been out of his mind yes he must have been nick said an edge he killed himself larry stopped and looked down embarrassed im sorry i didnt mean nick said nothing letting the moment hang there everything awkward the chicken salad arrived larry sipped his iced tea they said you found the body that must have been he switched tack avoiding it how did he do it they didnt say he jumped off the balcony nick said matteroffact jumped its an old prague custom like jan masaryk yes larry said surprised at the reference i remember another awkward pause a sip of tea that doesnt always work was he still alive when you found him larry asked his tone almost delicate talking around it like asking a cancer patient the details of his medication because you couldnt ask how it felt to die no no last words nick said it must have been terrible finding him stay away from it thats why they thought i killed him at first it wasnt jail you know just a few questions christ what a mess larry said youd think hed have waited not while you were still there i dont think he was thinking about that larry nick said no a quick step back maybe its because i was there his seeing me thats what the police think larry grabbed his arm across the table almost violent dont you think that ever dont you do that to yourself then he pulled his hand back and looked away hell he said general meaningless like shaking his fist in the air he picked at his salad letting the polite room settle around them what was he like he said finally as if they were just making conversation the same different he was sick i met his wife whats she like a russian no czech they met in moscow though she didnt talk much he wanted to talk about old times old times when i was a boy nick said not politics not what happened no i guess he wouldnt jokes we used to have you know no i dont larry said irritated then caught himself never mind what else nothing we went to the country we went to a benny goodman concert god he was just happy to see me i thought so anyway i had no idea he was thinking about no he was always good at that the old kotlar twoface come on larry he sighed and nodded an apology what else how nicks heart had turned over that first night at the wallenstein putting him to bed his face at the gallery gazing at the fatted calf the bottomless regret none of it he showed me his order of lenin nick said instead well he earned it larry said sourly im sorry nick a couple of jokes and old fishing stories i remember other things i remember you the way you walked around looking like youd been kicked in the face i remember it too larry nick said quietly he shouldnt have done it larry said as if he hadnt heard making you go there all these years and he just crooks his little finger like nothing happened jokes ill bet he was charming he was always charming he spoke the word as if it were a kind of smear he charmed me well theyre all good at that all smiles you ought to sit across a table from them day after day not an inch they dont want us out they want us to keep groveling showing you his medalwas that supposed to make you proud what do you think he got it for nick stared at him amazed at the outburst larry put down his fork and looked out the window visibly trying to retrieve control he shouldnt have done it he said you might have got in real trouble i didnt know you were there nick waited a moment im sorry you were worried but nothing happened im back he wasnt charming he was a sick old man now hes dead its over he paused whats this all about i dont know larry said still looking out the window then he turned back to nick his eyes thoughtful maybe im jealous its hard to share someone he picked up his fork then put it down again as if a prop would distract him you were so stubborn like an animal you wouldnt trust anyone and i thought im not going to let this happen to him okay at first it was for your mother i never thought about having a kid not even my own you were just part of the package but there you were you wouldnt give an inch either he paused a smile just like old ho maybe you were my special training but then it changed a little then a little more the funny thing was i wasnt winning you overit was the other way around i loved being your father all of itall those things i didnt expect christ those hockey games he looked up i thought you were mine you remember the way people would say we were like each other and youd give me that look our little secret but i loved it when they said that we are a little you know i see myself in you sometimes i dont know how that happens of course i dont see myself farting around london when you could be making something of yourself here well i had to say it but i know you will he looked straight at nick youre the hardest thing ive ever done so maybe im jealous when someone has you so easily one call and you come and if you called i wouldnt well you like to be the only one maybe its wrong i never thought id have to share you but i do so ill learn even with him i thought walter was a foolim sorry i did i cant pretend but i dont want you to think i am too i dont think youre a fool well you will if i go on like this a little unexpected isnt it maybe im getting old a little fuzzy but a stunt like this christ nick wait till hoover tells you your kid is locked up somewhere larry paused and nick saw the hint of a question in his eyes but its all over now yes its all over larry glanced at his watch i have to run im sure youll be relieved to hear go see your mother shes expecting you you might skip the body detailsyou know after he fell shes been it brings everything back so maybe just the old jokes and how you werent in jail he paused a glint and his wife he got up and started out nick following i shouldnt leave her but ill be back friday its like the shuttle back and forth to paris every week they love facetoface in washington these days i dont know why maybe they dont trust the phones well theyre right remind me to tell you the latest about nixon and old edgar the war of the roses to tell you the truth i dont mind the planes no calls you get to read the papers they were on the bright marble steps traffic honking the quiet formal rooms behind them like some misplaced dream of london by the way whats with the hotel youve got a perfectly good room at home sitting there im with a girl really larry said interested serious but nick ignored it were only here for one night to see you we go to washington tomorrow whats in washington friends what friends nick smiled at him the suspicious parent hers this must be your car how do you know its black and important big aerial isnt it wise guy larry said fondly by the way did you get a call from jack kemper larry looked at him suddenly alert no why hes with the cia in london i used his name i told the embassy in prague i was working for him thats why they got me out not the bureau you dont owe hoover anything larry blinked taking this in how do you know hes with the cia you told me at the bruces party larry looked at him then smiled an insiders laugh who said my kid couldnt think on his feet theyd better watch you well they may and you i heard kemper was upset thats why i thought you should know thanks for the tip larry said taking his hand but nick leaned over and hugged him larry held him for a moment surprised and pleased im glad youre home he said no longer joking an apology for the lunch get us out of vietnam nick said as larry got into the car im trying believe me he said then rolled up the window and the car slid toward fifth avenue the photographer was in a rundown building on delancey street near the bridge two unlit flights up you nick man he said opening the door a crack long hair a face corrugated with old acne scars when nick nodded the door opened into a huge empty space with exposed pipes littered with tripods light cables and back screens the living quarters seemed to be a camp bed and a trestle table overflowing with chinese takeout cartons a young girl in a flimsy short dress sat on a stool smoking a joint mollys in there he said nodding toward a bare red bulb hanging over an enclosed space your prints are still drying what the fuck are they anyway i mean theyre in fucking russian what had molly told him samizdat nick said samitz who underground manuscripts they have to smuggle them out you know like solzhenitsyn far out want a hit the girl said dreamily holding out the joint nick shook his head im not going to get in any trouble or anything right the photographer said no nothing like that i appreciate your help hey no problem old molly samizyet he said shaking his head what kind of photography do you do nick said to make conversation fashion he said grinning the girl giggled molly came out stuffing an envelope into her bag hey thanks richie she went over and gave him a peck on the cheek you do great work fucking a you got them all dont leave nothing in there all here she said patting the bag ill see you okay yeah say hi to your mom as they were leaving the girl with the joint began lifting the dress over her head her body as thin as a childs the people you know nick said when they hit the street bright after the dark stairs richie we went to high school together she laughed to herself in the glee club they stopped at a bookstore on fifth avenue to buy a russianenglish dictionary whats the point nick said we cant translate this itd take months no but we might get some idea what it is what were you going to do get one of the girls at the un would you mind taking a look at these just a few espionage documents i happened to pick up by the way do you have a safedeposit box or something for the negatives no ill put them somewhere at home i have to see my mother anyway alone nick nodded a little too early to take me home to mom huh a little too early for mom shes got other things on her mind okay maybe ill run up to bronxville and see mine since were being so good but youll be back tonight hmm she looked at him im not that good besides i always wanted to stay at the plaza how rich are you anyway he smiled rich and catholic you are catholic arent you baptized anyway shell die shell just die the photographs in impenetrable cyrillic seemed to be a series of reports not a simple list see how theyre dated up here like memos this is impossible molly even if we figure out the letters we still have to translate the russian well the numbers help we can figure out the dates she said eagerly and see the words in block capitals they all have them its a format if we can figure it out they sign off that way too but the dates once deciphered were all recent none of them reaching back to his fathers time theyre the active ones thats why molly said these are the reports theyre getting now ill bet the caps are names look this ones otto so whos otto a code name nick said then sighed we have to know the context molly look at the datestheyre not consistent its a selection maybe theyre the incriminating ones each one nails somebody if you understand it hold on she said distracted looking something up in the dictionary nick walked over to the window and looked across the street to where the hansom cabs were idling in the afternoon sun serebro molly said running her finger down a page yes come look but nick was still eyeing the street watching the taxis pull up under the th street awning she brought the book over to him pointing to the word silver he said by him or about him by him the signature he glanced at the photograph a report exactly like the others same format so not original typed by someone in moscow from cables by nina perhaps his fathers friend silvers admirer yes but we have to know what it says didnt any of your friends go into the translating business no only dirty pictures she hesitated you could ask your father hed know someone you could ask jeff he answered back want the phone look lets think about this what would reports say not necessarily who they are just what theyre passing on i mean the reports still might not identify them youd have to know who the code names referred to great no we need the context i mean if its a trade report its someone in commerce like that but how would we know exactly who in commerce are you listening to me what are you looking at its a pickup zone nick said still watching out the window so why is that car just sitting there the doorman acts like he doesnt even see it maybe its waiting i dont think so two guys feels like old home week to me let me see molly said getting up accidentally knocking the photographs to the floor shit she bent down collecting them one of thems on the corner so theyve got both entrances covered dont get paranoid molly said still crouched down sorting the pictures ill bet its a divorce this isnt prague remember nick said nothing the man below lit a cigarette well bless me for a fool molly said nick look what i thought they were all alike but look at the end nick came over its a list he took the photograph but of what code names and addresses five of them see thats nw at the end washington theres otto come on we can translate this the street namesll be in english what were the letters for silver she glanced down the list hes not here but someone can lead me to him never mind lets do the others he grinned at her howd you get so smart anyway bronxville high she said look at richie the maid opened the door someone new a thin black woman wearing a housedress and comfortable bedroom slippers shes in there feeling sorry for herself see if you can get her to eat something his mother was sitting on the long couch staring out across the park the room was almost dark there you are she said holding out her arms i was getting worried he leaned down and kissed her smelling the gin on her breath want a light he said reaching for the lamp no leave it its nice like this anyway i look terrible her face in fact was blotchy like a blur sitting on top the sharp edges of her perfect suit and its gleaming brass buttons im having a cocktail she glanced up just one you he shook his head i dont know why i dont really like them she took a sip from the widemouthed glass did you see larry he took a seat beside the couch unnerved by her voicedreamy the way it had been the day after his father left he said you were in jail no nick said the police just asked me some questions im all right she turned her eyes back to the window what did he look like the same thinner not as much hair waves she said absently its hard to imagine nick waited was he happy but she caught the absurdity of it herself before the end i mean she reached for a cigarette no not happy i think he just made the best of it while he could isnt it terrible i dont think i could stand it if hed been happy isnt it terrible to feel that he asked about you did he she said her voice almost eager and then she was crying her face scrunched like a childs im sorry she said running a finger under her eyes i dont know why i mind so much i didnt expect to youd think she took out a handkerchief and wiped her face i must look like hell ive been doing this all day silly isnt it its just that i keep thinking nick looked at her curiously all these years without a word she blew her nose what did he say he wondered if youd ever want to see him again if id ever want to see him again she repeated dully staring at the handkerchief i wont now will i hes really gone not just away somewhere she paused ive never been a widow before all of a sudden youre alone she tried to smile airy nobody to go dancing with hear the songs he was a good dancer did you know no we used to have fun id get all dressed up he liked that and she stopped again catching his look dont worry its just that it all comes back all the fun her eyes went back to the window fixed somewhere in the fading light a silence see him again she said slowly i wanted to see him every day every single day i hope you die shed said i never knew you felt that way i mean after didnt you no nobody did maybe i didnt myself i thought it would stop she said to herself still staring out the window how do you stop i was in love with him she said simply the rest of it doesnt matter you know not any of it i was in love with him her voice was dreamy again people dont say that anymore do they in love nick looked at her remembering his awkwardness on the train but then we were all like that drugged with it that was our drug all those songs its what everybody wanted to fall in love maybe it was the war i dont know but i did just like in the songs he would just walk into the room she paused just walk into the room thats all and id be she stopped and looked at him am i embarrassing you children never think their parents feel anything her face softened but youre not a child anymore you look so much like him the same eyes he never stopped loving you either a kindness but wasnt it true he remembered the look on his fathers face when he asked about her did he say that her eyes moist again nick nodded not quite a lie no you never stop i dont think i realized it until i heard she turned back to the window i thought he took it with him everything the way he took the fun and then i heard and it all came back he was there all the time nobody else i didnt know she started crying again shuddering shaking her head nobody told me id miss him nobody told me then youre alone she turned her head a thin wail no louder than a sigh nick looked at her dismayed youre not alone she reached over and put her hand on his arm i know honey i didnt mean it that way she sniffled visibly pulling herself back what would i have done without you its different thats all i mean you have larry i never loved larry she said flatly putting out her cigarette i never loved anyone but your father not for a day didnt you know that no i didnt nick wanted to say but you married him yes i dont know why i suppose to make him stop asking me maybe i thought it would be saferbetter for you who knows why we do things maybe i thought it would be a way to forget her hand was still at the ashtray rubbing the cigarette out i was wrong about that in a way it made it worse all the pretending anyway i did not very fair to him i suppose but its what he wanted hes crazy about you larry she looked up at him larry was never faithful to me in his life not that i cared well at first then it was a relief really i never had to worry about him larry always took care of himself she paused now i am embarrassing you how did you know nick said disbelieving where had he been while their lives were going on oh darling people are always helpful telling you things for your own good i suppose they thought id mind divorce him which is always interesting but you see i didnt care i mean he never flaunted it there was no reason not to go on as we were he was always very fond of you she shrugged ironic a model husband its just the way he is so why should i mind you dont really mean that no not really she said quietly but thats the way it worked out i dont know what he expected marrying me i often wondered i think he wanted it because he wanted it the idea of it but after a while it didnt matter you get used to everything even the looks poor livia thats the only part that used to bother me the way theyd look at you as if you didnt know tim was the worst those eyes like he was praying for you she touched nicks arm you ought to go see him by the way hes had a stroke now they were giving him speech therapy funny isnt it to think of tim tonguetied funny how life works out one day youre she broke off and the next day youre a widow and its all gone she turned to nick im glad you saw him no matter what you were everything to him was it all right when you saw him the way it was i remember when you were little that look hed get on his face she reached for the handkerchief he couldnt get enough of you it was the same nick said suddenly claustrophobic in the dark room the air itself swallowed up in her longing he must have known to want to see you before its terrible knowing like that as if his father had been lying in a hospital bed waiting for the end not being hurled over a balcony the only way she would imagine it now her dying lover nick stood up and turned on the light its getting dark she looked up surprised then nodded into the handkerchief and here i am wallowing theres not much point is there going on like this there she said wiping her eyes again all gone now how about taking an old lady out to dinner well go somewhere nice she stood up and glanced at him i suppose youre dressed it doesnt seem to matter these days ill just go put on my face she stopped ill be all right really somewhere nice lutece nick checked his watch can we get in i mean darling use larrys name she started to move away then turned nick all this about larryi shouldnt have told you that you mustnt mind he cares about you all this otherit doesnt matter really its just life my life not yours she tried a smile well i wont be a minute well have dinner you can tell me everything that happened how he lived all that was he still funny not as funny oh she said a catch in her throat then dismissed it well everything even the bad parts are you sure you want to know maybe its better if yes she said looking at him seriously its important everything about him i have to know all these years nobody would talk about him i was supposed to bei dont know ashamed i guess larry wouldnt i think it embarrassed him maybe he thought it would hurt me but it cant now i want to talk about him she paused looking down her voice faltering you see i didnt know before there isnt going to be anyone else im not ashamed he was the love of my life then she turned and left nick stood for a minute looking at the rich soft room the dull sheen of silver boxes and picture frames in the halflight their old ormolu clock on the mantel then went over to the window across the park the familiar apartment towers had begun to light up majestic beresford el dorado movie castles not the grim hradcany looming over a dark city none of it had to happen all their happiness to protect somebody else i wont be a minute she called from her dressing room her voice almost an echo she took ten but when she appeared she was ready to go out hair brushed back lips red fixed in a smile the prettiest girl at sacred heart how do i look she said you look beautiful her face softened a real smile you always say that molly was late remind me never to complain about czech trains again she said flinging her bag on the hotel bed full of energy at least they run i had to wait an hour and then we got stuck and of course she had to wait with me good old kathleen made me realize why i left home in the first place still it was worth it wait till you see what ive got she looked over at him noticing his distant expression how was your mother sad he said quietly not wanting to discuss it what have you got what they call evidence molly sat poking in her bag take a look rosemarys last letter my mother had it all these yearsnot a word she said she never showed it to anyone because it was too shameful despairing anyway i wheedled it out of her a suicide note the letter was written on old correspondence paper one sheet folded over to make four sides the writing thick and hard almost pressed through so that the ink had barely faded i dont think so look no margins the girlish handwriting running from side to side in a solid block dear kathy thanks so much for the i know things arent easy for you either and i wouldnt have asked but im almost flat ill pay you back when im on my feet again i wish i knew when that will be i honestly dont know what im going to do and when all this business is going to end i could tell from your letter kathy that you think its all my fault but honestly its not please dont think that i dont know how it started its like a bad dream and i just wish it would end the newspapers dont bother me much now but i guess theyll start up again and then i dont know what at least now ill have some for a new dress you ask me if im sorry i got involved with the reds in the first place i suppose you want me to say yes so yes but i still think what they say makes a lot of sense i guess all i can say is that it sounded like a good idea at the time i am sorry that i got talked into doing what i did you know i would never do anything against this country i didnt think it was treason the way they say in the papers i was just helping out for a good cause well i know better now but that doesnt help much i thought one confession was enough at least it wouldnt be on my conscience but i guess washington isnt like the church they always want moreno absolution i thought i was finished with it but i guess i wasnt so i dont know what im going to do pray for me if you think god is still listening thanks again for the give my love to molly and dont be angry with me love rosemary ps youll be happy to hear i havent been seeing my friend i wish i was in spite of everything since this business started its been hard good i can hear you say but hes not what you think hes not even married like the other one so dont worry about that just scared like everybody else here im sort of a famous character here i guess i should leave washington when all this is over but where would i go well maybe god will forgive this too got to run thanks again ill pay you back promise nick read it twice trying to connect the simple schoolgirl scrawl to the twisted figure on the car roof everybody wanted to be in love then whats the evidence he said finally well it has to be some kind of evidence its the last thing she ever wrote what was on her mind a new dress nick said quietly which you dont buy if youre going to not if you have to borrow money for it we knew that you dont take your nightgown either whos the man did your mother say she didnt know just that rosemary was seeing somebody the married one was in new york before she went to washington she and my mother had a big fight about himyou know how wrong it wasso she was probably a little gunshy after that about her love life especially if she was borrowing money from mother kathleen anyway it sounds like he ditched her no i dont think so nick said thoughtfully just scared maybe just careful of a famous character well thats one piece of evidence anyway it wasnt my father he was married at the time unless he lied to her she caught his look well people do all right i dont think he did it either she took the letter back and looked down at it maybe ill try confession too look what it did for aunt rosemary you notice how nothings her fault her conscience is clear pretty crazy the whole thing the more you look at it she glanced up i dont think she was sorry about anything she just wanted my mother to think so the guys not so bad even the communists still make a lot of sense she was just helping out i love the exclamation marklittle innocent me just a bad dream i dont know how it started how hard would it be to figure that one out i dont know how it started but she didnt nick said my father told us she never volunteered they went after her well either way whats the difference the difference is somebody else started it everything that happened but he was talking to himself another conversation and molly wasnt listening give my love to molly she said pointing to the phrase if she saw me twice in her life it was a lot she was probably just getting ready to put the touch on old kathleen again you know my mother thought she was wonderful wild butyou know thats why she kept it ill bet she never thought rosemary was just fooling her too god she wasnt fooling anybody she seems more sad than anything else you keep saying that youve got sad on the brain you need cheering up she reached up and put her hand on the back of his neck tossing the letter on the bed lets forget about them kathleen asked me if i was in new york with a man she giggled so i told her id seen richie i thought shed die so would i if i were your mother but youre not are you no and youre not married no so theres nothing to worry about just my soul she stretched her neck and kissed him heres an idea lets smoke a joint and make love all night she nodded to the ceiling no microphones i liked the microphones he said smiling whered you get the stuff well i did see richie theres no end to his talents he kissed her was he a good kisser are you kidding i couldnt get past the clearasil anyway i dont kiss just anybody no no consider yourself lucky i do he said into her ear a murmur but lets skip the joint we have to get up early we do why our friends down there left after i got in he said still whispering back at the alcron so theyre probably on a shift not working all night i figure they wont get here before seven so if we leave early they wont even know were gone she pulled back surprised as if someone had turned on the news youre good at this arent you i have help youre the one who got the letter maybe you should take it up what are you going to do when this is all over go work for jeff he said i work for jeff she said kissing him chapter they took a taxi at dawn and waited groggy at the eastern terminal for the first shuttle new jersey was a nap and then they were circling washington nick at the window feeling hed entered a time machine twenty years compressed into minutes the monuments lined up as they always had along the mall changeless his house somewhere to the left of the capitol but on the ground everything was different whole streets of boxy new office buildings beyond the white house bland and faceless a discount bauhaus like a rebuilt city in germany they checked in at the madison its ornate ballroom still littered with last nights wedding then went for a walk a few of the trees were still in flower everyone carried briefcases where are we going molly said the mayflower i want to see it and of course it looked smaller the awning he remembered near the car in the picture just an awning the public spaces inside a little tired no longer waiting for trumans car he stood in the lobby for a few minutes creating lines of sight between the reception desk and the elevators and the big room where the united charities ball must have been then gave it up hed imagined it a hundred times the forbidden place of his childhood but it was just a hotel they rented a car a plain buick and started going down the list driving out toward the grand houses on embassy row only to discover that the first address was the russian embassy itself well it would be wouldnt it molly said maybe its like the americans in prague they have to live in the compound no there wouldnt be room they have too many people besides ill bet they like to live out its probably one of the attaches theyd be in residence it would help if we had the real names he put the car back in gear anyway i dont want the russians somebody will she looked down at the paper in her hand valuable little list isnt it yes they killed him for it did they know he had it i dont know he said wearily i dont know i dont know she looked up this isnt going to be easy i thought once we had it he remembered that feeling a jolt of triumph when his hand had felt it under the woodpile five names molly said calmly they cant all be russian the next address was a quiet row house north of dupont circle on a leafy block not far from the phillips collection god youd never think molly said so what do we do just sit here lets see what happens maybe hell come out when the door opened half an hour later it wasnt a man but a whitehaired woman who bent over to water one of the potted plants on the stoop then idly looked up and down the streetan old woman with all the time in the world this cant be right he said impatiently there was no one in the street but a mailman making his way down the row the woman put the watering can inside then came back on the stoop to wait evidently the mail was one of the events of her day she talked to the mailman for a few minutes her mouth moving rapidly with words inaudible across the street even with the car window rolled down look molly said shes getting a lot of mail i mean a lot maybe its not just her in the house you know maybe she rents out she acts like its hers nick said watching her flip through the envelopes absorbed shes just nosy okay ill find out nick said opening the door what are you going to say im not sure but it was remarkably easy an unsuspicious world away from prague he had only to identify himself as someone from the governmentthe washington password checking on her boarders and she leaped at the diversion you mean the russian girl there isnt any trouble is there they told me there wouldnt be any trouble i mean i never had a russian but she seems all right quiet of course she plays these records but i dont mind that really you have to expect things like that when you rent has she done something no no nothing like that nick said we just like to keep tabs see if shes giving you any trouble theyre guests here you know sometimes they forget that we do get complaints really she said interested settling in well no shes good as gold no men coming around of course i dont know what she does on her own time but shes been no trouble to me i wont rent to men just girls thats what mr baylor said before he passed away when he was fixing up the apartments theyll make a nice income but you dont want men in the house its not worth it me being alone of course these days girls are just the same as men arent they but irinas all right its just those language records but i suppose shes learning the other girl doesnt complain she doesnt live alone oh yes the flats are selfcontained they dont even have to share a bath mr baylor put another one in said i could charge more if people had their own place and theyll keep to themselves but of course you can hear the records the way she plays them still barbara never complains so i just leave well enough alone as long as they pay on time thats what mr baylor used to say mr baylor my husband she looked at him where did you say you were from immigration nick said on firm ground now we just like to check thank you im glad theres no trouble no trouble at all shall i tell her you were here you can nick said carefully but sometimes it upsets them you know what its like where they come from mrs baylor nodded i do we dont want them to think its like that here not with a routine check he had taken out a notepad and was pretending to write these last names he said shaking his head arent they something i can never remember either oh well here she said flipping through the mail until she found a store catalogue k at the end kova he glanced at it thanks any time you couldnt do better letting people like her in better than some weve already got nick got in the car and waved to mrs baylor as he drove off irina herlikova he said to molly quiet as a mouse i wonder what she does shes learning the language no for them the third address surprisingly was on d street in a black neighborhood southeast of capitol hill not a slum but tattered the respectable brick fronts frayed around the edges needing paint well at least this ones not a russian nick said we cant stay here two white people sitting in a car no lets just get a look at the house well swing back as if no one will notice but they were lucky the house was in better repair than its neighbors trim a neat front yard and on their third pass a man in uniform came out moved a tricycle to the end of the porch and taking out his keys walked toward a new car parked in front nick turned at the corner and waited lets see where he goes have you ever followed anybody she said her voice eager enjoying it im learning on the job it turned out to be harder than he expected he waited a few minutes after the car passed then rounded the corner to find it idling at a red light dont slow down hell notice molly said green their luck held another block and a car came out of a driveway and put itself between them nick relaxed more blocks the new car moved smoothly never running lights as orderly and correct as its owner but wheres he going nick said theres nothing this way why doesnt he go into town they followed for ten more minutes unhurried and then nick saw the wires and gates the sentry checking passes the black man held out an id badge and was waved through the sentry looked up at nick who turned away pretending to be lost what is it molly said anacostia the naval base i forgot it was down here well that fits doesnt it a little red dot on the sonar screen they drove up around the jefferson monument then out through the park along the river and over the bridge the fourth address was in alexandria not the old town of cobbled streets and ice cream shops but the maze of streets behind lined with twofamily houses anywhere theyre certainly not doing it for the money molly said scanning the street no a better world next to the one on the end they found a space two houses down and parked then sat and had a cigarette another quiet street a few children coming home from school molly looked at her watch ill bet theres no one home not at this hour they must all do something work somewhere otherwise what good would they be i forgot to ask where the russian girl worked well find out its only the beginning you know its not going to happen overnight its not going to happen here at all nick said putting the key in youre right well come back in the morning wait lets find out who he is anyway be right back she got out walked over to the house and rang the doorbell what would she say if someone answered she rang again then looked around once and put her hand into the mailbox pulling out a few pieces and shuffling through them it took a second ruth silberstein miss she said in the car silverstein ber he drove past the house well come back she gets the new republic if that means anything wheres the last one he looked at the list chevy chase god theyre all over the place creepy isnt it no one has the faintest idea you can walk right up and look at their mail they could be anywhere undermining our way of life he said using a newsreel voice well they are arent they we dont know what theyre doing molly maybe theyre just passing on the wheat crop estimates so somebody can make a good deal do you think rosemary was undermining our way of life molly looked out the window quiet just her own i guess maybe theyre just small fry your father didnt think so no names he was willing to sell worth a life what are you going to do after with the list i dont know he said a curve unexpected im only interested in one i mean theyre agents so was my father but they might be i dont know molly what do you want me to do turn them in to the committee i cant it would be like turning my father in besides there isnt any committee anymore its over just cops let jeff catch them i dont take sides yes you do not anymore not with this so ruth silberstein just keeps getting her new republics and doing whatever shes doing i guess that depends on what shes doing so youll decide she said quietly youll be the committee a pinprick sharp yes ill be the committee he said the sound of the words strange as if even his voice had turned upside down whats the address the house in chevy chase was a snug cape cod with shutters and a fussy herbaceous border running along the front in december there would be a wreath on the door and candles in the window a christmas card house the wide glossy lawn was set off on either end by tall hedges to separate it from the neighbors modern ranch houses one with a for sale shingle stuck in the grass there was no car in the driveway or other sign of life you going to read his mail too nick said no its a slot molly said having already looked theyre showing the house next door how do you know see theyre huddling and he keeps looking at the roof the one in the suits the real estate lady you can always tell shes wearing flats with a suit they all do that i guess its hard on the feet nick grinned at her are you kidding me or do you really know all this everybody knows that she said pleased with herself you just never notice things she turned back to the window and watched the scene on the lawn another pantomime of gestures and nodding heads howd you like to live in the suburbs i wouldnt yeah she said still looking out but when you see the right house she opened the door then closed it behind her and stuck her head through the window maybe youd better stay here you look like somebody from immigration he watched her dart across the street and up to the group on the lawn disengaging the woman wearing flats a nod toward the hedge heads together the couple left to the side unmoored a shake of hands the woman rummaging in her purse for a card a smile and a wave every step light and sure when she crossed the street she seemed to move like liquid and he thought of her coming toward him at the bruces party walking into his life like the songs now she was grinning what did i tell you theyre the cia of the suburbs everything his names brown john brown like an alias but then whod use that the house isnt for saleshes tried they wont list it but there are a few others i might like to see just like it hes not married by the wayhe lives with his mother which is odd considering considering what where he works he raised his eyes waiting how much do you love me where she grinned the justice department bingo they couldnt sit there and wait however under the watchful realtors eye so they drove into the next street then the next driving finally because they couldnt stop just being in motion a substitute for something real to do brown wouldnt leave his office until five later if he was the diligent type so they had the rest of the afternoon to kill like a homing pigeon nick found himself drawn back to washington trying to make the streets familiar again we still dont know who the russian is molly said as they passed embassy row again it doesnt matter hed never use a contact from the embassy theyre probably watched as a matter of routine hed never risk that so then there were four unless brown makes one it was when they were passing the bland new buildings on k street glass boxes of lawyers and lobbyists that he saw the sign and pulled up united charities building molly said its just an idea he pointed to the no parking sign move the car if someone comes five minutes he was directed to the events office and a pretty blond girl who looked too young to have been alive the night of the ball a southern voice and perfect teeth the office seemed a mystery to her and nick wondered whether she was paid or just a nice girl taking a semester off from sweet briar doing good works for credit she treated him like a prospective date from vmi all smiles and helplessness a social history do they know about it not of united charities of washington washington society oh she said interested now you want to know about the ball i thought you might keep the guest lists to update them every year is there a file like that well i dont know i tell you what you wait right here ill ask connie shell know another smile nineteenfifty just nineteenfifty unaware that anything had happened then a date from the archives when she returned holding a few pieces of paper she seemed surprised that they existed at all nick glanced at the long row of typed namesthats it he said nodding would you like a copy i can use the machine she said walking over to the copier nick looked at the names as the sheets came out of the machine on page two mr and mrs walter kotlar he saw his mother dressing her offtheshoulder gown i dont suppose they keep a list of who actually attended you know who showed and who didnt show one with check marks or something check marks no this is all there was you know most everybody does show its our big event i was there this yearyou know to help out i hope they let you dance they should well arent you nice back in the car he flipped through the list again i wonder how many are dead he said i still dont see what youre going to do with it molly said did you see at the mayflower how easy it would have been you could go from the ballroom to the elevators without even passing the desk two exits in fact no one would know you could also just walk through the front door whod notice unless you were a bum he glanced down the honorable kenneth b welles he said she looked at him come on john browns body lies amolderin there was traffic and browns car was already in the driveway by the time they got there they sat for an hour watching the house lights come on in the late spring dusk occasional shadows moving back and forth behind the sheer curtains the carriage lamp by the front door was on as if they were expecting visitors a dark corner suddenly visible through the window curtains open the dining room molly said watching look a cozy dinner with mom brown sat at the table his back to them afterward the woman cleared then passed out of sight a light came on at the other side of the house the dining room light was switched off more waiting then they saw the bluewhite light of a television in one of the upstairs windows lets go molly said theyre here for the night give it an hour lets see if anyone comes the front lights still on but it was brown who stepped into it a middleaged man with glasses disappointingly nondescript more clerk than gman he crossed to the driveway quickly and got into the car a few seconds later the glowing red taillights backed out into the street look alive nick said waiting until browns car had turned the corner before he started his own they drove through quiet suburban streets then finally into the busy broad sweep of wisconsin avenue hes going back to town molly said meeting somebody maybe hes just going back to work now that moms tucked in they stayed several lengths behind almost losing him once in the confusion of a traffic circle but he swung onto massachusetts and they found him again and followed unhurried all the way into town the left turn came out of nowhere without a turn signal and nick missed it he doubled back making a uturn in front of an annoyed taxi browns taillights were at the end of the block turning right at the next corner he took a right again heading back to the avenue he knows molly said why would he do that i dont think so hes not trying to lose us no to catch us see if were here look there he goes again another diversion then back into the light traffic maybe its standard procedure to make sure nobodys following before a meeting i always thought they met on park benches they drove past the white house where nixon was plotting the peace then down around the willard and back up th street the old downtown was deserted now abandoned to drunks brown stopped at an intersection just down from new york avenue and pulled over hes parking molly said well its not a bench the storefront was outlined with a marquee of flashing light bulbs its paperedover windows shouting xxxrated magazines novelties peeps c brown walked over looking around furtively and went in a few minutes passed the one place nobody looks at you nick said they dont stay here i want to see who he meets nick crossed over to the store but turned to the window startled when the door opened again brown he glanced toward nick then unconcerned walked back to his car a bag under his arm keeping his head down nick pushed into the store dazzled by the harsh fluorescent glare racks and racks of magazines a riot of breasts and pink skin but no one looking at them in the back a dimly lit room of cubicles for the film loops the place was deserted at the cash register enormous plastic dildoes hanging behind a kid in a tshirt with shoulderlength hair pulled into a ponytail looked bored or stoned that guy who was just in here nick said he talk to anybody who the fuck are you back there nick said nodding at the cubicles he go back there fuck you nick glared at him a cops look you want me to close you down hey man i just work here you see anybody back there its slow you know what i mean he bought a magazine thats all you want to buy one the kid reached under the register and picked up a baseball bat then get the fuck out youre not fuzz i know fuzz you sure he saw the kid hesitate but let it go and turned to the door his hand on the knob whatd he buy a lez mag so he likes lez what the fuck thanks nick said leaving yeah peace hey close the fucking door browns car was still there as nick crossed the street hes just sitting there molly said what do you think hes doing i dont know nick said disappointed beating off he likes lesbians whats wrong with you were wasting our time he wasnt shaking a tail he just wanted to be sure no one saw him buying dirty magazines there he goes lets make sure but the trip back to chevy chase was uneventful no diversions and when he went back into his house the carriage lamp went off now they can both settle in for the night nick said i wonder if he locks his door he turned to molly this isnt working yes it is it just takes time theyre spies we know that sooner or later but how much later lets get another car that way at least we can cover two of them at once she glanced at him unless you dont think i can do it he smiled i think you can do anything all right ill start with ruth you take the russian girl i thought you said he wouldnt use a russian not at the embassy lets see where she works he was in alexandria at dawn but not up before ruth silberstein a small light on upstairs presumably the bathroom he sipped coffee from a styrofoam cup prepared this time for a stakeout twenty minutes later she was out of the house nick leaned forward and looked closely probably in her forties carefully made up dark hair teased into a kind of beehive helmet like the johnson daughters a belted raincoat even though the morning was already warm high heels and a black purse the car keys ready in her hand everything in its place even her walk was efficient like the professional secretary she probably was she got into a volkswagen and ran the motor a few minutes before she pulled away ruth silberstein who are you what do you do she took the direct route to the parkway driving fast breaking lanes the river shiny with sun flew past the window nick got into the lane for the bridge anticipating her but she turned over to the virginia side and he was forced to dodge cars to get back toward the cemetery he stared at the little car keeping her in sight ignoring signs when she pulled off into a side road he had no idea where he was until he saw the vast parking lot acres of it ringing the fivesided building well the pentagon yes early to get a space near the building to minimize the distance in high heels or maybe her boss liked to start early whoever he was who probably thought the world of miss silberstein because she knew where everything was nick watched her walk into the building ready for whatever paperwork came her way running two copies to be on the safe side it was still early so he decided to make another pass at chevy chase the black navy man seemed unlikely somehowwould silver pass on sub designs and brown whatever his taste in magazines was somebody at justice the street still seemed asleep only a garbage truck clanking its way down the row of cans but after two cigarettes nick saw the door open and brown come out his mother on the stoop waving to him after a kiss goodbye he was carrying a suitcase he got in the car without even looking at the street this time he didnt leave wisconsin but headed toward the river past the georgetown cliffs and then over the bridge nick had expected ruth silberstein to take so that nick found himself back on the parkway going in the opposite direction not toward the justice department the car turned off for national airport and inched its way through the crowded winding access roads to the terminals longterm parking lot nick circled around to see if brown actually went into the terminal then pulled into a space and sat not sure what to do the eastern entrance new york or maybe new york to somewhere else for an instant nick was tempted to go after him hide behind a newspaper a few rows behind follow his taxi but what if it turned out to be as pointless as the adult store he drove back to washington anacostia was down to his right the pentagon behind him chevy chase beyond a little necklace of spieswhat did they actually do ringing the unsuspecting city or half of it the only part hed seen he looked up at the capitol in the distance if he kept going straight on constitution hed be there the house on nd street he turned a sharp left never i think he spotted us he said to molly when he got back to the hotel room slumping on the bed going away the next day it might not be the next day to him maybe hes on vacation she smiled slyly thats why he got a magazine for the plane she took out the telephone book and flipped some pages what are you doing im finding out if you want to know something the easiest way is to ask she started dialing what about irina she works at the embassy she said over her shoulder so then to the mouthpiece john browns office please a minute yes is he in please oh and he told me to call today i see well when do you expect him uhhuh all right ill try back no no its just a friend of his mothers she hung up and turned to nick was that hard not a vacation he had to go out of town today she doesnt know why he just called from the airport but i should try back hes very good about checking in which tells us what that he wasnt planning to go something came up i suppose we could try the new york field office but thats probably stretching it i mean what if he is there we dont even know if hes actually with the bureau nick said mm or just someone down the hall so now what well i knew youd be bored while they were at work so i had a little idea of my own remember the police report on rosemary i got the name of the signing officer retired but still alive so i called hell see us i think he was amazed ill bet where does he live actually not too far from ruth silberstein al mchenry he wheezes maybe he drinks still the house smelled of medicine and old age an oxygen tank and face mask standing guard near the lounge chair he made tea shuffling around in a cardigan and slippers its the emphysema theres not a damn thing you can do for it either its all the smokes i guess well just throw it over there he said to nick who was fiddling with the bulky sofa pillow so what can i do for you i wasnt on that case long you know the fbi took it over moved right in the way they do national security noses up in the air all of them like were just flatfeet but i dont see they got anywhere either did they we did everything right you know at the scenethe dusting the plastic bags the whole works the way it should be theyll say we didnt but its a lie we did it all the fact is there was nothing left for them to do thats the truth of it if theres one thing im always careful about its the scene of the crime so you didnt think it was suicide he looked carefully at nick well let me put it this way if it was someone drove her to it right there with her she was entertaining you know thats a crime to me never mind what the book says he stopped and looked again at nick no i never thought it was suicide they didnt either the bureau boys that was just the official line i could never see it they have a lovers quarrel and she gets hysterical and jumps out the window hell by the time she got it open he couldve stopped her no unless he never turned up maybe she got depressed waiting knowing he wasnt coming nick said playing devils advocate oh he was there all right they had a drink now look you dont have to be sherlock holmes to get the lay of the land here girl checks into a hotel no clothes just her nightgownnot the wool kind the other kind you know and she brings her douche he turned to molly pardon then she orders a setup from room service for two mind you ice bottle mixer two glasses id say she had company but no one saw anybody going in no that was a bad break you know hotel people notice everything cant wait to help you out whether theyve seen anything or not gets them off work but that nightwell they had everyone running around with that dance people everywhere nobodys got time to notice anything like somebody leaving the dance and taking the elevator to the sixteenth floor mchenry looked up from his tea i thought about that too couldnt prove it though couldnt prove it might have been anybody the only one i can prove went into that room was the waiter and he didnt see anybody no hadnt got there yet but she was getting ready for company said she was putting her lipstick on when he brought the setup then how do we know he was there there was liquor in both glasses why pour two prints no mchenry said slowly looking at nick as if trying to assess where the question came from but he was there he was there and he killed her im sure of it because both glasses had liquor because it makes sense and there were the marks on the window he waited for nicks reaction you see i thought to look even a flatfoot could figure that out they had those sash windows you know you lift it up he stood up to demonstrate now you dont usually push someone out face first i mean what would they be doing at the window in the first place getting some air usually their backs to it and you surprise them they dont know theres nothing behind then they start falling and the natural reaction is to grab on to something like this he turned his hands around and lifted them as if he were holding on to the sash then fell back in the chair the nails dig in you see then they slip or someone loosens them for you and down you go but youd leave the scratches and she did yes sir she did but i couldnt prove that either he gasped out of breath from the demonstration and sucked some air from the mask these days thered be all sorts of ways just one little flake of something under those nails and the lab boysd have it licked in a minute but back then he took more air we just had eyes the report says you found a lighter nick said getting to it yes i did my fathers yes so you think he killed her no i dont he said flatly looking up at nick does that surprise you you thought he did is that it well he didnt im not trying to be nice as far as im concerned he was a traitor id have put him away for that in a minute but murder thats something else thats police work i suppose it isnt easy having a traitor for a father course mine thinks he has a fool for a father so take your pick but you dont have to have this hanging over your head too no i dont think he did he took a deep breath wheezing slightly then continued everybody else thought so everybody wanted it to be him nothing makes me more suspicious than everybody wanting it to be someone i think you know they just wanted to nail him for something they couldnt get him for what he did do but if they got him for this it sure as hell would look like he did the otherwhy else kill her of course in the end they couldnt get him for anything you cant try a man who isnt there not even the bureau he smiled i have to say i guess they were frustrated the bastards they keep the murder stuff out of the papers thinking theyre going to get himyou know pull the rabbit out of the hat the way they liked to do i kept my mouth shut they want to say its suicide fine i cant prove otherwise i can see theyre just waiting then by the time they find out where he is its too late who gives a rats ass you cant hang a man who isnt there you cant even accuse him no point if youve already proved your point that hes a traitor nick said thinking well he gave them that one himself from what i saw they werent going to prove nothing but i guess he was right to go for him i mean they sure as hell would have got him for this he had the motive all right and you had the lighter why didnt you think it was him well there was a funny thing about that lighter very funny i thought no prints none wiped we dusted right away dont let them tell you different i knew about prints we got hers all over the place but the lighters all smooth and clean you asked before about the glassno prints there either now that i can understand you have a drink you kill somebody you wipe the glass nobody knows youve been there but whod wipe their own lighter and then leave it behind so wed find it anyway somebody who wanted it found mchenry nodded right i mean if youre worried enough to wipe it why not take it with you somebody else planted that lighter who that i dont know they were all out to get him but whod want to get him that bad like you said he had the motive and we had the lighter case closed even if you didnt think he did it well it wasnt my case was it no nick paused you know the lighter never appeared in the bureau report it didnt well they sure as hell had it i gave it to them myself in a bag sealed everything the way it should be why wouldnt they mention it that i dont know either who knows why they do anything there its all politics over there not police work who did you give it to who specifically the guy running the case the canuck french name la something he snapped his fingers lapierre thats right one look hed freeze your blood snotty little bastard again to molly pardon anyway thats who had it after that i dont know maybe they got it over there with dillingers prick who knows do you know where he is now no idea still there for all i know well twenty years he did a mental calculation maybe not not with their pension i wish i had it not this chickenshit they give you on the force he waved his hand around the room living proof you want to see him too maybe theres something else well i doubt it like i said we did everything right what are you expecting to find anyway who did it no just who didnt my father did a lot of things but i never thought he did this i just wanted to be sure anyway thanks im sorry to bother you no bother no bother what else would i be doing but hacking my lungs up he walked them to the door reluctant to see the meeting end his eyes lively with interest back on the case one other thing that never came out not about your father he said to nick about the girl it was really out of respect to the family this to molly tentative we figured they had enough on their hands already terrible thing suicide for a catholic molly looked at him waiting maybe she didnt know it herself mchenry said she didnt need the douche she was pregnant molly was thoughtful in the car is that possible nick said not to know i suppose for a while anyway maybe she did though maybe thats why she wanted the money not for a dress a good catholic girl its been known to happen i dont know remember in the letter how she made this big point about his not being married ill bet she thought it was going to be all right once they got past the hearing i wonder if he knew she moved her hand brushing the thought aside anyway you dont kill somebody for that you get it taken care of he did molly worked her phone magic again with the justice departments personnel office pretending to be unaware that her old friend had retired and got lapierres address out in falls church they decided not to call first what if he says no nick said but when they got there a condo development pretending to be colonial row houses there was no question of his not opening the doorhe was in the garden a slight man still wiry digging on his hands and knees when he got up slowly his whole body seemed wary not standing but uncoiling his face was blank when they explained themselves then drew even further behind an official wall but his eyes stayed on nick curious as if he were looking at an old photograph i cant discuss cases its not a case anymore nick said the statute of limitations was seven years on espionage not murder he wiped some dirt from his hands its still an open case my fathers dead yes i hadnt heard that he looked at nick again you were the kid i remember you at the house a man holding his hat his face unfamiliar just a blur even then said you were playing monopoly wasnt that it scrabble scrabble he nodded right scrabble noncommittal a woman opened the back door dad you all right fine were just talking here she looked at them suspiciously wanting more information then had to give it up dont forget your pills she said reluctantly going back in my daughter he said shes worse than hoover but the interruption had the effect of drawing him to them like a little boy not ready to be called inside his body relaxed tell me something since youre here i always wondered after did he tell you to say that about the scrabble did you know hed skipped nick shook his head i thought he was hiding somewhere lapierre took this in and nodded again he had us all going didnt he he said his voice reminiscent they must have had every man in the bureau on it turning over rocks and all the time we were just chasing our tails but who knew the director didnt want to hear it just find the sonofabitch i remember that all right of course we were too late we started late you get the locals in trails cold before you get to it he glanced at nick kid says hes home all night why not we never thought he skipped we checked everything howd he do it anyway do you know he went to philadelphia then detroit canada lapierres face was busy putting pieces in his own puzzle but all he said was philadelphia huh now can i ask you something lapierre looked at him wary again he wasnt being accused of murder nick said that would have been a police case anyway unless they asked you in which they didnt you just came lapierre didnt respond he wasnt being accused of anything else either so why the big hunt every man in the bureau well when you dont turn up at a congressional hearing thats the excuse nick finished you put a dragnet out for a subpoena violation lapierre glanced at him shrewdly intrigued i wouldnt know about that but nick kept staring at him until finally lapierre nodded conceding the point wanting to go on playing one more hand to see what nick knew lets just say the bureau likes to take care of its friends welles was a very good friend to the bureau close to the director nobody likes to lose a star witness all of a sudden youre sitting there holding the bag so i would guess he asked for a little help thats just a guess he added quickly you did it as a favor nick said skeptically maybe you dont understand how things work everybody thinks the bureaus on its own but it isnt hoovers got his boss too sometimes the ags on your side sometimes not depends on the man whatever his agenda is that was a funny time tom clark had just leftnever any problem with him he never gave a damn one way or the other but the new one he left it unfinished still discreet and you never knew what his boss would do the director hated truman mutual probably so it was important to take care of your friends in congress kind of an insurance policy he stopped well thats the political side the director wasnt going to let welles hang out there he made welles but the fact is kotlar was guiltyyou dont need an excuse to go after a spy you cant blame the director for that one i dont say he does everything rightthat case was no picnic for us i can tell you no letup but hell youve got a red spy and you dont go after him thats like putting blood under a hounds nose and then sticking him in a cage hes got to do it i dont think you can blame him for this one i dont blame him i just want to know how he knew lapierre looked puzzled kotlar was guilty theres no doubt about that not now but what made you so sure then i dont think i understand you he said cautiously one womans testimony not proven what made you believe her what made you go after her in the first place lapierre took a step backward physically retreating thats all before i got into it you want to know that youre going to have to ask hoover yourself and hell tell me nick said sarcastically the director a cool smile not even on a good day he turned anyway whats the difference turns out he was right he usually is he looked at nick appraising again what do you really want to know is that why you came all the way out here you know what happened theres no mystery about it you know where he was we looked for him we didnt find him so what do you want to know nick waited what happened to the lighter he said finally watching lapierres reaction the police gave it to you you didnt put it in your report why did you lose it lapierres eyes narrowed a new appraisal and nick saw that what interested him was not that nick knew but howa bureaucratic reflex a fear the system had been violated the bureau doesnt lose things he said simply but its not in the report that depends on which report you saw again the narrow curiosity how had nick seen it nothing was lost theres more than one report the files are crossindexed it may be confusing to someone from outside sos double bookkeeping he glanced up annoyed were an investigative agency that means sensitive material sources for instance its more prudent not to keep everything in one place where somebody might see it we dont own the files a request comes down from the ags office he shifted careful again its not always appropriate you dont want the files used for say political reasons no of course not almost a laugh lapierre hesitated you say hes dead nick nodded all right you ask ill tell you the official file wasnt the same as the internal one couldnt be we were investigating communists not murder there are some who would have preferred that you know for political reasons to take peoples minds off the real issue but we didnt want it to be a murder case then it might have been sent back to the police right out of your hands lapierre looked at him sharply then nodded with predictable results you keep forgetting he wasnt there there would have been no case theyd be spinning wheels he paused besides we didnt want to get him that way not for murder welles would lose his red you dont think much of the bureau do you think were just like the feet fact is i didnt run it as a murder case because i never thought it was i always thought she killed herself he looked up while he was playing scrabble then how did the lighter get there lapierre looked at him with mild scorn as if he had missed the obvious she put it there there werent any prints you know he said watching nick a little clumsy anyway dont you think leaving it like that it was her she wiped it on her skirt or somethingand out she was going to take him with her one way or the other what you said before about going after her it was always my understanding that she went to welles her idea of course i dont know where your information comes from lapierres eyebrows went up welles got everything from the bureau well maybe you know that i dont nick stood for a minute looking at the ground thinking but you kept it even though you cant destroy evidence thats illegal so is hiding it its not hidden lapierre said blandly i dont know where you get this idea to my knowledge no ones ever asked for it you kept it just in case you needed it nick said to himself a little insurance insurance if the statute of limitations ran out dont let your imagination run away with you we didnt expect it to run out we expected to catch him nick looked up and tell him you had it in case he wasnt feeling cooperative with the committee loosen his tongue i dont know about that i was just supposed to catch him but i didnt he shrugged so the statute did run out but theres no statute on murder lapierre looked at him eyes cold again thats right not on murder you would have hanged him with it that would have been up to the jury with your help i would not have withheld evidence no if thats what you mean the bureau would never allow that nick felt a band of heavy air tightening around his chest a land of noose what the jury made of it lapierre wiped his hands again free of dirt one way or the other nick said again to himself he could never come back silvers insurance come back why the hell would he come back he got away with it the woman came to the back door again dad insistent this time all right he said turning back to nick i dont know what youre trying to prove everybody wants to get something on the bureau these days the bureau didnt do anything to your father we never got the chance we were the ones looking like jerks not him he got away with it yes he got away with it nick said seeing his fathers thin white legs as he put him to bed lapierre began walking away tell me one more thing nick said stopping him you must have seen the cochrane file a beat the internal one lapierre waited interested was there a description of it how she approached welles lapierre thought for a moment no he said just the first interview then how do you know she did lapierre began backing away well i guess i dont know that either he gave nick a thin smile maybe you should ask welles he was there not me molly whod been silent during the meeting opened up in the car that was a mistake she said hes going to report it he thinks hes still working for them did you see his eyes just like jeff i know something you dont know even when they dont ill bet theyre all like thatthey dont know how to stop well so what what if he does theyll start watching again how are we going to watch our friends if somebodys watching us god its getting like prague everybody watching everybody maybe theyll do the navy guy for us nick said lightly you dont like the neighborhood anyway im serious if they start tailing us its like handing them the list you know that nick nodded they have to find us first anyway theyre not watching now you want to take mother brown ruth silberstein went to the movies while molly was parked in chevy chase waiting for brown nick trailed the volkswagen to a suburban shopping mall her friend a woman waiting at the box office handed her a ticket and began a conversation that would last off and on through the show and into dinner afterward they both chose the chefs salad ruth drank several cups of coffee her friend shared an envelope of snapshotsrelatives or an office party nick guessed when he passed by the table to lookand ruth picked up a pint of ice cream on her way home then he saw the blue glow of the television set upstairs the bathroom light as she got ready for bed a small reading lamp for twenty minutes and darkness nothing it occurred to nick as he sat smoking in the car that the only exciting thing about being a spy was the end the final adrenalin jolt of exposure john brown hadnt returned just an evening with mom molly said weary one of thems the connection nick said itll happen i hope so whos on tomorrow try irina again ill do the navy then i think ill take the bureaus advice and go see welles why molly said looking up i want to know how it started why she talked to him its important is it molly said quietly watching him silver didnt start this he just did what he had to do once it did i want to know who started it all who did it to you you mean her voice still quiet not just to me he said quickly disconcerted to all of us molly started to say something then backed off instead she went over to the mirror and started brushing out her hair what makes you think welles will talk to you she said youre the last person hed want to see ill use larrys name nick said thinking of lutece its a real dooropener chapter he drive to anacostia the next morning was as uneventful as before a careful swing southeast through the back streets toward the sun and the crisp sentries uniforms when the black officers car slid through the gates barely pausing for its badge check it seemed to melt into the lot in the slow motion of a dream navy whites a few official cars what did he do here nick watched his dark face move toward the building unhurried he decided to take a chance on the guard that guy who just came in i think he put a dent on my car lieutenant williams the guard said amazed i guess how do i get in touch with him you cant not without a pass you have an extension i just want to call for the insurance the guard checked a clipboard he said big dent no just a scratch thanks nick pulled away the guard not even bothering to look at the car turning his face to the sun the whole base was dozing far away from the war the senate office building on the other hand bristled like a command post phones ringing secretaries heels clicking along the halls busy with itself nick dialed the anacostia number from a pay phone in the lobby a girls voice naval intelligence nick put the receiver back nodding to himself and went to find welless office there were two secretaries both with beehive hairdos both wrapped in sweaters against the air conditioning a leather couch piled with unopened mail the walls filled with photographs of welles shaking hands with everybody in the world a portrait of nixon a framed campaign poster peace with honor nick heard voices coming from the inside office laughter now that he was here he felt a quiet panic at the ordinariness of it all that the demon swirling through years of his imaginative life would be reduced to a man making jokes in an office harmless like a funhouse ride after the doors open welles belonged in the newsreel gavel banging cowing them into silence always oversize his malevolence so large it needed an expanse of screen or it would become invisible too large to be seen in a small room with posters and crank mail his father had said that when you shook hands with stalin the act itself was a violation of scale allowing you to believe he was just a man the inner door swung open no longer screensize but still large grown fat his bulk filling the door frame everything the same the straight nose and square face softened by the years of extra flesh he was wearing a bow tie and redwhiteandblue suspenders sweating a little in the cool room his arms were draped around a middleaged couple whose faces had the pleased look of pilgrims granted an audience when he saw nick his smile froze for a second then spread back across his face well there he is looks like bettys got them backtoback this morning i swear they dont give me time to pee sometimes genial for the benefit of the couple who smiled now bless your heart you tell the club i wouldnt miss it wouldnt miss it you just make sure betty here has that date he turned to one of the secretaries darlin you circle this one now hear then to nick well come on in if youre coming and then a flurry of goodbyes and nick suddenly felt himself being led into the room by a hand on his shoulder everything smaller after all well i was surprised your call but you know your dadlarry and i go back a ways both sides of the aisle so i guess i owe him a favor or two hell i owe everybody favors now whats so important he couldnt call himself they got phones in paris last time i heard before nick could reply he held up his hand let me tell you up front if its this peace talk business hes got himself into i cant do it no help at all the people dont want ittheyd have themselves a lynching party with me in the rope and i dont blame them peace with honor he said last years slogan for war thats what were looking for here now larry knows that hell that was the whole campaign cant have him giving everything away over there weve been there before all our fine boys getting shot up and were just going to hand it to the commies another yalta no sir his cheeks puffed now like bellows everything the same he didnt send me i wanted to see you myself welles stopped surprised you did he said marking time not sure what was happening well what can i do for you larrys my stepfather you know my real father was walter kotlar a tic of recognition not alarm a reflex to a surprise question thats right larry married the wife i never did understand that there was a kid just a detail lost over the years thats you nick nodded walter kotlar welles said sitting against the edge of the desk a lot of water over that dam he died last week died well thats something he said slowly dead im sorry to hear that he caught nicks expression oh he was no friend of mine matter of fact he was anything but for a while there no end of trouble whole thing just folded up on me but dead he shook his head you know its not just your friends makes you feel old when the other ones go too maybe more nobody left who knows the war stories kids dont want to hear it i do welles lifted his head no you dont theres no percentage in that scratching sores thats all that isyoure better off letting them alone it dont pay staying mad your dad he almost put me out of business terrible him and that woman but what are you going to do you pick yourself up and roll with it you dont want to look back thats whats great about this countryyou just go on to the next thing nick looked at him amazed just something that had happened to him was it possible it had never really mattered the whole thing no more important than a hitch in the campaign patched over with a boosters platitude or was this just another way of telling betty to circle the date a hand on your shoulder on your way out the door my parents never talked about it well thats right they wouldnt he peered at nick so you came to see me is that it its all there you know matter of record not all of it welles gave him a serious look on guard look nick said my fathers dead it cant hurt anybody anymore its history id just like to know to fill in the gaps improbably this made him smile history well i guess it is now we did make some history there didnt we he did anyways what do you want to know did rosemary cochrane really have new testimony the way you announced did she tell you anything this was clearly unexpected she would have he said with a sly glance back but she didnt welles frowned now look im not raking this up again they all said i drove her to it but thats bs i didnt drive her to nothing you had to know how to handle heryou needed a little pressure if you were going to get anything out of her in the beginning you know when she told me about your father i have to say i scared her into ithad to wouldnt have got anywhere otherwise she knew she had to give me something then she just clammed up again my opinion her friends got to her god knows with whatprobably scared her worse but she still knew plenty thing was how do you get her to open up you had to turn the heat on somehow hell thats just politics youre from a political family you ought to know that you tell the papers shes already confessed shes not going to have her friends to fall back on cant trust her theyre running for cover shes out there all alone maybe facing perjury if you play it right and she didnt want to go to prison in the worst way she was pregnant welles looked at him stunned how do you a sputter like a candle nick didnt wait but slipped in under the confusion look i never said you drove her to it i just want to know what she said after hoover told you to talk to her did she mention my father right away welles missed it i told you with her it was always pressure she knew she had to give me a name or youd go after her of course what else by the way how did hoover know nick said trying to sound casual how does he know anything you dont ask but she didnt mention anyone else nick said moving away from it hoover no just kotlar and she thought that was the end of it i dont know what she thought how could it be the end but you offered immunity from espionage charges he said carefully which you couldnt prove anyway without bringing the bureau into it another sly look nodding that was the tricky part but she bit she thought we could you know she was guilty theres no doubt about that no and after she gave me a name well then i had her he smiled then looked down troubled how do you know she was pregnant she told her family it never came out i didnt know that it explains a lot why shed be so upset to take her own life welles shook his head if she did he peered at nick alert whats all this about i always wondered nick said flatly if he killed her killed her welles said surprised now dont you start thinking that way he raised a finger he was your father he said as sanctimonious as his peace platform nick shrugged its possible you must have wondered there were a lot of people in the hotel anybody could have gone up and well couldnt they i mean you were there at the time yes i was he said slowly with mrs welles only his name on the list but you werent married nick said involuntarily two glasses we married later welles said evenly she was my date nick tried an apologetic grin im sorry i wasnt asking for an alibi i dont care what youre asking for your times up welles glanced at his watch physical evidence then stood up let me give you a piece of advice dont be like your father going off half cocked that woman was probably crazy i dont know you have to work with what youve got what i do know is its over and done with youd best put your mind at ease and get on you dont want to go digging around the pasttheres no percentage in it ive lived a long time in this town and i learned theres only the next thing there isnt any past here you let your father be nick nodded message received then glanced up at his eyes now the same hard eyes that had peered over the microphones when you looked at him he said at the hearing what were you thinking welles stopped framing an answer that he was the smoothest goddamned liar id ever seen that id never get him maybe it takes one to know one instead of taking offense welles smiled maybe it does at that thanks nick said taking his hand wanting to see how it felt small welles raised his eyebrows for your time for telling me what i wanted to know but welles misinterpreted its true never thought id get him and i knew he was guilty what about all the others the others all forgotten like campaign workers the ones who werent guilty well they must have been guilty of something welles said easily or they wouldnt have been there attending meetings running mimeograph machines flubbing loyalty checks thousands welles put his hand on nicks shoulder and smiled you know son you dont know shit about politics you should just get on to the next thing welles walked him to the door taking a deep breath and drawing up his shoulders ready for a new meeting as nick watched the buffoon suspenders seemed to expand his body filling back up with air almost newsreel size the break came the next day molly took the vigil in chevy chase again and nick decided as if he were sticking a pin in a map to follow irina he drove to dupont circle and by seven am he was waiting halfway down her sunny street thinking that the whole random exercise was futile they needed five watchers not two he imagined the contact being madean exchange on a park bench how was it done while they were both somewhere else never in the right place at the right time in this lottery silvers luck could hold forever while nick drew empty mornings of delivery vans and dogwalkers anyway where was she shed be late for work if she didnt leave the house soon nick stared at her door so preoccupied he didnt hear the steps behind him stopping at his open window there you are a womans voice i suppose i have you to thank mrs baylor carrying a brown grocery bag nick looked up blankly i thought shed be someone youd want why send her back if you dont mind my asking was something wrong you mean shes gone first brown now irina well dont you know nick shook his head confused oh of course she did say it was temporary but she seemed to like it here when did she leave yesterday said she found something better i dont know what she means by better theres nothing wrong with the apartment its selfcontained i thought you people sent her home no nothing like that did she leave an address theyre supposed to no of course they come and go the girls but one month no more for me i can tell you no more foreigners not that she wasnt nice she was only here a month could the list have been that recent but his father must have had it earlier when he had first planned to leave one month hardly worth the time it takes to clean the place flighty mrs baylors arm shot up in the air waving theres barbara nick looked toward the house where a girl on the stoop was waving back his eyes stopped and he felt a tingling along his scalp not the russian the other girl she started down the street thanks mrs baylor sorry for your trouble shell probably check in with us this week when shes settled if she does send an address let us know okay just in case he turned on the ignition by the way how did she find you she give you references well i never thought to ask barbara told her about it they met at work i guess not that i blame barbara she was good as gold about those records by the time nick was able to pull away the girl had turned the corner into the next block shoulder bag swinging a miniskirt short heels blond like molly reliable barbara whod met irina at work but she was heading downtown away from the embassy nick followed slowly but even at this pace the car was bound to overtake her she passed a bus stop clearly intending to walk he went through the light into the next block keeping her in his rearview mirror a car pulling away from the curb he slammed on the brakes and backed into the spot adjusting the parking angle until she went by when he started down the sidewalk he kept his eyes on her hair a tracking beam so that everything around her blurred out of focus she was walking quickly not stopping to look at windows heading toward farragut square she took a diagonal path across the park unaware of nick in the crowd downtown the bureau wasnt far away then she went into a coffee shop forcing nick to stop at the corner exposed he fed some coins into a newspaper vending machine and took out a post a peace rally district police requesting additional crowdcontrol units people streamed by carrying briefcases what if she was just a boarder after all but the address had been there on the list when she came out sipping from a styrofoam cup nick turned away and almost lost her then in front of a dont walk sign the blond hair came into view again she crossed the street and disappeared through a door employees only nick looked around then at the blocklong row of plateglass windows trying to orient himself it was only when he stepped back to the curb taking the whole building in that he finally recognized it as familiar to him as an old dream garfinkels still his father had said the reports never changed the same pattern you could tell just by the prose one of them will lead me to him nick went through the door dont show yourself but how else could he be sure he walked past aisles of cosmetics and womens handbags she could be anybody but when he reached the mens department there she was just arrived behind the counter talking to another clerk as she arranged the tie display the shelves behind her lined with row after row of white shirts we have to figure out a way to get in there nick said later excited i cant spend all day trying on suits they were in the lobby bar at the madison the soft spring light still flooding into the windows from th street not yet evening molly unexpectedly subdued picked out a cashew from the bowl of nuts you want me to be her she said not looking up no he probably knows her by sight but if you were there theyre always looking for extra help you could talk your way in anyway its worth a try no i meant her rosemary you want me to be her nick said nothing surprised at her mood do i have to molly were so close she nodded and looked out the window in the corner a man in black tie was playing the piano cocktail hour these foolish things one of the songs his mother must have danced to its funny she said all my life my mother kept telling me i was like her political thats what she said when i wanted to go to kennedys funeral a whole bus went down from school you dont want to get mixed up in anything not like her god every time i brought someone home youll turn out boycrazy just like she broke off but i never thought i was i didnt even know her that was just my mother half the time i didnt know what she was talking about now it turns out maybe she was right i am like her i know just how she felt what do you mean well she did it for him didnt she mr right anything right up to the end new dress order up a bottleill bet it was the kind he liked everything was going to be all right everything is going to be all right a weak smile ignoring him and now im going to be her do everything she did even sell the shirts molly if it bothers you dont do it well figure out something else oh dont worry ill do it she paused i am like her ill do it for you no do it for her she sighed shes dead nick she turned from the window ill do it for you so youll be finished with it were so close he said again what do you want to do walk away from it i need to do this for him another wry smile looking down at the nuts what nick said annoyed not for him she said dont you know that she raised her hand stopping his response its okay i want you to bury him but how do you end it nick what are you going to do if this works if you do get silver have you thought about it nick looked down embarrassed because he hadnt it had seemed enough to know to see a face this one we turn in he said finally but not the others hes a murderer maybe they are too and maybe they just sell shirts would you have turned rosemary in she shrugged shying away i guess not i dont know molly whats wrong he said touching her arm what are you so worried about youre just so determined were going to get him then what push him over a balcony nick lets just give the whole thing to the fbi now let them do it nick took a drink calming himself so that when he spoke his voice was steady and reasonable molly for all we know it is the fbi you just want to do it yourself yes he said still calm i want to do it myself i want to see his face a beat then itll be over will it he held her eyes sure yes she glanced out the window avoiding him then busied herself lighting a cigarette she exhaled then nodded when do i go to work tomorrow selling seashells by the shore she said lets hope i dont end up the same way she did then before he could answer and just when i was getting somewhere with mr brown what do you mean i thought you said he wasnt there he wasnt but theres another thing if you had let me finish i took a drive over to the parking lot at nationalthats where you said he left the car right well it wasnt there so what is he up to nick thought for a minute then frowned it doesnt matter it isnt him but funny dont you think we dont have time shes the only one who matters now well you have to do something while im playing salesgirl why not find out unless you want to protect him from the fbi one of your innocent spies what are you talking about see the guy at the end of the driveway hes been keeping an eye on us nick looked out the window youre sure ive developed this instinctin my new professional capacity she said airily then nodded pretty sure he follow you here no at least i dont think so i just noticed him while we were talking i told you lapierre would have them put a tail on us then hes interested in me good we cant have anyone walking you to work take the car out tomorrow and see damn why now nick said worried what do they want like old times isnt it molly said her eyes back at the window we have to get rid of them the fbi hoover can she glanced back amused that would do it then seeing he meant it right to the top larrys name again no he smiled i thought id use jeffs but he didnt have to use either name hoover sent for him he drove out to national in the morning avoiding chevy chase his eyes almost fixed on the rearview mirror but the tail if it was there had been trained in a better school than zimmermanshe seemed to be alone he went slowly through the parking lot no car had someone taken it a day ago he would have felt uneasy now it was only a piece of a different puzzle he took the direct route home then doubled back across the mall where they were putting up a stage for the peace rally still no obvious tail then at the hotel he saw they hadnt bothered the two men approached him in the lobby said the boss wanted to see him and led him to the car when they hustled him into the back seat with a peremptory shove he was at holeckova again the same helpless anxiety his palms damp as if he were back in handcuffs the office a suite of rooms was on the fifth floor of the justice department past a secretarial pool and a corridor lined with autographed pictures and plaques and framed awards the tokens of a grateful nation the visitors office made welless look like a closet a huge room with an oversize desk between two flags whose only purpose seemed to be for taking pictures a vast blue rug with the bureau seal a ghoulish death mask mounteddillinger more photographs all of them with hoover burly in a doublebreasted suit and crisp fedora leading a fugitive up the stairs bending over to shake hands with shirley temple nicks escorts knocked on the inner office door nodded to the prim woman in a high collar who opened it and backed away like courtiers one more large room with windows looking out over pennsylvania avenue this one for workinga line of wooden memo trays another footballfield desk with telephones and a single open file standing behind the desk was the director himself bulldog jaw sticking out just like it did in his pictures glowering up at nick with a theatrical intensity a silence am i under arrest nick said no i want to talk to you hoover said the words coming as fast as bullets nick wondered if he had worked on it practicing in front of a mirror until speech too had become an intimidating prop i hear you want to talk to me if you dont you can leave right now im a busy man thank you miss gandy he said to the secretary so that ironically the next sound nick heard was the door clicking shut behind him now we could start friendly but i havent got the time nobody bothers my agents mr warren nobody interrogating them who do you think you are of course i know who you are he tapped the open file with his finger the only reason im talking to you at all is that your fathers been a friend to the bureau nick realized after a second of confusion that in washington he was always larrys son first sometimes depending but i dont hold grudges and the bureau takes care of its friends ill bet hoover jerked his round head and stared at nick dont do that again he said evenly talk smart to your father maybe hes used to it i dont like it as far as im concerned youre just some kid who thinks hes having fun with the bureau and thats not smart ask your father hell tell you hes my stepfather i know that too i know everything about you he touched the file again war record not much but at least you werent one of the dodgers im not surprised you changed your name we cant help our parentsi dont hold that against you maybe i should they usually dont fall far from the tree but right now i just want to know what you think youre doing talking to lapierre playing cute with us in new york i wasnt trying to play cute i just left early they werent there around the clock youre not worth twentyfourhour surveillance hoover said youre not that important im not that important now either so call off the guys you have watching me here i havent done anything if theres something you want to know ask and ill tell you i dont like being followed i had enough of that in prague but you expect it there i didnt think we were like that yet hoover peered at him curiously sizing him up then moved out from behind the desk involuntarily nick glanced down to see if his shoes had lifts hoover had always been described as short but here on his carefully constructed set the sight lines seemed to exaggerate his bulk and the broad shoulders and thick neck gave the impression of a large man barely contained by his suit what caught nicks eye however was the hair short but still dark at his age a color that could only have come from a bottle nick wondered if he did it himself towel wrapped around his neck at the mirror or if a barber had been sworn to secrecy not yet mr warren and were not going to be weve still got a free country here no thanks to people like walter kotlar why did you go see him because he asked me to look youre busylet me make this easy for you he sent a message that he wanted to see me i went i spent a few days with him and his wife he didnt tell me any state secrets and he didnt tell me about the old days he did tell me that he was sick and hed like to come home one of your people therea legat isnt that what you call them hoover nodded almost imperceptibly a legat found out about it and ran with it all the way back to the bureau where they started ringing bells so loud even you heard them is that about right so far but he didnt come back he killed himself i found him the czech police thought i did it or caused it somehow or whatever who knows what they think i wasnt going to hang around to find out i got out as fast as i could only to come home and get the same treatment from you which i would like you to stop hoover looked at him for a moment i know all that he said finally that doesnt tell me anything what do you want to know why he thought he could come back i dont know that he did think it he just said he wanted to nick paused he didnt know you had the lighter hoover said nothing stonefaced id like it back by the way its mine now its not evidence anymore hes dead youre talking about bureau property no im not the bureau doesnt officially have it you do youve always had it in one of your special files just in case but you cant get him anymore he got away again you think you know all about it no just that it was you all along you fed welles you fed mccarthy that was your little war years of it you think it wasnt a war youre too young to know all of you the only reason youre walking around free today is he stopped it was a war and we won it well you did anyway youre still here hoover glared at him and so is the lighter the one time you really had somebody and he slipped through your fingers but at least you could always get him for something he didnt doif he came back he did do it your agents dont think so neither did the police hoover looked at him steadily his voice low but i did naturally you dont want to it doesnt matter what we think anymore does it then why are you bothering lapierre nosing around where you dont belong what are you really doing in washington research not your kind history thats what it is now its important to talk to who was there while theyre still around hoovers eyes widened as if hed been personally insulted research he said sarcastically for who that pink in london youve been working with yes that pink he snorted not far from the tree well not with my agents youre not dont expect any help from this office and keep the bureau out of it hoover held up a finger i mean that im not interested in history and nick saw suddenly that it was true that all the stagecraft was there not to trick the future but to keep things going now attorney general after attorney general hoover still at the desk the only idea hed ever had was to hold on to his job then it wont matter he said you know hoover said more slowly now a lot of people come into this office just set on showing me theyre not afraid of me its a thing ive noticed smart talk they dont leave that way how do they leave with a little respect for this office and what were doing they find its better to be a friend of the bureau the eyes so hard that nick had to look away would you tell me something he said for your research almost spitting it no for me just one thing it cant possibly matter to you anymore hoover looked up intrigued who told you about rosemary cochrane you told welles but someone told you what makes you think i told welles because he told me you did he didnt intend to but he told me hoover twitched annoyed well thats not what i would call a reliable source ken doesnt know enough to come in out of the rain never did did a lousy job with your father too despite all the help hoover said nothing you knew about her how it cant matter anymore it always matters thats bureau business we never divulge sourceswouldnt have them otherwise he paused but in this case since it matters to you he glanced up it was an anonymous tip a good one for a change we never knew who yes you did nick said youre sure about that hoover said toying with him yes hoover glanced away i dont remember nick stood waiting i dont think you understand how things work here hoover said looking back at nick information thats like currency to us we dont spend it we dont trade for it yes you do for the first time there was a trace of a smile but you see youre not a friend of the bureaus nick stared at him stymied now ill ask you something hoover said why you all those years and youre the one he sends for says he wants to come home why not just go to our people in the embassy would you trust them every embassy has informers if the russians had found out well they did didnt they a shot in the dark if they did mr hoover then they got it from you only the bureau knew is that what you think happened a leak in the bureau no i do not he said steel again we dont have leaks you must have had one once my father had his file hoover frowned lapierre said youd seen that he said diverted now to the office mystery another witchhunt irresistible but he might have got it a while ago actually i never thought the russians did know but if they did that means i know what it means and that never occurred to you no i thought he committed suicide with you there he makes you go to czechoslovakia so he can kill himself while youre around people who commit suicide dont always make a lot of sense hoover looked at him then turned to the window pretending to be disappointed i dont think you do either he said looking down at pennsylvania avenue dont have too much fun at our expenseits not worth it ive been here a long long time and i knew your father i studied your father you want me to think it was just a pipe dream our man didnt think so some pipe dream your father knew how things worked if he wanted to come back he knew hed have to buy his way back but what was he going to buy it with youd need a lot of currency to do that he turned back and stared at nick and somebody to make the deal close like family i dont know what youre talking about nick said holding his gaze i hate to see good information go to waste get in the wrong hands hate it he paused most people find that it makes sense to be a friend to the bureau i cant afford it its too expensive hoover nodded and moved toward the table behind the desk theres all kinds of information he said and pressed a button on a tape recorder nick heard a scratch then his voice mollys heres an idea lets smoke a joint and make love all night no microphones i liked the microphones whered you get the stuff well i did see richie hoover clicked it off and looked at him for a reaction not the alcron looking up at ceilings the plaza where they were safe where was the bug nick said stalling the phone you cant use it no for two cents id set you up you and your hippie girlfriend i can do it for two cents nick stared at him the bantam chest and dyed hair his eyes shining about to win the way it worked but you wont he said finally you cant afford it either larry warrens a friend to the bureau nick saw the tic the flesh of hoovers cheek quivering as if hed been slapped two cents hoover said machine gun speed again trying to recover but the air had gone out of it his skin now slack with age nick turned away keep it with the lighter just in case can i go now think about what i said hard maybe something will come back to you nick walked toward the door dont push your luck hoover said wanting the last word not with me i hear you had a rough time over there you might learn something from that how things are nick turned from the knob and looked at hoover i did learn something you know when i walked in here i was afraid of you the boss you want some history that was stalins nickname too just like you but youre not that scary youre just a guy who likes to go through peoples wastebaskets hoovers face went blank amazed you know what i learned nothing is forever you think you are youre going to be disappointed for a moment hoover just stood there seeming paralyzed by the impertinence then his eyes narrowed youll change your mind they always do its better to be a friend he walked back toward his desk pulling himself together so ill give you something free as a friend the bureau isnt following you maybe we should be but were not and maybe youre not as smart as you think you are just a little paranoid maybe you see how it works now you give me one i know he talked to you how else would you know about the lighter nick smiled and opened the door an anonymous tip he walked over to the mall and sat on a bench watching them build the scaffolding for the rally kids in tshirts and jesus hair with hammers portable toilets in a few days the buses would pour in speeches and peace balloons all of it happening somewhere else in the present while he waited to find someone in the past hoover hadnt dyed his hair then hed been a real monster not a creaky vaudeville turn hanging on hed made welles mccarthy nixon all of them passing out his currency now some were dead and one was in the white house and everyone had moved on to the next thing except nick he noticed some men in suits loitering by the construction site the bureau getting ready he should get up and go home which was where a hotel with a piano player in the lobby a room in london he couldnt even remember he looked up toward capitol hill that wasnt home either but he was still living there on nd street trying to find his way out the trouble with history his father had said is that you have to live through it a crime story where everyone did it without even thinking as careless as an anonymous tip and then went on but what if it stopped a freeze frame what if you were the one caught in the picture stuckunless you found the one with his finger on the shutter who had told hoover molly was already at the hotel when he got back they said no nick said no halfday orientation they jumped at it once i said tempno health plan her department well they rotate but i told them thats where id done it before so it should be okay i start with tiesno sizes even i can do it she was doing hats today i mean who wears hats anymore everybody switches around except for the men selling suits i suppose you really have to know about suits what was she like nice but not too nice she probably thinks im going to be a pain you know who needs a trainee but the point is i can see her no matter where they put me its all open except for the fitting rooms so so now we wait you do she grinned ill be on my feet and theyre already killing me she took her shoes off and lay back on the bed looking up at the ceiling i wonder if shes in love with him too hed be a little long in the tooth now dont you think oh men just keep going she smiled at him at least i hope they do he sat on the bed and began rubbing her feet mm what every working girl needs browns still not back by the way you went out there nick said well i had the time just a driveby i was curious theres something going onit doesnt make sense nick shook his head we should leave the others alone what if they spot us we dont want to complicate things now i dont think anyone followed me no hoover said theyre not tailing us really what about the man outside the hotel he wasnt just waiting for a cab i know he wasnt thats what he said of course it wouldnt be the first time he lied the real waiting began in the morning nick stayed at the hotel afraid hed miss mollys call if he left unable to read or think about anything else so close he played a game with the united charities list checking it against the phone book to see who was still alive still in washington the others he could run through the post obituary files finally winnowing it down some names he could deal with by sightpoliticians gone after failed elections senators old even then his parents still together on the list but there were too many he might as well be doing crossword puzzles just passing time his father had said the reports were irregular how was it done was there a prearranged signal a call or did he just stroll into the store a man shopping on his lunch hour nicks worst fear was that he might appear without their even knowing it the waiting all for nothing the next day too restless to stay inside he walked over to th street and circled the building to fix the likely exits in his mind when he walked into the mens department molly looked up in surprise then cocked her head toward the blond girl folding sweaters there were only a few customers nick moved slowly past the counters browsing familiarizing himself with the floor layout you could see everything from the fitting rooms he made his way to the shirt counter where molly was waiting glancing at him nervously fifteen and a half thirtythree he said then stopped not even his size when she reached behind her and handed him the shirt he felt eerily that he had crossed some invisible line into his fathers life exactly the way it must have been no one noticing he fingered the shirt wrapped in plastic you could slip an envelope underneath rosemary could take it hand you another ring up the sale and carry the shirt back to the stockroom a crime so easy no one would ever see he realized then that molly was staring at him disconcerted ill come back he said embarrassed and walked away after that he stayed with the list not trusting himself to go out he reread rosemarys letter trying to imagine what her voice had been like throaty maybe like mollys the hotel room was claustrophobic so he sat for hours gazing out the window going over everything that had happened in prague some clue he might have missed he wondered what had happened to zimmerman what anna masaryk had done with the exit visas he could see them both vividly and realized that this is what people in prison didfloated out of their cells into some imaginative other life she had been putting lipstick on when the bellboy brought the setup two glasses happy to see him the phone rang twice before nick came back to his own room she asked to switch with me friday tomorrow to do the shirts molly said i dont know if it means anything or not but why switch nick im here so what do you think he paused not sure well it might be dont you think molly said eagerly why dont you buy yourself a suit tomorrow he tried on several lingering in front of the mirror with one eye fixed on the shirt counter finally when the salesman became impatient he picked a blue pinstripe and stood on a raised platform while the tailor measured for alterations but how long could he string it out a few men all of them too young bought shirts the blond girl barbara kept looking around as if she were expecting someone but nothing happened when the floor manager told her to go to lunch nick followed a sandwich in a coffee shop eaten quickly when she went back to garfinkels nick stopped himself at the door his excuses to go inside exhausted he went across the street and kept watch from a doorway smoking waiting to meet a friend then another corner a newspaper the afternoon dragged on how much longer he went back into the store and caught mollys eye a quick shake of her head he crossed the floor positioning himself next to ladies scarves then bought some perfume all the while keeping the mens department in sight almost closing time barbara looked at her watch and then toward the door a missed connection or just a salesgirl eager to go home when the bell rang nicks heart sank hed made himself conspicuous and no one had showed he watched her close the register with molly chatting then had no choice but to follow the other customers out he waited across the street again and then on the chance that she was meeting him after work moved toward the employee entrance a group of women talking he picked out the blond hair easily and began to track it back toward dupont circle maybe a drink after work but barbara the reliable tenant went straight home and when he saw her go through mrs baylors door he knew the day with all its nervous expectations was gone but she asked to switch again molly said later maybe he couldnt make it for some reason and maybe she just likes shirts nick said depressed no she never asked before it has to be anyway you could use the clothes the next morning was like the first sleepwalking past the sales tables picking through the suits the clerk puzzled at his being there again but still wanting to make a sale nick said hed try a few on hoping the salesman would go away and went into one of the changing rooms the door was louvered so that if you bent a little you could see between the slats barbara at the shirt counter but he couldnt stay here forever peering out the clerk had someone else now and was leading him toward the tailor but hed knock in a minute wanting to know if everything was all right nick thought suddenly of the station mens room the sick feeling as the footsteps came closer he was about to give up and open the door when he saw barbaras head rise relieved recognizing someone she turned and pulled two shirts off the shelf ready then glanced to either side of her to see if the coast was clear as the mans back came into view for a second nick didnt breathe the man was picking up a shirt handing the other back to her turning slightly as she went to the register nick grabbed the slats with his fingers lightheaded steadying himself as his stomach heaved hed seen the face a shouting in his head he opened the door ah and how did we like the gray the salesman said but nick walked by him one foot in front of the other as if he were underwater moving toward the shirts a hundred pictures flashing by him rearranging themselves in place the same face through the cubicle slats in a slice just like the crack at the study door molly watching him her mouth open and then he was there behind the familiar shoulders hello larry he said chapter he told you they were on a bench in lafayette square across from the hayadams everything around them drenched in sun surreal larrys voice as calm as the quiet park a man feeding birds a young woman pushing a pramno one had the slightest idea larry had led him here by the arm guiding him out of the store as if he were a patient one of those men in nicks unit whod been too near a bomb and had to be helped away no he never knew nick said almost whispering foggy except at the end his voice was coming back now thats why he changed his plan that day he figured out the lighterthat you were the only one who could have taken it from the study that was an accident i must have put it in my pocket but then i had it he was going to use you to make the deal for him then he realized you were the one person he couldnt use hed have to do it himself he must have been out of his mind yes come back really nick are you going to kill me too dont be ridiculous youre my son you killed the other one then to larrys blank expression she was pregnant rosemary cochrane it was yours wasnt it larry was silent i didnt know he said finally past denial would it have made any difference no he looked away it was too dangerous she wouldnt have named you she was in love with you you cant trust that he said dismissively she was just a girl then she gotemotional and she slipped up somehow they got on to her it was dangerous she knew about me but he didnt no but he was going to crack i saw it that night he glanced over when you were spying on us i didnt understand anything larry sighed well neither did walter that was the problem he didnt understand how serious it was he thoughti dont know what the hell he thought buy them off with a name and live happily ever after it doesnt work that way once you start you go to the end and what name he only had schulman who recruited him larry looked back surprised thats right and me at penn the one point of connection i couldnt risk that if hed given them schulman it might have led them to me he wrinkled his face the way things work out i was the one who suggested he try walter he was always looking for prospects i told him walter might be promising material but he turned out to be the weak link you see that dont you he might have brought the whole thing down nick looked at him incredulous was he being asked to agree they had to protect me i was in the white house wed never had a chance like that why didnt you just kill him too larry looked at him with an indulgent expression is that what you think of us of course we didnt kill him anyway you take care of your own unless theres no other choice that would have been a foolish risk to run two deaths no one would have believed the other was suicide thered be no end to it the police didnt believe it anyway you made sure of that with the lighter no i was making sure of him i wasnt sure hed go walter was unpredictable he paused he had reasons to stay he might have thought he could tough it out not accept our invitation but not if he thought hed be accused of murder then hed have to go well it never came to that it was just a precaution he did go convenient for you convenient for everybody except old ken welles i suppose but that couldnt be helped oh you think we wanted him stopped nohe was useful he was so busy looking for commies in all the wrong places nobody thought to look in the right ones loyalty oaths for schoolteachers christ but even a fool gets lucky once you had hoover looking too well i didnt want him looking at me all i had to do was suggest that walter must have been tipped off by someone in the bureau and he was off catching his rats he stopped i never wanted to hurt walter you killed him we got him out it was the best we could do he had a life there you said so yourself we had to do it not then now you killed him or had him killed you dont know that were sitting here arent we how do you think i got to you larry looked up at him serious how did you first tell me why why what else could we do coming back that could only mean one thing he found out i dont know howwe were careful about that all those years i knew how hed react hed make it personal it was personal no i was just another agent who took his wife and set him up for a murder charge and got rid of him to cover your own ass you ruined his life larry what do you call personal larry turned away why did you have to kill him he was never going to get outyou know that he didnt have to get out once he knew he could have told anybody a journalist the spooks at the embassy he wasnt safe if he knew he paused given everything but he didnt know larry not until the end you had him killed for nothing what do you want me to say nick im sorry its a death wish to want to defect theres only one way to do it if he didnt know about me then he knew others he was going to turn them this isnt school what did you expect them to do once you told them yes once i told them he said impatiently of course i told them you dont wait were all at risk when somebody defects he had to be stopped before anything got out it had to die with him it didnt nick said quietly he told me thats what led me to you names her your new friend you ought to change your pattern larry you made it easy it didnt die with him larry crossed his legs and looked down at his trousers picking at the fabric seemingly at a loss well that creates a little situation doesnt it yes youll have to kill me too does anyone know larry said just me once im gone youre safe i didnt mean that i was thinking of you are you sure what about that girl no nick lied just me youd be safe dont talk crazy kill you he turned to nick his eyes suddenly old and unguarded youre all i care about dont you know that nick felt a tremor another shock to the system not a lie his boy the unexpected thing in his life a knot too tangled to untie nick looked away you should have been more careful in prague then he said i almost didnt make it or were you going to get me out of that one too but i didnt know you were there larry said reaching over and putting his hand on nicks arm i didnt know you have to believe that i would never involve you nobody said you were there didnt brown tell you brown one of yours over in justice larry held up his hand dont im not supposed to know its safer then who did hoover he called he had a report from one of his legats saying that walter was planning to come back did i know anything about it i suppose he thought i might because of your mother he never said anything about you why would i even think it it was a damn fool thing for walter to do involving you what was in his head you dont do that he trusted me he didnt even know you i was there not him no matter what you think of me now that parts still true he wasnt there i was i gave you everything nick looked at him amazed no he said you took everything a pause then larry looked down at his watch well this isnt getting us anywhere and i have a meeting he looked up youre being sentimental walter was a damn fool but youre all right thats the main thing you have a meeting nick said was he just going to walk away yes at the white house walk over with me he stood up do you really think im going to let you do that larry raised his eyebrows genuinely puzzled nick got up facing him i know everything youve done your code name what happened at the hotel how you report all of it youll make an awful mess trying to prove it i can do it i have documents he gave them to me ah larry said looking away then i guess im in your hands you might say were in each others hands sort of a protection racket im not in your hands well a minute ago you said i was going to kill you which im not of course but youre not going to do anything either what did you have in mind turning me in your own father i dont think so you know nick youre more like me than you think were both pragmatists we take the world as it comes you just got thrown a curve thats all but dont do anything foolish whats in it for you patriotism not very pragmatic you bastard listen to me no you listen to me calmly were going to walk out of the square and in a few minutes im going to sit down at a table and listen to fools and crooks tell me how they want to run the world ive been listening to them for thirty years different crooks same fools but im at the end this is my last job after that i wont be a threat to anybody least of all the country that you think you care so much about its over walter told you things he had no right to tell youre lucky no one knows except me so you come back playing detective all fired up to change the world just like walter used to be but youre not going to change it nobody does what you might do is cause a scandal that would embarrass the governmentnot a bad thing in itself given who they are but itll be a lot worse for us it would kill your mother no it wouldnt and what about you you know what it would mean do you want to go through all that again im not doing anything more than what walter did you want to make him a saint thats your business but dont drag the rest of us down trying do you think anybody wants to know that time is over you think nixon wants his old redbaiting days brought up again mr statesman hell the only one who still cares at all is hoover and hes been nuts for years no one wants to know who would you be doing it for for me for you why settling someone elses scores and youd still have to prove it i dont know what you think you have is it really enough id have to fight you and im good ive been doing it for a long time i dont want to fight you nick youre my son you are you know wed be killing each other like scorpions wed both go down you killed someone larry doesnt that mean anything to you listen nick im going to a meeting now with men who are killing thousands and people think theyre heroes i didnt make the world at least i did it to protect myself thats the oldest instinct in the book whats their excuse come on walk with me ill be late numbly nick fell in step at his side i dont care about them larry you killed him he killed himself nick he killed himself the moment he decided to turn those are the rules theyd do the same thing to meor you be smart lets all just retire in peace think of your mother you dont want to do this to her look what youve done to her i hope ive made her happy he turned she cant know about this whats the difference a wife cant testify against her husband nick stopped is that why you married her of course not i love your mother i always have youre a liar larry you dont even know her im not going to argue with you nick i did my best thats all i can say you even lie to yourself well we all do that they stopped near the entrance to the white house across the lawn behind the tall railings barriers along the street to keep protestors away larry waved to one of the guards and turned but im not lying to you theres no advantage here be smart like you maybe im one of the fools are any of them smart or are you the only one nick cocked his head toward the gate where a black limousine was pulling onto the driveway well theyre not very bright larry said anyway it wont be much longer ill be out this fall would you like me to resign sooner would that ease your conscience making a deal the way he always did sure of himself nick looked at him the familiar face suddenly inexplicable tell me why did you do it i thought i explained no it are you a communist i mean do you believe in it i used to i thought it would fix things but not anymore im too old to believe you can fix things then why did you keep going well you have to an easy answer but then he stopped thinking i dont know if youd understand it was the stakes it wasyoud sit at a table in there he jabbed his thumb toward the gate youd sit there while they all talked and none of them knew that you were betraying them that you had the secret this big secret none of them knew he shrugged but thats all over now my sons going to insist i retire he smiled his old van johnson smile and turned to the gate call me after lunch but nick reached out to stop him but larry had already moved out of reach so that nicks arm just hung in the air as if he were holding a gun then slowly he dropped it unable to pull the trigger molly was still at the store waiting i didnt know what else to do she said what happened wheres the girl she split but i got this she held up the envelope she was too freaked to argue just ran did you look molly nodded what were going to say in paris talk about a stacked deck if this doesnt put him away nothing will what happened no more than what your father didanother lie he was prolonging the war lets get out of here i cant she said indicating the unmanned register theres no one here now nick said sharply then seeing her surprised face what if she comes back molly grabbed her purse from underneath the counter they walked down th street toward the mall hearing the sound of loudspeakers in the distance a chant molly listened to him without interrupting her face worried they turned up pennsylvania avenue nick could see the justice building hoovers balcony overlooking the street where he watched the parades a short elevator ride a dealthats all it would take so what are you going to do molly said finally why did it have to be him he said almost to himself because it is i dont know he said answering her question finish it thats what you came here to do end it it wont end itll start all over again nick she said softly if you dont do this itll never stop just name a few names thats their politics im tired of being them hes selling us out now us i cant be that neutral is this how were going to live like them they made a mess of their lives but we wont he said ironically well we can do it our own way at least then we wont know how it comes out she took out the envelope and handed it to him here its yours you decide nick looked down at the envelope i cant be his executioner molly somebodyd better be hell do it to you too hes not going to kill me yes he is every time you look at him she hesitated its a lousy deal nick he watched her turn away where are you going over to the rally if you want to join the living meet me by the monument she stopped then im going back to new york i hate this place she looked up at him come with me im not finished here i am she said and walked away he went toward the justice department and stared up at the balcony the envelope like a weight in his pocket a lousy deal but would this one be any better could you really buy freedom in a pact with the devil the lobby was busy full of men in suits and shortcropped hair bureau style a bank of phones guards armed where hoover had started the phony war that had finally circled them on nd street and nowbeyond an irony something grotesquenick would hand him so many years later the unexpected paper to win it the pragmatic deal but as he walked toward the reception desk surrounded by hoovers foot soldiers he knew he couldnt do it not here the old enemy he saw hoover snatching the prize vindicated unassailable at last which was worse larry for a few months or hoover taperecording for the rest of his life how did you measure the damage molly had to see that hed be one of them he turned pretending hed forgotten something and walked out past the indifferent guards the rally was noisy and crowded he walked past the line of police and portable toilets and parked ambulanceswere they expecting trouble and into the mass swarming over the mall he felt a million miles from the somber candle vigil for jan palach bubbles and painted faces and scraggly hair shirts off in the sun the defiant smell of dope in the distance was a concert stage with loudspeakers a group at its base yelling out now the chant rippling back through the crowd in a wave homemade posters and peace buttons where was she everyone looked young nick realized with a start that no one in the huge eager crowd had ever heard of the hearings that the old war was not even a distant memory to them like welles the survivors had moved on to the next thing an embarrassing moment in the republic not even worth teaching in school so the children absorbed in their own war would not even know it had happened and larry would survive this one too betraying them all a lousy deal molly was right they needed to breathe their own air hed never find her in this he scanned the broad slope by the monument a scuffle had broken out near the transverse road and policemen were wading in to contain it a kid next to him was watching it through binoculars pigs he said there go the pigs again could i borrow these for a sec look at the pigs man he said handing the glasses to nick it wasnt yet an incident people stood watching without getting involved like a highway accident the police were leading two men away but no one was protesting probably a fight someone had to break up not a bust people stepped back to clear a path then started up the road again nick moved the binoculars across the young faces then stopped jarred by something out of place the woman was looking away a little farther up the hill annoyed shed had to stop anxious in the carnival of the rally her determined face stood out like a warning not just any face ruth silberstein nick followed her hypnotized what was she doing here and when she turned to speak to the man with her nick felt the fear begin ponytail and acne the guy from the adult store then ruth pointed and nick followed her finger to molly standing on the curb looking around waiting for him hey man said the kid reaching for the binoculars just a minute please it hadnt been hoovers tail hed been telling the truth rrown or someone had been following her or had barbara called in an alarm and now they were here just a few feet from her he wanted to shout out hopeless but shed know them run for it except shed never seen ruth silberstein never been in the store nick watched through the binoculars as they approached her what story would they have at first she smiled then a moment of panic on her face a quick glance around for help she stepped away but ruth pulled her in and the ponytail moved behind her close to her back and then they were moving off together toward constitution avenue in a huddle run nick dropped the binoculars and started racing through the crowd bumping into people dodging section leaders with bullhorns the chant came back from the stage again and those who had been sitting picnic style jumped up out now nick tried to push through a wall of people not even able to see the road anymore flailing through vines in a jungle shoving them aside hey wheres the fire man someone said peace as if the word itself had power had they known all along been aware of their amateur shadows browns elaborate route a lure not just a dirty bookstore nicks mind raced through the crowd faster than his blocked feet but why here in public what would have drawn them out the envelope they knew shed taken the envelope and then as he edged around a group of girls stalled the other thought occurred to him larry of course hed lie there had never been any deal you dont wait the oldest instinct in the book she really had become rosemary by the time he reached the road calling out her name now they had disappeared he ran faster trying to catch up police glared at him then he saw a car across the avenue the ponytail bundling her in he screamed her name as she got into the car she turned her head as if impossibly shed heard him and he thought a final panic that it could be the last time hed ever see her he ran across the avenue halting traffic but the car was pulling away too far for him even to make out the license plate and then sped around the corner he stopped and stood still heaving theyd question her first but for how long it was the lawn at holeckova again feeling utterly helpless he glanced toward the line of police but what would he say and then another jolt what if they were following him too or was she just bait larrys new bargaining chip bastard he thought and began running toward pennsylvania avenue somewhere they wouldnt follow if he could make it he tried to calm his breathing as he walked into the justice department dont look out of place he went to the row of phone booths and pulled out some change if it had been larry they might not even question her he already knew nick tried the hayadamsnot there but you couldnt call the white house unless your life depended on it he dialed the switchboard believed the emergencythe operator could hear it in his ragged breathing nick are you crazy larry said when he came on pulling me out of a meeting what be quiet im at the justice department im going up to hoovers office unless you let her go do you understand no nick these phones hedging theyre not secure i dont give a fuck let her go calm down i dont know what youre talking about you kidnapped her molly i fucking saw them ruth and the freak from the porno store they probably had brown in the car whered they take her larry christ stop it youre babbling i dont know what youre talking about was it possible look come over here ill meet you outside not the phones forget it im not leaving here its safe even you wouldnt try to get me here ill go upstairs larry i mean it ill tell him everything what do you mean safe are you all right no im not all right theyve got her theyll kill her unless you stop it nick ill say it one more time i dont know what youre talking about she was following brown he must have spotted her or your girlfriend nick i dont give a fuck he yelled you have to get her fix this thats what you do isnt it theyre your peopletalk to your boss you must have one hell know tell him im already at the bureau if they touch one hair one hair ill blow the whole fucking operation i can do it i have the names larry you want to hear them youre not supposed to know nobodys supposed to know but they will tell him i have the envelope too what envelope your envelope your last fucking report nick a beat stay where you are ill be right there where in justice in the lobby right next to an armed guard he took ten minutes nick sat in the booth sweating the receiver cradled at his ear the constant dial tone drowning out the buzzing in his head all that matterednot any of the rest of it all the complicated loyalties he saw her walking past the guards on the prague station platform in the room at the alcron his the only thing he hadnt lost yet by the time he saw larry walking into the lobby the fear had set into something harder without margins the oldest instinct in the book it wasnt me nick larry said his voice brisk setting things straight i dont care just get her john brown works upstairs somewhere hes the one whod know her hes probably had her watched what about barbarashe take packages from anybody else larry nodded then she must have tipped one of them let me see what i can do larry said getting into the booth i cant promise anything i dont know the others it may be out of my hands but youre in mine do it larry picked up the receiver and began closing the booth door nick put his hand on it secrets larry still theirs he closed the door and dialed nick stood outside the booth watching the bureau pass by unaware larry was right there was an excitement in knowing the only secret at the table he heard him make another call brusque a man used to getting his way nick looked at his watch theyd question her first all right larry said as he came out theyve got her somewhere they want to know whats going on they tell you where yes lets go one thing nick stopped and turned id like the envelope larry said holding out a hand even now and if i dont larry just looked at him nick reached into his pocket here he tossed it at him youre a lousy deal anyway nick lets go outside they walked to the waiting black car larry opened the drivers door personal errand he said take an hour and ill meet you back at the white house the driver surprised handed him the keys they dont like that larry winked wouldnt want to do anything personal on government time huh no sir when they pulled away larry said in my briefcase left compartment nick took the case from the back seat opened it and pulled out a gun staring at it just put it in my pocket why the man holding her doesnt know me if my person doesnt reach him we may need a little help just in case god larry still enjoying yourself they drove up th street toward new york avenue and stoppedwhy hadnt he thought of it at the adult store thats why you didnt want the driver they talk larry said simply there was a closed sign on the door nothing visible inside larry knocked were fucking closed the ponytail joseph sent me larry said who john brown nick said the one man hed have to know the door opened a crack what the fuck do you want we came for the girl larry said come on open quick before someone sees he pushed the door the man was holding the baseball bat his eyes widening as he recognized nick who the fuck are you nobody said anything about the girl where is she larry said now the man nodded toward the film cubicles in the back nobody said nothing about this nobody had to put the bat down you look like an idiot yeah well who the fuck are you i gotta make a call he went toward the register counter just put it down larry said holding the gun and the bat fuck the ponytail said amazed he dropped the bat which clattered on the floor i thought you said just in case nick said just get her where he said to the man in the back on the right nick stared at larry suddenly frightened then moved quickly into the back dim after the garish front room doors with light bulbs over them molly he heard a pounding inside one of the cubicles his eyes adjusted to the dark at the end a chair was propped against a door molly he threw the chair aside and pulled the door open she was standing there cowering holding her forearm you all right she nodded still stunned her face was blotchy and she moaned when he took her in his arms hugging her its my wrist i think its broken he grabbedoh god nick whats happening come on he held her by the side and walked her out of the dark room theyre coming back she said who are they later come on she blinked when the light hit her eyes dazzled by the slick covers full of flesh where are we then she saw larry holding the gun and drew closer to nick clutching him get her to the car larry said nobody told me about this the ponytail said shut up fuck you he moved toward molly larry raised the gun dont i mean it the man stopped glowering get in the car larry said to her quick she looked at nick who nodded and opened the door you dont know what fucking trouble youre buying the ponytail said i always know what im buying larry said now you can use the phone the man snorted and turned toward the counter the blast caught nick by surprise making him jump so loud it was still ringing in his ears as he watched the man fall onto the counter then slump and slide off with magazines slipping around him when he hit the floor nick heard his head crack he stared at the blood like the war blood coming out quietly he looked up at larry for a second expecting the other shot but larry was taking a handkerchief from his pocket wiping the gun then tossing it next to the man he saw me he said simply nick said nothing lost in the stillness that follows a violent death it had been that easy no witnesses a girl falling out the window barbara next whoever else might be a threat his father jerking under the pillows no end to it ever now get out of here larry said youve got her were quits i saw you too nick said quietly then im in your hands again larry said matteroffact but we have a deal he wiped his hands come on nick we have to get out of here youll see itll be fine he moved toward the door youre going to get away with it yes i am come on he lifted his hand to the door his back to nick the familiar shoulders no end to it i wont be his executioner not to hoover giving comfort to the enemy but no end to it he reached down and picked up the gun larry turned nick looked down at his hand outstretched the way it had been at the white house gate unable to pull the trigger locked together in the tangle larry had made nick leave it theyll nick fired the sound splitting the room again he saw larrys shocked face his graceless stumble and fall to the floor nick a gasp like a plea nick wiped the gun just as larry had and threw it toward the clerk then he went over leaned down and took the envelope out of larrys pocket no scandal just a crime larrys eyes were still open dont worry nick said to the ground your secrets safe with me that was the deal a pounding on the door nick he slid out not opening it wide enough for her to see and he took her good arm leading her away from the corner leave the car if anyone askswhen they askjust say he dropped us at the hotel we didnt see him after that the shots theyre both dead we cant just leave he turned to her we were never here understand nobody will ever know she nodded frightened come on well pack and get you to a hospital pack for new york but first well see about the wrist im all right no youre not besides i have one more thing to do stay at the hospital until i get back dont leave youll be safe there she looked at him one more thing she said dully i have to see hoover she glanced at the envelope no he said only the others they still know about us now i have to but not him no he tore the envelope into small pieces then bent over and tossed them into a storm drain where they would float like a shirt to the potomac hes not a spy anymore theyll find out what would he be doing there what does any man do in a store like that theyll cover that up out of respect he said an edge in his voice hes a crime victim molly mugged it happens in washington all the time are you sure you know what youre doing he looked at her yes im sure its over except for one more thing yes they took a taxi to the hotel and he made the phone call while molly packed no one was outside watching he drove her to a hospital out in georgetown the late sun still glowing on the buildings why georgetown its on the way to hoovers he said hed see me at home god his home she said sounding better as if movement itself had begun to rub away the shock i never thought of him living anywhere remember dont leave he said as they pulled up to the hospital for any reason theyre still out there thirtieth place was a quiet culdesac near rock creek park large brick houses with georgian windows set back on narrow lawns for a second nick stopped disbelieving hoovers grass a hardy even green was astroturf a negro houseman opened the door and led him into the living room at first nick thought he had walked into a gift shopthere were hundreds of antiques vases and statues silver teapots and curios oriental carpets laid on top of each other so that every space was filled an oil portrait of a young hoover on the stair landing hoover himself in an opennecked shirt and slacks came into the room followed by two cairn terriers who sniffed at nicks ankles then padded away the voice still quick had lost its machine gun effect as if it too had been softened by domesticity drink a drink with hoover no i cant stay hoover indicated the overstuffed couch he took the chair next to it sinking into the cushion so that his body became foreshortened the round head bobbing on it like humpty dumptys he made the first move extending his hand and opening it the lighter nick took it staring at the initials no longer shiny a dull gold from the days when they used to go dancing thank you he said now what have you got for me i want to make a deal the bureau doesnt make deals thats no way to do business you havent heard what ive got a flash of irritation then a slow smile the fathers son larry never comes emptyhanded what have you got names i want to trade you some names hoover looked surprised then distracted as a thin once goodlooking man shuffled vaguely into the room speed ill be with you in a minute clyde oh i thought it was time for drinks he was illness thin why dont you start ill be down as soon as im finished with my young friend here the man nodded still vague and headed for the basement stairs the rec room where larry had told him hoover had an obscene cartoon of eleanor roosevelt a joke from the past clydes staying here for a few days hoover said as if he needed to explain him the rumored companion but it was impossible to think of hoover being intimate with anybody nick wondered what they talked about over dinner the dillinger days maybe filled with public enemies speed nick said a nickname hoover said annoyed what kind of trade five for one five russian spies here in washington hoover looked at him impressed you were right about my father he knew hed have to buy his way out this is what he had itll be a coup for the bureau headlines you can pick them up now on your sayso the names are good he knew proof youll find it once youve got them the bureaus good at that isnt it hoovers face was wary and eager at the same time why so helpful all of a sudden my father wanted you to have them you were wrong about him he wasnt disloyal he was trapped hoover looked confused this was his way of giving something back a friend of the bureau hoover said almost sneering why didnt you tell me this at the office ive been checking them out but im not as good as you arethey caught me doing it they know about me now i want you to pick them up a slow smile thats more like it so you want me to save your behind for two cents id let them take care of you not disloyalyour father was a traitor you just want me to save your behind and yours nick said easily you could use a little press nixon wants you out you made him but now you make him nervous you could use this you dont know what youre talking about no one of thems in justice hoover raised his head as if hed heard a bell if you dont want them maybe nixon will he could make you look awfully pathetic directors so past it he doesnt even know he has a spy in his own department hed do it with a speech about your long record of service a twitch in hoovers jowls anxious now but id rather give them to you why well for one thing i dont trust him to get them off the street in time you could do it in an hour keep my behind safe for walking around he paused and i want something from you hoover peered at him waiting i want to know who told you about rosemary cochrane one name for five well four to be precise one of thems at the russian embassy i only have the code name but you probably know all the players there anyway maybe on tape id like that destroyed too by the way the tape you played the other day i always sound funny on tape a real wise guy arent you nick shrugged i grew up in washington you get to know how a place works no you dont a trade what makes you think i wouldnt get them out of you anyway what with a rubber hose like the commies you dont do business that way you do business this way hoover said nothing one name what do you want it for i just want to know its worth it to me but not as much as my names are worth to you its a good deal hoover watched him thinking then leaned over and picked up a silver pen from an antique set on the coffee table he scribbled on a notepad then tore off the page and held it up theres not much you can do now anyway he said with a sly smile making the better bargain nick reached over but hoover raised his eyebrows nick nodded and took the sheet of names and addresses from his pocket he handed it to hoover with a formal gesture like a diplomatic exchange then looked at the small piece of paper it took a second to sink ina name just a squiggle on a piece of paper rosemarys letter the overlooked clue one confession is enough the start of everything that had happened to them youre surprised hoover said enjoying it nick stood up thank you for the lighter i knew youd be a friend to the bureau nick looked at him thats one thing ill never be he pointed to the list in hoovers hand if you start now you can probably get them before you go down for drinks youre a cold bastard hoover said a kind of admiring salute i didnt start that way nick said he found her in the emergency room her wrist taped but not in a sling its just a sprain they dont know why im still hanging around just sit tight for a few more minutes i have to pay a visit your face she said studying him ive just been with hoover she nodded at the tv monitor in the waiting room theres been nothing on the news by the way there wont be stores closed remember i doubt if any of our friends are running to report it ill be right back a visit here an errand of mercy five minutes the nightduty nurse was sympathetic its after hours just a few minutes okay he gets tired its difficult for him to talk he still slurs nick went into the private room and closed the door there was a small reading lamp but no books father tims head was raised on an inclined pillow his body motionless only the eyes moved in recognition nick he said the word muffled by the twisted face a string of drool hung out of one side of his mouth his hands still had some movement he was clutching a rosary a nurses call button nearby nick he said again that awful forced sound livia you hateful bastard nick said tims eyes blinked in astonishment you told me to think of him as dead a gargled sound came from the bed shut up he is dead now isnt that what you wanted no it was you hoover told me one confession that poor stupid girl shed never imagine would she its supposed to be sacred did you run right over from church to tell him you interfering sonofabitch one of hoovers little helpers root out the communists protect the church christ godless tim mumbled struggling to explain she didnt know you were just like the party means to an end she trusted you you were a fucking priest but youre the real party no doubts tims eyes darted about the room in frustration just one bad moment when you thought you caused her death but you forgave yourself didnt you god always forgives if you ask him in time isnt that the way it goes and for such a cause but i dont forgive you i want you to die knowing that never you ruined our lives for what so you could have dinner with clyde and edgar do god a favor rosemary cochrane was murdered my father was murdered does god forgive that maybe yours does but its a chance isnt it what if youre wrong maybe theyre just beads he brushed the rosary in tims hand communists yes they were communists so what anyway they died for it i want you to see their faces when you go do you know how my father died somebody took a pillow just like this one and held him down till he couldnt breathe till his legs stopped kicking yours wouldnt even move tim his eyes wide with fright moved his hand toward the call button but nick snatched it and put it on the table out of reach dont worry id like to but i wont youre not worth it let god do it nick leaned over i just wanted you to know what you did so you can live with it too and then suddenly the fury broken nick felt his eyes fill with tears you started everything you unholy bastard just so you could be somebodywith your lousy piece of gossip he looked down at the figure the still wasted frame the twisted face already punished what was the point tims eyes leaping you thought id never know nick said calmly all that time watching it happen my mother nobody blaming you not even blaming yourselfnot after putting yourself in gods hands ill bet you made a private confession only a fool would trust the box nick another gurgle his breathing ragged but i do know so die knowing that i do know no absolution nick turned to go a frantic sound he looked back the breathing was a gasp now tims hands motioning toward the call button nick started toward the table to get it then stopped no he said let god do it he owes you the old mans eyes wild now afraid a grunt pray tim nick said backing away maybe hell hear you molly seeing his face said nothing in the car fiddling with her bandage instead who were you seeing she said finally an old friend of my mothers hes dying what a good little boy you are the best she looked at him you all right he nodded its over were going to new york theyll call about your father for a moment she was quiet you killed him didnt you not the other man he looked straight ahead yes she bit her lower lip was itselfdefense wanting it to be true nick saw larrys surprised face finally betrayed yes he said she was about to speak again when he turned to her its over she nodded then placed her hand on his just a touch and looked out the window at the river i wonder if theyll find john brown she said finally count on it i hope hoover nails him personally hed be just right they both lived with their mothers he turned the car toward the mall this isnt the way to the airport no i thought wed take the train for old times sake she looked at him the first hint of a smile okay he drove past the mall where crews were cleaning up litter from the rally then up the hill turning into the street behind the supreme court the lighted capitol dome a spring night in the south the magnolias thick and glossy lights on in the row of houses the big forsythia bushes spilling over the wroughtiron fences he stopped the car idling was that your house molly said yes lights on upstairs his bedroom window no longer scratched by the tall tree which must have been taken down when inside a woman passed in front of the window everything was quiet in the street does it bother you she asked softly i thought it would and for a second just one he was looking out the back window on that last day the sidewalk covered with moving cartons but its just a house he said shifting into drive the frozen picture moving again she looked at him your house no he said not anymore
