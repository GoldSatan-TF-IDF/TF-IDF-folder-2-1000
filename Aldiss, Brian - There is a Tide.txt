there is a tide by brian w aldiss how soothing to the heart it was to be home i began that evening with nothing but peace in me and the evening itself jellied down over africa with a mild mothers touch so that even now i must refuse myself the luxury of claiming any pre monition of the disaster for which the scene was already set my halfbrother kjubal was in a talkative mood as we sat at the table on the veranda of his house his was the major part of the conversation and this was unusual for i am a poet and poets are generally articulate enough because the new dam is now complete he was say ing and i shall take my days more easily i am going to write my life story rog gwilliams on the world weekly has been pressing me for it for some time itll be serialized and then turned into audibook form i should make a lot of money eh he smiled as he asked this in my company he always enjoyed playing the heavy materialist generally i encouraged him this time i said jubal no man in congo states no man in the world possibly has done more for people than you i am the idle singer of an idle day but youwhy your good works lie about you i swept my hand out over the still bright land mokulgu is a rising town on the western fringes of lake tanganyikas nothem end before jubal and his engineers came here it was a sleepy market town and its natives lived in the indolent fashion of their countless forefathers in ten years that ancient pattern was awry in fifteen shattered completely if you lived in mokulgu now you slept in a bed in a towering nest of flats you ate food unfouled by flies and you moved to the sound of whistles and machinery you had at your black fingertips in fact the benefits of what we persist in calling western civilization if you were more hygienic and healthyso ran the theoryyou were happier but i begin to sound sceptical that is my error i happen to have little love for my fellow men the thought of the massacre is always with me even after all this time i could not deny that the trend of things at mokulgu and elsewhere the constant urbanization was almost unavoidable but as a man of sensibility i regretted that human advance should always be over the corpse of nature from where we sat over our southern wines both lake and town were partially visible the forests in the immediate area having been demolished long ago the town was already blazing with light the lake looked already dark a thing preparing for night and to our left standing out with a clarity which suggested yet more rain to come stretched the rolling jungles of the congo tributaries for at least three hundred miles in that direction man had not invaded there lived the pygmies flourishing without despoiling that area the congo source land would be the next to go jubal indeed was the spearhead of the attack but for my generation at least that vast tract of primitive beauty would stand and i was selfishly glad of it i always gained more pleasure from trees than population increase statistics jubal caught something of the expression on my face the power we are releasing here will last for ever he said its already changingimprovingthe entire economy of the area at last at long last africa is realizing her potentialities his voice held almost a tremor and i thought that this passion for progress was the secret of his strength you cling too much to the past rog he added why all this digging and tunnelling and wrenching up of riverbeds i asked would not atomics haye been a cheaper and easier answer no he said decisively this system puts to use idle water once in operation everything is entirely selfservicing besides uranium is none too plentiful water is venus has no radioactive materials i believe this sounded to me like an invitation to change the sub ject i accepted it theyve found none yet i assented but i can speak with no authority i went purely as a touristand a glorious trip it was it must be wonderful to be so many million miles nearer the sun he said it was the sort of plain remark i had often heard him make on others lips it might have sounded platitudinous in his quiet tones i caught a note of sublimity i shall never get to venus he said theres too much work to be done here you must have seen some marvels there rog yes yet nothing so strange as an elephant and theyll have a breathable atmosphere in a decade i hear so they say they are certainly doing wonders you know jubal i shall have to go back then you see theres a feeling ersomething a sort of expectancy no not quite that its hard to explain i dont converse well i ramble and mumble when i have something real to say i could say it to a woman or i could write it on paper but jubal is a man of action and when i did say it i deliber ately omitted emotional overtones and lost interest in what i said its like courting a woman in armour with the visor closed on venus now you can see it but you cant touch or smell or breathe it always an airtight dome er a space suit between you and actuality but in ten years time youll be able to run your bare fingers through the sand feel the breezes on your cheek well you know what i mean er sort of feel her undressed he was thinking saw it in his eyesrogs going to go all poetic on me he said and you approve of that the changeover of atmospheres yes yet you dont approve of what were doing here which is just the same sort of thing he had a point youre upsetting a delicate balance here i said gingerly a thousand ecological factors are swept by the board just so that you can grind these waters through your turbines and the same things happened at owen falls over on lake victoria but on venus theres no such balance its just a clean page waiting for man to write what he will on it under that co blanket theres been no spark of life the mountains are bare of moss the valleys lie in nocent of grass in the geological strata no fossils sleep no arncebae move in the sea but what youre doing here people he exclaimed ive got people to consider babies need to be born mouths must be fed a man must live your sort of feelings are all very wellthey make good poemsbut i consider the people i love the people for them i work he waved his hands overcome by his own grandiose visions if the passion for progress was his strength the fallacy in herent in the idea was his secret weakness i began to grow warm you get good conditions for these people they procreate forthwith next generation another benefactor will have to step forward and get good conditions for the children thats progress eh i asked maliciously i see you so rarely rog dont lets quarrel he said meekly i just do what i can im only an engineer that was how he always won an altercation before meek ness i have no defence but hostility ran like a sewer below the level of our conversation the sun had finished another day with the sudden dark ness came chill jubal pressed a button and glass slid round the veranda enclosing us like venus i thought but here you could still smell that spicy bosomy scent which is the breath of dear africa herself on venus the smells are imported we poured some more wine and talked of family matters in a short while his wife sloe joined us i began to feel at home the feeling was only partly psychological my glands were now beginning to readjust fully to normal conditions after their long days in space travel jcasta also appeared him i was less pleased to see he was the boss type the strongarm man as jubals under ling he pandered wretchedly to him and bullied everyone else on the project he and there were many others like him unfortunately thought of the massacre as mans greatest achievement this evening in the presence of his superiors after a preliminary burst of showing off he was quiet enough when they pressed me to i talked of venus as i spoke back rushed that humblingbut intoxicatingsense of awe to think i had actually lived to stand in full possession of my many faculties on that startling planet the same feeling had often possessed me on mars and on earth the vision chimed and an amber light biinked drowsily off and on in jubals tank even then no premonition of ca tastrophe since then i can never see that amber heartbeat without anxiety jubal answered it and a mans face swam up in the tank to greet him they talked i could catch no words but the sudden tension was apparent sloe went over and put her arm round jubals shoulder something up jcasta commented yes i said thats chief mshawn on the visionfrom owenstown over on lake victoria then jubal flashed off and came slowly back to where we were sitting that was mshawn he said the level of lake victoria has just dropped three inches he lit a cheroot with clumsy fingers his eyes staring in mystification far beyond the flame dam okay boss jcasta asked perfectly theyre going to phone us if they find any thing has this happened before i asked not quite able to understand their worried looks of course not my halfbrother said scornfully surely you must see the implications of it something highly un precedented has occurred but surely a mere three inches of water at that he laughed briefly even jcasta permitted himself a snort lake victoria is an inland sea jubal said grimly its as big as tasmania three inches all over that area means many thousands of tons of water casta i think well get down to mokulgu it wont do any harm to alert the first aid services just in case theyre needed got your tracer yes boss im coming jubal patted sloes arm nodded to me and left without relaxing his worried look he and jcasta shortly appeared outside they bundled into a float soareddangerously close to a giant walnut tree and vanished into the night nervously sloe put down her cheroot and did not resume it she fingered a dial and the windows opaqued theres an ominous waiting quality out there i dont like she said to explain our sudden privacy should i be feeling alarmed i asked she flashed me a smile quite honestly yes you dont live in our world rog or you would guess at once what was happening at lake victoria theyve just finished raising the level again for a long time theyve been on about more pres sure and the recent heavy rains gave them their chance to build it up it seems to have been the last straw and what does this threeinch drop mean is there a breach in the dam somewhere no theyd have found that im afraid it means the bed of the lake has collapsed somewhere the waters pouring into subterranean reservoirs the extreme seriousness of the matter was now obvious even to me lake victoria is the source of the white nile if it ceased to feed the river millions of people in uganda and the sudan would die of drought and not only people birds beasts fish insects plants we both grew restless we took a turn outside in the cool night air and then decided we too would go down to the town all the way there a picture filled my head the image of that great dark lake emptying like a washbasin did it drain in sinister silence or did it gargle as it went men of action forget to tell you vital details like that that night was an anticlimax apart from the sight of the full moon sailing over mount kangosi we joined jubal and his henchman and hung about uneasily until midnight as if an unknown god had been propitiated by the sacrifice of an hours sleep we then felt easier and retired to bed the news was bad the next morning by the time i was dressed jubal was already back in town sloe and i breakfasted alone together she told me they had been in formed that victoria had now dropped thirteen and a half inches the rate of fall seemed to be increasing i flew into mokulgu and found jubal without difficulty he was just embarking on one of the dam authoritys survey floats with jcasta youd better come too rog he shouted youll probably enjoy the flight more than we shall i did enjoy the flight despite the circumstances a disturb ance on lake tanganyikas eastern fringes had been observed on an earlier survey and we were going to investigate it youre not afraid the bed will collapse here too are you i asked its not that jubal said the two hundred miles between us and victoria is a faulty region geologically speaking ill show you a map of the strata when we get back its more than likely that all that runaway subterranean water may be head ing in our direction thats what im afraid of the possibility has been known for a long while and no precautions taken what could we do but cross our fingers the possibility exists that the moon will spiral to earth but we dont all live in shelters because of it justifying yourself jubal possibly he replied looking away again that stupid an tagonism we flew through a heavy rain shower which dappled the grey surface of the lake then we were over the reported dis turbance a dull brown stain a blot on a bright new garment spread over the water from the steep eastern shore to about half a mile out put us down pilot jubal ordered we sank and kissed the lake several hundred yards away rose the base of mount kangosi i looked with admiration up the slope great slabs of rock stood out from the verdure crouching at the bottom of this colossus was a village part of it forced by the steepness of the incline to stand out on piles into the lake leave everything to me boss jcasta said grabbing a hand asdic from the port locker and climbing out on to the float we followed it seemed likely that the disturbance was due to a slight subsidence in the side of the lake basin such subsidences jubal said were not uncommon but in this case it might provide a link with lake victoria if they could pin point the position of the new fault frogmen would be sent down to investigate were going to have company jubal remarked to me waving a hand over the water a dozen or so dugouts lay between us and the shore each bore two er three shiningskinned fishermen the two canoes nearest us had swung round and were now being paddled towards our float i watched them with more interest than i gave to the asdic sweep men like these sturdy fishermen had existed here for countless generations unchanged before white men had known of them before romes legions had destroyed the vine yards of carthage beforewho knows if not before the heady uprush of civilization elsewheresuch men had fished quietly in this great lake they seemed not to have advanced at all so rapidly does the world move but perhaps when all other races have fallen away burnt out and exhausted these steady villagers will come into a kingdom of their own i would elect to live in that realm a man in the leading canoe stood up raising his hand in greeting i replied glancing over his shoulder at the curtain of green behind him something caught my eye above some yards of bare rock a hundred feet up the slope of the mountain two magnificent mvulesafrican teak treesgrew a chinablue bird dipped suddenly from one of the trees and sped far and fast away over the water fighting to outpace its reflection and the tree itself began to cant slowly from the vertical into a horizontal position jubal had binoculars round his neck my curiosity aroused i reached to borrow them even as i did so i saw a spring of water start from the base of the mvules a rock was dis lodged i saw it hurtle down into the bush below starting in turn a trail of earth and stones which fell down almost on to the thatched roofs of the village the spring began to spurt more freely now it gleamed in the sun it looked beautiful but i was alarmed look i pointed both jubal and the fisherman followed the line of my out stretched arm jcasta continued to bend over his metal box even as i pointed the cliff shuddered the other mvule went down like an envelope being torn the rock split horizon tally and a tongue of water burst from it the split widened the water became a wall pouring out and down the sound of the splitting came clear and hard to our startled ears then came the roar of the water bursting down the hill side it washed everything before it i saw trees bushes and boulders hurried down in it i saw the original fissure lengthen and lengthen like a cruel smile cutting through the ground as fast as fire other cracks started running uphill and across every one of them began to spout water the fishermen stood up shouting as their homes were swept away by the first fury of the flood and then the entire lower mountainside began to slip with a cumulative roar mud water and rock rolled down into the lake where they had been a solid torrent cascaded out one mighty wall of angry water the escaping flow from lake victoria had found its outlet next moment our calm surface was a furious sea jubal slipped and fell on to one knee i grabbed him and almost went overboard myself a series of giant waves plunged out wards from the shore the first one rocked us the second one overturned our flimsy craft completely i came to the surface coughing and snorting jcasta rose at my side we were just in time to see the float slip completely under it sank in no time carrying the pilot with it i had not even seen his face poor fellow jubal came up by the fisherman who had also overturned but dugouts do not sink we owed our lives to those hollowed tree trunks they were righted and jubal and his henchman climbed into one while i climbed into the other the waves were still fierce but had attained a sort of regularity which allowed us to cope with them the breakthrough was now a quarter of a mile long water poured from it with unabated force a mighty waterfall where land had been before we skirted it painfully making a land ing as near to it as we dared the rest of that day under its blinding arch of sky passed in various stages of confusion and fear it was two and a half hours before we were taken off the strip of shore we were not idle in that time although every few minutes jubal paused to curse the fact that he was strand ed and powerless miraculous as it seems there were some survivors from the obliterated village women mostly we helped to get them ashore and built fires for them meanwhile dam authority planes began to circle the area we managed to attract the attention of one which landed by our party jubals manner changed at once now that he had a machine and men who unlike the villagers were in his command he worked with a silent purpose allowing of no question over the vision he ordered the rest of the floats to attend to the villagers needs we sped back to mokulgu on the way jubal spoke to owenstown they took his news almost without comment they reported that victoria was still sinking although the rate had now steadied a twentyfourhour a day airlift was about to go into operation dropping solid blocks of marble on to the lake bed there a fault about three miles square had been located four frog men had been lost drowned its like tossing pennies into the ocean jubal said i was thinking of the frogmen sucked irresistibly down the fault they would be swept through underground waterways battered and pulped to be spat out eventually into our lake vision from mokulgu coming on just before we landed there reported a breach in the lake banks some twenty miles north of the town at a word from jubal we switched plans and veered north at once to see just how extensive the damage was the break was at a tiny cluster of huts dignified by the name of ulatuama growing like a wart on the edge of lake tanganyika several men the crew of a dam authority patrol boat were working furiously at a widening gap the damage had been caused by the very waves which had swamped us and i learnt that a small disused lock had stood here relic of an earlier irrigation scheme so the weakness had been of mans making beyond the lock had been a driedup chan nel some twenty yards wide this was now a swollen plung ing river is this serious i asked jubal isnt there a good way of getting rid of surplus water he gave me a withering look where are we if we lose control he demanded if this thing here runs away with us the combined waters of victoria and tanganyika will flood down into the congo even as he spoke the bank to the south of the escaping waters crumbled several yards were swept away their places instantly taken by the current we flew back to mokulgu jubal visioned the mayor and got permission to broadcast to the city i did not hear him speak reaction had set in and i had to go and sit quietly at home with sloe fussing daintily round me although you know from a child that earth is a planet it is only when you drift towards it from space seeing it hang round and finite ahead that you can realize the fact and so although i had always known man was puny it was the sight of that vast collapsing slab of mountain which had driven the fact into my marrow to guess the sort of sentiments jubal broadcast to the city was easy he would talk of rallying round in this our time of crisis he would speak of the need for all hands uniting against our ancient enemy nature he would come over big on the tanks he would be big his fists clenched his eyes ablaze he was in touch with the people and they would do what he said for jubal carried conviction perhaps i envied my halfbrother labour and supplies began to pour north to mend the damaged bank jubal meanwhile thought up a typically flamboyant scheme tilly one of the lake steamers was pressed into service and loaded full of rock and clay by steam shovel with jubal standing on the bridge it was mance vered into the centre of the danger area and scuttled half in and half out of the rushing water it now former a base from which a new dam could be built to stem the flood watched by a cheering crowd jubal and crew skimmed to safety in a motor boat we shall conquer if we have to dam the water with our bodies he cried a thousand cheering throats told him how much they liked this idea the pitch of crisis which had then been engendered was maintained all through the next two days for most of that time it rained and men fought to erect their barrier on clinging mud jubals popularityand consequently his in fluenceunderwent a rapid diminution the reason for this was twofold he quarrelled with jcasta whose suggestion to throw open the new dam to relieve pressure elsewhere was refused and he ran into stiff opposition from mokulgu town council this august body composed of the avariciously successful and the successfully avaricious was annoyed about tilly tilly belonged to the local government and jubal had in effect stolen it the men from the factories who had downed tools to fight the water were summoned back to work the dam authority must tend its own affairs jubal merely sneered at this dangerous pique and visioned leopoldviue in the briefest possible time be had the army helping him it was at dawn on the morning of the third day that he visioned me to go down and see him i said adieu to sloe and took a float over to ulatuama jubal stood alone by the waters edge the sun was still swathed in mist and he looked cold and pinched behind him dimly outlined figures moved to and fro like allegorical figures on a frieze he surveyed me curiously before speaking the works nearly done rog he said he looked as if he needed sleep but he added energetically pointing across the lake then we tackle the main job of plugging that waterfall i looked across the silent lake the far shore was invisible but out of the layers of mist rose mount kangosi even at this distance in the early morning hush came the faint roar of the new waterfall and there was another sound intermit tent but persistent beyond the mountain they were bombing fault lines that way they hoped to cause a collapse which would plug victorias escape routes so far they had had no success but the bombing went on making abattfefield of what had once been glorious country sorry i havent seen anything of you and sloe jubal said suppose youve been busy sloe called vou on the vision oh that come on into my hut rog we walked over to a temporary structure the grass was overloaded with dew in jubals hut jcasta was dressing smoking a cheroot as he dexterously pulled on a shirt he gave me a surly greeting whose antagonism i sensed was directed through me at jubal as soon as the latter closed the door he said rog prom ise me something tell me what if anything happens to me i want you to marry sloe shes your sort concealing my irritation i said thats hardly a reason able request you and she get on well together dont you certainly but you see my outlook on life is well for one thing i like to stay detached an observer you know observing i just want to sample the landscapes and the food and the women of the solar system i dont want to marry just move on at the right time sloes very nice but my ghastly inability to express the pressure of inner feeling was upon me in women i like flamboyance wit and a high spirit but i tire quickly of them and then have to seek their manifestation elsewhere besides sloe frankly had had her sensibilities blunted from living with jubal he now chose to misunderstand my hesitations are you standing there trying to tell me that youve al ready tired of whatever youve been doing behind my back he demanded youyou he called me a dirty name i forgot to make allowances for the strain he had been undergoing and lost my temper oh calm down i snapped youre overtired and over wrought and probably oversexed too ive not touched your little woman like to drink from pure streams so you can put the entire notion out of your head trouble came to us as suddenly as it had done to the lake although nobody afterwards could have said there had been no warning he rushed at me with his shoulders hunched and fists swing ing it was an embarrassing moment i am against violence and believe in the power of words but i did the only possible thing spring to one side and catch him a heavy blow over the heart poor jubal no doubt in his frustration against the forces of nature he was using me only as a safety valve but with shame i will now confess what savage pleasure that blow gave me i was filled with lust to strike him again i can per ceive dimly how atrocities such as the massacre came about as jubal turned on me i flung myself at him breaking down his defences piling blows into his chest it was i suppose a form of selfexpression jcasta stopped it breaking in between us and thrusting his ugly face into mine his hand like a clamp round my wrist pack it up he said id gladly do the job myself but this is not the time as he spoke the hut trembled we were hard pressed to keep our feet staggering together like drunken men now what jubal said and flung ppen the door i caught a rectangular view of trees and mist men running and the emergency dam sailing away on a smooth black slide of escaping water the banks were collapsing glimpsing the scene jubal instantly attempted to slam the door shut again the wave struck us battering the cabin off its flimsy foundations jubal cried sharply as he was tossed against a wall next moment we were floundering in a hell of flying furniture and water swept along on a giant sluice the cabin turned over and over like a dice that i was preserved was the merest acci dent through a maze of foam i saw a heavy bunk crashing towards me and managed to flounder aside in time it missed me by a fingers width and broke through the boarding wall i was swept helplessly after it when i surfaced the cabin was out of sight and i was be ing borne along at a great rate and the ugly scene in the cabin was something fruitless that happened a million years ago nearly wrenching my arm off in the process i seized a tree which was still standing and clung on once i had re covered my breath i was able to climb out of the water entire ly wedge myself between two branches and regain my breath the scene was one of awesome desolation i had what in less calamitous circumstances might have been called a good view of it all a lake spread all round me its surface moving smartly and with apparent purpose its forward line already far away was marked by a high yellow cascade in its wake stretched a miscellany of objects of which only the trees stood out clearly most of the trees were eucalyptus this area had probably been reclaimed marsh to the north the old shoreline of the lake still stood the ground was higher there and solid rock jutted stolidly into the flood to the south the shoreline was being joyously chewed away mokulgu had about half an hour left before it was swamped and obliterated i wondered how the mokulgu town council were coping with the situation overhead the sun now was shining clear bars of pink wispy cloud flecked the blue sky the pink and the blue were of the exact vulgar tints found in twocolour prints of the early twentieth century adthat is a hundred years before the massacre i was almost happy to see this lack of taste in the sky matching the lack of stability elsewhere i was almost happy but i was weeping they visioned me that one of the floats had picked you upand not jubal is there any hope for him rog or is that a foolish question i cant give you a sensible answer he was a strong swim mer dont forget they may find him yet i spoke to sloe over the heads of a crowd of people mokul gu surely enough had been washed away the survivors homeless and bereaved crowded on to high ground sloe had generously thrown open most of her house as a sort of restcampcumsoupkitchen she superintended everything with a cool authority which suitably concealed her personal feelings for that i was grateful sloes feelings must be no affair of mine she smiled at me before turning to address someone behind her already the light was taking on the intensity of early evening above the babble of voices round me came the deep song of speeding water it would continue for months yet africa was ruptured at her very heart beyond mans mending instead of flowing northward fertilizing its old valley vic toria crashed into our lake adding its burden to the weight of water rolling west while twentyone million people perished of drought in egypt as many perished of flood and typhoid in the congo i seemed to know what was coming as i stood in the crowd ed room knowing jubal dead knowing the nation of africa to be bleeding to death we were dying of our own wounds the ten years to follow would be as terrible as the ten years of the massacre when every member of the white race had been slain now we negroes in our turn stood at the bar of history
